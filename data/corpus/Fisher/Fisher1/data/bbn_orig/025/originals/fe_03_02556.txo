L:  Good morning.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jeff.
R:  Hi.  My name is Marion.
L:  Hi, Marion.
R:  And we're in trouble 'cause I don't watch those shows.
L:  Neither do I.  I don't watch television at all.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, ah -- I don't really watch -- I don't -- I don't -- I know about them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I can talk why I feel people are -- are so thrilled about them, but I don't -- why do you not watch them?
R:  Just seems stupid.  And I don't -- I think it's fake anyway.
L:  Ah, you think it's all rigged?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean the people are -- they're actors -- kind of like a Jerry Springer type thing?
R:  Um, well, from what I had heard -- that these shows started during some writers' strike.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And they were cheaper to produce.  And, I don't know -- I just -- I don't believe the things that are going on anyway.
L:  And they are cheaper to produce because they're not using actors, so you don't have to use actors.  And they're not, um -- they're not written, per se.  So, you're right about that.  I think people -- I think people watch them because it -- it -- they live their life vicariously.  You know what I'm saying?  They wanna be those people, so they -- they kind of, like -- they kind of transfer their, ah -- their interests and that, per se.  They kind of wish that they were like, you know -- Who Wants -- Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, for example.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They kind -- that's kind of like their fantasy.  So, it's an escape for a lot of people.
R:  But what would be the difference than any other show or soap operas, which I do watch?
L:  Um, because these are -- these are not actors.  These are people like, you know -- people that they -- their cowo- -- these could be their coworkers or their family members and such.  There -- there's some sense of -- of connection.
R:  Okay.
L:  But at -- at the same time there's a fantasy as well.  They kind of, like, wish they -- wish they were a participant because it looks like a lot of fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Somebody sitting on the couch, they're kind of in the scene, where a soap opera it -- it kind of takes on a different tangent.  Does that make any sense?
R:  A little bit.
L:  Yeah?  So, what soap operas do you watch?
R:  Well, I tape everything.
L:  Yeah, do you?  I'm a big One Life To Live fan.
R:  Uh-huh.   I like that.
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess we have to stay on the topic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, yeah, I mean, all these reality shows -- I used to watch The -- did you ever watch The Real World, with MTV?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, that was -- that was a cool -- that was -- that's what started it all.  That's where they take, um, like, five, you know, college graduates -- some of them weren't even college -- and take 'em to some remote place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they would, um -- not remote but, like, you know, some town -- and -- and just film them for, like, twelve weeks -- and all the interactions.  And they would have some sort of thing that they had to do, like either be a DJ on a radio station, or, um, something of that nature.
R:  So, do you think they're geared to a certain age group?
L:  What?  These reality shows?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I would think so.  I think they're -- I think -- it depends on the type of show though. Like, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, or The Bachelorette, or -- The Bachelorette, I think really attracts, um, ah, women.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean the Bachelor.  I think that -- that, um -- but, I also heard that men watch that show too.  But -- but, I'm under the impression a lot of women watch The Bachelor just to see --
R:  Nice looking guy?
L:  Yeah, a nice looking guy.  And how many, you know -- and the cat fights, I guess.  And I heard a lot of that is, um -- you know, don't forget they film, like, for a zillion hours, and they only use, like, one percent of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Are you aware of that?
R:  No.  Ah, I -- I'm not up on those shows at all.
L:  Yeah.  So, that -- they do.  They, um -- they'll put the camera on for a long time, and then they'll take the parts that they want the viewers to see.  So, therefore, you're right, it is -- it is rigged in a lot of ways, because you're not seeing the total -- the before and the after, you're just seeing the event.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it -- it gives the impression that something more dramatic happened than really happened.
R:  I -- I know a few ti- -- my son's seven and -- and, ah, you know, "Time to go to bed" -- "I'm watching" -- um, I don't know if it was The Bachelor or The Bachelorette one, but --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- I'm, like, "No -- no".
L:  And also, I think it's kind of dangerous, don't you?  I mean, look at what happened to, ah, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, where -- where she had to, like, get an annulment and everything.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Because I thought --
R:  Wasn't -- wasn't he a fake millionaire?  Was he --
L:  I think he was real, but I think he had a shady past.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think -- I think he abused his first wife or something.  But, um, yeah.  And it -- but a lot of these people want, you know, their fifteen minutes of fame too.
R:  Um, and how do you think they differ than, ah, those court ones?
L:  Oh, the Court TV?
R:  Yes.
L:  I guess those are reality shows too, in a way.
R:  I mean, do you believe them, or -- or ...?
L:  Ah, you think those -- it depends.  I heard, like, Divorce Court -- remember the old TV show Divorce Court?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That was rigged.  Because I had some friends who were actors who were on that show.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So, yeah -- so, I think they were -- they were -- the script -- the, um -- the cases might have been real, but those were actors playing the parts.  So, um, yeah, I -- but, I -- I think it's another type of, ah, reality show.  But, um, I wonder what the -- have you heard any -- of any reality shows that are gonna be, like, down the pipe -- that are coming up?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.  I think, um, they're -- they're constant- -- there -- there's this new one that they're trying to -- they're trying to do -- the Real Beverly Hillbillies, where they're gonna take, um, real hillbillies from the, ah, Appalachians --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and put 'em in Beverly Hills, and h- -- and have the whole -- the whole nine yards with a maid and a mansion and everything.  And put on the camera and see how they, ah -- how they cope.
R:  But, what do you think the purpose of that is?
L:  I felt like they're making fun of these people.
R:  Th- that's what it sounds like to me.
L:  And, um, a lot of people in Appalachians -- or the Appalachians are getting -- are very upset.  But, um, yeah, there's a whole big search for -- I don't know, they may even found them.  But see, the whole thing is -- like, what you said at the beginning of the conversation, these are very inexpensive to produce and they gain very, very high ratings.  'Cause again, I think people are just, like, so curious and, ah -- and such about how it's all gonna play out.  It's kind of -- it is kind of like a soap opera.  I mean, I think it's more similar than -- than dissimilar, these reality shows to a soap opera.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because the -- the same curiosity takes place.
R:  But, ah, in a shorter period of time.
L:  Right -- right.  Much shorter.  And the drama -- but, the same -- similar types of drama, where people cheat and -- and things of that nature.  So, um, yeah, I -- I just think that these reality shows -- I think more people like them than don't like them.  And people -- I think people are constantly trying to come up with new ideas, but to me with the whole phenomenon of Survivor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That started in -- that started in England, didn't it?
R:  I -- I -- that's another one I didn't watch.
L:  Yeah.
R:   I mean, watching, um, who gets to eat bugs on an island just doesn't do anything for me.
L:  Right.  And then -- but then they have it -- then they had Temptation Island.  Did you ever hear --
R:  No.
L:  -- about that?
R:  No.
L:  Well, that was an interesting concept, where they would take six couples --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um, they -- they weren't married, but they were close to marriage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they had to go on a different side of the island and, um -- so, they were separated.  And then, women were with the men, and men were with the women -- strangers -- and see if they -- if they would be hooking up or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that was -- that was -- that was very controversial.  But it's interesting.  Most people are not -- I mean, some people are -- are critical of it, but most people see it just part of the -- as a new fad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, every time there -- there's something different.  Remember, like, in the eighties, there was, like, Dynasty and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, ah, those -- and Dallas, and those type of shows?
R:  The night time soap operas?
L:  Right, night time soap operas.  So now, the new phenomenon is these reality shows.
R:  Mm.
L:  But it all started with, um -- um -- um -- you brought up a good point -- the whole thing with the wr- writers' strike.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That is true.  I've heard that.  That is true that.  And they are very cheap to produce.  And they make a lot -- a lot of money because people are watching 'em.  And -- and, ah it'd be interesting to see what comes next.  I mean, I mentioned the Beverly Hillbillies, but I think there's other shows that people are thinking of.  My brother pitched a show of, um, having people in a halfway house --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and have the cameras on them.  And I -- I don't know if it went anywhere.  I don't think it did.  But, um, you know, people are -- in the industry are constantly trying to come up with a new idea, a new setting particularly.
R:  Well, now wouldn't this be -- now I can't think of the name of the movie, and I saw it -- the one with Jim Carrey in.  And he --
L:  Yeah, The Truman Show.
R:  Yes -- all on that idea?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  It's all pretty similar.  For the -- in The Truman Show, he didn't know he was being filmed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everybody else did.  In this, everybody knows they're being filmed.  But, um, it is -- it is an interesting phenomenon.  And it -- it is -- it is curious to know why people are not more upset.  And, ah -- and they're -- they're extremely popular.
R:  I know.  To see you -- you're exposed in so many different ways. I --
L:  Right.  But every so often it gets tainted.  I don't know if you heard about Big Brother.  You know, they -- they try to do their best job screening these -- these actors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, these people.  Then, once again -- these houses, they -- some things come out.  Like, this one guy, ah, had a -- had a record where he assaulted somebody with a knife.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I think he even did it on the show.  He, like, walk- --
