R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hi, this is Alyssa.
R:  Hi, I'm Carrie.
L:  Hi. Nice to meet you.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, thanks.
L:  Good.
R:  Um, I do watch [LAUGH] reality TV.  Um, do you?
L:  Um, yeah.  I -- well, not a lot, because I don't watch a lot of TV in general.  But I used to watch, um, The Real World and Road Rules.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and I've -- I've seen a couple of episodes of The Bachelor and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- American Idol and those shows.  [SIGH] 
R:  Right.  Um, yeah, I have watched The, um, Real World also in the past.  Um, but [NOISE] now I'm at home with a baby, so I watch a lot more TV than I ever --
L:  [SIGH]
R: -- have before.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, you probably hear her in the background.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  But, um, so I h- -- I have watched things like The Bachelor and I actually even watched that show, um, Mr. Personality.
L:  Oh, yeah, I actually saw, um, a little bit of that for the first time last week.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know what -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what night it's on, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --what -- I don't know, a -- a few days ago I saw it for the first time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Right.  Yeah, I -- I mean i- it's not like I'm hooked on them or anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they're -- you know, if you're just relaxing or whatever, it's just --
L:  Yeah, I can --
R:  -- kind of fun TV to watch. [NOISE]
L:  I can definitely see them being entertaining.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Which is your favorite one?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.  I don't know if I really have a favorite one, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you?
L:  Um.  I used to really like The Real World.  That was the one show that, you know, I would [MN] sit down to watch on a regular basis but now -- I liked it when it was, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  a little more unique, you know, when it was kind of like -- 'cause that's like the first reality show that was ever really on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now it's -- I feel like there's so many of them.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  That's it getting kind of ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I'm just like, only if I'm really bored [LAUGH] I watch.  But they definitely are interesting.  I mean a couple of times I've seen them I've, you know, um, definitely --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like -- if I have the time, you know, they're -- they're not, uh, boring to watch.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean I -- I don't know -- I don't think people watch them because it's really like reality.  Because I don't really think it is.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  You know?
L:  I -- I think it's a lot of people who just kind of want like, exposure.  You know, maybe are looking to become like, I don't know, famous or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just want the exposure.
R:  Yeah, 'cause like Married by America.  I mean most people wouldn't [NOISE] just marry any -- someone that [NOISE] people voted for them to marry.  [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  And the most of, uh, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least from what I've heard, it seems like most of the people, like Married by America, and the people who are like g- ended up getting married on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette like, I don't think any of them stayed together already.
R:  No, right.  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I wouldn't do it, but it's fun to watch other [LAUGH] people doing it.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Maybe that's the -- I liked, um, Temptation Island.
L:  Oh, I never saw that one.  I forgot about that one.  That, yeah -- that was -- they -- I guess that's not on anymore?
R:  Yeah, I haven't seen that.  I haven't yet seen any new episodes of that so I -- I don't know if they're planning on coming back with it.
L:  Hm.  
R:  Another one I -- well, ones I used to like, which I don't know if they were -- I guess they would be considered reality TV, like, the dating shows I used to watch sometimes.  Like, late at night, like, um, [LIPSMACK] there was that one on the cruise ship.
L:  Oh --
R:  Um.
L:  Shipmates, right?
R:  Shipmates, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Shipmates and Blind Date.  Those were funny to watch.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I felt like those [LAUGH] -- those were good to watch because they showed you exactly what not to do on a date.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, have you ever seen Change of Heart?
L:  Yeah, Change of Heart, too, I used to watch sometimes.
R:  Well, do you know that that's fake?  My brother's friend was, um, [LIPSMACK] they came up to him on the street in Queens, New York.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they asked him if he would like to be on Change of Heart.  And he didn't even have a girlfriend, and they had a girlfriend there for him, like, it was staged.
L:  Oh my God.  
R:  And he --
L:  So it's totally -- it's totally, like -- it -- it's not real then?
R:  No.  It was like -- and so he was deciding who to stay with between two people that he didn't know.  It wasn't like it was the girlfriend [MN] for a long time and then some other person off the street.  It was, like, two people that he didn't know, and one of them he was pretending was his girlfriend for a long time. [NOISE]
L:  Huh, that's interesting.
R:  And I -- I was like upset to hear that.  'Cause I didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought it was, [LAUGH] at least, that part of it was real, that the contestants were really dating.
L:  Yeah.  That's kind of ridiculous. I wonder --
R:  So, I wonder how many --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of them are really like that?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know, um, [LIPSMACK] my room mate, like, uh, this guy that she's friends with, um, one of his, like, friends from high school's, um, brother, I think, was one of the contestants on The Bachelorette.  And I know that, um, [LIPSMACK] he wasn't allowed to, like -- no one was allowed to talk about it.  I mean, they -- they weren't allowed to say anything about it.  So -- and I don't know how he originally got on the show.  I mean, they probably have like a casting or something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but for that, I mean, it just seemed, like, since they had to keep it so quiet about it that it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- was actually -- you know, but that it --
R:  Yeah, you're wondering why they had to keep quiet.
L:  Yeah, that's true too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well -- it's gotten --
R:  I mean, I -- it's like that -- that one with, um, [LIPSMACK] Darva Conga.  Remember that?
L:  [MN]  Uh, was -- was she the one -- was she the one who won under the --
R:  She was the nurse that got married.
L:  Okay, to the bachelor or was she the bachelorette?
R:  No, it was -- it was that [MN] [LIPSMACK] -- I can't remember the name of the show.
L:  Oh, like [MN] -- like --
R:  Rick Rockwell.
L:  Like, what, Marry a Millionaire or something like that?
R:  Yeah, that one.  That one.
L:  Yeah, that was, like, one of the very first versions.
R:  And he had this really bad past and stuff that she never knew about until she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was already married to him.  I don't know. [NOISE]
L:  Wait, and what?  She wa- -- someone was ma- -- what did you say?
R:  That -- he had like, a bad past, like he was stalking his ex-girlfriend, or something like that and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she didn't know about it until she was already married to him.
L:  And then they ended up getting divorced too, right?
R:  Yeah, she didn't even wanna be near him.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I don't know what these people --
L:  It's so ridiculous.  [LAUGH]  I guess the one good thing now that comes out of it is getting famous, if they do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  Although, I don't know how many of them become that famous but ...
R:  No.  
L:  I don't know.  They're just all starting to seem the same now.
R:  Yeah, it's not as good.  Like you were saying before, when it's a n- -- something's new.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then you really wanna see it, but now it's kind of, like, every -- th- -- every show that you turn on is a reality show so ...
L:  Yeah.  And like The Real Word.  Like, I haven't watched it lately, I saw a couple of episodes last season, which I think was when they were in Vegas.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, it just didn't really interest me that much anymore, because it felt like the people on the show, like are, you know, kind of, like, try to --
R:  Act?
L:  -- I don't know.  Like act, like, act and also act, like, maybe they try to [inaudible], you know, what the original shows were like.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  There's just -- like, there's no more originality left --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in it, you know.  Because it's like, I don't want more -- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just like the same stuff happens all the time.  Like, the people in the house hook up and, like, you know, like -- or, like, there's always someone with an attitude problem --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there's someone that has to be, like, the -- the troublemaker.  Like, it's just like -- I don't know, it just gots to be the same stuff.
R:  Well, do you ever watch when there's a like, a reunion of those shows?
L:  When, there's a what?  Oh, a reunion.
R:  They have, like, the reunion, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it always seems like there was so much cut out that happened that would've made for more interesting TV, but I guess they didn't want to show it for some reason.
L:  Yeah, that's weird.  'Cause, I mean, I know that they do cut out a lot but I thought that they -- they cut things out just to make, you know, things more interesting.  I thought they cut out the boring parts.  I think they also -- they -- they cut things and they put things together to, like, skew things, you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- to create what might seem, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just something, like, juicy.
R:  And it's not really.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And actually I saw one of those.  Um, I was visiting a friend at, um, [LIPSMACK] who went to Syracuse a few years ago, and they had the -- the people from one of the casts, um, I don't remember which cast it was, but it was one of the very first ones --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and they were, you know, just talking about it and stuff, and they said that it was totally like, you know, skewed, like I said.  Like, they're -- they said there were so many things that happened that, like --
R:  So they come off looking terrible. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like -- it's like the people on the sh- -- it's like, you know, the producer's, like -- not that they instigate but it's like they -- i- it's like what, you know, reporters do when, like, they interview someone, you know, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they take things, like, out of context kind of.  And --
R:  Well no one wants to sit and watch, like, these five people that get along with each other all the time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  That could --
R:  And nothing happens, you know.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, that's what they have to do, I guess, to have an audience and get good ratings.  That's the whole -- that's the game [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I think there's a new one on.  Something about, I think it's called High School Reunion, or something like that.
L:  [SIGH] I heard about that one too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Did you s- ?
R:  I don't know about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you see, uh --
R:  I didn't see it.
L:  Is it on yet or ...?
R:  [NOISE] I'm not even sure.  I just remember hearing about that. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I think that's a pretty interesting concept.  I mean, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, to see people go back -- you know, like, to see like what they've become and stuff.
R:  [NOISE]  I mean, I think it would be good to see like, [LIPSMACK] someone who was like made [LAUGH] fun of or something in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, comes back and they're, like, something really good and -- that kind [LAUGH] that whole kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- story line.
L:  Which is probably like what they -- I mean, there's probably, like, one of those people and then there's probably, like, someone that was like, you know, a jock, like a really popular jock or something, who's like a loser now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or [inaudible] --
R:  Or like, they wanted to date when they were in high school but now -- but they never did and now they're finally getting together or something.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But they even have, like, they -- they've had some similar stuff like that on talk shows.  You know, like, I've definitely seen stuff like that on -- when, you know, people come on, you know, like Ricki Lake or whatever, any show like that and -- and, uh, they're -- you know, like, they went to high school together and one's one that got made fun of or ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  I always like to see the [MN] the reactions of the people who used to like, be the bullies, or whatever.
L:  Yeah, it
