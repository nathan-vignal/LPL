L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, my name's [LAUGH] David Roth[?].  I'm in New York.  And I didn't think I was gonna have to do this tonight, but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hope you're well.  I'm twenty five, and that's about that.  Hello?
L:  Hello. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  What -- exactly what is this? [NOISE] 
R:  Um, this is something to do with -- ah, I just signed up for it today.  How did you get with this?
L:  [NOISE] I did -- I didn't sign up for anything. [NOISE]  I don't even know what this is. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, apparently you're gonna paid ten dollars for it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm going to.  I hope.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's this thing.  I don't -- I got it today.  I was at work and I was looking for, like, extra little ways to make money.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And this is something -- some school -- I wanna say it's Stanford, but I don't if it is --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:   -- is, ah, basically sponsoring this, and they're recording what we're saying right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then they're gonna send me a ten dollar cheque.
L:  Oh, is that it?
R:  And hopefully you too.  I mean, like, that would kind of suck f- for you.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know what?  It's funny.  I thought this was like a telemarketer, and I was, like, "Hold on.  I thought they had to stop, like, after nine o'clock or something".
R:  I know.   It was the same thing for me, 'cause I heard -- any time I hear a recorded voice, my first impulse is automatically just to get rid of it and go --
L:  That's me -- 
R:  -- back to --
L:  -- too.
R:  -- doing whatever I was doing.
L:  Normally I would've just hung up.  I was, like, "Hold on!  Wait a second".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's ten fif- -- like, ten o'clock.  I --
R:  Did you --
L:  -- was, like, "Uh-uh.  I'm --"
R:  Did you --
L:  -- gonna take --
R:  -- sign up for --
L:  -- their name --
R:  -- this?
L:  "-- down". 
R:  I hate to think that, like, I'm getting paid and you're just sort of having to have a conversation you didn't plan on having.
L:  I mean this is crazy. [NOISE]  Like, I don't even know what this.  And it's funny because I'm actually talking to someone.  I thought it was gonna be, like, another recording or something like that.  But, this is, like, the coolest.  Like, I don't even know what this is.
R:  [LAUGH] So, what's -- what's your name?  What's going on?
L:  I'm Tamila[?].  I'm in Atlanta.
R:  I'm David, and I'm in -- I'm in New York.  This is just some weird stuff.
L:  Isn't it?  
R:  So, what --
L:  Gosh, technology is crazy, isn't it?
R:  And of all the things to be using it for, to have us talk about Survivor for ten minutes.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't --
R:  And then --
L:  -- even watch --
R:  -- we get --
L:  -- Survivor.
R:  -- paid.
L:  What is it?
R:  I don't watch -- I can't watch any of that stuff.
L:  Wow.
R:  I've had -- well, this is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unique.  I really hope that you're also gonna get something back from this, 'cause this just doesn't seem -- doesn't seem fair otherwise.
L:  You know what's funny?  I don't even care 'cause I wasn't expecting anything.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  All right.
L:  It was just, like, [LAUGH] -- this is just -- 'cause you know I'll be talking about it tomorrow -- like, "Dude, a recording -- then this guy's on the phone and we're just supposed --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- to talk about Survivor".  This is crazy.  I mean, I'm like [NOISE] [several inaudible words] about it or something.
R:  I like the idea of somebody trying to pull some scientific research out of this.
L:  Yeah.  Like, I know we're supposed to be talking about something, but I mean, whatever. [LAUGH] People are gonna be hooking up and everything. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  That's what you gotta hate. [LAUGH] 
R:  God, this is weird.
L:  [LAUGH] They'll be, like, "Oh, I like the way you sound".  And then, you know, that's gonna be the one thing -- one thing -- if anything, this is gonna become, like, the hook up line.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's why -- especially it's, like -- you know, whatever -- like, somebody in Atlanta and somebody in New York, but if there's -- if there's a million people doing this right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, there are phone numbers being exchanged left and right, right now.
L:  Thank you.  Definitely is.
R:  But, it is --
L:  It's a big hook up line --
R:  You know --
L:  -- that's what it is.
R:  So, um -- ah, so, what are you wearing?
L:  [LAUGH] No, right? [LAUGH] 
R:  Wh- what -- what are you up to?  What are you doing in Atlanta right now? 
L:  Now, I was just sitting up here watching TV.  Actually, I was watching the movie Jack.  I've never seen it before.  I didn't know it was a sad movie.
R:  Wait.  Which movie?
L:  Jack.  I think that's the name of it.  Jack.  With, um, [MN] the funny guy in it, ah --
R:  Oh.  Jack.  The, ah -- with -- with Robin Williams in it?
L:  Yeah, Robin Williams.  Yeah.
R:  Where he's playing the kid?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never even saw that.  
L:  It's --
R:  I never did see it -- 'cause it's directed by the guy that did, like, The Godfather.  Like I was, like, "What is he --"
L:  Really?
R:  "-- doing making a movie where Robin Williams is playing a seven year old?"
L:  I know.  Right.  It's -- that's crazy.  I didn't know that.  But, it's -- it's sad.  Like, it's not even -- it's, like, really sad.
R:  Well, he's sick in it, is he -- or something.  Like, he's --
L:  Yeah.  He's --
R:  -- got some disease that makes him --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- be older.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Man, that's -- ah, so, did you rent it, or is it just on TV? 
L:  It was on TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't [several inaudible words] I came in at, like, nine fifteen or so.  But, it was still set.  And I came in probably, like, a quarter to eight -- maybe ten minutes later -- something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it was sad.  I was, like, "This is so sad".
R:  Well, this is -- maybe -- maybe you know what you need to -- to pick you up after watching a sad movie, is an opportunity to -- to hook up with --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- reality television.
L:  Like, I'm off the tape[?] now, so I have to call a -- a roommate from college.  I was, like, "Why didn't you tell me that movie was sad?"  But now, you know, I got something else to talk about.  Like, this is really -- this is different.
R:  You got nothing --
L:  We're supposed to be talking about Survivor, right?
R:  Well, I mean that or -- or reality television in general.  I just -- I didn't know that -- that -- I didn't know what this thing was gonna be about.  I didn't --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- think I was gonna be talking about reality television, 'cause I -- it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sponsored by a school.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I thought it would be, like, you know, whatever.  They'd ask us a question about, like --
L:  Yeah.  This is --
R:  -- you know, genetically modified food or something.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It'd be like [LAUGH] -- be, like --
L:  They say --
R:  --quizzed by --
L:  -- it's like a --
R:  -- some professor somewhere.  I didn't think it was gonna be, like --
L:  Yeah.  This is --
R:  -- do you watch, like, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, and why?
L:  You know what?  You would think that they would have, like, some type of mediator or something on the phone.  But, I bet you they're saying about reality --
R:  Like having --
L:  -- television.
R:  Instead of having a robot?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Which is what we talked to.
L:  But, it would tell, like, they're -- they're actually researching, like, what'll happen if two strangers -- [LAUGH] you know what I'm saying [LAUGH] --
R:  It probably is. 
L:  -- connected on the phone.  You know, something silly like that.
R:  I remember I did one of these things -- ah, 'cause this is just, like, you know, whatever.  You can do stuff, like, little studies at school, or whatever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I was in school I used to be able to do 'em all the time.  And it's nice way to get, like, an extra couple of dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I did one at NYU and it was, like, they gave you this -- it's, like -- you know, they give you five dollars for this questionnaire.  And, like, this is kind of, like, weird, random questions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, like, "What do your parents do?"  And then they gave, like, a couple of hypothetical situations.  And I was, like, "I don't really see what this is about".  And then at the end of it they basically were, like, "Well, would you like the money now?  Or, would you like to enter a lottery --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- to see if you could win, like, a hundred dollars?" or whatever.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  And I think the whole test was basically an excuse to do that.
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  Like, there's -- like, the smoke screen of it was the actual stuff I had to fill in, and it was basically, like, testing people's optimism or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I don't know what this one is actually supposed to be.  I think it probably is, like --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Whatever.
L:  Definitely is.
R:  What happens when a guy in New York calls a girl in Atlanta --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that he doesn't know.
L:  You know, that's what it has to be, 'cause I mean, reality TV?  [MN] Whatever.  That's what it's all -- that's what this study is really about.
R:  Yep.
L:  I'm convinced.
R:  Do you actually watch any of it?  Just out of curiosity.  I feel like we oughta --
L:  Um --
R:  -- give 'em something -- something to work with.
L:  You know what I watch?  I watch, um, tsk tsk -- I watch reali- -- no.  The only thing I watch is, like, um, American Idol.  I don't know if you consider that a --
R:  I haven't seen that.  It's -- it's reality enough.
L:  Yeah.  Americ- -- you don't look at American Idol?
R:  I've seen it, bits and pieces.  But, I don't really -- I mean this -- whole thing is that I work a lot of times at night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, because I -- I have, like, a second job, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a lot of times I have to, like come home and I'll -- I'll watch, like, basketball or baseball while I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eating dinner.  But, for the most part, I don't -- I don't think I even have any shows that I watch too regularly.
L:  Well, who are you going for in the play offs?
R:  Oh, right.  Well, I'm a -- I'm -- grew up in New Jersey, so I'm a Nets fan.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't quite chosen a team yet, so I'll see. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Last year I was the Six- -- I was -- you know, I was going for the Sixers.  It wasn't last year --
R:  Oh they're --
L: -- or the --
R:  They're --
L:  -- year before I was with --
R:  -- amazing to --
L:  -- the Sixers?
R:  -- watch.  I feel like they'll probably beat the Nets if they play 'em.  Like, I don't think there's anybody on the Nets that wants it as badly as Iverson does.  Like, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- guy just -- unbelievable to watch.  Like, he's smaller than I am.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Like, I'm a little -- little runty freelance --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- writer in New York.  And, like, the guy's, like, five ten -- just taking people apart all over the place.
L:  Yeah.  He is off the ch- -- well, you know, like, small guys have that complex or whatever.  You know?  It's like --
R:  Yeah, I think he's definitely like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that guy -- like, I'm sure -- like, I don't know how many basketball teams cut him before they realised how amazing he was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now he's just, like, getting revenge on all the people that picked him last --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when he was, like, ten.  But, he's -- God, he's fun to watch.  I think that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's probably -- the Nets are eventually gonna wind up playing 'em.  And it'll be fun to watch him, 'cause it's always fun to watch him.  But, I'll --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hate to watch him beat my team.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  That might not be too great, but, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.  He's [MN] -- but, you know who I'd -- the only thing that -- I just don't want the Lakers to win.
R:  Oh, I hate 'em.
L:  Yeah.  That's the only thing.  I don't really care who wins --
R:  Really --
L:  -- as long --
R:  -- hate 'em.
L:  -- as the Lakers don't win.
R:  I went to school in Los Angeles, or around Los Angeles.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And I got so, so dis- -- I mean, I didn't really care when I was out here 'cause, like, I mean, I grew up a Nets fan.  The Nets were always terrible.  So, like, the Lakers had -- you know, they weren't even on my radar. Like, once a year they would, like, beat the Nets really bad.  And I'd be --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- like, "Well -- well.  It happens".  And then, when I was out there and, like, you had to deal with, like, Laker fans all the time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, like, everybody going on about how great they are.  And, like, Koby's all over the place, and he's being photographed all the time.  It just, like, I couldn't take it.  I didn't want to hear anything else about them.
L:  Right.
R:  And I was the more -- like, God if they win again it would be very, very sad.  I mean, my roommate's from Minnesota and he's a big Timberwolves fan.  So, he's pulling for -- ah, for them to win the game tonight.
L:  Right.
R:  I was actually going to go out and meet some friend and watch it, but I guess I won't do that until the robot cuts us off after ten minutes [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  Right. [LAUGH]  Oh wait.  It this, like -- how long is this supposed to be?  Like, ten minutes or so?
R:  It's something like that.  I think we're probably most of the way there by this point.
L:  Yeah.  You know, it doesn't seem it.  It's -- it's just funny.  This whole thing is crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, speaking of the Lakers, I was just like that.  Like, people feel like that with the Falcons.  Like, oh -- you know, I'm for the Falcons all the way.
R:  I've always --
L:  And, you know --
R:  -- liked them.  I used to be a huge Andre Risen fan when I was a kid.  I thought he was the coolest when I was, like, twelve.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause he was -- that was right when, like, Left Eye burned down his house and everything.
L:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah.
R:  And my -- I was, like, "This --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- guy's amazing".  Like, he's got the most interesting wife --
L:  You know, "You're a player, Dude".
R:  But, it's like you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah -- he, um -- he was -- that was my favorite Falcon team, when it was, like, him.  And, like, Jerry Glanville was coaching.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, I don't know.  But -- yeah, I don't think people resent the Falcons too much.  I mean, 'cause it's like -- I -- like, Vic is kind of like Iverson in the fact that, like, people might dislike some of the ways he plays the game.  But, like, God he's fun to watch.
L:  Right.  Well, you know what?  I think it's because it's new.  Like, you know, Vic's only been in -- what?  Last year was really his first year.  I think the first year he was, like --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- red shirt[?] --
R:  The first year he --
L:  -- or something.
R:  -- was playing a lot.
L:  Yeah.  So I mean, it's just 'cause it's new.  Like, in a couple of years, if it's still going the way it is, people, like "Man, screw the Falcons".  You know what I'm saying?  Whatever.
R:  [MN]
L:  Just like -- you know, just like -- ah, like the Braves.  Like, I know they might -- they're not having, like, that good of a season this year.  But, you know, when they were bad, they were bad.
R:  I remember that.
L:  And then they got good.  You'll hear, "Go, yeah.  Braves this, Braves that".
R:  I remember.
L:  I mean, they must blitz like the world series, like, umpteen billion times.
R:  Yeah, I know.  But, people --
L:  And they've only won --
R:  -- get used to it.
L:  -- like, none. [LAUGH]  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  I remember when I was a kid -- I remember when they were really bad 'cause I used to -- I grew up in Jersey, but I used to go to Hilton Head in South Carolina --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with my parents for vacation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we used to get -- the only baseball games we'd get would be the Bra- --
