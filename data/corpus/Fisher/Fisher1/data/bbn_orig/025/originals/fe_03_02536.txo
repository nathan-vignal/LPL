L:  Hello.
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi.  I'm Joya.
R:  Are ya --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're Joya?
L:  Yes.
R:  Is that G.O.Y.A.?
L:  J.O.Y.A.
R:  J.O. -- ah, say that again.
L:  J.O.Y.A.
R:  J.O.Y.A.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  My name is Harold.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, we're supposed to talk about, ah, again, some type of a TV program.
L:  Reality TV.
R:  Now, what is -- what is the definition of, ah, reality TV?
L:  Those are those shows that are based on real life people, who are not actors or anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like --
R:  I --
L:  -- that are -- oh, like American Idol, and all those shows.  You watch any of those?
R:  Well, um, just parts of 'em, spasmodically when they -- when I have the free time.  But, I don't -- I don't spend a lot of time watching 'em.  But, ah, if I'm -- happen to be -- come across 'em I'll probably watch 'em for a few minutes.
L:  Yeah. Oh, when they first started out, the fad was -- it was nice.  It was good to see people doing natural things on TV.  But, after a while it -- it's really sickening now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Getting way off from, ah -- from being a, ah -- a, ah, educational type of thing, huh?
L:  Exactly.  And it's not creative at all.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I see.  Where you, ah, located, Joya?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  New York City?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh boy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- N- New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been there a few times. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, ah, [MN] we're supposed to talk about this one subject here for -- for ten minutes?
L:  Yeah.  The reality TV.
R:  Well, in the case that I'm not fa- -- too familiar with it, ah, how I'm g- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, it'd be difficult for me to say too much.
L:  Yeah.  Um, let me think.  Well, I think a lot -- a lot of it is, um -- I don't think it would've been acceptable years ago, like the Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.  It's like you +herd all these women onto the show and they all compete [MN] for each o- -- compete against each other to marry someone who's allegedly a millionaire.
R:  So, actually this, ah -- going back a -- oh probably quite a few years there was a program called The Millionaire, but that wouldn't be what we're talking about, is it?
L:  No -- no -- no.
R:  No?
L:  This is where they pick a whole bunch of women from all over the wor- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- over the country.
R:  Yeah.  How many, ah -- I mean, how long have these so called reality type of p- programs been going?
L:  Um, the first one I can remember was back when I was in high school, like, maybe eight years ago.
R:  Oh, not too long ago, huh?
L:  No.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, there was a -- a -- the first reality show I remember, besides, like, general game shows, was on MTV and was called The Real World.  And they took these seven people who didn't know each other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they, um, made them live together for, I think six -- six months, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in apartment in New York, and they all had to just get along.  Like, they didn't know anybody.  They didn't -- they weren't -- their -- they didn't -- all their personalities were different.  And, um, they had to live together and I think they also had to get jobs.  I think they were given jobs by MTV.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, would, ah, the program called Fear Factor -- would that be t- -- is that type of a program?
L:  Yeah.  That -- I think that's -- I think that's more re- -- I think that that would be considered reality show also.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Although, to me, it's more of a game show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I think that's considered reality show too.   
R:  But, the general public seems to go for these in a big way, I guess, don't they?
L:  Exactly.  You would think that they'd get tired of the same format over and over and over again.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But no, people are still doing it. 
R:  So, you don't think these programs are staged?  They are more or less, ah, spontaneous, ah --
L:  Oh, no.  I'm convinced they're staged.
R:  You are?
L:  Even The Real World.  Like, [MN] now they're hav- -- now they've been doing it, I think, for, like, eleven of twelve years now.  And the first one, it seemed very real.  It was, like, brand new and it didn't seem like they were manipulated to act certain ways.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And the people were all different and -- but, if you watch it now, after all these years have progressed -- now it seems more -- where the producers want to show all the bad stuff that happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [LIPSMACK] it's funny, because all the cast now -- all the people that are chosen to live together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all look like models.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  It -- it's ridiculous.  They all have perfect bodies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what society considers perfect bodies.  There's not one person who's overweight.  There's not one person who's ugly.
R:  So, they're kind of getting out of the realm of reality in that sense, aren't they?
L:  Exactly -- exactly.  Like, they might as well just give them a script.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  It's more like, ah -- like six months of improvisation. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, you say they've been going for about eight years.  Have their ratings being going higher and higher over that eight year period?
L:  I think so.
R:  Now --
L:  I think so.  I think it's -- well, it's a different generation now that are watching it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I still watch it every now and then, but I think that now's younger generation -- I think they just enjoy seeing good looking men and women scantily dressed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on TV.
R:  So, do you think the ratings will continue to climb?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I'm -- I -- I would hope that society would get sick of it and start showing less interest so we can start getting more imaginative shows back on TV.
R:  Yeah.  I -- well, I agree on that point.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, it doesn't look like it might happen right away, I guess, huh?
L:  No, I don't think so 'cause every time you look at it there's a new one. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they seem to be getting, ah, an increase in th- those types of programs, huh?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Now, they have the show, um, called Mr Personality, where they have all these men who have to wear masks all the time.
R:  Oh yeah, that's right.
L:  And there's one woman, and she has to pick the man that she wants to be with, based on his personality.
R:  Is that a fact?
L:  Yeah.  But then, also on another night, they have show wh- -- called, um, Extreme Makeover, where they pick two people and they give them this big huge makeover, where they get -- like, they can get a nose job, and boob job, and liposuction, and all this plastic surgery to look like the person that they really want to look like.  So, it's like, you know, on one hand they have this show where you're supposed to be judging people on personality, and then they have a -- another show, which is totally on the opposite spectrum, where they're changing their image using plastic surgery to look what society thinks is beautiful.
R:  But, yeah, there again, it's -- I don't know.  It's getting -- it's not in the realm of reality, 'cause how many people can afford those kind of treatments, huh?
L:  Exactly -- exactly.  Yeah.  All those humans that want --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, hm.  But, the thing is about programs like, ah, Candid Camera and, you know, things like that, ah, people don't seem go for 'em much now, do they?
L:  Yeah, they -- they rarely come on.  I think Candid Camera might come on one of the cable channels.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, th- -- you know, I find those interesting. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I usually watch them if they come on and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm watching.
L:  I guess that would be considered kind of a reality show because it's --
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  -- dealing with the --
R:  -- I mean, it --
L:  -- real people.
R:  -- it -- it -- it is catching people in their, ah, natural, ah, [LIPSMACK] ah, frame of mind, I guess, huh?
L:  Well, they actually -- actually they now have a -- a modern day version of that called Punked, and it's with Ashton Kutcher.  He's from the, um -- that show -- that TV show called The Seventies Show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's on MTV.  And he actually does pranks on celebrities.  And it's a half hour show that comes on.
R:  Oh, is that --
L:  And it's -- it's -- he wants to show that, you know, um, just regular people aren't the only ones fall for these things, and that celebrities are human too.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And, like, they had, um, one guy -- I forgot who is -- he's an actor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they set him up to go to the rest- -- to this restaurant with his friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they had another group of people come in [LIPSMACK] and act like they were buying him drinks --
R:  Sure.
L:   -- because they were a fan -- fans of his.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, they kept ordering all this stuff and all this stuff, and then they leave.  And the waiter comes over to the celebrity and gives him this eight thousand dollar bill.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he's, like, "This is not mine".  And then -- so, the waiter starts getting upset and the manager comes out.  And then, ah, the guy -- the actor gets really upset, and he's getting ready to storm out of the restaurant.  And they come -- they tell him it was a practical joke.  And it was really funny.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, yeah.  I guess that's the new generation of Bloopers [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- And Practical Jokes.
R:  So, actually the -- the survey that's taken by the college is trying to evaluate, ah, what people are watching.  Is that what the, ah, college is trying to evaluate? 
L:  These calls now?
R:  Well, no -- well, you know, they want us to talk for ten minutes on -- about these reality programs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are they more or less taking a survey?
L:  I'm not sure.  That's a good question.  I wonder what their motives really are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's, ah, supposed to be a speech pathology to see how people converse with each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:   But, I wonder if is just about -- I guess it's -- if we happen to get another scheduled call with other people we can see what questions they ask and see if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's leaning towards TV.
R:  Is this your -- your first call?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yep.
R:  Now, there was something said at the beginning, after the ten minutes up, to do something.  What was that about?
L:  I think they're gonna come back on and give us directions on -- I think they're gonna, ah, ask questions about our opinions on, I guess, how the call went, maybe.
R:  Oh, I see -- I see.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure.
R:  Well, we got how many more minutes to go here?
L:  I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, according to my clock we've been talking about thirteen or fourteen -- about, ah, thirteen minutes, so I guess we better talk for two more minutes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gosh.
R:  Well, ah --
