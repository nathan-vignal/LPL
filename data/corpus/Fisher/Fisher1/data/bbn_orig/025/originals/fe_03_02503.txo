L:  Erin.
R:  Uh, this is Susan.  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Where do you -- where do you live?
L:  Ah, Toronto.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm [NOISE] Sarasota, Florida.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]  Ah, do they [MN] -- do they have the reality shows up there?
L:  Of course.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I wasn't sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so all you Americans, you don't know -- you're -- you're very, um, a non-Canadianized, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, actually I -- I do -- I do know, uh, lots of people from Toronto.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, really?
R:  Uh, yeah, because I work at a hotel and we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we often get visitors from Toronto.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I'm very friendly with a couple actually.
L:  So how does this work?  I- is it a draw or something?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  You -- you ask me questions, I answer them and then it turns into some sort of draw or something?
R:  No.  No.  We just talk about the subject.  Um, do you watch reality shows and, um --
L:  But, then what ...
R:  -- what do you think of it?
L:  [MN]
R:  We don't do anything.
L:  Is it a volunteer thing for me?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, I thought there was a draw to win something.
R:  No, I th- -- I think they pay you f- per ph- -- per phone call.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.  [LIPSMACK]  Okay, yeah, so go ahead.
R:  So, I watch Survivor.  [LAUGH]
L:  I watch, uh, The Bachelor.
R:  I actually saw p- parts of it.  I -- I saw that, uh, that Joe, uh, what's his name?  Joe Millionaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was hooked on that one.
L:  Yeah, I like, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, The Bachelor and, um, what else?
R:  I saw that last night.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know I didn't -- I haven't seen that one from the beginning.  Survivor I never miss though.
L:  Oh, I used to watch that last year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, or two years ago, but then I just -- I got really busy with school so I stopped.  And, um, I don't know, I think The Bachelor's really interesting.  It's cute.  It's funny and, I don't know, I wonder if he's really going to marry the woman at the end?
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know all the [MN].  I -- I watched, uh, I guess, The Bachelorette, I watched that one.
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that.
R:  That was the one where she wa- -- she was the one that lost to the original bachelor.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then she had to choose from her.
L:  That -- uh, you and I just talking about reality TV for this?
R:  Yeah, that's all it is.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, what else can we talk about?
R:  We --
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] do you find it realistic?
R:  Um.  Painfully so.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Do you think, uh, they're fr- -- like [MN] any of it's scripted by Hollywood or by the directors?
R:  Uh, I'd like to think not.
L:  [MN]  Neither do I but somehow I just don't think that it's natural.  
R:  Yeah, well -- yeah, I'm sure of the -- I'm sure that they're directed somehow.  Um, you know --
L:  Yeah or scripted.
R:  I mean if they like -- if -- if they go off tangent or something.  It may be -- they may somehow throw something in to direct it a -- a different way.
L:  Right.
R:  Just like they do on Survivor.  You know, when things are going wrong they'll -- they'll change the make up of the -- of the -- of the, um, tribes or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or, um, what else have I watched?  Oh, American Idol's a reality [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, I think that's a reality show, too.
L:  Yeah, I think so and that --
R:  And I -- what -- I'm -- I'm hooked on that one, too.  [MN]
L:  And they're having a Canadian Idol actually and I'm going to try out for it 'cause I sing.
R:  Oh, terrific.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll look for you.
L:  Oh, thanks.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, what else about reality TV?
R:  Um.
L:  I find it more interesting than regular TV just because it's -- it's [MN] like real.  It's real people and not actors --
R:  Well --
L:  -- or actresses.
R:  But -- yeah, that's -- that's -- that's one -- one way to look at it too.  And -- and, uh, like old sitcoms, and I -- I do watch a lot of television.  I'm -- I live alone right now and I watch a lot of TV.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Um, but I ended up -- they all -- they're all the same stories over and over and over and this one, you -- you do find something different going on.
L:  Yeah, I like, um, the fact that it's a creative [MN] -- nobody's ever done it before and it's just such this new phenomenon going on.
R:  But, you know, I think it [MN] originally all started in Europe, in England.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- yeah.  It started in Europe a lot of these things.  They're -- they were a little more drastic than we with nudity and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it did start there, the original Survivor, the idea for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a few -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- which surprised me.  [LAUGH]  We always look like to think that we in North America are --
L:  Are the first.
R:  -- above it all.  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually I think -- I think it's Europe that actually is the first for everything.  They have the new -- the newest music, the newest technology.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Which is interesting 'cause people don't know that about Europe.  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, wha- -- did you see, uh, Survivor a couple of years ago with, like, a [inaudible]?
R:  I didn't see the very first one except for the last, um, the last one.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And then -- so then I said, "That was interesting".  Then I started watching 'em since then.
L:  Um, I find it -- it hooks me in, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like I'll watch it and I'll want more and more.  Like, whereas, other TV programs I -- I find it fake.
R:  Right.  And I -- I put it on -- I put it on to -- on to tape 'cause I'm afraid I'll miss it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Like it's addictive.  You know, like I definitely prefer reality shows.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like definitely -- oh, have you watched Extreme Makeover?
R:  [SIGH]  Last night was the first time, because it happened to be on right after The Bachelor.
L:  How good is that?
R:  I -- [MN] I mean that was freaky.
L:  Isn't that crazy?
R:  That -- that was freak- -- I don't know -- well, you know, it -- just to submit yourself to such pain but, actually, how else are you going to get it -- something like that done?
L:  You can't.  It's [MN] --
R:  For free.
L:  Yeah.  It's crazy.
R:  I'm sure it's for free.
L:  Well, it's like a real -- it's -- it's unbelievable.  Like that is an -- a crazy show.  Like I saw it with my boyfriend, he was like, dying over it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- that's the first I'd heard about it but I never th- -- you know, [MN] as it happened to be on the same station as what was before The Bachelor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right.  Which was, you know, after something else that I happened to be watching.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it all comes to, like -- you -- you get the -- like they're all after one and the aft- -- after the other, pretty much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, you watch one then the ones after and then aft- -- like it's -- you just sit in front of your TV it's -- make it very convenient.
R:  Actually there's a station coming out.  A new TV, um, station that will be all reality TV.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's so cool.
R:  The first thing --
L:  I wonder if they're going to have that here?
R:  Right.  The first thing that they're making is, uh, a story about reality TV.  How it came to be.
L:  Wow.
R:  And now that it -- and they'll be showing reruns of --
L:  Do you -- do you --
R:  -- all the -- all the reality programs until they get themselves going and then, I guess, they'll have some of their own.
L:  What -- do you know if the t- -- the reality TV people are actors that get paid?  Like Hollywood actors do?
R:  I don't know.  I just [MN] -- they have to -- I was thinking that, like, in -- at least in the Survivor, as -- as long as you stay you probably get a little bit of money. 
L:  I think so.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think they would do it for free.  I think they do get some money, but I don't know.
L:  And do they really starve them on Survivor?
R:  They probably -- well, I -- I tell you.  I did find something out that's really interesting.  I was in California doing a workout class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in California the -- the -- my -- the te- -- the instructor was, uh, um, [LIPSMACK] her husband was a producer of one of the Survivor in Africa, w- Australia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she went along with him and she was the, um, workout person for the -- for the people there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I guess, so they wouldn't die.  I mean, she actually worked out with them, like, once or twice a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that shows that they -- it's not totally -- um, I mean obviously there's lots of things that they don't film, or they don't show.  But I guess to keep them, uh, ali- -- you know, going they have --
L:  Well, they can't starve them.
R:  -- things like that.
L:  It's impossible.
R:  Yeah.  I mean they watch em.  Su- -- I'm sure they doctor them and make sure that they're not going to, you know, um, fall away.
L:  Because, like, how can you keep your morale up?  How can you ...?
R:  Well, just -- uh, [MN] um, Fear Factor.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you watched that one?
L:  I've seen that a couple of times.  That's scary.
R:  When they put the rats, that got me.
L:  Ew!
R:  Very first one when they had the rats.  [LAUGH]  Oh, and they have to eat stuff, I gag.
L:  Ew!  What -- what happened with the rats?
R:  That was the very first one.  They had to lay 'em in a crate and they dumped, uh, uh, like, uh, I don't know, twelve pounds of rats on top of them, and they had to stay in this crate with the rats nibbling at them.
L:  The rats literally, like, bit them?
R:  Well, they might have, you know, nipped them.  I'm sure they were -- 
L:  Ew.
R:  They made sure they weren't rabies rates.
L:  Oh, my God.  Who could handle that?
R:  I couldn't.  That -- that would kill me.  I could handle snakes better than rats.
L:  Oh, I couldn't handle either.  Snakes? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That -- those are sick.  Like those bite you and -- and with poison.
R:  No, no.  They would make sure they're not poison, I'm sure.
L:  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.
R:  But the rats, I can't even look at a rat.
L:  They're gross.  
R:  You know.
L:  In -- in Toronto I sometimes like --
R:  Before we hang up, I [inaudible] that they will cut in soon.  Do you know the Leibels up, um, [LIPSMACK] I know they're very famous, I mean, a very big family up there.  Uh, Stan Leibel and his family?  They're --
L:  Leibel?
R:  -- architects.  Or builders.
L:  Um.  Where do they live in Toronto?
R:  In To- -- well, um, in -- in -- in main Toronto, I guess.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
L:  Are you -- what -- what background are you?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Are you, um, like what -- what's your nationality?
R:  Uh, I'm Jewish.
L:  So am I.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Are you serious?
R:  Serious.
L:  That is hilarious.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  No, the Leibels?
R:  L.E.I.B.E.L.
L:  No.  I've never --
R:  L.I.E. -- You know, what, they're probably in the phone book because there's lots of them.
L:  Wow.
R:  Anyway that's the family that comes down here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I visit with them.
L:  Wow.  What -- what -- do they have children, like around ...?
R:  Well, uh, it's a second marriage.  Uh, so they have one child who's -- who's about eighteen or -- eighteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's in -- he's in University.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, then the husband has lots of other children.  You know, they're much older -- as old as the wife actually.
L:  Right.  I o- only know people, young adults, like twenty four --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- up to about twenty nine.  So, I'd know people in that age bracket.
R:  Right.  Well, I mean, [MN] you might have seen their signs around because I think they're very well known in the city.
L:  Oh, really?  I guess they've got money.
R:  Yeah.  I was originally from New York -- yeah, they do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I was originally from New York and people -- it was funny --
L:  Oh, you were?
R:  You come down to Tampa and people say -- or Saracen, and they say, "Oh, do you know Barry Manilow lives in New York?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not realising how big New York is, you know, things like that.
L:  Yeah.  That's ignorant. But, um, you're from New York?  Which part, Manhattan?
R:  Uh, no, the, um, the -- Long Island.
L:  Oh, yeah, a lot of Jewish people are from Long Island.  Hm.  [LIPSMACK].  And then you moved to Florida?
R:  Yeah.  Tampa.
L:  Do you like it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I would never up -- back up north.  
L:  Mm.
R:  The weather is ideal down here.  
L:  That is hilarious.  I can't believe [LAUGH] that --
R:  That we're Jewish [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  That they matched us, you know.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they're everywhere, you know.
R:  Yeah, well my children are -- your children -- are your age.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, no.  Actually they're older.

R:  My youngest is thirty one.  Mm?
L:  Any single sons for my girlfriends?
R:  No.
