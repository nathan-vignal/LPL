R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Uh, my name is Maureen.
R:  Hi, Maureen.  My name's Gordon.
L:  Hi, Gordon. 
R:  Uh, well, do you watch reality TV?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Uh, yes, I do.  I watch, uh, Survivors.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I'm trying to think about that other show was, uh, where they all lived in the house together, about three months?
R:  Oh, was that -- not like --
L:  Big Brother.
R:  -- Real World.  Oh, okay.
L:  I think it was Big Brother.  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I think the reason that the reality shows are, and I don't watch all of them, but like Survivor.  To me Survivor is like a microcosm of how things are in the work world.  I mean ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.
R:  Back biting.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, back biting.  People, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, coming together, falling apart, you know, uh, uh, with ulterior motives.  You know trying to get together to, uh, advance themselves.  Making liaisons today, different ones tomorrow.  You know, all serving their own, um, individual needs.  It's unfortunate, uh, but, uh, it's kind of the way it is, and I think by having a show like Survivor on the air you actually get to observe that behaviour that you can only, kind of, feel when you're at work.
R:  Uh, don't you think, um, possibly that it's, uh, [MN] it's a bit -- I mean, I haven't -- I never watched, uh, Survivor.  The only one I've been watching is, uh, is Bachelor.  And, uh, I don't know if -- you can't really call that, uh, American Idol, that's not really reality TV.  Um, but, um, don't you think that's a bit -- do you think it's a bit staged?  I mean, I --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- do --
L:  Yes.  Um, I'm -- I'm not too familiar with The Bachelor but, uh, all of it is staged.  Um, because see you wouldn't watch something unless it was entertaining.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, it's staged.  It's not -- [MN] it's not reality the way actual reality is.  It's staged for entertainment purposes.  And I think even on the show that I watch, Survivor, uh, it's edited to be entertaining.  You know they're there for hours and hours and hours a day. Uh, they're not showing you that reality.
R:  Right.
L:  They're -- they're just showing you edited, spliced together, reality that's, uh, hopefully entertaining and viewers will watch.  Uh, The Bachelor, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I saw the millionaire, a little bit of that one.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that whole thing was staged.  And it was phony and I don't think, uh -- oh, wait, I did see some of The Bachelor.  That's right.  That's where the girls, uh, [LIPSMACK] yeah, were, uh, hoping to get a proposal from somebody right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, uh, artificial.  I don't think anybody's expecting people to really fall in love and have a lasting bond, uh, [LAUGH] with -- with, um, cameras watching.  I mean the whole -- the whole climate's artificial.
R:  I mean -- what I find so interesting about the whole thing is that it's gotten this, uh -- and there's this whole thing going on with language, uh, where thing- -- uh, certain phenomena are -- are getting terminologies that actually are complete misnomers.  Because to call this reality TV.  Yes, it is a new genre.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it is a new genre of TV, but reality doesn't actually describe it because, I mean, for example, like, you know, when was the last time you were invited, uh, with some kind of has been star to go on a deserted island and eat, you know, cockroaches, or whatever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as they do on --
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I mean --
L:  That's true.  It's not -- it's not real life the way --
R:  Yeah, it's like --
L:  -- life actually is.  Yeah, you're right.  You're correct.
R:  Um, and I mean it's pre- -- it's [MN] it's [MN] -- all of it has kind of a bizarre twist and my own theory, a little bit, is that, um, with so much very heavy duty business going on in the world, um, there's a lot of this stuff coming out and I don't think it's like one grand plot, um, but either people want to get away from it or, you know, they -- the, uh, television producers want to help people get away from what's going on and they program the stuff that's totally escapist.  So it's actually in -- it's the inverse of reality, the sort of opposite of reality.  It's like, uh, you know --
L:  Oh, sort of like --
R:  -- it's how -- how to sort of escape reality.
L:  Like modern fairy tales?
R:  Um, yeah, a little bit.  I mean, certainly The Bachelor, from what I watch, is total fairy tale.  I mean the guy's a -- the guy's a stud.  All, you know, very charming, you know, nice guy.  And all the girls are, uh, you know, very attractive and, you know, you find their personality quirks, um, but, uh, you know, in general it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this guy's got a good selection.  The girls are all kind of -- uh, kind of boxing out and trying to get at, like, the you know, the world's richest guy and, uh, he happens to be sweet and sensitive too.  And it's like, you know, it's kind of not -- and then he has to, after, you know, knowing someone for six weeks, propose marriage and he's speaking, like, [LIPSMACK] like he really, um, [MN] -- you know, like he really likes these people.  You know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- after only a few weeks.  It's -- it's, uh, I think it's a bit, uh, far fetched.
L:  So you think, uh, [MN] the reason they're so popular is a little bit like bread and circuses from ancient times?  You know.
R:  Oh, right.  Like more like a stage, uh, just kind of like a carnival -- like a kind of flip -- flipped -- reality kind of flipped on its head a little bit to -- uh, in that sense?  I don't, um, I don't know what the original bread and circus was.
L:  Oh, back in ancient times, back in ancient Rome --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, to take the people's mind of, uh, [MN] things that were going on, like the wars and the fact that taxes were so high, uh, Caesar would arrange for entertainment.  Throw the Christians to the lion.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  The, uh, gladiators, that kind of thing.  He called it bread and circuses.  Uh, just like you said, you know, it's a carnival atmosphere to take the people's mind off a things.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And in that -- that regard I -- I think you're correct.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look over here while all this bad stuff in the world's going on over there.  'Cause there has to be a reason why they're so popular.  Uh, another thing too could be that the traditional shows have kind of run the course.  I mean, how many different plots can you come up with in sitcoms and dramas.  I mean, it's kind of rehashed, so this is a novel form of, you know, entertainment.
R:  Yeah, and there's so many, um, so many of them, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's kind of, uh --
L:  I don't know if that will -- will kill the genre.  I -- I kind of think it will.  I mean some of them are, um, like the one -- I -- I saw it once and I couldn't watch it after that.  Uh, you had touched on it where, uh, a has been star takes somebody out on a date.  And that was extremely uncomfortable.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Oh, it was terrible.  It was [LAUGH].  Um, [LIPSMACK] trying to think of the actor's name.  Uh --
R:  It wasn't Emmanuelle Lewis was it?  [LAUGH]
L:  No, it was the other, uh, uh, little boy who was in, uh, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Gary Coleman?
L:  Gary Coleman.  
R:  Oh, no. 
L:  Right.  And of course --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he was with, um, a white girl who was way too tall for him.  They were both uncomfortable and his life is, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  They just make a --
L:  -- difficult.
R:  -- mockery of that guy.  
L:  Yeah, they did.  And that's what the whole event was about.  And that was the one and only show I watched.  Because that's, um, that's not what I like.  I -- I don't like, uh, making fun of people.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean that -- [MN] see on Survivors you know they're out there to win a prize.  And they're going to lie [MN], you know, cheat, whatever, it's a game.  But that was different.  That was, uh, extremely painful and hurtful to watch.  And, uh, he was trying his best to entertain the young lady and show her what his life was actually about.  Uh, he likes toys and trains and, you know.  And she thought he was a cock and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] after the, um, the date was over she spoke at length about how she thought he was.  And it was all extremely negative and, um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it just, um, a dreadful thing that -- that type of a show.  So, I -- I wouldn't watch that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like the -- I like the fantasy, um, of The Bachelor.  I mean the concept is sort of, like, uh, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty.  You know, the -- the handsome prince and all the beautiful girls.  Um, but that to me is just -- I don't buy into the +fantasy that everyone will really find somebody and fall in love.  
R:  No.
L:  It's, uh, it's just merely, um, a contest.
R:  And, uh, do you -- do you know any, um, are there racial elements in the programs where they're, sort of, ignoring, uh, race or any, um, it [MN] or not ignoring it but, again, do you see -- do you see a preponderance of just, you know, kind of white folks and --
L:  Well, they're --
R:  -- upper class white folks.
L:  Uh, again, the only one that I've -- I've watched a little of The Bachelor and I watched Big Brother.  I don't recall there being [SIGH] uh, more than one black person in the show.  I think in Survivors last year, there were two, uh, that started off.  And I believe they had an Oriental, um, contestant too.  And that's not a microcosm of the way things are.  In my office, uh, we're really diversified.  I mean, we have all kinds of people of different races and cultures and we all, um, more or less work well together.  But that's not represented in these shows yet.  And I don't know why that is.  Um, [LIPSMACK] certainly there's some wonderfully entertaining shows on that are black comedies, uh, so it's not the people won't watch them.
R:  No, definitely.  But, uh, I mean -- I mean I see that too.  Where [MN] you've got -- you know, I think it would be a stretch to imagine there's going to be a black reality series.  Um,
