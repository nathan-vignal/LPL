L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  [NOISE] All right. [NOISE]  Um, I'm Jasmine. [NOISE]
R:  I'm Maria.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Maria. [NOISE]  I guess the day's topic is about reality TV?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] So, do you --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- watch it? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I watch some of it, but I'm really not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into to it, you know.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um, the only one that I watched for a couple of, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was, um, The Mole.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, The Mole?  Oh, okay. 
R:  Yes.
L:  Every time I tried to catch that I'd get the last ten minutes, [NOISE] and I don't know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what it's about. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I tried --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Big Brother one. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, i- -- 
L:  And the first one, it was good.  But, then it was, um [NOISE] -- it got a little boring after a while. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  Unless they had somebody that's, like, um, getting on everybody's nerves.
R:  Mm, yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, and you know, I mean, I've seen the -- a couple of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minutes of S- Survivor, and --
L:  Mhm.  Did you like Survivor? [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I really didn't enjoy it that much, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, like I said, I would just watch here and there, but I -- it wasn't something, like, I had to turn in and watch.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, the -- the only one that I actually, you know, sat down and watched, for at least twenty -- thirty minutes, was The Mole.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then, the one that -- when they had the celebrity one.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you ever watch Fear Factor? [NOISE]  Is that --
R:  No.
L:  -- considered -- it that con- -- I don't even know if that's considered reality TV -- where they do those stunts and then they have to eat those, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those bugs or whatever.
R:  I -- I used to watch that one, but I don't know if -- if it is a realit- --
L:  It's kind of gross. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know.  But, you know, the things people do ...
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] What --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I tried to watch Survivor, [NOISE] but it just seemed so boring.  And then, um, you've got all these people arguing with each other back and forth.
R:  Yes. [MN] 
L:  So, I just -- I -- I really couldn't, um [NOISE] -- I don't know.  I know some people really like it.  Now, I even tried to watch The Bachelor.
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  But, I thought that was wrong how he was doing those women.  'Cause he was hugging and kissing on all of 'em. [NOISE]  And, you know, dating all those women, and making 'em think that they could be the one, and, you know, he'd eliminate them.  I -- I just didn't like that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Um, no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, other than -- than those two, I really didn't watch anything else, because they're --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess they're not that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting, as people seem to think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At least to me, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah --
R: Ah --
L:  -- I didn't think they -- [NOISE] I didn't think they, um [NOISE] -- I don't think they really real.  I don't know why they call it reality TV, because they're not really realistic about it.  They keep hiding -- see, 'cause even Joe Millionaire, he wasn't --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- even a millionaire.
R:  I know.
L:  [NOISE] And they --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- had those people, you know -- they was gold diggers just looking for this guy that had all this money, and he had nothing. [NOISE]
R:  I think that the one that really was more of a reality show, to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was the Big Brother one.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] 
R:  But, ah, other than that, I didn't, you know -- like I said, I didn't watch any of the other ones.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, but, do -- are there any other ones? 
L:  I gu- -- I -- I -- um, [NOISE] I know -- well, they consider, like, those dating ones -- they have The Bachelor.  Now they got The Bachelorette.  They have Mr Personality.  I think those are considered reality shows.  But, you know, we just --
R:  What about that -- that -- the other one about Meet My, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where they meet the parents?
L:  [NOISE] Meet the --
R:  And --
L:  Oh -- oh yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  I think --
L:  I -- I've -- I've seen that -- a little bit of that, like, last week. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Oh, I can't remember the name of that. [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, what's the name of it?  It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Meet My Parents, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]  But, you know, they had also had a show on [NOISE] where, um, [NOISE] they had -- it's called, like, The Family, or something.  And they all stay in this mansion or whatever. [NOISE]  And it could be, like, cousins, brothers, or sisters, and parents, or whatever.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And one of them is, um [NOISE] -- oh gosh.  One of them is, like, [NOISE] really against each other -- everybody, or whatever.  They -- they're supposed to win, like, about -- I think it's, like, fifty thousand -- a hundred thousand dollars or something at the end of it if they -- if they're, like, the last one. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you ever see that one?  No? [NOISE] 
R:  No -- no.  I don't watch any -- like, I said, you know -- I don't know why. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I honestly don't know why people think that they're popular.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, why they became so popular --
L:  Maybe --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- the people have a boring life, and that's what they [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- that they have --
R:  I think --
L:  -- nothing else --
R:  -- so.
L:  -- to [LAUGH] --
R:  I think I'd take a taped reg- -- I mean, a regular show, other than Survivor, you know.  I stick --I still --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- stick to my Friends and my ER and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- all of those.  I think they're very, very nice. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I like -- I like ER.  Friends is funny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I -- I don't, um -- I can't imagine just sitting there, you know, week after week -- have to be home at a certain time to watch these reality shows.  And I'm thinking, you know, a lot -- ah, maybe their lifestyle is just not so demanding, that they have kind of time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I mean, if I miss Survivor I'm not gonna die one way or the other. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because --
R:  And, yeah --
L:  -- it -- it's -- it's not that, you know [NOISE] --
R:  I think they, you know -- somehow or some way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they have to have some type of, not acting, but +premeditated -- whatever they call it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, things where they do it because, you know, they -- they must cut some things out.  They don't put everything in.
L:  [COUGH] Right.
R:  So that -- that wouldn't be cons- -- you know --
L:  [COUGH] That's what I was thinking too, 'cause, um, [NOISE] after they did a Joe Millionaire thing, and it showed some of the -- the different things that they deleted [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- you know, after he had, um, picked the one that he wanted to be with, or whatever.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when they found out that he wasn't wealthy, they really did -- th- that girl didn't want to be with him either. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Even if -- they got a new one -- a new show out, where, um, they're gonna actually pick somebody where even -- you wanna marry this person. [NOISE] And it's like you can't turn back, or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I don't know if it came out yet, but it -- it's supposed to. [NOISE] 
R:  Is it that -- like, the one on Fox?  I think all the shows on Fox are messed up, you know.
L:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean --
L:  I don't know.  I just -- I had seen the preview of it, but I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  No, um --
L:  I've seen the one where the guys had the masks on their face, and then --
R:  You know, the --
L:  -- and they were -- and the one guy got upset so he pulled his mask off.  He was like, "Forget this". [NOISE] 
R:  I think the only -- the only reality show that, ah -- that I used to watch -- and I don't know if it would be considered a reality show -- was -- you know that MTV show?
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  The Real World.
L:  Real World.  Yeah. 
R:  I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's the only one that was actually, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kind of into it.  That it was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think they acted or anything.  It was just --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- something --
L:  'Cause they did -- yeah, I think that was -- you're right.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I caught that a couple of times. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, that's the only one that would actually think -- that was a reality show.  Oth- -- all those, like, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're playing for money.  So, I -- to me, they're not -- they're acting, you know, because --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when people -- a lot of people think they are not, but, you know, they're actually --
L:  Yeah, 'cause they get angry and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And I have watched, um -- you know where they the wrestling -- the people that are trying to be wrestlers. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And they have to show 'em, like, training and things like that. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Now, those shows are -- people's tempers -- tempers are real high.  Like, they get really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mad at one point.  'Cause I think one time, this guy accidently kicked this guy in the face, and he kept kicking the guy in the face 'cause he couldn't do the stunt.  And the guy turned around to him and, "You kick me one more time in my face and I'm gonna punch you dead in your chest".  And he was, like, really -- you could tell that he was really angry 'cause he was tired of the guy not being able to do it. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, um, I guess you got some real -- some -- some of 'em are really real.  And then some of 'em you can tell that [NOISE] the people are just pretending.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Are you there?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Well --  
L:  So, I think, um [NOISE] -- well, for the most part, um, I'd rather watch regular TV, without all that reality. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'll stick to my soaps, even though they're acted.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So -- but -- where are you from?
L:  Um, [NOISE] Philadelphia. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Texas.
L:  You're from Texas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Oh, so you're all the way, um, in the mid, ah, of the country?  Is that --
R:  Well, I --
L:  --like, ah --
R:  I'm in sou- -- way, way south.  You know that -- the -- when you look at United States map and you see the -- the south tip of Texas?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  That's where I'm at.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
R:  I'm right across the border.
L:  Oh, get out.
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's hot?
R:  It is very hot out here.
L:  Okay.  We got, like, um, seventy eight degrees --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- now.  It's kind of nice.
R:  I bet.
L:  My nephew --
R:  Well --
L:  -- was living in Texas for a little while, with his aunt.  She's from, like, Kemah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's out, like -- that's near Houston, almost. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] He said the first week he was out there he passed out.
R:  No.
L:  'Cause he wasn't --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- used to the temperatures. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  It's very humid over here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You can't, you know -- unless you get used to it, can't really -- I mean, everywhere it's +stifling, you know.  Very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very hot.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  -- you --
L:  I've said enough about reality TV and I'm done -- trying to wait for the ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think we're almost done.  But, um, I guess, you know, I don't know why they have that Survivor so much.  You know, they -- they have so many things happening there.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Like, when, ah, they were killing those -- were they killing animals or something like that when it came out on TV?
L:  Killing the what?
R:  Somebody was killing, ah, something -- an animal, and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and people were upset --
