R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hell- -- Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Greg.  Who are you?
L:  David.
R:  Hey David, how's it going?
L:  Alright.  [SIGH]  I guess we're suppoed to talk about Iraq, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you go first?
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, well, in my opinion, um, I don't -- I don't -- I don't think the reas- -- stated reasons for going in Iraq --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are what -- are the real reasons why we went there.
R:  [NOISE] I agree. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I think there was a lot of dishonesty.  It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it's obvious they didn't have, uh [COUGH] arms of mass destruction like we claimed that they did.
R:  And that we even, like, know North Korea does. [NOISE]
L:  That's right and furthermore --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the stated reason is to, uh -- because he was a tyrant.  He was a tyrant long before we went in. [MN] And in fact --
R:  He was a tyrant with our money. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  He was a tyrant with George -- with -- with Chaney [LAUGH] long -- way back when. [MN]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  W- way back in the mid or late eighties.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I -- I -- I -- I -- I have -- I have -- I have a problem with the dishonesty of the administration. [MN]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, uh [NOISE] -- I mean, yeah, he's a [NOISE] -- he's a bastard but is it -- is it worth even a single American life to go unseat him? [NOISE] I don't think so.  He was [NOISE] -- he was no immediate danger.  I mean, I --
L:  You know, I -- it seems to me that it was more like revenge for -- for the f- -- it was more like he wanted to finish his father's unfinished business.
R:  [NOISE] I'll go even further than that.  I think that [NOISE] -- I -- I think that this has been the entitlement presidency. [NOISE] You know what I'm saying, "Oh, my daddy got to be president.  I should be able to be president. [NOISE] Daddy had a war in Iraq.  I should be able to have a war in Iraq". [NOISE]
L:  Well, I don't -- I don't like the secretive nature of the whole thing, you know.  I mean -- I mean, in the past even in -- during World War Two, there was some secrets but for the most part we -- we worked within an open system.  I mean we --
R:  Also we were fighting Hitler.
L:  [MN] Yeah, but we were also working in an open system and here, you know, it's people can be arrested without ch- -- being charged, you know, th- they're not willing to share information, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's --
R:  W- well, there I actually disagree with you.  I don't know how open a system we were [NOISE] -- [inaudible] if not disagree -- if not disagree at least -- at least question are you sure that having an open system [NOISE] was -- was a priority back then?  I mean [NOISE] it's almost but just a --
L:  Well, that -- well, that --
R:  -- just automatically more than it is now but are you sure that it was -- that was really a priority then? [NOISE]
L:  Well, it was -- it was much more open. [NOISE] The deal was that back then [NOISE] if there still was a reason to keep something secret like a particular attack that was kept secret but in terms of the general --
R:  Pearl Harbor.
L:  In terms of the general debate, the debate was -- was -- was kept open, you know.  I mean -- and -- and --
R:  Unless you were Japanese.
L:  Well, but -- right.
R:  Or black.
L:  The Japanese internment --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- system was, uh [LAUGH] -- was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was a great scourge of the time.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, and, uh, I -- and I -- I don't know anything about [COUGH] the black core that -- you know, I mean, the -- the core that went in separately [NOISE].  I -- I think that -- I guess that was sort of kept secret too.
R:  Well, I don't think we're supposed to get too off topic.
L:  Yeah.  Well -- yeah, we're back to Iraq.  Back to --
R:  They -- they won't -- they won't pay us if it's too off topic.  All right.
L:  Yeah.  We drifted off -- off Iraq unfortunately.  But in the --
R:  That's okay.  We've got a few minutes.
L:  We've got two minutes?
R:  Yeah. [several inaudible words] [NOISE].  Have you noticed how the objective of the war keeps changing?
L:  Yes.  I've noti- -- I mean, that's -- that's my point is as soon as you prove the objective is false he changes the objective. [MN] Or changes the state of reason for going to the war.
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] the reason why that is.  As long as you keep your motive really fluid then -- then you can't be held accountable for whether or not -- not you succeeded at it. [NOISE]
L:  Well, it makes it -- it makes it -- it makes him a moving target rather than a stationary target in terms of debate.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, I read that after -- after the, uh [NOISE] -- after they toppled the statue and everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there was a press conference and -- and someone asked, "Are we [inaudible] [MN] not? [NOISE] [inaudible] at what -- at what point will we have considered this a victory?"  And [NOISE] -- and he j- -- he just, uh, kept saying over and over, "We will announce what -- what constitutes a victory later on". [NOISE] You see w- what he's doing there?  He's b- -- he's basically saying -- basically saying, "We'll -- we'll wait and see what happens and then we'll say that --that our -- that it was our plan all along to cause that to happen --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and we'll take the credit for it".
L:  You're right.
R:  [inaudible]. [NOISE]
L:  I mean it's so -- there's -- there's such -- I mean, it's the worst administration we've ever had.
R:  Yes.
L:  And they're blatantly bad.  I mean, that's the whole thing.  It's -- it's scary that -- I mean, they're kind of -- they've kind of been given a free hand.  I mean, we're not -- people aren't putting them -- you know, aren't criticizing them the way they should --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The press has been fairly lax about it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  [NOISE] He doesn't -- [NOISE] [inaudible].  You remember that --
L:  I didn't hear everything you said.  You're fading in and out.
R:  [NOISE] You remember about the hotel where all the western press were saying got shot by a tank.
L:  Yeah.  Accidentally. [LAUGH]
R:  And there's documented proof that no one was firing at the tank at the time that they -- they fired that shot off.
L:  Yeah.  I heard that too.
R:  It -- it wasn't in -- in retribution for anything. [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, it was -- it was more -- I think it was more probably to bring home the point that Iraq's a dangerous place, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  [several inaudible words] place [inaudible] too. [NOISE]
L:  I can't hear you very well.
R:  So that if you go for [inaudible] he wants you to report [several inaudible words]. [NOISE]
L:  I can't hear you very well.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.  Anyway, back to -- to Iraq itself [NOISE] you realise all the things that they lost [inaudible] af- after [inaudible] the night that -- that the US rolled in the -- all the ministries [NOISE].  Looters burned and destroyed the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Planning [NOISE] the Ministry of --
L:  Museums.
R:  -- Irrigation.
L:  And the museum.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  All the looters at the museum.
R:  [NOISE] Got the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of -- of Intelligence in the Interior [NOISE].
L:  Well, those were our priorities.  We had to preserve those.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  We had troops stationed at those. [NOISE] So, yeah, I mean, supposedly this was to help the Iraqi people.  Don't you think the Iraqi people could maybe use all those things? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, well, I don't -- I -- see, I'm v- -- I don't think they're the- -- I don't think that -- that's our real reason for being there to help the Iraqi people.
R:  [NOISE] Huh, no.  No.  Yet another thing that a lot of people are just [NOISE] -- just don't even seem to care about is that [NOISE] -- that Saddam would never have anything to do with Bin Laden.  They hate each other.
L:  Yeah, well that's the -- that was -- well, yeah, nine eleven and -- and Saddam Hussein have nothing to do with each other.
R:  [NOISE] That is --
L:  They're totally unrelated but yet they're always talked about together --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as if somehow this is going to help, you know, what happened before.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I also find it kinda strange that Bin Laden --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wound up missing after the end of the Afghanistan war and now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] Saddam Hussein is missing.  I mean, I -- I think it just gives you a way that you can allow the war to continue for ever, you know, that you're never sure when they might pop up again.  You know, if we were able to get rid of them then there would be no bogeyman any more.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I don't know.  I mean, [several inaudible words] always manage to find a new bogeyman.  There'll be a new one now.  Maybe it'll be Syria [NOISE] ...
L:  Iran.
R:  [NOISE] Or North Korea which even I could admit is fraught with -- is a threat.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it -- yeah, it -- it's -- well, the thing is is that we're -- well, we've been letting that brew for a while.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  We were too busy --
L:  It seems to me -- it seems to me there -- there -- we had a diplomatic opportunity to deal with them and we chose to ignore the opportunity.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  I --
