L:  Hi.
R:  Hello
L:  Hi.  My name is Pascale[?].  What's your name?
R:  Lori.
L:  Lori?  Hi, Lori. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] So, the -- the topic of day is, ah, about reality, ah, TV show?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, ah, do you watch any?
R:  No.  I'm not interested in -- although I watched, like, the first Survivor -- like, first two episodes, and I thought it was pretty stupid.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, um, I -- I -- [SIGH] the -- the only thing that I, um -- I watch, ah, now is, ah, the, um -- The Bachelor.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  But, I just -- I don't know.  I got hooked to that because I think it's so, ah -- it's so funny, and, you -- you know, it's, like, so pathetic of those people going there to -- to be in love in, like, you know, six weeks or something.  To find a -- a person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to marry in six weeks -- it's so funny I just, um -- um -- so, you --
R:  You can't really know 'em.
L:  No, that's true.  Are you with, ah, um -- what do you do for a living?
R:  Ah, right now I'm a stay at home mom.
L:  Oh, okay.  So -- so, do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, you -- you just never watch those TV -- ah, reality TV show?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  Not really.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I change the channels, like, "Yeah, right". [LAUGH] 
L:  So, they were asking why we think it's -- that it's so popular.  Why do you think it's so popular?
R:  I don't know.  So, I guess some people wish it was them.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Or maybe some people are bored. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  They escape reality. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I don't -- for -- for example, there's another show that -- ah, that -- it's called Fear Factor.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Ah, and that's so d- -- for me, it's so disgusting.  I just cannot believe that people would --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- eat worms to get, you know -- I don't know -- fifty thousand dollars or whatever.  That's r- -- for me, it's -- that's the -- the dis- -- most disgusting thing.
R:  Don't need money that bad.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  But, you know, I mean, it's great -- I mean, I would go to The Millionaire because it's -- it's just a quiz, and you just need to, ah -- to know what -- you know, to know a little bit about everything. [MN]  But, to, ah -- I don't know -- to, um -- to go -- to go a show and, ah -- and, ah, do awful things like eating, like, a brain of a monkey, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, [LAUGH] that would disgust --
R:  Ah, it's -- gets pretty ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  And, I -- I -- I don't watch those.  I just -- you know, sometimes you just see the, um -- the -- the, you know -- the, um -- the, um advertisement for -- for -- for the show, you know, before some shows.  But, I think it's disgusting.  I just -- I watch, um -- um, American Idol.
R:  Oh, I haven't watched that.
L:  Yeah.  I just, ah, you know, um -- [LIPSMACK] but, ah, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's great to see that young people are full of hope and, ah -- and they're -- I mean, they're -- I'm a -- I would be totally terrified and too shy to go on TV.  And saying so, I really admire those young people -- young kids they go there and, you know, they're so -- they're so, ah -- they have a lot of courage to do that.  So --
R:  Yeah.  They have this new one, um, World's Most Talented Kid.  Now, that I watch.
L:  Oh, you watch that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did --
R:  I like seeing those kids.  And oh my gosh, their talent -- it just blows me away.
L:  Yeah?  Do you have kids?
R:  I have four.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, okay, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know I -- I saw -- I think I saw one episode and, ah, there was a -- a little girl was dancing like crazy.  I mean, she was like a little chubby girl, but she was so -- I mean, she was dancing and singing and it was really amazing, you know.  Just no fear, you know -- to just go and -- and -- and also, ah, the same episode I saw, like, there was a -- a black girl, um -- [LIPSMACK] um, like, I don't know -- she was, like, twelve years old and she was singing like Whitney Houston.  It was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unbelievable.  So, yeah, that's really -- that's really amazing.  But, ah, yeah, beside that I just, you know -- I just, ah, watch TV for entertainment.  But, I don't watch the -- the type like, um -- like, ah, the Jerry Springer Show.  All those type of things are stupid for me.
R:  All -- all those -- those talk shows things are silly too, 'cause half of 'em, they have to be made up.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's too +outrageous.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I think so.  Yeah, then maybe -- maybe when they say real- reality shows, then these are not like those talk shows -- maybe li- like you say, um, the Survivor.  I s- -- I watched actually the first Survivor -- a few episodes.  But then, I didn't watch the, ah -- the following years I was not interested anymore.  It was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one time thing.  So, um -- but, do you -- I mean, do you watch any other, ah, things on TV, or ...?
R:  Oh yeah.  I watch -- like, right now, um, the ER is on.  I like watching that.  You know, like doctor type shows.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, yeah -- yeah.  But, um, yeah, I mean, there -- there's a lot of -- I'm -- I'm from Switzerland originally.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, ah, I don't know where -- where are you located?
R:  [MN] Ah, I'm living in Nebraska.
L:  In Nebraska?  Okay.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never -- I've never been there.  So, I'm from Switzerland and, ah, in Switzerland we don't have, you know, that type of, ah -- of show.  It's very, ah, plain.  Ah, you know, like movies and -- but, reality TV -- reality TV we don't have that in Switzerland.  It's really -- ah, for me, it's really American, you know.  And, um, it's like, ah -- I don't know -- it's, like, everything for the money.  You know, you can get a million dollar if you marry someone, ah, on the show.  Or -- or, you know, like -- there was, like, um, that show a few -- I don't know -- a few weeks ago, um, for the, um, Joe Millionaire.  He was a --
R:  Oh yeah.  Where he wasn't really rich --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but he had pretend to be?
L:  Yes, exactly.  And it was, like, "Come on".  You know, he's just a -- it's just too -- I don't know -- sometimes they -- they really do everything so that people are -- are cheated or -- or -- oh and, ah, yeah.  And then you just -- you just watch it to see how pathetic people are, you know.  So, maybe we are the pathetic ones, to watch.  But, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah. [COUGH]
L:  There was a -- there -- there's another, um -- another, ah, show, um, I was watching.  Um, was -- well, yesterday I was watching the -- The Bachelor, but I already just -- I -- I already talked about that.  Ah, oh, there was another show I was watching, um -- oh no, I have a blank.  Oh yeah, um -- um, Mr Personality.  So, now the have all those -- those, um, shows with marriage at the end.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And -- and, um -- and then there was another show, so -- Married By America.
L:  Oh yeah.  Where -- where people, like, voted on the internet or something?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I've -- yeah.  I -- b- basically they had, like, a choice between a few people.  And then the family came and asked questions to the few people -- you know, the couple or three people, to see if their daughter would get along with them, or their son -- blah, blah, blah.  And, um, then they -- they -- basically they -- they put together six couples.  And those six couples went to, um, like, a -- like, a private hou- -- private, beautiful property just for a few weeks to get to -- to know each other.  And, ah -- and then each week these was judges that were, um, deciding if, ah -- if they would continue to be engaged.  And the one -- the one couple -- or, the two couples that were, ah, left at the end, they would, ah -- they would go to do a wedding.  And if they were going through the wedding, then, um, the -- whoever couple was voted by America to be the winner, then they would get, like, a house and a half a million dollars or something like this.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I mean, it -- it was funny because, um, they got -- I mean, [MN] of -- of -- of the six couples, there were two -- like, they were really -- they fell for each other.  Really -- they really liked each other and, ah, they did kind of fell in love.  And, ah -- and -- but, they didn't go through the ma- -- ah, they didn't go through the marriage at the end.  They -- mm, they went to the -- to do the wedding ceremony, and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- both backed out.  And, ah, they didn't get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- married.  And then they did a follow up on the -- on the -- on the, um, show and they said, "Well, you know, this couple is still dating.  And this other couple, ah, he moved from California to New York to live nearby where she lives, and they're still engaged".  So --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know --
R:  But, they're taking their time.  That's the whole thing.  They're not jumping into it, and then finding out six months down the road they can't stand each other.
L:  That is correct.  That is -- yeah, because frankly, I don't know -- ah, I don't know you, but I cannot be- -- I -- I -- I don't understand how you can get married after six weeks or -- or even six months, you know. You don't know a person, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, yeah, that's it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, yeah -- yeah.  So, that's about it, ah, about reality TV show.  And, ah -- and, ah, it -- it -- do you have, ah, cable, or you have just regular channels, or ...?
R:  Yeah, we have, um, the digital cable.
L:  Oh, okay.  See, I -- I just have the regular channels.  I have, like, ah, you know, the thirteen channels and, ah -- and a few others, ah, down the -- down the -- the line.  But, um, I usually watch, um, ah, you know, some TV shows -- 'cause I work also.  Um, I do web design at home.  And sometimes I just need, like -- like, a ground -- you know, like, ah, a back- --
R:  A break?
L:  A background.  Yeah, or a -- or just a background sound, you know, so I can just, ah, do my web --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- design.  And watching, like, a stupid show that I don't have to be, ah, you know -- I don't have to be very attentive.  I can just, you know -- just have it on the background sound.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you watch that show for, ah, children, like, every week, or ...?
R:  Um, it's -- yeah.  It's on weekly.  Ah, I think it -- they're in, like, the finals or something like that right now, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  So, what's -- what -- I mean, what are they gonna win?
R:  Um, I don't -- I think if they -- they win, um, a recording contract -- the winner does.  Um, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there was a winner who actually, um, was already signed on by a company.  And e- even though she was the winner, she -- that disqualified her because now she's considered professional.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so, they -- they took the runner up from, ah, that show that she was on and, ah, made that person the winner.
L:  Oh, okay.  But I mean, are there only singers, or -- because I -- I thought that it was the most talented kid, but they have, like, different talents, d- don't they?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  They're -- well, one kid, ah, in the three to five group, ah, won last week doing yoyo stuff.  And this kid was just awesome.  But, ah, yeah, they dance, they sing, um --
