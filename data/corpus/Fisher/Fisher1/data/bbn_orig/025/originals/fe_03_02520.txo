L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hey, how you doing?
R:  I'm fine.  And you?
L:  Um, I'm doing -- uh, my name's Chris and I'm from the University of Maryland.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm Deborah and I'm from Kansas, originally from New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, yeah.  Uh, how old are you right now?
R:  I am -- let's say, I'm in my forty to fifty range.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm old -- a lot older than you.  I have kids --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- your age.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Oh, that's cool.  That's cool.  Uh, yeah.  I'm just, uh, I'm a sophomore.  I'm going to be a junior next year, so ...
R:  Excellent --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my son graduates on the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sixteenth.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Okay, that's cool.  Um, yes.  So I guess we talk about the topic, uh --
R:  Yeah, reality TV.  Uh --
L:  Reality TV?
R: They're real -- I'm a schoolteacher and my --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- students talk about it all the time.  
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'm not really, uh, like, I don't really get interested into reality TV 'cause I don't think half of it's, like, you know, like, real.  It's, um -- it might be real but, like, it's just too much -- too much like stage fright[?] for me.
R:  It is.  It's rigged.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it's -- it's too staged for me to watch when they call it reality, when it's not really.  You know.  And I think it, like, plays with -- plays with people's minds all the time, which --
R:  Well and you can't act natural in front of the -- the camera.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh, there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one show I do watch and I admit it.  And that's The Osbournes.
L:  The Osbournes?  [MN]
R:  I -- [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I'm an old -- I'm an old Ozzy fan from when --
L:  Oh.
R: -- he was young and I watch The Osbournes, and you can see how -- and it's reality TV.  You can see, though, how they're starting to play to the camera.
L:  Oh, like, [NOISE].  Um, what do they, uh, what -- what -- what does The Osbournes talk about?
R:  Oh, ev- everything.  It's, uh, you know who Ozzy Osbourne is, don't you?
L:  Uh, I actually don't watch that much reality TV.
R:  He -- well, he's an --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- old rocker.  He is the -- probably the Godfather of heavy metal music.  He's the guy --
L:  Oh.  Oh --
R:  -- who bit the head of the bat.
L:  -- that's right.  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  That's right.  Uh --
R:  And so they follow his -- they follow his family around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And kind of -- it's like it was a slice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into the life of this -- this Osbourne family.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Um, like, what do your kids usually watch 'cause, uh, I -- I -- yeah, recently, like, they've been talking about, like, Who Wants to be a Million -- uh, not the millionaire show, but the, um, what's the one?  The Batchelor one and then the one -- they're coming out with a new series with a woman this time and they have all masks on and stuff.
R:  You know --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- I haven't seen that one.  I have, uh -- my daughter who's a freshman in college --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- watched the one where the guy was tricking everybody.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess they thought he was rich and he wasn't rich.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, uh, [MN] --
R:  She thought that was a hoot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, and then in the end they ended up getting some money anyway, so it wasn't really --
R:  Yeah, it wasn't quite what -- yeah, but, uh, yeah -- to me that -- I thought that was just so crass.
L:  Yeah. I -- I didn't --
R:  I mean it showed the women to be so [LAUGH] materialistic.
L:  [LAUGH]  [MN]  Yeah.  I -- and like I think they tried to follow it up and now the next season's going to be, like, a woman that does it.  [NOISE]  And instead of, uh -- she has to pick a mate but like only through personality, and all the bachelors have to wear masks on theirself.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they have -- so now they have to, like, the woman has to pick in the end who, uh, who she wants to be with, uh, not, like, regarding looks and stuff, so ...  That's going to be like the next series, I think.  That's coming up this, uh, summer, I think.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  I'm sure I'll hear about it 'cause I [MN] -- I mean, the middle -- my middle school kids, it's all they talk about are these shows.  
L:  Oh.
R:  They're disappointed I don't watch them.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, but --
R:  So you don't watch very many of them.  I guess I don't either.  I -- I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the reason why people watch it though, it's like peeking into somebody's house.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like -- I -- I guess it's -- sometimes, like, uh, when they -- when they kind of watch -- when they kind of, like, what should they expect for some things to happen and they're like, "Ooh, maybe this spicy thing will happen up your ..." or like this, uh, this thing'll pop up, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kind of like unexpected events, and if they do happen I think they're all planned what they do.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And that --
R:  Now, I just -- I remembered another one that my freshman watches and that's -- there's -- I guess it's on MTV, it's a sorority house.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She watches that one.  'Cause she thinks --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's hysterical.  It's a bunch of sorority chicks.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [LAUGH] that's a reality TV show too. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.  I think, like, um, the one I'm more familiar with would be, like, Survivor, I think.
R:  And I watched --
L:  And --
R:  -- a tiny bit of that.  Not very much.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I haven't watched it, like, I don't really watch TV that much.  I'm kind really busy, uh, recently these days.  But, like, last year we, like, um, even our, like -- I live on a -- I lived in the dorms last year and, um, they had this, like, floor meeting -- they had this floor, like, games thing and they played Survivor on the floor.
R:  Oh [inaudible] really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Kind of like, uh -- yeah.  They had to like each -- I don't know each like -- each week they would have, like, a -- a con- -- like a -- like a challenge or something.  And then, like, someone would be voted off and, like, stuff like that, and I thought was kind of stupid because they were just, like, copycatting and mimicking, like, the stupid games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's stupid, like, reality TV thing and, like, kind of -- kind of hurt some of the feelings on the people on the floor -- of some of the people on the floor.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause like, yeah, 'cause they were kind of like -- there wasn't really, like, even part of the game.  I didn't even play.  I didn't even participate because I thought it was just plain stupid so I didn't even go.
R:  Well, it's kind of brutal.
L:  Yeah, so, like, they're -- they kind of made. Like, some people kiss each other and a lot of stuff like that and some, like, the other college people didn't care about it.  That it's not a big deal but, I don't know.  I -- I just think otherwise.  I -- I think it's not that -- not that, like, appropriate to do and you know.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of -- kind of cheesy.  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's kind of -- yeah, it's kind of cheesy too.  It's like -- it's like, you know, like fourth grade playing like spin the -- yeah, they played, like, spin the bottle and stuff too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like to do with Survivor and stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  I thought it was just kind of stupid and I didn't quite, uh, yeah, participate in it.  But, um, [LIPSMACK].  Yeah.
R:  But you gotta admit a lot -- that's -- that's a lot of the fun of being at college, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do your stupid thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing stupid things.
R:  Do it while your --
L:  That's it.
R:  --  young 'cause when you get old you can't do 'em.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, yeah -- I kind of -- I kind of don't have the time -- it's -- it's not like I don't have the time, I just don't -- I don't know.  I want to kind of get out of college early 'cause I don't want [MN] -- want to spend, like, my entire half of life, like, in college or in school.  You know.
R:  Or paying for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or paying for it.  And I want to, you know, come out -- start coming out and get, like, a real job, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like, I don't really feel like -- I don't know.  Just spending time -- too much time watching TV and watching pointless, like, programs like that, but I do find them amusing sometimes.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, um, isn't there, um -- oh, have you been, uh, following up on [MN] American Idol?  I think -- is that --
R:  A little bit on the go- -- I -- I -- I've -- I, um, watched Idol -- well, I read the gossip groups online.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  People in the gossip groups have been talking about it but I haven't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- watched it.  I know my -- I have a married daughter and my son in law --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are hooked on that show.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't think that one's as rigged as everything else.  Would you -- would you agree there?
R:  Yeah, now is that --
L:  [MN]
R:  Is that the one where they -- where they, uh, sing?
L:  Yeah, that's the one where they all sing and then --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- people vote in.
R:  My son in law -- and you phone it in.  Yeah, my son in law --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- loves the guy from, I guess he's Louisiana.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some guy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  who sings.
L:  Yeah.  And, like, I think that's less, uh, less like -- less fake, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's more real --
R:  Well, you have to have some talent, supposedly.
L:  Yeah, you have to have talent and then, like, it's based on people's voting from outside, like, in America, you know.  So, it's kind of like everyone's calling in to see who they like and who they want to be their next star.  And it's kind of like an election, kind of.  Whoever wants to get the most votes stays, and then whoever gets the least votes gets dropped.  You know.
R:  Yeah, and I've heard a lot of -- a lot of people talk about that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause then they get angry, whoever gets voted off.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  And then --
R:  There's a whole round of discussions over that.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think the, uh -- I think the -- the fake part or, like, [MN] the unreal part would be, like, uh, Si- -- the guy, Simon.  The critic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who like bashes down on people and then, like, makes 'em feel bad.  I think that's kind of bad but it's kind of funny to watch, sometimes.
R:  I've heard a lot about him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I heard about Simon and Paula Abdul.
L:  Yeah, Paula Abdul, like --
R:  People [LAUGH] talked about those.  I guess everybody hates Simon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's rude.  
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, 'cause he's real rude.  'Cause like he just says, like, I don't even know how you got here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- you simply stink.  You sound horrible.  I don't even know why you're on here.  And, like, he just pretty much insults them and I think that's how they get, like, people to watch.  
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, like -- yeah, like, who -- like, what's he going to say next and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, how --
L:  So, --
R:  How is everybody going to react when he insults them?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And like some -- some of the people, like, uh, the singers, like, uh, the people who [several inaudible words] they're like, just, like, whatever.  You can say whatever you want.  I tried my best.  At least I'm here trying, you know.  And, like, then the crowd and people in the audience, like, likes them for, you know, standing up for themselves and stuff.  So ...
R:  Now is there -- is there a big prize in that?
L:  Um.  
R:  Is there -- are they doing this for money or for a con- -- or [inaudible].
L:  Well, the win- -- the winner of the entire thing gets a contract to, like, uh, to sing and they also get, like, uh, a certain amount of money, I think.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then, well, like, I guess, like, half of that has to go to, like, a recording studio.  Making a CD and make a hit single and stuff like that.  But, like, eventually they get to be like the top singer, like the last one from last season.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like she's starting to make more songs now.  
R:  Oh, is she really?
L:  'Cause she's got -- yeah, yeah, she is.  So she's, like, kind of like the new pop star, you know.  [COUGH]
R:  Interesting.
L:  And -- yeah.  And, um, I think, uh, [LIPSMACK] what's it called?  Um, yeah, so -- oh, I just forgot a thought.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
R:  Well, it's an hour later for you guys, it's almost --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nine o'clock.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  Um, oh, I don't know.  But, um, yeah, so, like, in the end -- oh, oh, that's what I thought.  Um, the thing with the new artists that are singing right now I think that they sound more real because, like, um, when -- when they sing on stage and when they sing on the CD they sound kind of like the same.  It's kind of like you're voting on how they really sound like.  Whereas, like --
R:  Oh, so not enhanced.  It's not enhanced --
L:  It's not -- yeah, like -- like, you know, how like, uh, when --
R:  Like a Brittany Spears?
L:  Yeah, like, they're not enhanced in the studio and then when they perform live it's totally different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, like, with the record, I don't know, I think you [MN] actually get like
