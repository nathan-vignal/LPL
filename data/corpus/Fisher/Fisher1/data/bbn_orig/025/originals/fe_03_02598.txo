L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Jan.
L:  I'm Regina.  It's nice to meet you.
R:  Hi, you too, Regina.  Uh, so what do you think about the topic?
L:  Well, since they've already went in there and had the war [LAUGH] ...
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm pretty sure they're in the process of disarming Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  And -- and I think that it should be a top -- a top priority.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I think that the, uh, forces we've still got in place over there should be doing all they can to find the ones that were probably hidden in, you know, Saudi Arabia or wherever.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh ...
L:  Well, I was really surprised by the behavior of the Iraqi people.  I mean, I didn't --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I didn't expect that they would loot and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was kind of taken by surprise by that.
R:  Well, I -- I really wasn't because that's very typical in a wartime situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's happened in probably all the wars.  But as far as -- you know, as far as the weapons, I do believe that -- that they did have weapons of mass destruction and I believe that they were taken out of the country and that's why I think it's a top priority. We should pursue that as m- -- as heartily as we're still op- -- pursuing Osama bin Laden, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Keep -- keep, uh, covert ops people over there, whatever we have to do, and the money is insubstantial to me.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, whatever it costs because, uh, the -- the original George Bush did not finish the job over there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's -- we've lost over a hundred men and in their honor, you know, our -- our procedure should be completed over there, you know.
L:  Mm, yeah, I agree.
R:  So ...
L:  And not only that, but the people seem to be genuinely happy to see him, uh, being taken down if he's dead or whatever.  They seem to really be happy.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, I -- I just thought maybe there was a little more solidarity among those people, but I guess [SIGH] there really wasn't.
R:  Well, it seems to me like they -- they just kinda go with the flow and turn with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever is there for them at the time.
L:  Right.
R:  Because they're obviously living in desperation.
L:  Right, and they were being terrorized --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and tortured and whatever.
R:  Right.  And, you know, mass destruction weapons were used against them.
L:  Right.
R:  So, why wouldn't -- I mean, I -- I really -- you know, I've -- I know I've spoke with people who say, "Well, they, you know, good lord, I -- I can't believe their attitude".  Well, we're -- we haven't lived like they've lived for twenty years --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- uh, under --
L:  Duress.
R:  -- weapons of mass destruction, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, and torture.  So --
L:  And I guess we were just really being, um, subjected to propaganda to believe that they were all as one on these issues.  Because I really believed that, you know, they all believed all this stuff that -- that -- you know, they'd have newscasts and they'd talk to people on the street and they'd be like, "Oh, ya, ya, ya" but I guess that really wasn't the case.  Which is good.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's good because, my God, how scary that they could all be these fanatics, you know.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And no -- no matter if you took him down or not, I was beginning to wonder if they'd ever be.
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess that's good that they aren't all of the one mind, like --
R:  A- -- yeah.  And in -- in point that you mentioned that there are radical factions still, there again is just another good example of why we should, you know, find all the weapons we can.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  And I believe that there are, as I say, if they've not -- I think they've been taken to the other surrounding countries there, but I think that there's probably still some or some evidence of some that's buried or something there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we just haven't found yet, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, we live in a day and age where everybody wants their Big Mac in one minute or less, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
R:  And, uh, you know, the American people are like, "Well, you know, let's" -- you know, "Well, I'm not seeing no ev-" -- some of them are, "I don't see any evidence of weapons", you know, blah blah blah, "Why did we go?" and -- and -- well, you know, it's not even been two months, you know.
L:  Right, right.  It hasn't.
R:  And this man had, you know, twenty years to cover his [LAUGH] trail.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So to speak.
L:  Exactly.  He -- he has.
R:  So, yeah, I think that it would be great if we found everything that we possibly could.
L:  Right.  And -- and, you know, gave those people a chance.  Like, I do agree with one thing, that, you know, we need to give them a chance at democracy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, some kind of, uh, you know, system that they can work with because I can't imagine, you know, how that must be to live in a country like that.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  It really -- I mean, when you think about it, it comes down to just the luck of the draw --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we were born here instead of there.
R:  That's right.
L:  It's that tenuous, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, it's just like your parents always said, you know, [LAUGH] there's children starving in Africa.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Thank God you were born here, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I mean, it just comes to down to -- to that random of a --
R:  Right.  And there's children, you know, all -- apparently in m- many countries that grow up under that threat of what if I get, you know, gassed today --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or whatever if --
L:  Am I gonna come up missing tomorrow?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And still, I guess, they weren't getting fed ei- anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  No medical, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  They weren't distributing the medical, uh, supplies or the aid that was getting through.
R:  Well, and then people were looting that also.  I mean, they were just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- attacking the trucks and distributing it.
L:  Right, right.  And I heard that some of the top officials in the government were selling it.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that was happening in Ethiopia also.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Same thing happened there.
L:  Yeah, I heard that, too.
R:  So, you know, it's -- oh, my gosh, it's just ...
L:  It's funny how the greed of a couple of usually men [LAUGH] can --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Always men, girlfriend. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, right, right.
R:  You're talking to a he woman man hater. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I mean, the --
R:  But --
L:  -- the greed of a few men can bring --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so much destruction.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's just really sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and hopefully they can have a chance for a different life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But they have gotten all the rest of the top guys, so I mean, that -- that does offer some hope.
R:  Yeah, like I say, they're making progress every day and I think that people should just calm down and relax and --
L:  Give 'em a chance.
R:  Yeah, give 'em a chance.  And even if they -- like I say, even if they do not find weapons of mass destruction still in the country, then they will find evidence of it, I'm confident of that.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  Because for nothing else, we -- they need to prove to all these liberal skeptics that there w- -- you know, there was a reason -- other than the fact that he was a mass murderer --
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] -- to his own people, there -- there was -- there was a threat to the world from him.
L:  Well --
R:  And that's why we went in and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's -- I think that the last faction really should -- needs to have that proof, you know.
L:  Right, right.  No matter what the outcome on that is, the fact of the matter is they need to focus their attention on something else 'cause what they were doing ain't working.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, there's starving people, there's people with no homes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no medical care.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whatever they were doing, whatever their focus was on, it wasn't working.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, if we can at least redirect 'em into something else ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause it wasn't working at all for 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like they say, you can fish for 'em or teach 'em how to fish.
R:  Right.
L:  So, if we could just direct their attention to something a little more profitable for 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, the -- the weapons of mass destruction thing wasn't working out. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it doesn't take a genius to see that much.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, maybe they can focus on telling the people in simple terms, "Hey, w- whatever, it wasn't working for you, was it?"
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And maybe that could also be a -- a tactic they could use.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just simple talk sometimes can accomplish quite a bit when you kinda put it in frank terms.
R:  Yeah.  And it's like, you know, I was watching Dennis Miller, his special on HBO last night, and he said, "Hey, you know, we need to go, uh, kick a little butt every now and then".  He said, "Has anybody heard from Gaddafi lately?" you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right.  Oh, no, no, now suddenly he's a leader on the UN Security Council. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So --
L:  I thought about that, too, the other day when they said, uh, "Muammar Gaddafi or da da da da".  I was, like, what?  Since when?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  He, uh, he has become quite sedate.
R:  Yes.  And, you know, I'm sure that he's not getting any nuclear warheads put together.
L:  No, no.
R:  Because [MN] you know, it -- it's just -- you can't have it.  You've gotta have -- and you've gotta let the people have the say of what they, you know, can do.  Like you say, democracy, well, if that's what they want, you know, or if they're gonna have it a -- something like the Saudi Arabias do, a prince, you know --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and all -- a royal family --
L:  If they --
R:  -- or whatever, whatever they want, but they have to --
L:  If they've just gotta have a dictator. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] if you just gotta have a dictator, go with the royal family business, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  Because they probably won't be building nuclear weapons. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  'Cause they're busy being their -- doing their royal family stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  You know what they say, there is nobody hungry in Saudi Arabia.
R:  Yeah, yeah, they do say that, yeah.
L:  They say that -- yeah.  That country is the richest country in the world per capita.
R:  Yeah.  But I do -- but I don't trust them any more than I did --
L:  Oh, I don't either.
R:  -- Saddam Hussein.  I mean, it's the -- as far as I'm -- they could have -- they could have weapons there of mass destruction, but they're probably weapons [LAUGH] from Saddam Hussein.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, like I say, it -- uh, I -- I do believe that they're there and they were moved and hopefully we will find, uh, tangible --
