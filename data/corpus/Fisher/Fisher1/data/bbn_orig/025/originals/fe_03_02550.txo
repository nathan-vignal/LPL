R:  Hi.  My name's Christine.
L:  Hi.  My name is Marilyn.
R:  Hi, Marilyn.  How are you?
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm new at this. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Today is my second, ah, ca- -- can -- you hang -- hang on for just a second?
R:  Sure.
L:  Just a minute. [NOISE] [PAUSE]  I don't know how we're gonna do this.  I don't watch reality TV.  Do you?
R:  Well, you know what?  I don't either.  Um, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the only thing --
L:  Isn't that something?
R:  -- I really watch --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that I could even consider reality TV is American Idol.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know why?  'Cause I like the songs.  I was watching it the other night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't consider that.  I didn't know that was a reality show.
R:  I -- I don't know if that's really considered a reality shows or not.
L:  [MN] Well, we can try.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As -- last night it was great.  They were doing all these oldies from the sixties.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  
L:  And um --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- ah, where are you from?
R:  I am from Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Ah, California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Channel eleven. [NOISE]
R:  All right.  So, you're from California then?
L:  Uh-huh.  San Fernando Valley.
R:  Oh, that's where I used to live.
L:  Oh, isn't that something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What part?  What city?
R:  Um, I lived in, um, let's see, Santa Clarita, but --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- I was born in San Fernando.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been in North Hollywood since, ah, eighty one.
R:  Oh, I went to school in North Hollywood.
L:  North Hollywood High?
R:  No, actually, um, Valley College and Medical and Dental Careers.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, that's a great school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I take aqua aerobics over there.  My son goes there.
R:  Oh neat.
L:  Yeah.  We live right down the street --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- basically.  And, ah -- but, I'm really from Long Beach.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, know the area --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- well.
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh. So, I guess -- 
L:  Isn't that amazing.  What part of Oregon are you in?
R:  Um, Salem.
L:  Mm.
R:  The capital.
L:  How neat.
R:  So -- we moved up here about ten years ago.
L:  Good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  So, why don't you like reality shows?
L:  Ah, I just --
R:  Or why don't --
L:  -- think it's --
R:  -- you watch 'em?
L:  I don't know.  I ju- -- it -- it -- it's so -- I looked at it for five minutes one time, when they were on some island.  And it just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- looked so [SIGH] -- they were yelling and I just couldn't get into it.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Ah, it just, like -- like, Fear Factor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know -- I don't know.
R:  Well, I watched Survivor, I think the first time it was around.  I watched one or two of them.  But, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just, um -- I'm so busy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- know, with my family and my kids and everything.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just think that it -- it's just actually a sad commentary that we're getting that bored that we have to do things like How To Marry A Millionaire, and put ourselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that low, you know.
L:  I know.  Really.  I like, ah -- I sort of like public television --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I just like the human interest stories and that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of thing.
R:  Much more so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than uh -- you than, uh --
L:  Calmer.
R:  -- Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.
L:  Yeah.  But, if they consider the American Idol then that's great.
R:  Oh yeah.  I love American Idol.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- you know, I never used to watch it.  I didn't watch the first season at all, but then everyone at work was always talking about.  So, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- finally started watching it, and we're just addicted.  The whole family --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, who do you want to win?
L:  Ah, I just saw it last night.  Um, and then I've seen it -- I saw the guy when he was on Oprah, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- and it was just -- it was nice last night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't really realise what it was.  I thought, "Wow.  Is this some talent search?  These guys --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- are really good".
R:  Oh it's great.
L:  But they were doing all this medley of sixties songs.  It was wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  But I really -- I really felt that, um, Ruben shouldn't have been up there.  It should have been, um, Josh -- that guy who sings more country, 'cause Ruben's a great singer.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  So, I was a little disappointed with that, but I was glad he got to go sit back down.
L:  When -- when was that?
R:  That was just last night.
L:  I'm --
R:  It's on Tuesday night and Wednesday night.  See, Tuesday night they do the singing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then Wednesday --
L:  Right.
R:  -- night they kick people off.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I had no idea.
R:  Yeah.  And yeah -- they hook you for two nights. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  But -- and I have watched the millionaire thing because --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- my mom likes it, and I was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- watching it with her.
R:  How do you like that?
L:  It's okay.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's kind of weird that you can call somebody and get the answer though.
R:  Yeah -- yeah that is.
L:  And I don't know -- I don't get that.  And it's good that some of the money -- the celebrities were giving the money to charity.
R:  Oh, that is --
L:  Like, Queen Latifah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the other ones.
R:  Oh well, that's good.  Yeah.  I've never -- I've -- I know Regis --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- does that show, but that's pretty much all I know about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but, um, have you seen the commercials for that, um, one where the wo- -- men are wearing a mask?
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- and the woman has to, um, get rid of the men without knowing what they look like.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I did.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  I didn't watch it, but it just -- it looked interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, same here.  That's weird.
R:  It -- it's really weird.  So --
L:  It's getting -- they're -- they're getting pretty desperate for ideas, I must say. [LAUGH] 
R:  I think they are.  You know, there was an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie out in the nineteen --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- eighties.  It was called The Running Man.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it was kind of, um -- Richard Dawson was in it, and it was a reality based, um, TV show --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that basically criminals went on, and you either died or won the game.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it almost seems like that's what we're heading towards anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Doing anything to be entertained.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah, we are.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Um, but you can get every- -- everything up there that we get down here?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's all nationwide.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  So --
L:  Um, did you see [SIGH] -- I -- isn't there, um -- oh, [MN] ah, [MN] I don't know whether this was a reality thing, but on Oprah they had this family that went to Africa.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Do you ever watch Oprah?  They --
R:  No.
L:  -- went to Africa --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for a year, or -- I don't know what the time period was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To learn the ways of this tribe.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And that might have been a survivor thing.
R:  Huh.
L:  And then they were gonna be on this show -- they had 'em on this show about them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was a week ago.  And the whole family -- they sold their five bedroom home -- three children. [SIGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  And they learned the ways of the tribe.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, you know, they're all used to videos and TV and, you know --
R:  Oh, how cool.
L:  -- they just gave it up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  Hey, I would like to do that with my son sometimes.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A survivorship?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Take away the Gameboy and, um, just show him wh -- what it's like. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, well that sounds really interesting.  I'm sorry I missed that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't know if they consider -- like, um, you were saying you watched cable -- 'cause I watch a lot of, um, like, if there's nothing on I'll turn to, like, um, the ER programs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or the, um, you know, maternity ones.  And I mean, those are kind of reality based because they follow real people through real situations.
L:  Hm.  I don't have cable.
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  I did, but then my, ah, cab- -- ah, the TV broke down, so I just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- got rid of it.
R:  Oh, well [MN] 
L:  I couldn't see paying for the cable.
R:  It's so expensive -- it is --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I --
R:  -- expensive.
L:  -- just had basic.  I mean -- I don't know.  It -- it made me not do what I should be doing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was an addict.  I was -- that's how --
R:  That's a good --
L:  -- I turned into a -- I turned into a couch potato, and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- I don't wanna be that. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.  Oh, I know I have to find mys- -- I find myself, you know, not wanting to watch too many of them just for that reason, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  N- not wanting to take time away from other things that I need to be doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are more important.  
L:  I know.  It's so hard. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It is.
L:  So easy to sit there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yep.
L:  It's just [LAUGH] -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's why I told them, um, you know, to call me.  I missed the call at sev- -- ah, what time was I -- oh, eight. 
R:  Oh.
L:  It's eight o'clock on Thursday.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  'Cause I do have my aerobics at Valley College. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh neat.
L:  Oh, aqua aerobics.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I get back at seven thirty.
R:  Oh, it sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah, it is. And then, ah, the call at eight, I was already on the phone.  So, I had to --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- call this eight hundred number.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Did you just call the number?
R:  I called the number too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I figured that they'll call tomorrow night at my daughter's birthday party in --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- in the middle of it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, with my luck.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  It is interesting.  So, this is your first call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it was fun last night.
R:  What'd you do last night?
L:  We did, ah, what are the five -- out of these five problems that people may have, what do you think is the worst?
R:  Oh.
L:  Alcoholism, excessive smoking, too much caffeine, not exercising enough, overeating.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, we kind of just talked about all of 'em --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- you know.  
R:  That sounds neat.
L:  Yeah.  This is pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  So, do they let you know when you're finished?  Or do you just kind of have to --
L:  I guess --
R:  -- time it?
L:  -- after three calls.
R:  Ha.
L:  And they're supposed to, you know, send you a cheque --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- for thirty dollars.
R:  So --
L:  You --
R:  -- how'd 
L:  -- got it --
R:  -- you find --
L:  -- off the internet?
R:  Did you --
L:  Craig's List?
R:  I did too.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I found -- off on the internet on one of my contest sites, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Yeah, Craigslist dot com.  They have surveys in Portland --
R: Oh.
L:  -- Oregon too.
R:  Ha.  Craigslist dot com?
L:  Uh-huh.   And then you can go down to Portland, Oregon --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and look under et cetera jobs, and you'll find a bunch of surveys.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And your kids can do 'em too.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'll have to look --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that up.
L:  Yeah.  They have jobs -- medical -- there's all kinds of jobs, and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- apartments, and selling items, and cars, and --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'll look that up.
L:  A really neat website.
R:  Hm.
L:  And this study was on it, so --
R:  [LAUGH] That's cool.
L:  I guess they'll take our voices and mix 'em all up, and [LAUGH] --
R:  I guess so, and then get the opinions and everything.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  Ha.  That's kind of interesting.
L:  Yeah, it is -- it is.
R:  So, do they let us know when we're finished tonight?
L:  Yeah, they will.
R:  They do?
L:  Oh -- oh, that's what you meant.  Yes, they will.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'll say --
R:  Oh, that's okay.
L:  It's really eight minutes, but then they do the -- it tak- --
