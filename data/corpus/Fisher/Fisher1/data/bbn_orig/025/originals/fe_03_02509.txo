R:  Hi, my name is Mallory.
L:  Um, hi.  I'm Erin.
R:  So, do you watch reality shows?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I do.  I watch Joe Millionaire and, um, I watched Married by America [LAUGH], and right now I'm watching Mr. Personality.
R:  Cool.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  No, I haven't actually -- I don't think I've ever seen -- it's -- it's really terrible.  I've never seen a reality show.  Um.
L:  Never?
R:  No.  I -- I don't really watch TV all that much.  During the year I'm in s- -- in college so I'm like, um, I'm reading a lot of the time [LIPSMACK] so I don't -- I -- pe- -- I guess people in my -- in my dorm watch it -- watch, um, they've watched, like, Joe Millionaire.  They watched the finales and stuff.  But, um, mostly I -- I've read about it [LAUGH] I've read about 'em a lot but I ha- -- I just haven't really [LIPSMACK] watched, I don't know.  So you -- you can tell me about --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know, which ones have you liked the best or ...?
L:  Well, I don't have cable so I really don't watch --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that much TV either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just watch Fox.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I don't know, for some reason Married by America, I was just like, I can't believe, you know, that this is -- that the people are actually going to do this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it turned out, of course, that they weren't.  I mean, in the end --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no one actually got married.  But by that time I was kind of used to watching the Monday night slot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so then I started -- just started watching Mr. Personality because it was on at the same time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, Monica Lewinsky is the host of that.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah.  So I was kind of interested to see how that would turn out too.  But, really, she's, like, she's a better host than I would've [inaudible].  And, uh, [MN] like, um, on last week's show they were dismissing some of the guys and, uh, one of the guys tried to quit early because he knew he was going to be dismissed.
R:  Mm.
L:  And Monica totally gave him a smackdown.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's cool.
L:  It was like you know that you were going to get +kicked off anyway so don't think you can get away with it just like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was kind of fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  The one that I have, like, actually thought about watching is, um, [LIPSMACK] like, there's -- there's one on a food network which -- cause we -- we have -- we have, like, I don't know, somehow our -- we get cable even though we don't pay for it in my -- in my dorm.  We get, like, all the -- all the channels so on the food network they have, I don't know if you've heard about it.  They have this one called Date Plate and they, um, the people, like guys, there's this woman who the guys are trying to, um, impress and so they -- they cook her different meals, but I haven't [LIPSMACK] I haven't watched it.
L:  Does she get to see him before the -- or does she just pick them based --
R:  Um.
L:  -- on the meal?  
R:  I'm not sure.  I -- I haven't watched it, so I [LAUGH] don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know anymore, but there is this -- I read this ar- -- um, this thing, um, [MN] and supposedly -- oh no, I think this is the false one, I -- I just saw this -- it was like this stupid little quiz and it was like, "Which reality show is not in production right now?"  And one of the ones that I thought actually would be kind of interesting was, um, because I think that animals do know, is they had -- it -- it was like a show -- this is -- this is the one that -- that actually is not happening but, um, [MN] they said a show on Animal Planet where people choose, um -- people choose their dates by, like, their -- who their animal likes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or something which -- but you know, like, I don't know, animals have a sense about people so I didn't think it was that far fetched, but apparently it's not being done.  So ...
L:  Yeah, that is -- actually I think that's a good idea, too.  And I also think that, like, people who are like each other tend to have similar animals.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  So if I like large dogs but not, like, tiny cats I'll -- [MN] you know, someone else who also likes large dogs is going to be more like me.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Definitely. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they're -- you always -- they -- I mean, people are [MN] always getting together when they have dogs and, like, going to dog runs and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you ever watched, um, American Idol?  That's the one that, like ...
L:  I watched, like, one show of it but I don't know.  That's the -- probably the reality show that I like the least.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And -- although I did watch, uh, was it Popstars?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.  I guess it was already a year ago.  I tried to -- I watched it, like, twice but I couldn't really get into it.  I don't know.  I just -- watching them sing is a little bit boring.  I think.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, did you -- have you seen the new, like, reality movie?  The +Cancun?
L:  Oh, The New Cancun[?] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or Real Cancun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  I saw the previews at the movie theater --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- last week.  But I don't think I'd actually pay to see it.
R:  Yeah.  It's like -- I think, I guess I -- I heard that they're doing -- there was going to be like so many reality shows this summer but -- and they're just -- they're just really, um, going to be really sure.  I mean, I don't know.  You -- I guess, you like them so one of the questions like that we were supposed to talk about was why -- why do you think ...?
L:  Why do I like 'em?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you said -- you said kind of that, um, that it's like you can't believe that this is happening.
L:  Right.
R:  It's kind of like a fascination.
L:  Well --
R:  I can see that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, basically, I don't watch 'em too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I probably -- I watch like an hour a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  But one of the things that I like about it is that, like, I guess it's just [MN] I -- I don't like laugh tracks.
R:  Mm, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  So I'm not fond of sitcoms.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um --
R:  I can see that.
L:  I don't like how many times they cut to commercial.  There's something like -- it's like within the hour in these reality TV shows it's -- it's only like thirty minutes long [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --because of all the commercials.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do like, you know, I mean, i- i- it is unscripted and I realise that they edit it and they take out parts they don't like, but it is a little bit [MN] less predictable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than some TV.  You know, I read a, actually I think it was even in Newsweek, that they're developing a reality TV channel.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like it's going to be all reality TV shows.
R:  Yeah, I think I saw that too.  That's -- I mean, wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- that's too much, in my opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could not stand it.  I mean, if you're watching all reality TV all day, why don't you just, like, live your life.
R:  Right.
L:  Because that's --
R:  [LAUGH]  Really.
L:  -- reality too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Um.  I was going to say, like, um, oh, did you ever watch, like, Real World.  I [MN] -- that's -- that I guess, and that's even less reality, but that was kind of the first one that they ever did.  I watched some of, like, Real World and Road Rules.
L:  I used to watch Road Rules. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, just like I -- one time I rented this apartment where the landlady had cable and, uh, [LAUGH] I used to watch Road Rules like that.  And I -- I did like -- I liked the challenges.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where they made 'em go do stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I used to get really annoyed at, like, the snotty -- you know they would do these like, um, interviews with everybody.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and it was -- it was so petty and, like, so catty.  Sometimes it was funny but it would be like, you know, they'd have, you know, "Melissa always does this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just -- I was so annoyed today when Melissa did that thing she always does".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, those -- I -- I -- like I said, I did -- I -- I had [MN] really almost forgotten that I used to watch those sometimes.  Like they -- like on -- on MTV they would have marathons, so I'd, like, sit down and -- but that was before, I guess, I don't watch TV all that much now.  But, um, I don't know.  It's, um -- and I was -- I thought some of the -- some of the game shows that looked kind of interesting that I didn't -- like The Amazing Race.  Except that they've really, like, bombed.  It seems like.
L:  I kind of wa- -- I kind of like Fear Factor.
R:  I haven't seen that.  Is that --
L:  That's kind of a game show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, basically you have -- you know, you have a group of people and they each have to do the stunts.  And, you know, whoever doesn't do the stunt doesn't [MN] get to go on to the next round.
R:  Right.
L:  And they do it, or whatever, until there's one person left and then that person gets the money.  I think it's fifty thousand dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's kind of -- sometimes they have them do stuff that is really -- looks really scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- so I'll like -- like sometimes if I'm surfing through and I see it on I'll be, like, watching it, but I don't even know what time slot it has exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Did you watch Survivor?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah, I didn't either and I -- it's kind of one of the reasons, which is sort of perverse, but I feel like, I don't know, it's -- it's -- it's sort of pop culture that I'm not in on those, um, like when people are talking about, you know, Survivor -- the people who actually go on after Survivor is over and, you know, people who either get commercial spots, I sit and like, "Who is that?"
L:  Exactly.
R:  I feel kind of out of tune 'cause it's such a water cooler subject now and really --.
L:  Well, I guess I'm not just -- not just good at recognizing celebrities either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it took me a while to realise, like, I guess the -- some of the women that were on Joe Millionaire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are like pitching different kinds of products and stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- now.  Yeah, like one of 'em was on a KFC commercial with, uh, George Kostanza from Seinfield.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, like, I was like, "Huh, she looks kind of familiar" but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [MN] I even used to watch the show --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I guess you could say her fifteen minutes of fame are over.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um [NOISE] did -- 'cause I --I heard that, like [MN] he -- the Joe Millionaire guy and whoever he picked, or whoever picked -- whoever made -- he got together with, they, um, they either broke up -- they broke up didn't they?  Or do you know?
L:  Um, I don't think they ever actually dated.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, uh, her name was Zora.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. Yeah.  That's it.
L:  And, um, you know, they made -- uh, they created a Zora day in her town.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like her hometown.  [LAUGH]  I guess she's the most famous person who ever came from there.  Um, but, you know, basically, they -- they both got the money and there wasn't any contingent on them staying together. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so I don't think they did.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't seen 'em in even any pictures since then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Joe Millionaire's actually from around here.
R:  Is he?
L:  He's from Richmond, I think.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  He's actually -- he was playing in, um, not playing, but I guess just showing up in a -- in a club the other day.  What is it?  Um, [LIPSMACK]  Is it [MN], um, oh, never mind I can't remember the name of the club.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  But -- oh, the one thing about, uh, Mr. Personality that I thought was kind of cool is, uh, the first thing that the mean character did, Hayley, the woman who's supposed to be searching for, um, searching for her soul mate [LAUGH] between the guys who are all wearing masks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is she had 'em all give her a gift.  And, uh, it was really interesting to see what sort of gifts these guys picked out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And some of 'em were just so ridiculous.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like [LAUGH] one of the guys actually brought her a book called A Hundred Bes- --A Hundred of the Best Sports Jokes.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  And one of 'em gave her, like, a porcelain frog.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And one of 'em gave her -- this is was
