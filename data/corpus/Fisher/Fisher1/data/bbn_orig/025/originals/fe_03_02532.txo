L:  You wanna talk?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Angela.
R:  My name is Shannon. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about reality TV?
R:  Yeah.  Do you watch them? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, yeah.  Um, right now I watch, um -- um, do you know the shows Sorority Life and Fraternity Life?
R:  What?
L:  They're on MTV.  They're li- --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- about, like -- there are those, and then, um, The Bachelor.  I watched The Bachelor last night.
R:  Oh, okay.  Actually, I -- I haven't, um -- I actually am not into any -- well, no actually I was watching -- I did watch that, ah, one where the guys wear blindfolds, but I didn't see it this week.
L:  Oh, I didn't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- see that at all.
R:  Mr Personality. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, Mr Personality?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't even know that one was on.  Yeah.  But I saw the commercials for it, and they supposed to be, like, really, really ugly and when they take off their masks --
R:  No -- no.  Some of them are ugly and some of them are cute.  And she -- she doesn't know which are which.  Like, she's supposed to base it on, you know, her judgements of them on their personality.  And Monica Lewinsky hosts it. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my g- -- I'm gonna start watching it.  What -- what channel's it on?
R:  You know, I don't know 'cause I only saw the first one.  It -- they've only had -- I think they've only shown it twice so far.  And that -- I didn't catch the second one.  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  But, the commercial for the second one was pretty funny 'cause one g- -- like, you know, they're not supposed to take their masks off.  And one guy is like, "I can't take this any more", and he goes to take his mask off.
L:  [MN]
R:  You hear the other guy, like, "Don't!"  You know? [LAUGH] It's, like, oh my God, these people are so cheesy.  But, um, that's the only --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Oh, and then I saw -- you kind of might be interested in this one, but actually PBS now have reality shows, believe it not.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  And there's this one called Manor House, which is, um -- it -- it was done in England.  And they had these people living, like, as if they're in Edwardian England.  And it's the -- like, a family, and --
L:  Oh, I heard --
R:  -- their servants --
L:  -- about that.
R:  -- and stuff.  It's actually really good.  Like, it's really --
L:  Really?
R:  -- interesting, and there's scandal. [LAUGH]  Like when -- like when the scullery maid and the -- the footman are a having an affair. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  And [MN] they could get kicked out for it.  And --
L:  I get addicted to those soap -- you -- like -- like, my fiends and I watched the Fraternity Life and Sorority Life every single week.  Like, I won't even talk to my boyfriend on the phone.  I'll be, like, "Um, you're calling me between ten and eleven, and I need to call you back later".  Like, I can't talk -- it's so -- and then we'll talk about them.  We'll be, like, "Can you believe that Nicole did this with Tim?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I --
R:  Like it's --
L:  -- love them.
R:  -- a soap opera.
L:  I love them.
R:  Well, that's how I was with the first American Idol.  I don't watch the second one.  I watched, like, the first few episodes and then they +kicked -- kicked the one woman that was good off.  But, that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- woman -- that she was supposedly on a child porn site, but it wasn't really -- it wasn't child porn when she was on it.  It was just, like, soft porn and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
L:  Oh.
R:  She [LAUGH] -- but, she --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- was, like, the one person that had an awesome voice.  And then --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I was, like, "Well, they kicked her off, so there's no reason to watch it".  So then, I don't watch that anymore.  But the first one I watched.  But --
L:  Actually, we were gonna be on a reality TV sh- -- TV show.
R:  Get outta here. [LAUGH]  Which one? 
L:  Do you remember -- do you -- have you heard of that one, um, My Life Is A Sitcom, or something like that?
R:  Oh yeah -- yeah.  Did that one --
L:  My --
R:  -- ever come to fruition though?  'Cause I remember seeing the commercials for it -- like, that they were looking for people, but they -- has that show been on yet?
L:  Yeah.  It's on -- it's on ABC or something.  But they called us and they were, like, "Um, we're interested, make a videotape".  And I mean, we made videotape and we watched it, and we were, like, "Oh, there's no way we can watch ourselves on TV.  Like, there's no way we can do it".  So, we never even sent the tape in.  But it was really funny, like, when we thought we were gonna do it.
R:  So, wait.  What do you mean?  You applied first, like, in writing --
L:  Well, no.
R:  -- and they asked for a videotape?
L:  Like, we just -- we just called and we were, like, "Yeah -- it -- it's supposed to be a family".  We're, like, "Yeah, it's supposed to be a family".  But, like, we're all friends and we all live together.  Like --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- there' so much drama because, like, we live in a dorm.  So, we're, like, "We could definitely do it.  Like, we have way more drama than any of these TV shows".  And they were, like, "Yeah.  Send us in a tape -- send us in a tape".  And then, she's like, "Is there any way you can get it to us within, like, the next week, 'cause, like, we really wanna do it?"  And I was, like, "Yeah, we can do that".  And then, like, we made it and we watched it, and we were, li- like, "Oh, no".
R:  Like, no way. [LAUGH] 
L:  There's no way I could watch myself on TV.  But, like, seriously The Bachelor -- did you watch The Bachelor and The Bachelorette?
R:  No.  I -- I watched Joe Millionaire, but, like I never --
L:  Joe --
R:  -- watched The --
L:  Millionaire? 
R:  -- Bachelor or The --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- Bachelorette.
L:  -- watched that one too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my God, it's embarassing. [LAUGH] Like [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.  Seriously, I'll put my life on hold and I'll be, like, "Um, mm -- mm".  I -- I won't talk to people I know because these shows are on TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Or, if you know someone else that watches it, you could call them and watch it together on the phone.  And that's when it's -- when you're, like, "Okay, I'm really pathetic".
L:  It's so true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We'll all get together -- like, we'll all get together.  We'll have stuff we have to do, and I'll be, like, "Oh, um, are you gonna come over and watch, um, you know, Real World?" or whatever.  And it's, like, "Yeah, uh-huh".  And, like, we'll stop whatever we're doing and come and -- and watch it.  And then, like, immediately when it's over go -- leave. 
R:  Well, Real World is, like, the original, isn't it?  When you think about it --
L:  Oh ye- -- oh yeah.  I --
R:  -- that's been on forever.
L:  And I've been watching that one every year.  It's so sad.
R:  That's been on since, like -- I mean, I -- y- you're young I guess if you're in college, right?
L:  I'm twenty one, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm thirty three.  And that's been on, like, since I was, like, twenty three.  So, it's been on, like --like, ten years.  So, I remember -- actually back then I had a friend --
L:  You know what?
R:  -- who was, like, a semi finalist or something for, like, one of the original Real Worlds.  And she had some -- ah, she, like, blew her chance.  She, like, had partied too much the night before she was supposed to go or something, and she didn't wake up or something like that.
L:  [SIGH] You know what?
R:  And, ah, I -- I just remember, like, that because that was so long ago.  And that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was -- that was literally, like, ten years ago.
L:  It's go great.  I love it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, I love -- I love reality TV.  I don't even watch, like, the regular sitcoms any more.  Like, I -- I maybe watch, like, Will and Grace, but that's it.
R:  I was just gonna say Will -- Will and Grace 'cause that's on now.  Um, [LIPSMACK] no.  But -- but you don't have to feel guilty if you watch the one on PBS because it's, like, educational too. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think I saw a Simpsons that was about that one, where, like, they had to go live in the wilderness and everything like that, and it was really --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- funny.
R:  Yeah, I saw it.  And there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also -- but I didn't see this, there was also one done in America, like, about people living on the homestead.  They had, like, three families and --
L:  Yeah -- no.  It was the one that was -- The Simpsons was making fun of -- is that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, the homestead one.
R:  But, my friend was telling me she saw it and that it -- it was, like, the two -- two of the families got really mad at one of the other families 'cause they like -- they cheated.  They found, like, a box spring or something.  'Cause, you know, everything's supposed to be authentic [NOISE], like, you know, in the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- western days and blah, blah, blah.  And they found a box spring and they were, like sleeping comfortably [LAUGH] when everyone else was, like, sleeping on the ground -- on rocks and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And they -- there was, like, all this drama because they were, like -- you know, they were cheating.
L:  Right.  That's so funny.
R:  But --
L:  I love it -- like, I love it.  And they keep coming out with more.  But, some of 'em, like that -- that Mr Personality -- like, some of them are getting kind of, like, far fetched.  I'm, like, "All right.  Are you really serious about that?"  But, I don't know.  Like, J- -- I really liked Joe Millionaire.  Like, I watched that one and stuff, but --
R:  Yeah, but then I heard something like they were gonna have a Joe Millionaire Two -- and how?  Like, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those women are dumb, but come on. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] Even dumb women can figure it out once it's been on TV.
L:  I'd be so skeptical too, like -- yeah, I know.  I think that -- I don't think that one'll work out.
R:  No.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I don't think so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, is this, like -- have you done these phone calls before?
R:  No.  You know, I was -- they -- they had called yesterday, like, for me to do one, and then there was no one on the other side.
L:  Oh.  This is my first --
R:  So --
L:  -- one too.
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- I -- I didn't really know what to expect.  I -- I was, like, "Okay, this thing probably doesn't work.  There's probably not gonna be anyone on the other side, again". [LAUGH]  But, um --
L:  See, I feel I don't know how it works either.  Like, my friend -- my friend's one too right now.
R:  Oh, really?  But it was a different topic, so I guess it's -- they're -- it's all different topics.  And I don't know -- I don't -- do you know what they're studying?
L:  Um, it's some linguistics -- like, I guess how people talk to each other, um, about --
R:  I wonder if -- if -- if -- if they're, like, studying, like, if people get off the topic and stuff [LAUGH] like --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- we're doing now. Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- or if it's --
L:  Well, you're --
R:  -- just --
L:  -- only supposed to talk for ten minutes and -- hold on [NOISE] -- oh yeah, we haven't been talking for -- I [NOISE] -- see, I thought we had been talking for ten minutes, but we --
R:  How long has it been?
L:  [NOISE] it's -- my phone says, like, nine minutes and fifty seconds.  But, I also, like -- so -- it -- we've probably been talking for nine minutes.  And it says it will let us know when it's been ten minutes.
R:  Did you call the thing, or did they call you?
L:  Well, they called me earlier and I didn't know what was [NOISE] -- like, I -- I didn't know what was going on 'cause I've never done it before.  We just signed up for it today.  And, um, so then I -- I called the number. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it -- and it's say you can only do 'em three times, so we're gonna, like, ask if it's just three times a day, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like --
R:  I think it's three times per person, period.
L:  Period?
R:  Which -- yeah, I think so.  But, I mean, shit, it's, like, the -- the -- probably the easiest thirty bucks you'll ever make.
L:  Oh, I'm sure it is.  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wanna do it three times a da- -- I would -- I would seriously --
R:  I would do it as my job.  I'm unemployed.  Man, I -- I would sit here and do it all day [LAUGH] if -- if you could --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- do it unlimited.  No.  But I don't think you can.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think they mean three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- times, like, total.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Total --
L:  I'm gonna -- I gonna --
R:  -- time.
L:  -- ask them about that.  Well, okay, so I guess we should keep ta- talking 'cause it'll tell us --
R:  Until they --
L:  -- when we're --
R:  -- tell us --
L:  -- done.
R:  -- not to any more.  Um --
L:  Huh?
R:  Are we supposed to talk more about reality TV?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Prob- --
R:  See, but -- are there -- the other question that -- that the other person was on the other end was, um, what's -- it was, like, what's worse, gossip, smoking, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What were the other choices?  It was, like, random things, like gossip, smoking, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and a few other things.  I don't -- now I don't r- --
