R:  Hey there.
L:  So -- hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Carrie.
R:  Hi.  Ah, my name is Shreni[?]. [NOISE] 
L:  All right.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  Yeah? [NOISE]  The topic --
L:  I --
R:  -- of the day is, ah -- I think they wanted to see whether -- do we she- -- do we see any reality shows?
L:  Yes, I love reality TV.
R:  Yeah?  You watch a lot of reality TV?
L:  Um, yeah.  Not as much as I used to, but yeah, I would say that I do.  How 'bout you?
R:  Yeah.  I watch, ah, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, but, ah, um, not -- but, I also have watched some Sur- -- episodes of, ah, Survivor.
L:  Survivor, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.   Ah, so what's your experience?  Ah, do you like these things?  
L:  Well, let's see.  I watch, um, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, The Bachelor again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and now I'm watching The Bachelor now.  And I also have watched several, um, ser- -- several seasons of Survivor, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm not watching it this time.
R:  Okay.
L:  Big Brother, I watch.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  American Idol, I watch.  I watched Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.  I thought that was stupid --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- but I watched it.  I couldn't stop watching it.
R:  Ah, and you enjoy watching it?
L:  I love it.  It's great.
R:  Oh, okay.  It's great?  You like it?
L:  Yeah, I do like it.  I'm trying to figure out why though, 'cause that was one of the questions.
R:  And -- and do you like it because -- is it because, ah -- is it -- it's live, it's not edited?  Maybe that's the reason.
L:  [NOISE] Maybe.  I think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] I know that I don't like it if -- if I don't get to know the characters.  Like, right now if I were to flip on Survivor --
R:  Uh-huh.   
L:  -- 'cause I haven't watched it all season, if I were to, you know, watch an episode --
R:  Same as me.
L:  -- I wouldn't like it, because I haven't seen it all season.
R:  Yeah.  Actually --
L:  'Cause you don't know the characters.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I understand that.  Yeah.  Even I -- I -- I wa- kee- -- used to watch Survivor episodes.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um, but, ah, [LAUGH] of late I have, um, h- become bored with these things.
L:  You're bored now with it?
R:  Yeah.  So, I [LAUGH] -- I usually -- well, now that it's the sports season, I've heard.  The baseball has started and you have NBA games happening.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I s- --
L:  You'd rather watch that?
R:  Ah, yeah.  I get more -- I think that's more reality show than the reality shows, like, Who --
L:  Well, yeah -- yeah, I see how you can think that.  I guess my husband probably feels that way too.
R:  I think it happens in every family.  The wife wants to watch maybe a show or a serial or an episode, and then m- [LAUGH] -- the guy wants to watch NBA or baseball or --
L:  Yeah, that's probably true.  I think the women are probably a little more into than the men.
R:  Okay.
L:  Although, my husband -- sometimes I think he says he doesn't like it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I think there are times when, you know, even though you might not like it you just can't tear yourself away.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Sometimes you have to give up.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You have to just maybe give up something for -- to get something else.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.
L:  Have you ever seen Big Brother?
R:  Big Brother?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, not yet.  Do you see it?
L:  Well, it's -- um, I've seen it the last two summers that it was on.
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  And so, you know, it'll probably be on again this summer.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's really not very good, but I have to say I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- watch it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  That's true -- that's true. [NOISE]  So, this -- is this the first time you are participating in this study?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Is this the first time you're calling in?
L:  Um, I've done one other call.
R:  Okay.  Actually I also have done yesterday one, so this is my second call.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Yeah.  Yesterday there was something on what's a very bad personal habit.  Did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get the same topic?
L:  Yeah, I did.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, that's what they've been   So --
L:  I was kind of worried that the topics would be something that I didn't know anything about, but hey, I know about reality TV.
R:  Yeah.  Reality TV's something which we keep [LAUGH] seeing all the time. It's, ah, not some --
L:  Do you think it's gonna go away?  I keep hearing people say that it's gonna -- it's on its way out and people aren't gonna watch it any more after a while.  What do you think?
R:  Um, I think, ah, it won't go away, but the format of that will change.  For example, now you want -- now you have Bachelor and things, but in the future it might be something else.
L:  Well, that's true.  They keep coming up with all different --
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  -- kinds of ideas.
R:   -- it will -- it will come in a different -- a different flavor.  That's it.  Ah, people are going to watch maybe something like Who Wants To Become A Billionaire then [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah?  Really?  
R:  -- instead of -- instead of a millionaire -- that time million won't have any value, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we'll have a billionaire thing.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And also, I think these shows will become more prominent because people have more time to spend nowadays.
L:  You think so?  You think people have more time?
R:  Ah -- at least because technology has progressed.  You have a lot of things happening.  Um -- um, but as you said, ah, people have a lot of time, but they also have a lot of other things to do.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  They have a lot of things to do in their lives.  So, that's true.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, maybe, hm, I --
L:  You know, I -- I think that sitcoms -- do you like sitcoms?
R:  Yes.  I watch some of them, yeah.
L:  See, I don't -- I don't like 'em.  [MN] I can't think of any that I really like, except maybe Friends.
R:  Friends?   I like Friends, yeah.
L:  And -- and I think that, in my opinion, because they're not very good any more it's -- it's just hard to find any of them that are funny, in my opinion, and that's maybe why people watch --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- reality --
R:  -- watch --
L:  -- TV.
R:  --Seinfeld?
L:  Seinfeld?  I -- yeah.  I mean. I like that, yeah.  I used to watch that when it was on.
R:  Yeah.  It's, like, again, ah -- ah, I live on the east coast so I don't have much time to actually spend because I come really late to my home.
L:  You what?
R:  I live in the east coast.
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.  
R:  So, I'm -- I'm hardly in at --
L:  Oh, so you can really relate.  Okay.
R:  Ah?  +Really +relate? 
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Ah, I live in the Big Apple, so I don't have much time to spend because I have to commute for maybe more than an hour every day.  I come back really late.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I don't --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- have much --
L:  Really?  You have to commute?  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  So, I live in the -- so -- New York City's so huge.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- to move from one side of the city to the other side -- it takes a lot of time, so.
L:  Yeah, that's -- well, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would cut into your TV time.
R:  Yes, definitely.
L:  So, is that just -- I mean, I guess that's just the way of life for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you there.
R:  It's w- --
L:  You're just used to it.
R:  Yeah, the life here is really hectic. [PAUSE] [MN]
L:  Hm.
R:  It happens.
L:  Is it, ah, more than an hour commute one way, or just both ways?
R:  Both ways. Yeah.
L:  Both ways?  Okay.  Well, that's not that bad, I guess. [NOISE] 
R:  Huh?
L:  Right?  I mean, that's -- so it's over two hours commute, total?
R:  Ah, two and a half hours actually.
L:  Two and a half?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that's a lot of time.
L:  That's not that bad really.
R:  That's a lot of time.
L:  It is a lot of time.
R:  And there are people who travel for four hours a day, so I'm much better.
L:  Gosh.  That is unbelievable.
R:  Oh yeah.  People actually -- some people travel from Philadelphia --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to New York City every day.  So, that --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they actually travel through New Jersey to come to New York City.  So, it takes two hours each way for them.
L:  That is unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who has that kind of time?
R:  Ha.  I don't.  There are people who actually does it because they like the lifestyle in Philly.  So -- because they have good apartments, the education system is good.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So, they -- what they do is -- they don't mind commuting over time for three or four hours a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that's the thing.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, are you watching -- I guess you're probably not watching the one out now called Mr Personality.
R:  Yeah, I'm actually -- he loads[?] in my computer as we speak.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I have a DSL connection, so --
L:  All right.
R:  -- I can do both at the same [several inaudible words].
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, don't watch it, it's not any good.
R:  Yeah?  You're watching it?
L:  Well, no.  I know it comes on Monday nights, but it's -- if you ever see it, don't watch it.
R:  Okay.  It's a good one?
L:  No, it's not good.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's dumb.
R:  So, what's the serial you recommend[?] to me?  Maybe a sitcom or a reality --
L:  What would I recommend?  I would -- I would recommend The Bachelor, but now you're kind of getting in on the end of it.  I would recommend The Bachelorette next time it comes out.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  You should watch it from the beginning.
R:  Yeah, it's a good thing to watch, right?
L:  Well, it's -- it's entertaining.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and I think that you should watch -- what else do I watch?  I guess -- have you ever seen a whole series of Survivor?
R:  Not, ah --
L:  Like, the whole --
R:  Not completely.
L:  -- season, I mean.
R:  I -- I watched -- I have watched it, but, ah, usually in bits and pieces.  I miss a couple of episodes --
L:  See --  
R:  -- and --
L: -- if you -- if you --
R:  -- then watch again.
L:  -- don't watch it from beginning to end it's -- it's not good.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  You gotta start from the very beginning and you gotta watch all the episodes.
R:  Okay.   Then I'll really get the flow?
L:  Yes, then you'll really get it.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  O- otherwise it's not -- it's just not as good, at all.
R:  Okay -- okay.
L:  That's the secret to reality TV, in my opinion.
R:  Ha.  Okay.  So, the secret to reality TV is to get the context in full?  You have to watch it completely?
L:  Completely.  From the beginning --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- from the first episode --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to the end.  'Cause if you miss the first episode --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- I think you're probably gonna have less of a chance at -- to be interested in it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Part season.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know?
R:  Okay.  I got it.  Maybe all that [several inaudible words] --
L:  So, that's like --
R:  -- you should watch the replay or something.
L:  Yeah, watch the replay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they show it.  Sometimes they will show --
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- them over again that week, so --
R:  Or, maybe sometimes they'll -- something over the web TV.  You can watch it over the computer.
L:  Oh, really?  Okay.  Well then, yeah.
R:  In New York City that happens a lot of times.
L:  Really?
R:  And also there are people -- there is a website here, so in case -- if you miss an -- particular episode, they -- you actually -- you actually can put in a request for someone who has actually recorded that program.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  So, you can just go get it from them, watch it -- maybe pay them a couple of bucks -- that kind of thing.   
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's definitely what you would have to do to stay interested in it.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that's good.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think [MN] all things about[?] reality TV -- I think --
L:  You think what?
R:  I was -- I was thinking about something about reality TV, something which we can talk about, so -- seems to me that we have run out of ideas now.
L:  Yeah.  I like that topic.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Are they gonna -- I hope they don't play these tapes --
R:  Ha.
L:  -- on TV or something. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] Do you think so?
L:  I sure would feel stupid. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think they can't do it, right?  You haven't given your consent to do -- do that.
L:  Right.  I wouldn't think that they would.
R:  I hope they're --
