R:  Hi.  My name is Jennifer.
L:  Yes, my name is Raymond, and I'm from Maryland.
R:  I'm from Los Angeles, um --
L:  Oh, LA?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah.  I know you love the Lakers now, hey?
R:  That's right.  I don't know, how did -- did you know how they did last night?
L:  Yeah, they won.
R:  Okay, good.  Well, we shouldn't talk about that.
L:  Okay, that's sweet.
R:  Okay.  So, the, um -- do you wanna go first?
L:  No, you go ah- -- 'bout -- 'bout this war that -- that -- since I'm a veteran, so I'll let you have the first shot at it.
R:  Oh, I'm a veteran too.
L:  Oh, you are --
R:  That's --
L:  -- too?
R:  -- great.  Yeah, which probably taints us a little bit.  But, that's okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think in a good way. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I'm -- were you in a war, or just a veteran from the service?
L:  No, I've retired after twenty two years.
R:  Okay.  Which service?
L:  Oh, Army.
R:  Okay.  I was in the Army too.  I think that, um, disarming really sh- -- is a, um, priority.  I mean, I think it should be a priority for, um -- for the United States, especially -- and I think -- I think the money that -- that -- like, all the money that they found really kind of confirms that there was, you know, some -- some stuff going on.  And, you know, I just think that -- I just really think that Saddam is, you know, pretty crazy [LAUGH] and I think that he needs --
L:  And wh- -- I -- I agree.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I agree with the mi- -- the US pol- -- and it should -- wh- -- should be the world policy for all dictator type government.  They should have got him right there a long -- we should have got him -- I was over in the Gulf -- we should have got him at the -- in the Gulf War.
R:  Long time ago.
L:  We should've got him right there, because he been killing people left and right.
R:  That's right.
L:  He don't have no kind of remorse.  He -- if he kills his own son in law, then th- -- what did they -- you know, he don't care about else if he kills his own family.
R:  That's right -- that's right.  Exactly.
L:  And then, you know, he's a -- he's from the country of Iraq and everything, but yet he split the country up [PAUSE] -- as far as factions are concerned.  You had the Kurds, then you had -- and the Kurd and you had all -- all the other factions.  So, basically they against -- all of them against -- he was fighting all of them --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- in his own country.
R:  Yep.  
L:  And --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- you know, if you wasn't part of the ruling party, or you wouldn't -- you didn't fit in, and if you spoke out against his rece- regime, it was -- if he -- if you wound up dead the next day, who gonna say anything?
R:  That's right.  Exactly.  Yeah, I think there was a lot of, um -- I think there was just a lot of propaganda.  And I think there was-- I -- I -- I think that we didn't get to see a lot of the stuff that was really going on, you know.
L:  Yeah, but, you know, if we -- I wish we had got US -- I mean, UN sanction to go over there and do this thing, because we -- and as far as the world concerned we look like -- almost like invaders, almost.  Everybody -- 
R:  Inva- --
L:  A lot of countries started coming on board once we got in there.  A lot of other sort of countries started coming on board to support.  But, that's only after we got -- and -- and one thing --
R:  Wait, do you --
L:  -- else I don't --
R:  -- know -- do you know --
L:  -- like, believe --
R:  -- which -- are you saying, like, right now?  Like, with the situation right now?
L:  Say again.
R:  Are you -- are you asking, like, the situation right now?  Or -- I mean, not asking -- are you saying that people are coming on board now --
L:  No.  I mean, once the war -- once we had -- once Britain and -- the US and Britain had led the forces in there to get him out of power and topple his +regime --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of other countries -- "Oh yeah, that's a good idea then, and we -- we support you in it".  But before that everybody -- "No, we don't do it.  We should take another vote on it", and everybody was against it.  And then when -- what -- the actual conflict started --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- a lot of people started supporting it.
R:  Do you remember -- do you know who?
L:  I know France was one of those.  And then Fra- -- and --
R:  Well, I know that France wasn't supporting, but have they come on board now?
L:  Well, they -- they more in line with what took place now.  And the Germans and that.  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, like, one thing -- they wanna go in, like, right now.  And, you know, there's a lot of money to be made because they gotta rebuild the country.  They gotta --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get the --
R:  All the oil.
L:  -- oil wells and everything -- got to get all that stuff up and running.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Doing, ah, reconstruction, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I understood there was over seven hundred and something million dollars -- or a billion dollars worth of -- of companies that go in there and -- and -- gonna go in there after the war to do the rebuilding and the reconstruction of the area.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  And, you know, [PAUSE] United States and Britain, they led the -- led the, ah, fight in there.  And now a lot of other countries wanna go in there and partake of all the -- as they say, the spoils of war.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's [LAUGH] -- I think it's kind of funny that that happens.  But, they said that that would -- I mean, that something the people predicted too, is that they would go in -- you know, that once -- once they found out -- or, once they defeated them then -- or defeated the regime that, um --
L:  Yeah.  Because they would never that was -- that was gonna happen then.
R:  Right.
L:  Because we knew that was gonna happen, even if United States had to lead it by +themselves.
R:  Mhm.  Well, we did have Britain's support, thank --
L:  Yeah, that--
R:  -- thank goodness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm pretty thankful for that.  Now, do you think that, um -- that, um, it's important for the reg- -- or, do you think that's important that there is a regime change?
L:  I think that re- -- there's a -- there's a -- a big imp- -- big important reason that they should have a regime change, because at -- at everywhere -- all -- like, when the Soviet Union fell, all these countries that was under the Soviet block, they started -- wanted -- break away, and they wanted their own freedom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just like Iraq -- the in people in Iraq, they want freedom.  They were under Saddam's thumb for so long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they didn't know -- they could say +nothing, they could do +nothing that he didn't like.  Now, they want their own freedom, but I think it gonna -- it gonna be a -- a disaster just like the Soviet Union, because you got the Kurds, and then you got the other people, ah -- the o- -- the Kurds in the north and, um, ah -- I forgot the ones in the south.  But, you know, each one of them wants to rule their own part of the country.  So, it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gonna be a turmoil in there.
R:  Mhm -- mhm.  Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's right.
L:  But, there's one thing I -- I'd like the -- this country said, you know, we used to go in somewhere and we'd set up a government, so -- but, we -- they said they want -- the Iraqis -- they, ah -- to rule theirselves.  Yeah, we could help them set up the government, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no, we not gonna tell you who to -- who --
R:  To --
L:  -- who --
R:  -- put in place?
L:  -- to put in place.
R:  Right.
L:  And who gonna d- -- you know, this is your country, you rule it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, we do not want to --
R:  Well, it's like Kuwait.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, you know, after liberating Kuwait.  I mean, the same thing happened, right?  I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, if you look at the country now it's, you know, flourishing.  And -- and they're being run by people -- I mean, they're not oppressed, and they're being run by -- you know -- US friendly, but at the same time they're, you know, I guess, Kuwaiti picked, right?
L:  Right.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's --
R:  So --
L:  -- one thing I -- I -- you know, there's a lot of -- I think we should -- yeah, we should keep some type of force there so we can drown any type of +resurgence -- resurgent activity that might pop up.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, you know, we should get as many people out of -- out of that country as fast as possible, because there's a lot of anti American sentiment in that country.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  There's a lot of -- although they love what we did, we -- we toppled a reg- regime.
R:  Mm.
L:  A lot of 'em, they don't like American because America --
R:  Well, they've heard --
L:  -- is always --
R:  -- about it.
L:  -- perceived as the country with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the power, with all the money, and then, and --
R:  Well, they've taught them.  It's in the education system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Different things about, you know, the Americans, so, you know, that makes -- that totally makes sense.  But, I think that, you know, once there -- there's, like, a change over then they'll get a different perspective on the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, like, the -- most of the -- most of the Muslim countries -- I mean, over there, they still as if in the seventeenth -- eighteenth century, where women, like, don't have any rights and they have to walk around. [MN]  And I think they need to put a government in there which is gonna be more supportive of human rights.  All -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not -- not only men, but all -- all people.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's why you think it's, ah, important, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you think -- is -- is that, like, the major reason --
L:  Say again.
R:  -- that we get involved in Iraq?
L:  No, I don't think -- I think -- I think the reason we got involved in Iraq -- because -- well, I got some personal reason, but I -- that's not -- that's my opinion. But, I think we were got in there because of the atrocities that Saddam would -- was committing against his own people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And also because he supported terrorism.  The -- well, we always know that Iraq supports terrorism outside of its own borders.  And I think that's one of the reason, because we're trying to hit all the terrorist bases, like -- even with -- looking at Syria, because Syria supports terrorism.
R:  Right.
L:  I think --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- since --
R:  I agree --
L:  -- nine --
R:  -- with you.
L:  -- eleven -- I think we trying to topple all the countries that support terrorism.
R:  Mhm.  And you think that's a good idea, right?
L:  I think it'd get a -- well, I -- I think it's -- yes and no.  I think it's a good cut -- it's a good concept.  That's what I think.
R:  Right.
L:  But, it's a idea -- you know, all ideas is good when -- when put on paper, but --
R:  Ideally.
L:  -- the reality is it -- by you going out there, hitting at them, they gonna bring the war closer to you, if they -- if they want to think about you as a terrorist targets.  And now they just say, "Oh, they come in our area now.  Now, we gotta go to LA to get them".
R:  Mhm.  Yeah -- yeah, I kind of see what you're saying.  But, I think -- I think that, even though, um -- I think that if you break it down becau- [MN] -- it would be really hard to break down just the United States, and just kind of take out the whole United States, and so they have to resort to kind of terrorist activity.
L:  Yeah -- no, they're not gonna take -- they're not -- they can only hit sections of the United States.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, but th- the concept of millions of people -- like the World Trade Center, when all those innocent people, that never had -- they probably never even seen the country -- even heard about the --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- the conflict.  They just -- somebody flew -- I don't -- ah, they said Bin Laden supported that, um, but, you know, they didn't ever show us the evidence.  They said they got evidence, and -- um, but, you know, we -- as Americans, we got the right to know who did it.  But --
