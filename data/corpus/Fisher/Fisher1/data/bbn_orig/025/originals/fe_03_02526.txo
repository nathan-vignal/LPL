L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, my name is Patricia.
R:  This is Leah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so what shows do you like to watch?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I like to say I don't watch [LAUGH] them, but when I do catch some it, um, [LIPSMACK] I get caught in a little bit.  Like I've watched, um, Real World and I think I watched part of the ending of Joe Millionaire.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  I watched --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  -- a little bit of Joe Millionaire, a couple of times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That looks --
R:  What did you think?
L:  That looks pretty good.  Um, I've often watched Fear Factor but, um --
R:  I've never seen that.  Is that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the one with celebrities?
L:  Well, no.  I mean, there has [MN] -- they have had celebrities, actors, once in a while but it's regular people and -- but they do really disgusting [LAUGH] things.  They'll have 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  It's -- it can be gross but it's, I don't know, for some reason I just, like, want to watch it but they'll have, like, um, +eating -- they'll be like eating bugs and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there was one that they had, um, take a whole bunch of bugs and, um, they just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was -- just all these different insects and they mixed them in a blender and they had to drink it [LAUGH] and everything, you know.  It's gross.  But ...
R:  Mm.
L:  And they have to do like stunts and stuff.
R:  Huh.  Do you think, like, people watch that because, you know, it's not something we would ever, ever, do in real life?
L:  Maybe or [MN] if it's like exciting, I don't know.  It's just 'cause it's more real than -- I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Really?  'Cause I actually don't think reality TV's very realistic --
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  -- you know.
L:  Well, it's real but it's, like, they're real people, you know.  When -- and -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's something I would never do, I'm sure as heck.  [LAUGH]
R:  I [MN]
L:  I can't even --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- touch the bugs.  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's like what will people do for money, basically.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, some --
R:  [NOISE]  I mean [MN] --
L:  -- people'll do anything for money.
R:  Yeah, I know now [MN] -- would you do that sort of thing for, like, a --
L:  No.
R:  -- million dollars? [LAUGH]
L:  No, I wouldn't do any [LAUGH].  No.  I --I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  It's kind of getting --
L:  I [several inaudible words] have to --
R:  -- on my nerves though.
L:  -- so ...  I wouldn't mind, like, um, have you ever watched Big Brother?
R:  Um, -- 
L:  It was [MN] --
R:  I think I saw one episode.  That was -- was that the one where everyone's being watched?
L:  Yeah, they're all, like, in a house.  They're in one house for, like, um, I think it's like six months or something.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, there's like, I think twelve -- I think twelve people.
R:  I don't know.  There's so many I -- I get them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- confused now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's kind of annoying.  Like every other show is reality TV, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  And I used to like, um, Who Wants to be a Millionaire but I [MN] -- I -- I liked it when -- when it first came out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We used to watch it and it was -- did you ever watch that?
R:  [MN]  Uh, Joe Millionaire?
L:  No, Who Wants to be a Millionaire.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that's not really reality TV, right?  
L:  Oh.
R:  That's the game show.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Is that what you're talking about?
L:  No.  Well, I was thinking, uh, Who Wants to -- like, I guess that's not the same thing, is it?
R:  Yeah, that's more of a game show.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Who Wants to +Marry- -- I think I've seen that too.  Couple of times [inaudible].
R:  What -- what -- what do you think of the new one, Mr Personality?  Did that come out yet?
L:  I don't think I've seen that.  What's that one like?
R:  It's about the -- a girl who, um, dates, like, I don't know, ten or twelve guys and they all wear masks.
L:  Oh.
R:  So she doesn't know what they look like.
L:  I think I've seen the previews for that.  
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  They probably picked out, like, really ugly guys on purpose just so that she'll be shocked at the end, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, isn't that the point, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we'll try to get 'em to like 'em for their personality and based -- what they --
R:  Right.
L:  Like 'em on their personality and not their looks.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know.
R:  [MN]  
L:  I don't --
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  I don't really like all these shows like, um, [LIPSMACK] or The Bachelor, or whatever, and they're, like, you know, all this girl with -- this guy's got to choose from all these +women, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And somebody's -- you know, like, he's kissing all these girls and saying I love you to all these girls and dating all these girls, and then all these girls get hurt feelings and they all think, "Oh, I love him" and all these --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- girls [LAUGH] compete for this one guy, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, about that one where, um, they got married -- Married by America.  Did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see that?
L:  I mean, that's just crazy because even -- you shouldn't just marry somebody you don't even know and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  That's --
R:  Well, none of them got married at the end, I don't think, so ...
L:  Oh, I don't know. 
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it -- I think what they did, they had a bunch of couples and then they got eliminated one by one, you know.  And then at the end, um, two couples, you know, went to the altar but neither of them, uh, got married, you know.
L:  Hm.
R:  I guess, you know, that's good.  I mean, it shows that people would still [MN] you know, won't make that sort of step [LAUGH] to make the money.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I hope not.  
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't know.  [NOISE]  Um, when do you think this whole thing's going to end?  This, like, reality craze thing.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.  I think it's just getting, uh, bigger.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really.
L:  I think it's, you know, they're -- they're coming out with more and more.  You're always hearing about, oh, this is going to come out and this is going to come out and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Do you think they all started with the Real World?  Is that like the origins of all this --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- reality TV?
L:  Yeah.  I think [several inaudible words].
R:  And the Osbournes.  
L:  And what was -- I think it started, really, though too, like Big Brother and -- and Survivor were the first -- the first big ones, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and then they started coming out with some of these other ones.
R:  All right.
L:  Like Fear Factor and everything and ...
R:  [MN]  Yeah, we have to come up with, like, guesses on what they're going to do next.  [LAUGH] [MN]  I don't know.  Mm.  Do you have a favorite?
L:  Pro- -- I would probably say Fear Factor but I don't watch it that often, but when I do watch it -- I mean, but either that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or Big Brother when it's on.
R:  You know what I thought was pretty good but I only saw one episode of, um, The Mole.
L:  Yeah.  The Mole.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I liked that one.
R:  That was, like, better.  I mean, it was actually, like, kind of suspenseful and stuff, you know.
L:  Yeah.  That was good.  That was -- yeah, I would say that was my favorite.
R:  Yeah.  That's the --
L:  I -- I liked the --
R:  -- only one.
L:  -- host too because he was really, I don't know, he was kind of like a nice guy and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was cool because of, like, who's the mole [LAUGH] and you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- had to, like, try to figure it out and ...  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, I think that would be my favorite one.  'Cause I don't like, you know, like who -- all these contest ones.  They -- they seem kind of silly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, everyone competing and stuff for one, like, person or whatever.  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I don't like the dating ones as much.  I like the ones that are more exciting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, where they're, like, competing or something like that.  But when they're just like dating, or -- I mean I don't really care for, like, The Bachelor and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those kind of ones.  But [LIPSMACK] I like the ones that are more active.
R:  Mhm.  Do you ever watch Real World?
L:  I used to.  I know what it is, but I didn't --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- in a while.
R:  I don't know.  The last season it was, like, such a show rather than real, you know what I mean?  Like everyone -- it was obvious they knew they were acting.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I thought so.
L:  And -- well, there's this new one out.  I don't know if it's really reality TV but, um, I think it is -- would it be considered reality TV where they're doing the makeovers?
R:  Mm.
L:  They're doing like the extreme makeovers.
R:  I haven't heard of that.  So it's like a talk show, you know, how they have like Sally Jesse and they'll make over people?
L:  I mean --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- they're actually -- no, they actually go through like [MN] extreme makeovers like where they redo their whole face with plastic surgery and --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And everything is, like, extreme.
R:  Oh, that's crazy.
L:  [MN]  It's -- yeah, like why would you -- you'd be so -- you know, like to be so unhappy with yourself that you have to redo yourself, and that's the only way you can be happy with yourself, is how you [LAUGH] look, you know.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  You got to have --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] surgery to make yourself look better.
R:  And they want the whole world to know?
L:  Yeah.  You just -- I mean, [MN] it's like, well, I look like a barbie doll but whatever [LAUGH] you have to --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do to get that way, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Would you ever -- ever go on a show?
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  No?
L:  Nothing like that.  
R:  No?
L:  Maybe Big Brother or [LAUGH] something but ...
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean that one doesn't seem as bad, you know, just being in a house.  I mean there's some challenges and stuff but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I could never do something like Survivor or Fear Factor or ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  To be actually on there or anything like that.
R:  Well, what's that one where they go on the road all the time?
L:  Oh, Road, uh, [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  Road -- Road, uh ...
L:  Now I want to say Road Rage [LAUGH] but it's not, uh -- Road Rules.
R:  You know what I -- yeah, Road Rules.  
L:  Road Rules.  Yeah.
R:  Like, I watched that and it made me kind of like them because they really do bond on their, like, trips and, you know, like they get real close.  And I thought that was cool.
L:  Hm.
R:  [MN]  Is this your first [inaudible]?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Yeah, mine too.  [MN]  It's kind of interesting.
L:  Yeah.  It's different.
R:  Yeah, but, um, like the ones about, like, making friendships and getting to know new people and then, like, you have to get together and come up with some plan to do something, you know.  
L:  Hm.
R:  Um.
L:  So, let me think.  
R:  What's your favor-
