R:  Hi, my name is Craig.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Craig.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm Josh.
R:  How ya doing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- today?
L:  I'm fine.  I'm o- -- um, this is, um, the thing from the internet, right, where I --
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.  All right.  Sure.
R:  Telephone study.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um, so [NOISE] what do I have to do?  Are you gonna ask me questions and stuff like that?
R:  No.  I'm not gonna ask 'em.  They want you to talk about Iraq.  What the United States should do in Iraq.
L:  Oh.  Um, uh, I'm not really -- I don't know.  Um, [MN] I guess they should -- I don't know they -- what -- I don't know what's the situation over there right now.  I haven't seen the news lately.
R:  I see.  Well --
L:  Um.
R:  -- they wanna know if -- if you think it's important, what's going on over there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think it's very important 'cause there's a lot of lives over there.  Are we -- we're still on war, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  Although there's not -- there's not a lot of fighting going on but there's still -- the people are protesting and there's a lot of -- they're -- they're angry because there's a lot of -- a lot of looting going on and -- and they say that the -- they're angry with the United States now because they say that there's nobody -- nobody, uh, in power and that ev- everybody's just looting and stealing.
L:  Oh, in Iraq?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Well, um, maybe they should elect like a president or something like that over there in Iraq.  Um ... um --
R:  Yeah.  That's what they're gonna have to do some time in the future.  Right now I think the people would be happy just to be ge- get rid of Saddam Hussein.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's the m- most important thing right now.
R:  So, I think it is important what's going on over there but I think a lot of the -- they -- already -- already some of the troops are coming home so that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need them to come home safe and everything.
R:  Yeah.  We just -- and another thing we need to make sure that -- that the people that -- that are put in charge over there are -- are better than w- -- the people that was there because you never know how -- how the new people are gonna be.
L:  Yeah, well, we wanna good leader.  We don't want, like, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah.  There's -- there's -- I mean, there's other people that -- that are waiting in there.  They might be the same as Hussein.  All they want is the power.  They don't care about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the people.
L:  Yeah.  We need somebody that actually cares about [NOISE] their country and --
R:  That's right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, now that the war is over pretty fast that things went pretty well so now you -- I think that now they're more con- -- the United States is concerned of what -- about what the whole world is thinking and -- and we need to make sure that -- that things are taken care of and that -- that somebody else doesn't come in and just try to take over for the oil and the money.
L:  How do you think, um, yeah -- how do you think Clinton would have dealt with what the s- -- the same situation?  Do you think they'd of went to war in Iraq?
R:  Uh, I don't think so.  I think he would have -- he would have tried to, um, maybe just -- just, uh, buy his way out or something.
L:  Mm.
R:  Maybe give -- give Hussein something just to -- to -- to keep him happy.  He would've thought of that if he could keep him happy then he didn't have to worry about any kinda terrorist attack.
L:  So do you think that Bush deal with it, um, right or not real good, or no?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm -- I -- I think it is because a- -- all these people it's like -- it's like they find out now that all of 'em were -- all the people being tortured and killed and it makes me think of like Hitler during World War Two what he did.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so like all these ...
L:  I think, Bush, he's wanted the, um -- the oil.  That's what I think he wants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I -- yeah.  I think that's the main reason why he went to war.
R:  I don't --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- know.  I -- I can't tell but I would -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seems to me that -- that you would think that -- that -- that they would know more about it than I do, with the FBI and the CIA that they have more intelligence and -- and that they were more worried about, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- attack on the United States.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause although they never found any of these weapons that they said or they never found any of this poison, I don't know -- I saw somebody the other day who said, "Well, yeah, they did find it but they don't wanna tell us".  I don't know why they would -- wouldn't wanna tell us because that's so -- one of the reasons they said they were going there was to try to find these weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Well, they wan- -- they probably don't wanna scare us.  They probably -- they probably haven't found the weapons --uh, the, uh, nuclear weapons and all that but they probably found maybe -- I don't know -- maybe, um, some of the soldiers may have encountered a, you know, like attack for like -- um, for [inaudible] and -- something that they had.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, um ... I'm not sure --
R:  I don't know.  It just seems to me that they w- -- if they found 'em they would want the world to know that they were there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that -- that like the -- attacking Iraq was justified but I don't know how somebody -- somebody said, "Well, oh, yeah, they found 'em but the -- but the government wants -- doesn't want us to know".  Well, how does that person know?  What makes that person so smart?  I don't know.  It just seems to me that the people don't trust the government any more and -- and -- and no matter what the government says everybody's gonna say, well, they don't believe 'em.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think that what they -- all the people -- I mean, you saw the -- if you saw on television, I mean, when the United States when they were coming into Iraq, the people on the --all the citizens standing and cheering, I mean, it -- it made me feel good that we were helping these people.
L:  Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta watch out 'cause like they -- they could look like they're innocent bystanders but I've seen -- I mean, I heard the little kids they go -- they-- they are trained to like kill, like to kill themselves.  To kill Americans.
R:  Yeah.  I know that too.  But sometimes, um -- or like when they -- when they're pulling down the statues and things they were happy like when it happened but then later on once, uh, the looting started --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything they were -- all of sudden they're -- you know, they're angry with the United States.  They want -- they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think the United States is gonna -- is gonna be in charge over there instead of electing somebody to -- to be their representative.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, they're angry about that right now.
L:  So, what do you think the United States is gonna do?  Do you think they're gonna take over themselves; they're gonna let their own country -- somebody from their own country take over and like --
R:  No.  I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think the United States is gonna take over.  They want -- I think they want somebody else.  But they have to be careful because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --there's just a lot of, uh -- there's a lot of religious fanatics over there who I'm sure would love to be in charge like even people from other countries like Syria, Iran.  They wan -- that wanna -- already they wanna move in there and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take over.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So they see where -- see where it's a big -- a big power --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing and -- and the big thing over there I think is the oil.  You have to be careful because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody moves in there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all they see is all the money that -- that Hussein has from all this oil and -- and that's all they can see is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how they're gonna be -- be real rich just like he was.
L:  Uh [NOISE] --
R:  I think it's important what's going on over there and the United States needs to watch but I don't -- I don't think we need to -- to be over there all the time and -- and like be in charge because for one thing it's a -- there's a big difference between the people in the United States and people in the Muslim countries.  They whole -- they have a whole different -- different attitude and a whole different heritage that -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're not familiar with.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's important to --to get somebody in there that -- that knows the Iraqi people.  Maybe one of these -- there were some people that left the country because of H- Hussein and -- and get one of -- get maybe one of those leaders, get them to come back but I think it has to be -- it has to be who the people want because if the people don't support 'em it's going to be the same thing all over again.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  And so I think now that -- now that it's done in Iraq I don't think you have to -- have to move into other countries.  I think the United States should -- should stay there for a while just to make sure that -- that things are -- are kept peaceful and then --
L:  And everything is safe and every- -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And then -- and then move out.  I don't think we need to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep all the other war equipment and everything else in there.  We can move out because otherwise the people are gonna think that we're trying to take over.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Well, yeah.  I just -- I just hope everything's fine over there like --
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  You know, and everybody was worried there was gonna be all kinds of terrorist attacks in the United States.  Well, there still could be.  I think the peop- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I --
L:  Because they -- they kinda moved out, right?  They moved out the country probably -- the, um -- like all the terrorists from Iraq and everything, they probably moved out, right, to another country or something?
R:  Sure.  They're just waiting on the -- on the sidelines.  That's why they can't find --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all these weapons 'cause they've -- they had all this time to move 'em out so they're not there.  But they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they still could be around and the -- the terrorists are still there.  They haven't been killed and so I think the United States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- needs to keep their guard up.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You start letting everybody, you know, fly in the airplanes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'll have another --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- another disaster like they had in New York.
L:  Yeah, I think that the -- that was too easy for them, the terrorists.  That was way too easy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  God, I mean, hm ...
R:  But now that they -- the way things are now, I think, when they keep -- they keep telling everybody that -- to -- to be on your --
