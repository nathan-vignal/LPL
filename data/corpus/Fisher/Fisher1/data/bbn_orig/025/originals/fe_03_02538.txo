L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Ashley.
R:  My name is Patty.  How are you, Ashley?
L:  I'm good, Patty.  How are you?
R:  All right.  So, where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in, ah, Los Angles.
R:  Oh.  How's the weather?
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  Good.
L:  Yeah.  I got a sunburn today. [LAUGH]
R:  Where --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Seattle.  I grew up in LA though.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.  And it's really depressing here.
L:  Oh.  Is it raining?
R:  Well, it's not -- I mean, today it's a nice day, but I miss the sunshine.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, summer's coming.
R:  Yay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I don't know if I can talk about this subject they gave you because I don't even watch TV, much less reality TV.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Do you?
L:  Well, you know, um, being in Los Angles it's quite -- it's quite the topic.  Um, simply because I know a lot of artists and a lot of writers, um, who are -- are really feeling the pressure of reality programming, because it doesn't employ artists so much as other programming.
R:  Oh, really?  Are you in art yourself?
L:  Yes I am.  I'm an actor.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, you know, as opposed to something like West Wing or ER, you know, a scripted program, um, reality programs are very inexpensive to make.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Just like going through the line in the grocery store with no checker, huh?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you -- have you ever seen a reality show?
R:  No.  I mean --
L:  No?
R:  I've heard about 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  When people talk about 'em I hear about 'em, but I don't even watch TV.  I mean, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I figure it's a waste of my time.
L:  You know what?  A lot of times it is. [LAUGH]  There is some good programming on, but it's, ah -- it's few and far between.
R:  Yeah.  I hope that's not got the kind of acting you deal with.
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  No.
R:  I'll -- I'll go see movies and stuff, but, you know, TV shows just bore me to death, so...
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  I'd rather read a book or rent a movie or something.
L:  Right.  Um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's -- you know what?  You're -- you're in the -- in the top percentage, I believe, you know, of --
R:  Of what?
L:  Of -- of people -- yeah, I should clarify -- of -- of -- of people who are, you know, attempting to better themselves and [LAUGH] do something worthwhile -- something that, um, stimulates their creativity, their imagination, their, you know, intelligence.  Um --
R:  I don't know.  Occasionally, you know, like, if I'm at somebody's house and their TV is on --  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- you know, I'll stare at it dumbly, like all of them.  And I'll think, "No wonder I don't watch this stuff.  It's pure garbage". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's, like, lowering the collective mentality of the country, I think.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and I would have to say, you know, as far as reality programming is concerned, I think it just dumbs it down even further.
R:  Really?
L:  Because -- yeah. Because, um, it -- there's no -- th- th- there doesn't seem to be any kind of escapism in it.  You know?  It's -- it's kind of the opposite of escapism.  It's like -- I guess, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know.  I really haven't thought about it, but, um, you know, at least with -- with programming that's scripted, even if it's a -- you know, a crappy sitcom or something, you know, you're at least going into another world.  Um, there are characters, um, and it's -- you know, it's fiction.  It's -- it's a make believe kind of situation, whereas with something like Survivor or Who Wants --
R:  Well, aren't those things make believe anyway?  I mean, they might be real people, but the whole situation is made up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And people get a lot of money for it, I understand.
L:  It's true.  You know what?  I think you're right.  They do share those two things, that it is made up, regardless of whether they call it reality or not. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean -- that's right.  I mean, because there used to be all this stuff all the time about Survivor, the first time it was around.  So, I couldn't help but hear about it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's from the impression of it.  I was, like, "Well this sounds really stupid".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Let's abandon strangers on a desert island.  And who do we wanna get rid of?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, you know, I'll be honest with you, that is the one crap programming that I watch.  And it's like a guilty pleasure, um, because, you know, for the most part I don't watch a lot of television.  And I'm pretty selective about what I do watch just because, you know, it's not the kind of thing I would want to do as an actor.  Um, but what's interesting about the show, Survivor only -- I can only speak for that one 'cause it's the only one I've ever watched -- is that it -- it's kind of interesting from a psychological standpoint because these people, they actually are -- like, they're food deprived, and they're put on -- you know, in this, ah, isolated place with a bunch of strangers.  And to see how that plays from -- you know, just from that perspective is pretty interesting.  A lot of times you can tell when the show is, you know, pushing it into an entertainment place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is really annoying.  But, when they let things play out naturally between people, to see the kinds of relationships that people make under pressure when they're not eating enough, you know, like, it is kind of a game of survival and, um, it can be very interesting sometimes. 
R:  Psychological test case, so to sp- --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  What people do?  Yeah, see I haven't ever watched it, you know.  And so, I -- I don't really know what they do.  I just know so and so got kicked out, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, whatever that man's saying. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, you have a very nice speaking voice.
L:  Oh, thank you.  You know, maybe -- maybe you'll get to hear it over the airwaves or something sometime. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what kind of work do you do?
L:  Well, ah, mostly theater.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I just actually got home from shooting a movie.  This afternoon, um, was my first day shooting, um, kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] a comedy.  It's a comedy about, ah, dating in LA [LAUGH] which --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know altogether too much about. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, um -- ah, yeah -- yeah.  I think it's -- it's a lot of fun.  I -- I try to -- I try to do projects that are stimulating, you know, as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- far as my creative side, um, but that doesn't always work out here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is -- what is that you do?
R:  Finishing up at grad school right now.
L:  Oh.  What are you studying?
R:  Linguistics.
L:  Oh -- oh wow.  Well, that's fascinating.  I mean --
R:  Well, yeah it is.  Just -- just sometimes you get tired of studying all the time.  But, I still love to read, and I love foreign languages, and I love to listen to people talk.
L:  Yeah?  So, what -- um, what do you -- what does that entail when you study linguistics on -- on a higher --
R:  Well, there's --
L:  -- level like that? 
R:  -- a lot of sub fields involved in linguistics.  I mean, overall it's the study of language --
L:  Right.
R:  Human language.  But, you know, there's a lot of sub fields involved.  But, what I'm interested --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is in comparative and historical linguistics.  You know, how languages change over time.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful stuff.  You know --
R:  Yeah, and it's really fun.
L:  I mean, I kind of touched on that when I was in grad school -- I studied acting.  And, you know, we had -- we had a lot of work in speech and voice and, um -- and a lot of dialect work.  And what that meant was just sort of -- you know, there are a lot of dialects out there and you -- you know, there's a lot of history attached to it.  And so, when you're tackling a part like that, um, you really wanna get that stuff down correctly.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, for me it's fascinating if I watch a movie and they're -- you know, somebody's speaking in some dialect.  And I always judge how well they did it.  You know, some of 'em do it really well and some of 'em do it really bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, then I always want to know -- I wonder who their coaches are?  I wonder who teaches them how to do all that?  So, they --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- actually have you -- give coaching in that?
L:  Yeah.  I have friends who are dialect coaches.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, that would be a fascinating job.
L:  Oh, it's wonderful.  You know, um, they usually come from a teaching background, of some sort anyway, um, [LIPSMACK] where you can really break down the language.  You know, and -- and the phonetic alphabet comes in handy too.
R:  Well --
L:  Um, quite --
R:  -- used --
L:  -- a bit.
R:  -- to that.
L:  Hm?
R:  I'm used to that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  You know, I've forgotten a great deal of my -- of my phonetic alphabet, but -- but, when you're breaking it down that is a -- you know, it's a wonderful way of learning a dialect and, too, teaching your mouth how to [LAUGH] form something that's quite foreign to you.
R:  After --
L:  [LIPSMACK] So --
R:  -- you get in the swing of it -- I'm amazed really at some actors and how well they really do it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Like Meryl Streep, for instance, is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- one of those actors who can just transform.
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what I saw lately, but, ah, it's not coming into my head right now.  And then it's also very noticeable when you see somebody who's supposed to be playing a certain part and they don't take on the dialect at all.
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I saw this one film that had Harrison Ford in it.  And, you know, he's the perennial favorite, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- but, he was supposed to be this New York cop, and he didn't talk New York at all.  And I thought, "He can't do this".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Th- that this does not fly.
L:  But, you know what?  We also found out later that he -- he's probably not a diale- -- he's not, ah, very good at dialects, I don't think, because then he made this movie that came out last year, where he played a Russian captain.  And he was just the joke of the town --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause there -- the trailers that came out with him trying to have this Russian dialect were so embarassing.
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  And that people that had never heard a Russian dialect in their life knew it was wrong. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Wh- --
