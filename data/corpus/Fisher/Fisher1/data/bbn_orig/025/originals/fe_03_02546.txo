L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Who's this?
R:  [COUGH] This is Felicia, from --
L:  Hi, Felicia.  I'm Kelly.  I'm in San Francisco.
R:  I'm in Los Angeles. [NOISE]
L:  Oh my God.  You're in California too.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Two Californians.
L:  Then you probably have -- you probably have a lot of exposure to reality TV, don't you?
R:  Actually I do.  One of my girlfriend's is doing a reality TV show right now. 
L:  You're kidding?  What show is she --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on?
R:  It's a new one.  It hasn't aired yet.  She's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's called Wife Swap. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's called Wife Swap?
R:  Wife --
L:  Are you kidding?
R:  -- Swap.  Yeah, I'm serious.
L:  Oh my --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- God.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, is she the wife that gets swapped?
R:  Yep.  She's a wife, with three kids -- three, um --
L:  With three ki- --
R:  -- three young kids actually.  I think they're, like, six, eight and nine.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  She swapped places with a woman in New Jersey --
L:  No!
R:  -- who's got older kids that -- I met her just, ah, this past weekend.  I met the -- this wife who swapped [LAUGH] this past weekend at a party. [LAUGH]
L:  Is that hilarious?
R:  Yeah.  It was -- she was -- I was really sort of worried about this whole situation.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Think of it, leaving --
L:  What --
R:  -- little kids --
L:  -- do you think about it?
R:  -- with some kind of a stranger.  Actually, I mean, it's okay.  The woman's very nice.  They really screen the people carefully to make sure you get a decent person coming.  Somebody who's not gonna, you know, harm the kids in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any way.
L:  Be totally psychotic or anything.
R:  Right -- right.  And also her husband works from home.
L:  Oh my --
R:  So, he's there --
L:  -- gosh.
R:  -- all the time.  And the producers and the camera people, the sound people are there all the time.  They have a teacher on site.  So, the kids are safe.  They're fine.  And --
L:  Yeah.  But my question is what happens in the bedroom?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is that, like, understood?  Or is that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just off limits?  Or --
R:  [MN] It's off limits.  The woman is in her own locked bedroom in the house.
L:  Wow, that is so crazy.  So, really it's -- well, I guess I'm not supposed to be talking about it.  I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's really crazy though.  So, reality TV, what do you think about it?
R:  Well, you know, I don't watch a lot of TV.  In fact, I recently only -- I just -- maybe a month or month and a half ago got my TV turned on. [NOISE]
L:  Good for you.
R:  I didn't watch any TV at all.
L:  Good for you.
R:  But now, it's awful.  I've gotten hooked on [NOISE] The Bachelor, of all shows.
L:  Oh, the new one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the Firestone guy?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I have actually not watched any of those shows.  The only, like, quote unquote reality show that I c- -- I would say that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I watch is American Idol.  And I don't even know if that's reality.  That's more like Star Search, you know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a competition.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  There's --
L:  -- I think --
R:  -- elements -- hm?  Sorry, go ahead.
L:  I just think they're all -- they're all kind of silly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- you know, I felt that way too.  People would talk and talk and talk about Survivor.  I never seen it.  I --
L:  Me either.
R:  "-- thought, "What is big deal? [NOISE]  Why does everyone --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- watch this stupid stuff?" [NOISE]
L:  Why --
R:  But --
L:  -- do you think they do?  I don't understand.
R:  You know, I don't know.  I guess they can picture themselves in the situation better than in -- in -- in -- in the other types of shows, sitcoms and dramas and so forth.  I don't --
L:  You're --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- probably right.
R:  That may be the reason.
L:  Well, and also who wouldn't want a million dollars, you know?  I mean --
R:  Oh yeah.  I could use a million.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, hello.
R:  It's --
L:  Most of us -- 
R:  -- a million --
L:  -- could.
R:  -- dollars.  Isn't that a game show? [NOISE] 
L:  The game show?
R:  Oh -- oh, I'm sorry. 
L:  Which one?
R:  No, I'm sorry.  I was thinking of the other one.  There's another mil- -- Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.
L:  Oh, Who Want- -- is that a reality show?
R:  No.
L:  No, it's just a game show, right?
R:  No, we're talking about Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.  That's a different one.  So, I've never --
L:  you know --
R:  -- seen --
L:  I heard --
R:  -- that --
L:  -- that that was the very first one.
R:  Hm.
L:  Right?
R:  Yeah, but it turned out --
L:  Or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  It turned out the guy wasn't really a millionaire.  Is that right?  Ah, I don't --
L:  I don't know.  I think that -- you know what's so funny, is just because of media, like, you -- you know what it's all about even if you don't watch it.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think the guy who wasn't a millionaire -- what was that show called?  Joe Millionaire. [NOISE]
R:  Joe Mil-
L:  Joe Millionaire was this one where this guy was, like, a construction worker.  He was, like, piss poor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they convinced all these ladies that he was this, you know, super rich guy and whatever. [NOISE]  He was weird.  Yeah.  And they went to this stupid French chateau.  You what I don't understand about all this stuff is that, like, all the ladies always dress up in ball gowns, and they have, like, jewels on and all this stuff.  And all the guys are always in tuxedos.  And it's just, like, that is so not reality.  I don't know what reality they're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talking about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I personally really like jeans. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I like flip flops, and I like tank tops. [LAUGH]  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  I just -- I don't get it.  If I was a contestant on those reality shows I'd be, like, "Why are you putting me in a ball gown?" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is more like prom.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't know.  I guess we want to think of ourselves as living like that, even though we don't really.  I mean, that's what it is --
L:  I guess that's true.  I think they really try to emphasize the whole fairy tale aspect --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of it. 
R:  Right.  Yes.  Prince --
L:  When --
R:  -- Charming's gonna come and sweep you off your feet.
L:  Yeah.  That's so weird.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I just don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get it.
R:  Yeah.  And there are these other kinds I guess too.  The, like Ozzy Osbourne, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what's the woman who --
L:  Oh, Anna --
R:  -- the blonde woman?
L:  -- Nicole?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  Have you seen any of those?
L:  I haven't seen any of those.  I mean, obviously I've read about them because, like I said, they're all over the newspapers and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- magazines and stuff like that.  But, I can proudly say that I only have basic cable. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I really only watch The Simpsons, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] The -- [NOISE] and That Seventies Show.
R:  You live[?] totally in fantasyland. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] I just -- I could give two craps about reality TV.  I think it's just kind of silly.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [MN] So, why are you doing this telephone talk thing?
L:  Well, because it pays ten bucks for every ten minutes.  Why are you doing it? [LAUGH] 
R:  So, it pays you ten dollars every time you call?  Ah, this is the first time I've done it.  A friend asked me to sign up for it 'cause she's trying to earn money to go -- she's in grad school and she's, you know -- apparently --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- she asked all of her friends to sign up for it.  So, I signed up for it just today.  I was surprised to get a call so soon.
L:  I know. 
R:  How often do you get the calls?
L:  You know, I think I got the call last night and I was hanging out with friends.  Actually I'm doing the same thing tonight, but I decided to answer it.  I was hanging out with friends last night and I -- and I saw the two one five area code and I've no idea where that is.  I guess it's Pennsylvania.  And I said, "You know, I really can't do it".  But, yeah, I just signed up for it yesterday, or two days ago.  
R:  So, do --
L:  And, ah --
R:  -- they call you every day?
L:  -- and then I got the call. [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  Isn't that crazy? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- thirty bucks is thirty bucks.  I can always use thirty dollars. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Who couldn't?
R:  So, it's gonna be a total of three [NOISE] calls?  Is that the deal?
L:  I think -- I think it's something like at least three calls, and then -- I got it off of craigslist dot com.  I don't know where you -- oh, you heard about from your friend, right?
R:  Yeah, a friend sent it to me.
L:  I don't know where she or he heard about it from.
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I don't know either.  So, what do you do in LA?
R:  I'm a lawyer.
L:  Oh, are you really?
R:  Mhm.  I --
L:  What --
R:  -- really --
L:  -- kind --
R:  -- am.
L:  -- of lawyer?
R:  Civil rights.  I do, ah, discrimination against people with disabilities.
L:  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  Yeah.  I love it -- I love it.  I really like what --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- I'm --
L:  -- bet you do.  My brother's a public defender, and he --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- loves that line of work.
R:  Mm.  You also -- you're --
L:  You know what's --
R:  -- to be doing something good in the world.
L:  Yeah.  I think he is, you know.  And --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- actually I was talking to him the other about this whole Scott Peterson thing.  I'm sure you've heard about it.
R:  Oh yeah, mhm.
L:  Because, you know, for a while he was gonna be defended by his -- ah, the Public Defender of Modesto.  And I just wanted to talk to my brother about what he thought about it.  And it's just crazy.  I mean, [NOISE] people are so quick to convict him even though they don't know any of the details about it, you know.  And they see this pretty white girl who was murdered with her -- with her unborn child, and they're so quick to, like, say "Oh, so and so's guilty.  It's gotta her husband.  He's such a slime ball".
R:  Gotta be her husband.  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  And my --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- brother's --
R:  All we know are --
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  -- sort of the d- dirty old details.  We don't know anything about their lives really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess --
L:  You don't know anything.  I mean, what do I know?
R:  I mean, it's -- it's usually pretty typical though for the -- for the husband to have been the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one that actually did it. So, it [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- may be not a -- an unreasonable assumption to which, um, people have jumped. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well -- well, my brother said was, like, "You know, one out of four spouses cheat on s- -- cheat on their spouse".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just because they cheat doesn't mean that, you know, one out of four spouses murders their husband of wife.  You know, even though the guy's a scumbag, doesn't mean that he's guilty of murder.  And just because he has this mistress and all this circumstantial evidence, doesn't mean that he needs to have his life taken away, literally -- like, put --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to death.  I mean, there's -- it's just -- it's not [NOISE] -- it's not logical.  But, so many people wanna jump on that bandwagon.  It's like, "Fry that guy", you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] So weird.  So, do you go to trial and stuff? [NOISE] 
R:  Mm, not often.  No, I rarely go to trial.  And it's kind of reminded me actually the way people w- w- -- the way people reacted to, ah, Nicole Brown Simpson's murder.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I feel the same way.
R:  Yeah, it r- really is.  People felt so personally attached to her-- is what was really surprising --
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  -- to me.  Yeah.  I mean, somebody who would never have given any of us the time of day. [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] She lived in her -- completely own world.
L:  Well, as --
R:  And couldn't have --
L:  -- a civil rights --
R:  -- related to any of us.
L:  -- lawyer, how do you feel about that though?  I mean, here's a high profile African American -- you know, hyper masculine personality, who's been put on the stand for this because, you know, probably circumstantial evidence -- I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- know.  It was so long ago --
R:  Well, my --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- personal --
L:  -- don't know --
R:  Yeah.  My personal --
L:  -- anything about it.
R:  -- view on the thing was that he -- he probably killed her, but he was framed by the police.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think there was a lot of --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- mishandling of evidence intentionally, and I think they intentionally framed him.  I mean, think a- -- the -- the killer drops one glove at the scene of -- scene of the crime, and drops the other glove in his own backyard?
L:  Hm.
R:  That's just not gonna happen.  So, [NOISE] and -- and I think --
L:  And [COUGH] --
R:  -- as a lawyer, my perspective on that is that, ah, to have innocent go free is the price that we as a society pay when the police misconduct themselves in that way.
L:  Isn't that funny, that in a way that whole trial was kind of in itself reality TV?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And all of us wanted to just escape our lives and be glued to the car chase, and gl- --
