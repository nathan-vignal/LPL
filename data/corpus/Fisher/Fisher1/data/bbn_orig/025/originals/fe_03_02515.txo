L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Uh.  Hello, this is Danni Alexander.
R:  Hi.  My name is Sheila.
L:  Hi, Sheila.  Um, so do you watch the reality TV shows that are on?
R:  Uh, no, not consistently.  I've seen --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- maybe one or two episodes of one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- or the other but not -- not consistently, no.
L:  You know, I agree.  Because I really never did get into them my own self.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think when Survivor came on I watched two or three of 'em.
R:  Mm.
L:  They got Survivor two, three and four and I said, "I'm done".
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They did a, yeah, the Who Wants to be -- Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  I thought, "Well, that's kind of stupid".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I have to say though, I used to, um, it's been a few years, watch, um, MTV's Real World.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words] that.
R:  [MN]  When it first started, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I watched the f- -- maybe the first or second season.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but that kind of preceded some of these later shows.  So I didn't really think about that, but I did use to watch that.
L:  Yeah, that one's all right.  Now, I -- once in a while I'll the catch The Osbournes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're all right, you know.  They're -- they're more for the -- the evening type children not to watch.
R:  Sure.
L:  But it -- you know, I'll catch them once in a while but, um, I don't know.  Some of the other ones that they came out with I just -- I thought were, you know, a little much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, Big Brother.  That -- that one I think went -- went a little too far.
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I've seen one of those before, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Where everybody's in the house living together and you watch them twenty four seven online.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And they get voted off and stuff, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's really hard on the -- the people's families that are -- that have to wait for this person that's locked up in that house for however long they're in there.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.  That's --
L:  So.
R:  -- a good point.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And not only that it makes them kind of, um, do ridiculous things for money.
L:  I know.
R:  You know, it's kind -- it's not really entertaining.  That's kind of low, you know, that people would have to do some of the things that they wind up doing and then other people are watching, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yes, I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  Now Fear Factor.  Have you seen that one?  [NOISE]
R:  Actually, I've only seen the commercials.  I've never seen the program.
L:  No, actually Fear Factor is not bad.  
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Considering for the reality TVs you know, they -- they actually do, um, these stunts and stuff that actual people, like I -- I used to hang off of win- -- uh [MN] storey buildings and wash windows.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So I -- yeah, I -- I watch these guys doing this and I laugh to myself thinking, you know it's the height that kills 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on some of this stuff but, you know, I think, you know, tha- tha- that -- that's worth it.  'Cause you're doing something and at the end you're going to get money.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's all a physical thing.
R:  Sure, yeah.  There may be some skill involved.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  Rather than just, you know, kind of hanging out and persevering through ridiculous situations to earn money.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  And -- and causing drama.
R:  Right.  And cau- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, I don't -- I -- I think the reality TV shows, um, kind of exemplify lack of creativity --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the part of some of the -- the networks and the TV --
L:  Uh, yes.
R:  -- producers.
L:  Yes, I agree.
R:  You know, I mean, they just throw these people together and they don't really have to think too hard about what the script should be.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There is no script.  You know, there is no story.  There's no plot.  Um, they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just have to do ridiculous stuff to earn money.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Now they -- they did do one -- one kind of TV shoot -- show, up in East Portman.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't -- it was, uh, a mystery thing where these -- where it is supposed to be like reality TV where the people were supposed to find who the murderer was.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  And the name of the -- the -- the fake city was Sunshine.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And they did it up there in East -- in East Portman, where I used to live.
R:  Okay.
L:  And everybody had scripts and stuff.  [several inaudible words], this is just when the reality TV shows were just getting ready to come out.
R:  Oh, I hadn't heard about that one.
L:  Yeah, well, uh, it wasn't really popular.  
R:  Okay.
L:  It -- it came out after Survivor and, like I said, it was, like -- so they -- they took so many kids, they went up to East Portman.  It was a murder thing.  And everybody in it was actors [several inaudible words] because I used to live up there, so I knew who all the police officers were and all the regulars.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And everybody in that whole series was planted. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not one person was a regular up -- from up there in East Portman.
R:  Oh, that's terrible.  That's really terrible.
L:  Yeah, it wasn't real.  
R:  Yeah.  But that reminds of, um, PBS now is doing -- it's kind of like the reality show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's a historical program where people live in a situation that's supposed to be like the past.
L:  Oh, th- that --
R:  They live in --
L:  -- would be cool.
R:  Yeah, they live in a log cabin.  Uh, this one family, it's like a frontier family.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's one that -- they live in a Victorian home and it's supposed to be the Victorian era, then a --
L:  Oh, was this where they were going to put, like, hillbillies, up, like, in Beverley Hill, like they did, like, with the, um, you -- you remember the old series they had?
R:  Sure.  I think it's something --
L:  [inaudible] Hillbillies.
R:  -- like that.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Do you know, I think that one -- that would be a little interesting and worth watching.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- yeah, I don't think they have it out here yet.  And if they do --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I've missed it.
R:  Right.
L:  But I think that would be worth [NOISE] it.
R:  Yeah, I -- I haven't actually watched it but I've seen commercials where, uh, 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're trying to do that type of thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it sounds a lot more interesting than -- than what they have on -- on the other channels. 
L:  Right.  Now what do you think about this reality, uh, TV station they're going to come up with?  Have you heard about that?
R:  I didn't hear about that.  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah, they are.  The networks are [NOISE] putting together a twenty four seven one station that's nothing but all reality shows.
R:  Well, oh, unfortunately I think it's terrible because --
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]  I just don't think it's interesting.  I don't -- and I think it's kind of low.  I mean there's something about it that just seems really --
L:  There's a lot of stuff that we don't get to see.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they're cutting out.  
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  And if it's going to be a reality it should be all of it.  Like they did like in Big Brother.  Instead of taking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the best pieces and just s- sticking them up there to keep your attention instead of getting to see really what's going on behind the scenes.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, you know, as a matter of fact, I have heard about this new movie now.  They have, uh, something about going to Cancun and the [NOISE] students, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- just go on a spring break and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- yeah.
L:  They took +them to Mexico, didn't they?  They took like twenty students --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and took them to Mexico to do that, yeah.  And allowed 'em to get drunk and stuff.  I can't believe they did that.
R:  I can't believe it either.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I can't believe people want to -- why -- you know, I guess, it makes more sense to watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it than participate but it really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sounded just terrible, you know.
L:  Well -- well to be -- but, see I have to agree with them though. Th- -- [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  When I was in college, just out [NOISE] of high school, yes, I was young, dumb and wild.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just like those same kids were and I saw 'em -- and I see them doing that, I thought, "Oh my God, I used to do that" and that's how stupid I used to look.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  So at least it -- it woke something up in me with that.
R:  [NOISE]  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how old's the baby?
R:  Oh, she's four months old.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's sweet.  
R:  She likes to play with the telephone cord, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's great.  I've got one that's two.  And I know you're definitely enjoying that.
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All the different aspects of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, oh wait 'til they start moving around.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my gosh.  [LAUGH] Yeah, she's my first, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well -- yeah, I -- I've had other ones.  Uh, my mother's got my other three.  
R:  Okay.
L:  But, yeah.  Um, I raised them until they were like in middle school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I shipped them off to go to private school because of the school systems and the guns and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm in a large -- I'm in Los Angeles and I couldn't imagine my child going to school here.  I mean ...
L:  Oh my goodness. I used --
R:  I'm actually hoping --
L:  -- to live in L.A.
R:  -- to move.  Oh, wow.  Then you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's pretty bad actually.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to live there, um, as -- as [NOISE] strange as it is, being white, I used to live in [several inaudible words], I used to live in Compton.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, then I moved over to Bell Gardens.
R:  Okay.
L:  [inaudible] too bad.  But, uh, now that might be interesting.  A real -- a reality -- reality TV series in Los Angeles --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because there's so many --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different aspects and so many --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so many different people.
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's a lot of [inaudible].  [LAUGH]  I'm not -- I've only been here a few years so it -- it comes -- it came as a -- a surprise to me.  I didn't know what to expect.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh.  Hollywood is -- just blows your mind.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That would be -- yeah, that'd be a good reality.  Every street is like [NOISE] different types of people.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ...  Yeah, I think that'd be a good reality series.  To intermix all of them together and see what happens.
R:  There's so many neighborhoods here.  That each one is just so different.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  I agree.  I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN].
L:  I wonder for how long -- how our ten minutes is doing?  We're getting pretty close.
R:  We must be, yeah.  We must be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- getting close, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words].
R:  But, uh -- so you're thumbs down on the reality?
L:  Yeah, basically, I think so, yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  I'm not big on 'em either.  
R:  Yeah, neither am I.  I think they could be a little more creative with it and, you know, maybe something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible] reality based could be interesting, but so far I haven't seen anything that's sparked my interest.
L:  Mhm.  No, I agree.  Me neither.  Me neither.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, even though they have some of the, um, reality dating little series that's are on.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, they take 'em on dates and they show you the whole date and yay or nays and ...  
R:  [MN]
L:  I [inaudible] think those are pretty boring too.  So ...
R:  Sure.
L:  Now they need -- they do, I agree.  They need to find a different aspect on it.
R:  Mm.  Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] [NOISE] we're just so programmed to watching --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all of this action packed real movie stuff that that's why the reality shows are becoming so big, 'cause it's something different.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, like [inaudible] 
L:  And we're tired of seeing the same stuff everyday.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  Well, hopefully, Hollywood will, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- become a little more, uh, creative --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  Un- unfortunate- --
R:  -- instead of doing the same old stuff.
L:  I agree, but I think right now they're stuck in that reality [NOISE] phase until something else comes along.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Since they're thinking of a whole channel.  I mean that's -- that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- major.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it is.  Cable TV.  I couldn't believe it.  I heard it, like, three days ago.  I almost fell over.  I thought -- you know, they're going -- what are they going to do?  Rerun, uh, Who wants to Marry a Millionaire, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, [NOISE] all the Survivors.  You know what I mean?  This is all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I can think about [MN].  We've -- we've lived it once.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  I -- I think --
L:  [MN]
R: -- probably, you know, I'm sure we're not the only ones who -- even if we used to watch it, whoever used to watch it, they're getting tired of the same old thing, so ...
L:  Right.  That's true.  That's true.  And there -- and I know that there's some -- like my neighbors are followers.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're big Survivor fans.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But after a while it get -- it does, it gets old.  You know, and you think, well, you know, besides the challenges all being different, it's still the same scenario.
R:  Yeah.  You know what I do watch, um, uh, I don't know if it's reality and I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- start watching until late
