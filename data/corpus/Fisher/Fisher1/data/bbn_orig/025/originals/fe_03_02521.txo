R:  Hi, my name is Molly.
L:  Hi, I'm Shannon.
R:  Hi, Shannon.  That's my last name.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You know this is so weird.  My mom just called me and was telling -- she's doing this too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So she told me all about it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Small world.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]  So are we all watching reality TV?
L:  Well, I don't normally.  I did watch, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If you've heard of that.
R:  I have.
L:  That was pretty good.  I watched that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, Joe Millionaire.  I watched the last couple 'cause it was supposed to be good.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I liked The Osbournes on MTV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.  Things like that.  Not too much for the Survivor or The Bachelorette, or anything.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I haven't watched -- I watched the first episode of Joe Millionaire and I thought it was incredibly stupid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought he seemed like a moron.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought the girls were gold diggers.
L:  Right.
R:  And I tried to watch, um, the I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But only because I thought, for some reason --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that Steve Martin was going to be on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I adore Steve Martin.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] +really?
R:  But I didn't see that he was on there so I decided that it wasn't worth my attention.  And other than that, I just -- I really haven't watched it because, in general, I think it's really [LAUGH] stupid.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it does -- [LIPSMACK]  I liked -- I liked the celebrity one.  They're -- 'cause they was like -- you see celebrities and they're always acting so proper and stuff like that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  But on the actual TV show it wasn't like that at all.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They would fight back and forth.  And it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just -- it made for good TV actually.
R:  Well, I did see a little bit of it with, uh, was it Joan Rivers' --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- daughter?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just think that Joan Rivers and her daughter are just so incredibly low class.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So -- so I thought [MN] and actually I think that's why most people watch reality TV.  It really panders to the lowest common denominator.
L:  She actually won it though. Surprisingly.
R:  Oh, did she?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  She was -- she came out on top.
R:  Oh, did she?  Well, good for her.  [LAUGH]  I guess it pays to have a little bit of chutzpah, huh?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The only thing I really like about reality TV is you get to see, sometimes, like the [NOISE] other side. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, shit.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, man.  [NOISE]
R:  Just ignore them.  
L:  I'm sorry, hold on.
R:  Hello?
L:  You still there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm not sure what happened there but --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, sorry about that.
R:  Oh, no problem.
L:  Anyway, where were we?
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, I was saying about the other side of, uh, how, like -- I said, like, the celebrities live and with The Osbournes on MTV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How those -- I like to see the drama.  I don't like the whole, um, Bachelorette.  That's -- that's boring to me.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, you know, I guess to -- to an extent it's always fun to watch pretty people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, in general, they're all very pretty.  They're all very attractive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it seems to me that that's all that they're chosen for.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Like the -- like, uh, did you see the new one, Mr Personality?
R:  No, I haven't seen that one.
L:  Yeah, that's a new one.  All the guys walk around in masks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the lady, you know, is -- you know, she's supposed to pick one of them, or whatever. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she just goes by their personality and how they act.
R:  Well, I heard about that on the radio.  It was being advertised on the radio and I heard that one of the men said that he couldn't take it anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, a couple of them did actually that night.  Yeah, the first one.
R:  Well -- and why was that.  What was their, um, problem with it?
L:  Well, I guess they couldn't hide behind the mask anymore.  I don't know.  That --
R:  They felt that that was being untruthful?
L:  I guess.  The one did.  The one actually -- I guess they had a party there and [MN] one actually snuck off with another girl.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they were getting -- getting friendly in the bathroom.
R:  Oh my, yeah.
L:  And I guess he couldn't have that on his conscience.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  So he left.
R:  I -- I guess he should have thought of that before he [LAUGH].  Well, yeah, I -- all in all, I'd have to say I'm not too impressed by any of those shows.
L:  No.  I -- actually I don't watch much TV but when I -- when I catch it -- I mean ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One -- that's all that's on right now.  
R:  Well, I've --
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- heard that there's even going to be a reality network -- reality --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- TV network.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's all that seems to be one right -- just one after the other after the other.  What about American Idol?  Is that -- do you think that's reality TV?
R:  Now is that the one where, um, people sing --
L:  Yeah.  They sing.
R:  -- and perform and such?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And is that the one with that other rude person.  That very attractive Australian man.
L:  Oh, him, yeah, Simon.  Yep.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  Well, I -- you know, I've -- I've seen him on, I think it was Oprah that I saw him on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he is very attractive.
L:  Mm.
R:  But he's -- he's kind of rude.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  And obnoxious.
L:  He's a rude guy.
R:  I think that all started with that other show, um -- oh gosh, who was that awful woman, um -- you are the weakest link.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  That's where --
L:  The Weakest Link, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I wanted to hurt her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]  I -- I don't know.  I guess -- I've -- I've got kind of an issue about people having such poor manners.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And being so rude.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I can't understand why people find it so appealing on TV.
L:  I think -- yeah, that -- that seems to be a really -- really good selling point for shows like that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  People being rude and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and it just [SIGH] I don't know.  It seems to be the way a lot of people want to act these days and I don't understand it.  And I -- and I don't understand what people find appealing about watching it.  I mean, I kind of just vote with my -- my controller and turn it off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think that might be why, because so many people don't act that way on a daily basis.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You don't think so?
L:  Well ...
R:  Do you drive, Shannon?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I do.  I do, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not -- not very far, but I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't have to go too far to where I got to go, but ...
R:  Uh-huh.  [MN]  Yeah.  Well, [MN] I -- you know, it's -- it's a funny thing.  I mean it sounds like a dichotomy and I -- I actually believe that there are a lot of really wonderful people in this world.
L:  Mhm.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, well I'm -- right now I live in California.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I've lived in a lot of different places.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, born and raised in Missouri.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, you know, lived in Alaska and Florida and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- Washington State and Northern California.
L:  Phew.
R:  Lots of different places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I think in general [SIGH] um, there are a lot of nice people but [SIGH] like out on the road and just out and about, it just seems like good manners have died an ugly death.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, people don't hold doors open for each other or, you know, are polite when they drive and drive recklessly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and I think those shows are kind of a reflection of the general attitude that people have for each other, which is basically me first.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's true.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they seem to be so prominent.  I -- that's the one thing that gets me.  There's just one after the other, and they're all basically the same.  They all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have the same type of idea.  A girl --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- picks a guy out of a crowd.  A guy picks a girl out of a crowd.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a millionaire, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess that -- that appeals to our basic American fantasy, doesn't it?  If you're pretty enough you're going to get a really wealthy man.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um.
L:  Although I haven't found any of the guys attractive yet. On any -- on really any of the shows I saw.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I -- like I say, I really haven't seen it enough to -- to be able sure -- to be sure.  I thought that Joe Millionaire was kind of attractive in a simian sort [LAUGH] of way.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He was kind of like a neanderthal to me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well -- but -- and -- and until he opens his mouth.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  He was kind of -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  If he could've just stood there and flexed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he would've been fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [LAUGH].  But he was boring and --
L:  That was a good -- it was actually a good -- um, um, [LIPSMACK] a surprise ending I'd say.
R:  How did it end?
L:  It was a nice -- I -- I liked that they actually lied to the people.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like to me that was -- that -- did you watch that at all?
R:  Well, I had heard about it 'cause everybody talked about it.  You know you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- turn on the radio and they were talking about it.  Apparently he wasn't really a millionaire.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  They were -- they were lying to the girls the whole time.
R:  But they gave them some money at the end, didn't they?
L:  Yeah, they did give a million dollars at the end.
R:  Yeah.  Did he end up with that girl?
L:  He -- there was something about -- he -- he was away from her for, like, three months after the show.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They couldn't see each other or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I didn't hear what happened after that but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with five hundred thousand dollars I'd -- I'd leave, I'd stay.  I mean it wouldn't [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Take the money and run if you have to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You got the million.
R:  Well, [MN] I -- I admit it would be hard to pass up a million dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, if somebody said, you know, you have a chance to -- to be with a handsome man and a million dollars.  That has its appeal.  But, uh, boy, I think it would be a terribly humiliating circumstance to be in -- you know, with all those women.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [MN] I know that for me if a lot of people are vying for the same man I back away because I just don't enjoy that kind of [SIGH] competition.
L:  [inaudible]  A lot of those girls they were -- they were gold diggers.  Just after the million.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  But the one -- the one who ended up with him seemed pretty -- seems pretty genuine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's kind of -- kind of a down home, down to earth, girl.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess that's good.  Yeah.  I wonder if it worked out for them.
L:  I don't know.  
R:  Yeah.  So tell me, was Steve Martin on that one?
L:  No.
R:  One show --
L:  He wasn't --
R:  -- he wasn't, huh?
L:  It was people like --
R:  Gee, I wonder why I thought that.
L:  -- Melissa -- Melissa Rivers.
R:  Actually I'm very glad to hear that he wasn't on it because I think he's way too classy for that sort -- um, well I wonder what that was?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Hm.
