R:  Hi, my name's Darlene. I'm calling from Pennsylvania.
L:  Yes, my name is Raymond and I'm calling from, uh, Maryland.
R:  I'm sorry, where are you calling from?
L:  From Maryland.
R:  Maryland? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  So do you watch reality TV?
L:  I -- when it first came on and they had the Survivor show, I watched it.  And some of the things that they did I thought were ridiculous because, I mean, you had men and women out there based in the [inaudible], or out there in the wilderness, and they're running around, eating everything [MN] -- it basically just a gimmick to watch -- watch -- the people get to watch -- [MN] people watch TV.  It's a fantasy that people like to look at and fantasize what they would do if they were in that situation.  I really don't like those reality shows like that because it look like it -- it played on people mind [inaudible].  But nobody in their right mind will put theirself through that torture and eat worms and snails and stuff like, and eat rats and stuff like.  Why would you eat a --a rat?  Just because you want to win a million dollars?  I mean, money's one thing but your pride, +dignity and you don't know what kind of disease you might get is another thing.
R:  Right.  Well, ju-- yeah, just like all these now, the -- the Married by America and The Bachelor and all them.  I mean, I just can't imagine going on a show like that.
L:  I can't ei- -- well, look Who Want to Marry a --a Millionaire, something like that.  You're going to have twenty -- ten to twenty women, they know they competing for the love of one -- uh, this man, some [MN] and the only reason they want to be on it because this person's rich.  I mean, [MN] in reality if you going to try to marry somebody rich they not going to come from a -- a background -- they [inaudible] looking come from a background like you are.
R:  Yep.
L:  They looking from a background same as they have.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  It's like -- as you said, I watched, like, the first season of Survivor and I thought it was ridiculous.  [LAUGH]  And I haven't watched any of that since.  Like, I can't say that I haven't watched any of 'em but, like, I don't routinely sit down to watch 'em.
L:  I got a question.  Do you think it's a fantasy, or you just think it's a money making gimmick [inaudible] for the network?
R:  I think it's kind of both.  [LAUGH]  I think it's a gimmick, and I think they found something that -- they found the public likes to watch.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Seeing as it is so far fetched.  So people will watch it.  I -- hopefully people aren't believing they're doing everything or that it's r- -- some of the stuff is even real.  Um, but I think it's a gimmick that they found that they like because -- I mean everytime you look there's a new now --
L:  Yes, there's -- there's Survivor one, Survivor two, Survivor Australia, Survivor in the Outback.  There's Survivors all over the world.  Survivor in the Ara- -- in the Amazon.  
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, who -- would you risk this life down in the Amazon?
R:  No.
L:  With all those poisonous snakes and things down there.
R:  No.
L:  Just trying to make -- win money.  I mean, yeah, I like to be a millionaire and I like to be rich or something like that.  But what use would it be being a rich individual when I'm dead.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, I -- it's like now, at least, like there was the Survivor, it's like you know, you see previews on the TV and stuff for 'em.  I mean these people, as you say, they look half dead.
L:  Yeah.  And something else I don't like about those shows, or something like it.  You get to vote who you want off the island.  So -- so [MN] -- so you can get the strongest person, like everybody can get the strongest person and vote him o- --him or her off the island.
R:  Right.
L:  So, what reality -- they might be the strongest person on in this series, but you gonna vote them off the island because you figure your chances are better if they're not there.
R:  Right.  Yeah, so it's kind of stupid.  It's like not the real person that should win is even gonna win.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Since they have a say in it and stuff.  Even, like, I enjoy more of the, um, the musical, like the American Idol and stuff like that.  I enjoy that more but even -- like, I'm watching it this -- for the second season now and I'm, like, getting tired of that.  And it's, like, my husband and I said, "This will be the last time I watch this".  It's -- it -- they go too far with all of them.  It's like one time of 'em would've been enough.  But they kind of keep building on it.
L:  They keep pushing and pushing and pushing it on the Americans' intellect, like, "Oh, [MN] Americans will watch anything that we put on TV".
R:  Yeah.  But I guess they must be doing something if they can keep doing 'em now.  I guess people are still watching 'em.  
L:  Yeah, I guess the Neilson report, where so many people watch this show, so many people watch that show.  I guess the rating is up or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I can't see why some [inaudible] put theirself through that ridicule and put theirself through that danger to be on those shows.
R:  Right.  I -- I agree with that.  I mean just -- as you said, the -- eating some of that stuff they want you to eat on some of them and it -- it's just, like, I just can't imagine doing that for money.  As you said, who wouldn't want to be a millionaire?  You know, it's like -- or whatever they give for these shows.  Yeah, it'd be nice but to really put yours- -- your life in danger.
L:  Yes.  And like on those shows, like tho- -- Who Want to Marry a Millionaire or The Bach- Bachelor or The Bachelorette, or something like that.  Oh, if you going -- if you trying to win the -- the heart or marry somebody -- a bachelor that's worth a billion dollars or something like this.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there twenty people.  What are all the women d- -- are all of them sleeping with the guy, or something, just to try to win his favor or something like this?  So, they humil- -- the one that don't win do they feel -- what do they -- what do they get?  Humiliated or what?
R:  You would think.  I mean, even the one that did I don't -- there was one that she actually married him or whatever.  I forget what that one was called.  That she mar- -- you know, like the -- the guy came on and he was a millionaire, whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the woman married him and then, you know, like a month later they divorced.  And it's like, well, what was that to prove?  I don't know.  I just don't -- I don't know why somebody, first of all, would even put themselves in that situation.  
L:  And [MN]
R:  And it's like you're not really going to know the person.
L:  And I -- I feel that they playing on the intellect by calling 'em reality shows.  What rea- -- what's real about those shows?  There's nothing real about those shows.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  [MN]  We agree, my husband and I agree on that.  That they aren't [MN] really real.  [LAUGH]  They're just more entertainment and stuff and they're all acting.
L:  Yes.  I mean, you can put somebody on the island for thirty days, or something like that, and not give 'em nothing to eat and everything.  They're going to have to catch their own food and all this stuff.  I don't believe -- well, I don't believe they on this -- they just on this for the [several inaudible words] by the time they being filmed.  The rest of the time I don't think they doing all this stuff.  It's just a show I believe. 
R:  Yeah.  It's like you only -- you're only seeing a little bit so what are they doing the other twenty three hours that they're not showing us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are they just sitting back?  I mean, definitely on Survivor they don't look too healthy, but I can't imagine they're, um, really living that life twenty fours a day.  
L:  That's the truth.  And all [several inaudible words] then, like I say before, what's real about the -- I mean, really if you go at the -- if you get cau- -- get out there in the wilderness by accident and you have to survive some of that.  That's realness.  But you getting pushed out there because you trying to win money, there's nothing real about that.  
R:  Right.
L:  That's why I said they just playing on American intellect by telling them this is a reality show.  
R:  I know but somehow they keep getting more and more out there.
L:  Yeah, but -- yeah, like ever since that first season there have been more and more reality -- reality type shows like this.  And, like I said, I don't find nothing real about 'em.  Like I watched the first one -- the first --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- few pilots -- first few episode of pilot series of Survivor.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And out of that -- after the first three shows there weren't nothing real about that because, like you said, the people were looking bad and some were looking bad.  There was someone was getting off the island to get down to the last few people, and they was like -- but they got [inaudible] to vote who off the island they want.  Like who the +weakest link, they going to k- kick the person they want off the island.  
R:  So they can try to be the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the winner.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, it's like I -- I -- I kind of hope they stop doing these.  Like just -- I don't enjoy 'em.  And --
L:  I know, but there must be some -- there must be a large segment of the population that do enjoy 'em because if they didn't enjoy 'em, and somebody wouldn't watch them, they wouldn't be doing 'em.  And that's one thing else about the reality show.  Like after they show it one time, it's not like these, uh, these sitcoms.  Um, you can still show a sitcom and then you can come back and have it -- have reruns on it and to go into syndication.  Would you want to see a reality show and then go back and say, "Oh, let's see this reality show ag- again two years".  Well, I [inaudible] know what happened already.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, even though you know what happened on sitcoms, um, it's still funny or something.
R:  Right.
L:  But you go -- you wouldn't sit back and watch the reality show again because you already know what's going to happen.  You know whose going to win so there's no mystery to it.  
R:  Yeah, that's true.  So, I gu- -- there's no resale value, um --
L:  Yeah, that's -- I think that's the reason that they keep developing more and more of those reality shows because there's no resale value.  They don't -- they don't go in syndication or anything.
R:  That is true.  I never really thought of that aspect.
L:  So
