R:  Katherine.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Betty.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  This is Betty.  What's your name?
R:  Oh, okay.  Hi.
L:  Hi.  What's your name?
R:  I'm Katherine.
L:  Hi, Katherine. How are you?
R:  Really, why not?
L:  Katherine, do you watch these TV shows?
R:  Oh.
L:  No?
R:  I -- I've been watching American Idol a little bit.  [MN]  I don't know, I think it's interesting.  The radio shows here have been talking a lot about how those things are rigged though.  Like most of the main topics around.
L:  I'm having a very difficult time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- understanding you.
R:  Yeah.  And I don't know.  I watch the masked one the other night.  I don't know, it's like Mr Personality where all the guys wear masks.  Yeah, that was [LAUGH] ridiculous.  It was very -- very odd.
L:  Actually I don't watch television.
R:  I didn't even last that long.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't --
R:  Yeah, and, mm, I watch -- there's one where like the -- there'd be three suitors and like a daughter or a son and then they all competed and they had to, like, the parents got to pick who got to go on.  Yeah, I like that.  I think that one was funny.  Yeah.  And then there was like Who Wants to Marry My Mom, and so like three old guys would be there and the sons got to pick.  Um, not always.  [LAUGH]  But it was -- it was a good show.  It was entertaining to watch, so ...  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why do you think people watch those shows so much?  
L:  I have no idea and they're not for me.  I don't watch them so I really don't have an opinion on this situation.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, I really don't know anything about them.  I -- I see previews and they really don't interest me.  They don't challenge me.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I guess so.  And I guess [NOISE] they're not even that suspenseful though, you know.
L:  I'm sorry?  [PAUSE]  Hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I personally don't care for them.
R:  And I guess with the -- even people when they start realizing that the shows are rigged and they're planned out and things like that.  I think it's something to do with [NOISE], you know, they want to watch it to, uh, [NOISE] to see [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- to see, you know, how it's rigged and how it's going to keep going and, you know.
L:  Perhaps.  
R:  So ...
L:  Um, I -- I don't --
R:  Yeah.  Hm.  [LAUGH]  What else to talk about?  [LAUGH]
L:  Would you like -- would you like to participate in those type of shows?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You would?  Hello?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I don't know.  I don't really know what the appeals are.  
L:  I really don't care --
R:  Hm.  I guess being -- for American Idol I guess I like to see the pretty girls and the pretty boys, and they're like seventeen and eighteen.  Have you seen that one where it's, uh, like, America's most talented kid and it's all the little kids?
L:  No, not really.  What is it about?  Tell me what it's about.
R:  Oh really.  What is -- what [several inaudible words] about.
L:  What is it about?
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  There was one little four year old and she could, like, tell you who all the world leaders were and it was [LAUGH] really interesting.  Yeah.  And then there was -- actually, there was another one, and this girl came out and she was like fourteen and she's going to do, like, a cabaret dance routine.  And she was in, like, a little bikini and then, like, in between her stomach and her legs were this netting and she looked like porn star, a stripper or something.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And her parents were fine with that.  And I though she looked awful.  Her belly button was showing and ... 
L:  Not good.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's not, uh -- the Mr Personality.  Yeah.  With, uh, the masks.
L:  Which one did you -- which one did you like the best?
R:  I thought it was so funny when they announced who it was.  I don't know.  Maybe a lot of people watch it just to see her because she's changed so much since she was first introduced to the public.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't even watch that far.  I only watched it for, like, ten minutes but it was so silly.  So, yeah.  I don't know.  
L:  Do you watch these shows all the time?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she has to kiss them.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  And there's only one ugly guy out of all of them.  He's not even that ugly.  He's not even that -- that bad, but the rest of them ...
L:  You like them?
R:  But, you know, like, by the end of the show he's -- she's going to end up with the ugly guy because that's the whole basis of the show.  [LAUGH]  You know, like ...  Yeah, so how is that not rigged?  
L:  Of course it is, and it's fun to watch it.
R:  So, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh, in the meantime, what other shows do you watch besides those two?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure she'll get paid.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [MN]  Yeah.  But did you see the one that was, like, Joe Millionaire, I think it was called?
L:  No, tell me about it.
R:  Yeah.  With all the girls.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, tell me about it.  How did you make out with that one?
R:  I thought that was -- I don't know I thought it was so interesting because by the end of it, it was obvious he would become a millionaire by the time, you know -- he was then doing commercials and signing things and writing a book, and so, I mean, it wasn't like [NOISE] he wasn't going to become a millionaire afterwards anyway.  [NOISE]  Mhm.  [PAUSE]  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  It was great.
R:  I know, I'm on a bus.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry.  I -- I'm having a problem hearing you.  What is that background noise that you have there?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Seriously.  So ...
L:  Are you in a train station or something?
R:  Yeah.  I wonder how much time we have left.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you in a train station?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I made one other one.  So ...  Oh, it was awful, it was like what's the worst, smoking, drinking, gossiping, overeating or [MN] not exercising enough.  And we had to talk about it for ten minutes.  Yeah, it was bad.  And he had this thick Hungarian accent and I couldn't understand him.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Well, I'm having a diffi- --
R:  So, it was pretty bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  And what are you suppose to --
R:  Yeah, and have you done it before?
L:  No.  
R:  Oh.  Where you calling from?
L:  I'm in Florida.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay, but you're on a cell phone --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- or something and I'm having a hard time 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- understanding you.  
R:  Mm, I don't know what else to talk about.  [inaudible] reality TV shows.  
L:  But the millionaire was -- was something different.  Was that the one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was just on a couple of month ago or is that the one --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that was on a couple of years ago?  Where they had that woman who married the guy and went to Vegas and then after they were in Vegas she discovered she didn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like him and she wanted a divorce?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Is that the one? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean that's bizarre.
R:  Yeah.  I think those shows are probably more popular with -- mm, I don't know who they would be more popular with.  Who do you think they would be like the -- you know, what age group it?  [NOISE]
L:  I would say between twenty and -- and thirty.  They would be the ones that would be the most popular in that arena.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think older than that I don't think you would want to get involved.  That certainly wouldn't be my way of looking at it.
R:  Yeah.  My parents really like American Idol, they've been watching it, like, every night.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They watched the two hour special [inaudible] and I don't even stay up for that.
L:  Well ...
R:  So, yeah.  
L:  But, um, Who Married --
R:  One of the interesting things about American Idol is that there -- there was one girl who got, you know, she was eliminated like earlier on and she went on and she's +done like TV shows and she sings on TV now.  And the girl who actually won, she just put out a CD and I don't think I know anybody who ha- -- you know, has it or ...  I've never seen her.  So ...
L:  Well, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.  I guess it didn't work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, and -- and you know it's a shame but they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  She sat there and cried for two hours over the head of the fact that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the guy picked somebody else or she picked somebody else.  I forgot what that deal was.  But it was different.  I mean, it -- it -- it was entertaining and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopefully everybody took it as entertaining, not as anything else.  I mean, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how anybody could seriously entertain the thought of getting a boyfriend or a husband --
R:  Yeah, and they --
L:  -- on TV.
R:  -- pay to get you made over and things like that.  
L:  Well, it -- it was maybe a nice experience.
R:  And that -- yeah.
L:  But that would be basically it.  I mean --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- I wouldn't want to go too far.
R:  And to have all the spa days.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wouldn't want to go too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- far with that situation.
R:  And on The Bachelor, like, I don't think any of those people married the people they -- they chose.  
L:  Oh, didn't they?  I thought they did.  Well, that's good.  And I'm glad to hear that
