IRAQ BEING ONE OF THEM SYRIA BEING ONE OF THEM THOSE ARE OUR ENEMIES AND MY INTEREST IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF IN FREEING THOSE PEOPLE  (fe_03_02558-B-0028)
THOUGH CERTAINLY I'M IN FAVOR OF IT  (fe_03_02558-B-0029)
BUT OUR GOVERNMENT IS ACTING TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS OUR COUNTRY FROM THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DOING HARM TO US  (fe_03_02558-B-0030)

HE LIVES DOWN IN VIRGINIA HIS NAME IS AH LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROBERT PATTERSON HE LIVES IN ATLANTA  (fe_03_02558-B-0044)
HE WAS ONE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS HE WAS ONE OF THE AI- MILITARY AIDES IT WAS LIKE THE HEIGHT OF HIS NOT THE HEIGHT BUT  (fe_03_02558-B-0045)
YOU KNOW HE HAD SERVED IN COMBAT IN MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND THEN AT SOME POINT HE WAS OFFERED THIS POSITION TO BE THE MILITARY ATTACHE TO CARRY THE NUCLEAR FOOTBALL AROUND FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HE DID THAT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS I THINK HE WRITES IN THIS BOOK FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON  (fe_03_02558-B-0046)
AND HE TALKS ABOUT THAT A CERTAIN POINT IN TIME THE ENTI- THE ENTIRE GROUP OF AH OF AH MILITARY OFFICERS WERE THINKING OF RESIGNING EN MASSE  (fe_03_02558-B-0047)
BECAUSE THEY FELT THE THE PRESIDENT WAS DERELICT IN HIS DUTY  (fe_03_02558-B-0048)
WHAT HE WRITES IN THERE IS TREMENDOUSLY TROUBLING TO ME BUT IT CONFIRMS A IDEA THAT CROSSED MY MIND A WHILE AGO AND THAT IS FOR THE YEARS THAT MR CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT AH  (fe_03_02558-B-0050)
AND I'M THE SAME AGE AS THE PRESIDENT SO IT'S A DISGRACE AS I FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO MY GENERATION THAT THE BEST WE COULD DO WAS WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON BECAUSE  (fe_03_02558-B-0051)
DURING THOSE EIGHT YEARS  (fe_03_02558-B-0052)
THERE WAS NO COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY AND THOSE EIGHT YEARS WHERE THE WOR- WHERE THIS COUNTRY EXISTED WITHOUT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THEREFORE THE WORLD EXISTED WITHOUT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES  (fe_03_02558-B-0053)

IT WAS A LONG DECLINE IT WAS 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK OF HIMSELF NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT BUSH HAS TO G- WELL GET INTO A A A AN AIR FORCE OUTFIT AND FLY AROUND THAT MAY BE GOING TOO MUCH THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT IT'S THE THE POINT IS  (fe_03_02558-B-0055)
THAT CLINTON DID NOT SEE HIMSELF AS CAPABLE OF COMMANDING THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_02558-B-0056)
WELL  (fe_03_02558-B-0057)
WELL HE CAN SURROUND HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE CAPABLE BUT HE HAS TO HAVE IT WITHIN HIMSELF  (fe_03_02558-B-0058)
TO GIVE ORDERS TO DO THINGS AND HE HAS TO TRUMAN WAS A SHORT LITTLE GUY BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND HE STOOD UP AND SAID TO GENERAL MCARTHUR  (fe_03_02558-B-0059)
YOU'RE FIRED  (fe_03_02558-B-0060)
THAT'S HE HAS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO LEAD THEM AND FOR THEM TO FEEL THAT THE THE MILITARY TO FEEL THEY'RE BEING LED BY SOMEONE THAT'S MY VIEW  (fe_03_02558-B-0061)
