DISARMING IR- IRAQ  (fe_03_02584-A-0007)
SO  (fe_03_02584-A-0008)
[LAUGHTER] PUT THE TOE IN THE WATER  (fe_03_02584-A-0009)
WELL I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE A HARD ONE TO TALK TO BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THINGS IN BLACK AND WHITE  (fe_03_02584-A-0010)
UM  (fe_03_02584-A-0011)
MY FEELING IS  (fe_03_02584-A-0012)
UH THAT WE DON'T WE ARE NOT PRIVY TO ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS  (fe_03_02584-A-0013)
BUT CERTAINLY IF WE EVER WANT TO GET TO A UH PLACE OF TOTAL WORLD PEACE  (fe_03_02584-A-0014)
THEN THAT MEANS THAT THOSE THAT WHO TRULY DESIRE PEACE CAN'T TOLERATE TYRANTS  (fe_03_02584-A-0015)
AND UM WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO SOMEONE IS KINDA WHERE I AM  (fe_03_02584-A-0016)
SO I GUESS IT'S YOUR TURN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02584-A-0017)
UH MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN FACT I THINK UH BUSH IS GONNA BE ON T._V. TONIGHT TO TO TELL US THAT THE  (fe_03_02584-A-0018)
THE WAR PART IS ACTUALLY OVER BUT OF COURSE THERE'S STILL BORDERS THAT HAVE TO BE  (fe_03_02584-A-0019)
UH MAINTAINED BECAUSE THERE ARE THREATS FROM OUTSIDE THE BORDERS  (fe_03_02584-A-0020)
AND UH BUT AS FAR AS AS UH PUSHING IN AND TAKING OVER NEW TERRITORY THAT PART OF IT'S PRETTY MUCH OVER WITH  (fe_03_02584-A-0021)
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WERE AFRAID WERE GOING TO HAPPEN DIDN'T HAPPEN  (fe_03_02584-A-0022)
RETALIATION  (fe_03_02584-A-0023)
AND AND EVEN I MEAN EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID THAT THEY DID HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND THEY DID EXPOSE IT AND YOU KNOW AND THEY WOULD THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING WITH IT BUT THE TRUTH IS IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S THERE FOR ALL WE KNOW THERE ARE  (fe_03_02584-A-0024)
THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF DESERT WHERE ANYTHING COULD BE HIDDEN THEY COULD STILL HAVE ONE AND OR THEY COULD HAVE IMPORTED IT TO ANOTHER CORNER COUNTRY AND  (fe_03_02584-A-0025)
AND DETONATE AND DETONATE IT FROM THERE SO I THINK THE FEAR OF DOING NOTHING IS IS REALLY NOT A VERY GOOD REASON TO NOT DO NOTHING  (fe_03_02584-A-0026)
MYSELF  (fe_03_02584-A-0027)
SO  (fe_03_02584-A-0028)

TO REPEL LIKE THERE WAS UH IN THE CURRENT SITUATION  (fe_03_02584-A-0033)
SO I MEAN IT WAS JUST BIN LADEN AND A FEW OF HIS CRONIES NOT NOT THE ORGANIZED MILITIA THAT  (fe_03_02584-A-0034)
WE'RE DOING NOW SO ONCE IN A WHILE THEY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S THE WAY THE NEWS IS THEY WHATEVER THE HOT TOPIC IS AT THE MOMENT  (fe_03_02584-A-0035)

UH SOME DECISIONS AND AND WE CAN ONLY MAKE THEM FOR OURSELVES  (fe_03_02584-A-0043)
WELL YOU SEE THAT'S THE THING AS LONG AS PEOPLE DON'T VOTE INTELLIGENTLY OR DON'T VOTE AT ALL  (fe_03_02584-A-0044)

BECAUSE THE MAJORITY TENDS TO FOLLOW WHOEVER  (fe_03_02584-A-0053)
IS GOING TO OFFER THEM SOMETHING AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT THAT'S THE WAY THEIR VOTES WILL GO  (fe_03_02584-A-0054)
