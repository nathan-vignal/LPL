TERRORIST ATTACK  (fe_03_02583-B-0031)
YEAH WELL I'M I I THINK IT IS BECAUSE  (fe_03_02583-B-0032)
A- ALL THESE PEOPLE IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE THEY FIND OUT NOW THAT ALL OF 'EM WERE ALL THE PEOPLE BEING TORTURED AND KILLED AND IT MAKES ME THINK OF LIKE HITLER DURING WORLD WAR TWO WHAT HE DID  (fe_03_02583-B-0033)
AND SO LIKE ALL THESE  (fe_03_02583-B-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_02583-B-0035)
I DON'T KNOW I I CAN'T TELL BUT I WOULD IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT THAT THEY WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO WITH THE F._B._I. AND THE C._I._A.  (fe_03_02583-B-0036)
THAT THEY HAVE MORE INTELLIGENCE AND AND THAT THEY WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT UH  (fe_03_02583-B-0037)
ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_02583-B-0038)
'CAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER FOUND ANY OF THESE WEAPONS THAT THEY SAID OR THEY NEVER FOUND ANY OF THIS POISON I DON'T KNOW I SAW SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY WHO SAID WELL YEAH THEY DID FIND IT BUT THEY DON'T WANNA TELL US I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULD WOULDN'T WANNA TELL US BECAUSE THAT'S SO  (fe_03_02583-B-0039)
ONE OF THE REASONS THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING THERE WAS TO TRY TO FIND THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_02583-B-0040)
YEAH  (fe_03_02583-B-0041)
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY W- IF THEY FOUND 'EM THEY WOULD WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE AND THAT THAT LIKE  (fe_03_02583-B-0042)
THE ATTACKING IRAQ WAS JUSTIFIED  (fe_03_02583-B-0043)
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SAID WELL OH YEAH THEY FOUND 'EM BUT THE BUT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS DOESN'T WANT US TO KNOW WELL HOW DOES THAT PERSON KNOW WHAT MAKES THAT PERSON SO SMART  (fe_03_02583-B-0044)
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT ANY MORE AND AND AND NO MATTER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY WELL THEY DON'T BELIEVE 'EM  (fe_03_02583-B-0045)
I THINK THAT WHAT THEY  (fe_03_02583-B-0046)
ALL THE PEOPLE I MEAN YOU SAW THE  (fe_03_02583-B-0047)
IF YOU SAW ON TELEVISION I MEAN WHEN THE UNITED STATES WHEN THEY WERE COMING INTO IRAQ THE PEOPLE ON THE ALL THE CITIZENS STANDING AND CHEERING I MEAN IT  (fe_03_02583-B-0048)
IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD THAT WE WERE HELPING THESE PEOPLE  (fe_03_02583-B-0049)
YEAH I KNOW THAT TOO  (fe_03_02583-B-0050)
BUT SOMETIMES UM OR LIKE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY'RE PULLING DOWN THE STATUES AND THINGS THEY WERE HAPPY LIKE WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT THEN LATER ON ONCE UH  (fe_03_02583-B-0051)
THE LOOTING STARTED AND EVERYTHING THEY WERE ALL OF SUDDEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ANGRY WITH THE UNITED STATES THEY WANT THEY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS GONNA IS GONNA BE IN CHARGE OVER THERE INSTEAD OF ELECTING SOMEBODY TO  (fe_03_02583-B-0052)
TO BE THEIR REPRESENTATIVE SO THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_02583-B-0053)
NO I DON'T THINK THE UNITED STATES IS GONNA TAKE OVER THEY WANT I THINK THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UH  (fe_03_02583-B-0054)
THERE'S A LOT OF RELIGIOUS FANATICS OVER THERE WHO I'M SURE WOULD LOVE TO BE IN CHARGE LIKE EVEN PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SYRIA IRAN  (fe_03_02583-B-0055)
THEY WAN THAT WANNA ALREADY THEY WANNA MOVE IN THERE AND TAKE OVER  (fe_03_02583-B-0056)
SO THEY SEE WHERE SEE WHERE IT'S A BIG  (fe_03_02583-B-0057)
A BIG POWER THING AND AND THE BIG THING OVER THERE I THINK IS THE OIL YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SOMEBODY MOVES IN THERE AND ALL THEY SEE IS ALL THE MONEY  (fe_03_02583-B-0058)
THAT THAT HUSSEIN HAS FROM ALL THIS OIL AND AND THAT'S ALL THEY CAN SEE IS HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE BE REAL RICH JUST LIKE HE WAS  (fe_03_02583-B-0059)
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE AND THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO WATCH BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO TO BE OVER THERE ALL THE TIME AND AND LIKE BE IN CHARGE BECAUSE  (fe_03_02583-B-0060)
FOR ONE THING IT'S A THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND PEOPLE IN THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES THEY WHOLE THEY HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ATTITUDE AND A WHOLE DIFFERENT HERITAGE THAT THAT  (fe_03_02583-B-0061)
WE'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  (fe_03_02583-B-0062)
SO I  (fe_03_02583-B-0063)
IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO GET SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT THAT KNOWS THE IRAQI PEOPLE MAYBE ONE OF THESE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF  (fe_03_02583-B-0064)
H- HUSSEIN AND AND GET ONE OF GET MAYBE ONE OF THOSE LEADERS GET THEM TO COME BACK BUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE IT HAS TO BE WHO THE PEOPLE WANT BECAUSE IF THE PEOPLE DON'T SUPPORT 'EM IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN  (fe_03_02583-B-0065)
AND SO I THINK NOW THAT NOW THAT IT'S DONE IN IRAQ I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO MOVE INTO OTHER COUNTRIES I THINK THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SHOULD STAY THERE FOR A WHILE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THINGS ARE ARE  (fe_03_02583-B-0066)
KEPT PEACEFUL AND THEN  (fe_03_02583-B-0067)
YEAH AND THEN AND THEN MOVE OUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO TO KEEP ALL THE OTHER WAR  (fe_03_02583-B-0068)
EQUIPMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THERE WE CAN MOVE OUT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE OVER  (fe_03_02583-B-0069)
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW AND EVERYBODY WAS WORRIED THERE WAS GONNA BE ALL KINDS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES WELL THERE STILL COULD BE I THINK THE PEOP-  (fe_03_02583-B-0070)
I I  (fe_03_02583-B-0071)
SURE THEY'RE JUST WAITING ON THE ON THE SIDELINES  (fe_03_02583-B-0072)
THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T FIND ALL THESE WEAPONS 'CAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAD ALL THIS TIME TO MOVE 'EM OUT SO THEY'RE NOT THERE BUT THEY  (fe_03_02583-B-0073)
THEY STILL COULD BE AROUND AND THE THE TERRORISTS ARE STILL THERE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN KILLED AND SO I THINK THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO KEEP THEIR GUARD UP  (fe_03_02583-B-0074)
YOU START LETTING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW FLY IN THE AIRPLANES YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER DISASTER LIKE THEY HAD IN NEW YORK  (fe_03_02583-B-0075)
YEAH  (fe_03_02583-B-0076)
BUT NOW THAT THEY  (fe_03_02583-B-0077)
THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW I THINK WHEN THEY KEEP THEY KEEP TELLING EVERYBODY THAT TO  (fe_03_02583-B-0078)
