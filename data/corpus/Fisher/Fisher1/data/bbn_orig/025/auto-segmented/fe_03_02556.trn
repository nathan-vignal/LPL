UH-HUH  (fe_03_02556-A-0009)
AND THEY ARE CHEAPER TO PRODUCE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT USING ACTORS  (fe_03_02556-A-0010)
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ACTORS AND THEY'RE NOT UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0011)
THEY'RE NOT WRITTEN PER SE SO YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT I THINK PEOPLE I THINK PEOPLE WATCH THEM BECAUSE IT IT THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE VICARIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THEY WANNA BE THOSE PEOPLE  (fe_03_02556-A-0012)
SO THEY THEY KIND OF LIKE THEY KIND OF TRANSFER THEIR AH  (fe_03_02556-A-0013)
THEIR INTERESTS  (fe_03_02556-A-0014)
AND THAT PER SE THEY KIND OF WISH THAT THEY WERE LIKE YOU KNOW WHO WANTS WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE FOR EXAMPLE THEY KIND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THEIR FANTASY  (fe_03_02556-A-0015)
SO IT'S AN ESCAPE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_02556-A-0016)

BECAUSE THESE ARE THESE ARE NOT ACTORS THESE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT THEY THEIR COWO- THESE COULD BE THEIR COWORKERS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND SUCH THERE THERE'S SOME SENSE OF  (fe_03_02556-A-0018)
OF CONNECTION  (fe_03_02556-A-0019)
BUT AT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A FANTASY AS WELL THEY KIND OF LIKE WISH THEY WISH THEY WERE A PARTICIPANT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN SOMEBODY SITTING ON THE COUCH THEY'RE KIND OF  (fe_03_02556-A-0020)
IN THE SCENE WHERE A SOAP OPERA  (fe_03_02556-A-0021)
IT IT KIND OF TAKES ON A DIFFERENT TANGENT DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE  (fe_03_02556-A-0022)
YEAH SO WHAT SOAP OPERAS DO YOU WATCH  (fe_03_02556-A-0023)
I'M A BIG ONE LIFE TO LIVE FAN  (fe_03_02556-A-0025)

YEAH THAT WAS THAT WAS A COOL THAT WAS THAT'S WHAT STARTED IT ALL  (fe_03_02556-A-0029)
THAT'S WHERE THEY TAKE UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0030)
LIKE FIVE YOU KNOW COLLEGE GRADUATES SOME OF THEM WEREN'T EVEN COLLEGE AND TAKE 'EM TO SOME REMOTE PLACE  (fe_03_02556-A-0031)
NOT REMOTE BUT LIKE YOU KNOW SOME TOWN AND AND JUST FILM THEM FOR LIKE TWELVE WEEKS AND ALL THE INTERACTIONS AND THEY WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF THING THAT THEY HAD TO DO LIKE EITHER BE A D._J. ON A RADIO STATION  (fe_03_02556-A-0033)
OR UM SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE  (fe_03_02556-A-0034)
WHAT THESE REALITY SHOWS  (fe_03_02556-A-0035)
YEAH I WOULD THINK SO I THINK THEY'RE I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SHOW THOUGH LIKE WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE OR THE BACHELORETTE OR THE BACHELORETTE I THINK REALLY ATTRACTS UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0036)
AH WOMEN I MEAN THE BACHELOR  (fe_03_02556-A-0037)
I THINK THAT THAT UM BUT I ALSO HEARD THAT MEN WATCH THAT SHOW TOO BUT BUT I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION A LOT OF WOMEN  (fe_03_02556-A-0038)
WATCH THE BACHELOR JUST TO SEE  (fe_03_02556-A-0039)
YEAH A NICE LOOKING GUY AND HOW MANY YOU KNOW AND THE CAT FIGHTS I GUESS AND I HEARD A LOT OF THAT IS UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0040)
YOU KNOW DON'T FORGET THEY FILM LIKE FOR A ZILLION HOURS AND THEY ONLY USE LIKE ONE PERCENT OF IT ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT  (fe_03_02556-A-0041)

THEY'LL PUT THE CAMERA ON FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN THEY'LL TAKE THE PARTS  (fe_03_02556-A-0043)
THAT THEY WANT THE VIEWERS TO SEE SO THEREFORE  (fe_03_02556-A-0044)
YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS IT IS RIGGED IN A LOT OF WAYS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE TOTAL THE BEFORE AND THE AFTER YOU'RE JUST SEEING THE EVENT  (fe_03_02556-A-0045)
SO IT IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMETHING MORE DRAMATIC HAPPENED THAN REALLY HAPPENED  (fe_03_02556-A-0046)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_02556-A-0047)
AND ALSO I THINK IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS DON'T YOU I MEAN LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO AH WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE WHERE WHERE SHE HAD TO LIKE GET AN ANNULMENT AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE I THOUGHT  (fe_03_02556-A-0048)
I THINK HE WAS REAL BUT I THINK HE HAD A SHADY PAST I  (fe_03_02556-A-0049)
THINK I THINK HE ABUSED HIS FIRST WIFE OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_02556-A-0050)
BUT UM YEAH AND IT BUT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WANT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02556-A-0051)
THEIR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME TOO  (fe_03_02556-A-0052)
OH THE COURT T._V.  (fe_03_02556-A-0053)

AH YOU THINK THOSE IT DEPENDS I HEARD LIKE DIVORCE COURT REMEMBER THE OLD T._V. SHOW DIVORCE COURT  (fe_03_02556-A-0055)
THAT WAS RIGGED  (fe_03_02556-A-0056)
BECAUSE I HAD SOME FRIENDS WHO WERE ACTORS WHO WERE ON THAT SHOW  (fe_03_02556-A-0057)
SO YEAH SO I THINK THEY WERE THEY WERE THE SCRIPT THE UM THE CASES MIGHT HAVE BEEN REAL BUT THOSE WERE ACTORS PLAYING THE PARTS  (fe_03_02556-A-0058)
SO UM YEAH I BUT I I THINK IT'S ANOTHER TYPE OF AH REALITY SHOW  (fe_03_02556-A-0059)
BUT UM I WONDER WHAT THE HAVE YOU HEARD ANY OF ANY REALITY SHOWS THAT ARE GONNA BE LIKE DOWN THE PIPE THAT ARE COMING UP  (fe_03_02556-A-0060)
YEAH I THINK UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0061)
THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSTANT- THERE THERE'S THIS NEW ONE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE REAL BEVERLY HILLBILLIES WHERE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0062)
REAL HILLBILLIES FROM THE AH APPALACHIANS  (fe_03_02556-A-0063)

HOW THEY COPE  (fe_03_02556-A-0066)

AND UM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN APPALACHIANS OR THE APPALACHIANS ARE GETTING ARE VERY UPSET  (fe_03_02556-A-0068)
BUT UM YEAH THERE'S A WHOLE BIG SEARCH FOR I DON'T KNOW THEY MAY EVEN FOUND THEM BUT SEE THE WHOLE THING IS LIKE WHAT YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION THESE ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE AND THEY GAIN VERY VERY HIGH RATINGS  (fe_03_02556-A-0069)
'CAUSE AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE SO CURIOUS  (fe_03_02556-A-0070)
AND SUCH ABOUT HOW IT'S ALL GONNA PLAY OUT IT'S KIND OF IT IS KIND OF LIKE A SOAP OPERA  (fe_03_02556-A-0072)
I MEAN I THINK IT'S MORE SIMILAR THAN THAN DISSIMILAR THESE REALITY SHOWS TO A SOAP OPERA  (fe_03_02556-A-0073)
BECAUSE THE THE SAME CURIOSITY  (fe_03_02556-A-0074)
TAKES PLACE  (fe_03_02556-A-0075)
RIGHT RIGHT MUCH SHORTER  (fe_03_02556-A-0076)
AND THE DRAMA BUT THE SAME SIMILAR TYPES OF DRAMA WHERE PEOPLE CHEAT AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE  (fe_03_02556-A-0077)
SO UM YEAH I I JUST THINK THAT THESE REALITY SHOWS  (fe_03_02556-A-0078)
I THINK MORE PEOPLE LIKE THEM THAN DON'T LIKE THEM AND PEOPLE I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS  (fe_03_02556-A-0079)
BUT TO ME WITH THE WHOLE PHENOMENON OF SURVIVOR  (fe_03_02556-A-0080)
THAT STARTED IN THAT STARTED IN ENGLAND DIDN'T IT  (fe_03_02556-A-0081)

RIGHT AND THEN BUT THEN THEY HAVE IT THEN THEY HAD TEMPTATION ISLAND DID YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_02556-A-0083)
WELL THAT WAS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT WHERE THEY WOULD TAKE SIX COUPLES  (fe_03_02556-A-0084)
AND UM THEY THEY WEREN'T MARRIED BUT THEY WERE CLOSE TO MARRIAGE  (fe_03_02556-A-0085)
AND THEN THEY HAD TO GO ON A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND UM  (fe_03_02556-A-0086)
SO THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THEN WOMEN WERE WITH THE MEN AND MEN WERE WITH THE WOMEN STRANGERS AND SEE IF THEY  (fe_03_02556-A-0087)
IF THEY WOULD BE HOOKING UP OR NOT  (fe_03_02556-A-0088)
SO THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL  (fe_03_02556-A-0089)
BUT IT'S INTERESTING MOST PEOPLE  (fe_03_02556-A-0090)
ARE NOT I MEAN SOME PEOPLE ARE ARE CRITICAL OF IT BUT MOST PEOPLE SEE  (fe_03_02556-A-0091)
