YEAH WHAT IF ANYTHING WE SH THOUGHT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT DISARMING IRAQ OR  (fe_03_02588-A-0009)
DONE ABOUT IRAQ  (fe_03_02588-A-0010)

AND FRANKLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE SHOWING ON THE NEWS IS JUST TOO GRAPHIC  (fe_03_02588-A-0016)
HE'S  (fe_03_02588-A-0017)
HE'S A VERY SENSITIVE LITTLE CHILD I MEAN  (fe_03_02588-A-0018)
HE WASN'T EVEN A YEAR OLD WHEN THE TERRORISTS ATTACKED  (fe_03_02588-A-0019)
THE TRADE CENTRES AND HE SAID AND HE WAS CRYING ON MY LAP HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY MOMMY WAS UPSET  (fe_03_02588-A-0020)

[NOISE] YOU KNOW THEY SEEM TO EITHER LOVE YOU OR HATE YOU OVER THERE  (fe_03_02588-A-0026)

ONE OF THE MAIN  (fe_03_02588-A-0030)
GO AHEAD [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_02588-A-0031)
[NOISE] RIGHT THE MAJOR COMBAT  (fe_03_02588-A-0032)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02588-A-0033)
RIGHT EXACTLY  (fe_03_02588-A-0034)
WELL AND AND I AGREE WITH YOUR HUSBAND TOTALLY BECAUSE  (fe_03_02588-A-0036)
UH SYRIA HAS STEPPED IN AND BECOME VERY AGGRESSIVE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_02588-A-0037)
WITH THEIR POSITIONS WITH IRAQ  (fe_03_02588-A-0038)
THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY WE WENT INTO IRAQ WAS BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSEDLY HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_02588-A-0039)
AND A A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES ARE SAYING WELL YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THOSE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_02588-A-0040)
NOW WELL I THINK THAT WE HAVE FOUND A LOT OF  (fe_03_02588-A-0041)
UH SMOKING GUNS  (fe_03_02588-A-0042)
I MEAN WHY  (fe_03_02588-A-0043)
DID THEIR TRAINING BUNKERS HAVE TO HAVE ALL THIS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AGAINST CHEMICAL WARFARE IF THEY WEREN'T PRACTICING  (fe_03_02588-A-0044)
AT A  (fe_03_02588-A-0045)
CHEMICAL WARFARE AND THEY DID FIND A PLACE THAT HAD  (fe_03_02588-A-0046)
CHEMICAL  (fe_03_02588-A-0047)
UM  (fe_03_02588-A-0049)
SHELLS BOMB SHELLS  (fe_03_02588-A-0050)
BUT THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY THAT WERE STILL LOADED  (fe_03_02588-A-0051)
SO  (fe_03_02588-A-0052)
I  (fe_03_02588-A-0053)
I HONESTLY THINK THAT WE THAT WE NEED TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT WE'RE  (fe_03_02588-A-0054)
IT THEY WERE JUST SAYING ON THE NEWS YESTERDAY THAT OR DAY BEFORE ONE OF THE TWO  (fe_03_02588-A-0055)
THAT THEY WOULD GO TO PROTECT THE MILITARY INSTALLATION THAT THEY HAD FOUND THAT WAS IRAQ'S  (fe_03_02588-A-0056)
AND TRY TO GET IT THAT BUNKER EMPTY  (fe_03_02588-A-0057)
BUT THEY WOULD LEAVE WITH SOME OF THE MATERIALS AND BY THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD GET BACK IT HAD ALREADY BEEN  (fe_03_02588-A-0058)
EMPTIED AND LOOTED BY  (fe_03_02588-A-0059)
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN THAT AREA  (fe_03_02588-A-0060)
SO IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY YOU KNOW A DIFFICULT THING  (fe_03_02588-A-0061)
TO TRY TO GET IT DONE  (fe_03_02588-A-0062)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02588-A-0063)
WELL THEY THINK THAT IF THEY GET KILLED DURING WAR FOR A SHIITE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENSURED A PLACE IN  (fe_03_02588-A-0064)

HAVE A CHILD BORN AND NOT GET TO SEE 'EM  (fe_03_02588-A-0075)
YEAH  (fe_03_02588-A-0076)
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS ALSO WHY SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO GO AND FIGHT THIS WAR  (fe_03_02588-A-0077)
IF THEY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS A REAL THREAT  (fe_03_02588-A-0078)
