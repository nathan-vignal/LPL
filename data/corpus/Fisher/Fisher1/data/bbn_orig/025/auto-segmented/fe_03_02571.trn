YEAH  (fe_03_02571-A-0094)
WELL [SIGH]  (fe_03_02571-A-0095)
HELLO MY NAME IS PAUL  (fe_03_02571-B-0001)
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY SHARON  (fe_03_02571-B-0002)
OH MOST DEFINITELY MOST DEFINITELY IT'S A HOT DEAD ISSUE  (fe_03_02571-B-0003)
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO IN IRAQ HOW DO YOU BRING DEMOCRACY TO A FUHROCRACY TYPE COUNTRY  (fe_03_02571-B-0004)
OKAY WELL SINCE I HAVE I'VE GOT PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE BEEN IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD  (fe_03_02571-B-0005)
I FIND IT TO BE A VERY INTERESTING CONCEPT BECAUSE THEY DO THEY DID THOSE THO IRAQ IS A COUNTRY THAT'S USED TO BEING CONTROLLED BY AN INDIVIDUAL BY A MILITARY MONARCH IF YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU SEE PICTURES OF PRESIDENTS  (fe_03_02571-B-0006)
AND LEADERS OF COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WEAR A SUIT IN BRITAIN THEY WEAR A SUIT IN JAPAN THEY WEAR A SUIT IN NORTH KOREA THEY WEAR A MILITARY UNIFORM IN IRAQ THEY WEAR A MILITARY UNIFORM IN IRAN  (fe_03_02571-B-0007)
YES  (fe_03_02571-B-0008)
ALL RIGHT SO NOW THIS GUY SADDAM HUSSEIN REGARDLESS OF HOW ANYBODY FEELS ABOUT HIM HE WAS THE MAIN FOCAL POI- POINT OF HATE IN THAT COUNTRY SO YOU HAVE THESE VARIOUS PEOPLE THE SHIITE MUSLIMS THE SUNNI MUSLIMS AND YOU HAVE THE KURDISH PEOPLE  (fe_03_02571-B-0009)
SO THOSE THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE HATED HIM  (fe_03_02571-B-0010)
IN ESSENCE SO HE KEPT THE COUNTRY UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE THEY HAD ONE COMMON ENEMY NOW THAT HE'S DISPLACED FOR AMERICA TO CONTINUE TO STAY THERE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PLACATE ALL THOSE THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_02571-B-0011)
B- BEFORE WE BECOME THE HATED ENEMY  (fe_03_02571-B-0012)
OKAY GO AHEAD  (fe_03_02571-B-0013)
WELL MY MY OPINION ON MY ON THE REALITY OF FOR IT IS THAT IS BEING THAT THEY ALREADY WENT UP THEY ALREADY WENT IN THERE SO YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T WE CAN'T UNDO IT  (fe_03_02571-B-0014)
BUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WIND UP STAYING THERE A LOT LONGER THAN THEY ANTICIPATE STAYING THERE BECAUSE  (fe_03_02571-B-0015)
THE SHIITES MAKE UP SIXTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY BUT THEY NEVER CONTRO- THEY NEVER CONTROLLED IT SADDAM HUSSEIN'S PEOPLE CONTROLLED IT AND HE'S A SUNNI MUSLIM  (fe_03_02571-B-0016)
AND THEY ONLY MAKE UP LIKE FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY THEY HAVE CUT OUT WITH THE KURDISH PEOPLE THAT THEY THAT UH TH- THEY CUT OUT WITH THE KURDISH PEOPLE THAT WAS THEIR BUFFER BETWEEN THE SHIITES THE KURDS AND THE SUNNIS  (fe_03_02571-B-0017)
SO I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT SINCE WE'VE ALREADY WENT IN THERE THE ONLY THING TO DO IS TO PLACE THE BEST GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE IN PLACE BUT THEREIN THEREIN LIES THE RUB OF YOUR PROBLEM WHEN YOU PLACE A GOVERNMENT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY  (fe_03_02571-B-0018)
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE  (fe_03_02571-B-0019)
DOES THAT DOES THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH RESENTMENT AGAINST THIS COUNTRY ANYWAY DOES IT HELP THE RESENTMENT BUILD OR DOES IT PLACATE THE RESENTMENT BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BIGGEST BULLY ON THE BLOCK AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND THE STRONGEST PERSON ON THE BLOCK  (fe_03_02571-B-0020)
PEOPLE FEAR THE STRONG AND AFTER A WHILE THEY START TO RESENT THE STRONG AND THEN THEY FIND WAYS THEY WANNA FIND WAYS TO MAKE THE STRONG TOPPLE OR TO BRING THEM DOWN  (fe_03_02571-B-0021)
SO MY OPINION IS THAT THEY ALREADY WENT IN THERE  (fe_03_02571-B-0023)
TRY TO PUT THE BEST GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE IN PLACE THAT THE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW OR LISTEN TO AND THEN YOU STEP BACK BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK IN THERE AT SOME OTHER POINT IN TIME IF THE SHIITES DECIDE THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY  (fe_03_02571-B-0024)
Y- Y- YOU HAVE TO PLEASE THEM THE REST OF THE WAY REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT HAD A FOCAL POINT OF HATE  (fe_03_02571-B-0025)
THAT WAS SADDAM HUSSEIN NOW THEIR FOCAL OF HATE HAS GONE SO THE THE ANIMOSITY THAT THEY HAVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER  (fe_03_02571-B-0026)
YEAH WELL I I SPENT I SPENT EIGHT YEARS IN THE MILITARY SERVICE AND I W- I WAS LIKE SPECIAL A SPECIAL TYPE OF SOLDIER SO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF GOING INTO THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND TRAINING WHEN AMERICA WAS ON THE SIDE OF IRAQ WHEN THEY FOUGHT AGAINST IRAN  (fe_03_02571-B-0028)
[LAUGHTER] THE  (fe_03_02571-B-0029)
SORT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS ARE SAID TO HAVE WERE NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY PRODUCED ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_02571-B-0030)
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPLIED TO THEM BY FRIENDLY WESTERN COUNTRIES TO MAINTAIN THE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM AND ALL THAT OTHER GOOD STUFF BECAUSE RUSSIA BACKED IRAN IN THAT WAR  (fe_03_02571-B-0031)
YES  (fe_03_02571-B-0032)
SO WHAT IS YOUR OPINION  (fe_03_02571-B-0033)
WELL YOU SEE THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT AMERICA WE'RE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR LIKE UH SOM- UH INTANGIBLE THING I- A- IDEAL  (fe_03_02571-B-0034)
BUT THEY FIGHT FOR REA- YOU KNOW TH- THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE MY PARTICULAR BELIEF  (fe_03_02571-B-0035)
OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE MY PARTICULAR FAITH SEE SO IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO WHEN Y- W- W- W- IF I WANT A GOOD SOLDIER IN A FOX HOLE WITH ME I WANT AN AMERICAN SOLDIER BECAUSE WE WE NUTS  (fe_03_02571-B-0036)
YOU SEE THEY HAVE A SPECIFIC IDEAL THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A JIHAD THAT'S A HOLY WAR YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A NAME FOR EACH THING THAT THEY DO SO WHEN YOU DEAL WITH ISS- WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE  (fe_03_02571-B-0038)
THE THE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE LIKE THAT THEY'LL JUMP OFF A ROOF FOR THEIR BELIEF  (fe_03_02571-B-0039)
OR EXPLODE THEMSELVES I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT NOW  (fe_03_02571-B-0040)
WHEN I WAS IN VIETNAM I USED TO WATCH THE TIBETAN MONKS THAT WERE AGAINST THE WAR  (fe_03_02571-B-0041)
SET THEMSELVES ON FIRE  (fe_03_02571-B-0042)
AND THEY WOULD NOT MOVE I MEAN IF I THOUGHT I WAS BURNING MY HAND I WOULD BE HOLLERING AND SCREA- THEY SET THEMSELVES ON FIRE AND STAYED RIGHT INTO THAT POSITION UNTIL THEIR BODY FALL OVER  (fe_03_02571-B-0043)
WELL LOOK LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS OF  (fe_03_02571-B-0044)
IN AMERICA WE NEVER CAN WE'LL NEVER BE POOR OR HUNGRY BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S YOU KNOW THINGS IN PLACE TO TAKE CARE OF US  (fe_03_02571-B-0045)
IN COUNTRIES LIKE THAT YOU HAVE THE RULING CLASS OR THE RULING PARTY THAT CONTROLS ALL THE MONEY DOLES IT OUT ONLY TO THOSE THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN PLACATE OR PUT ON THEIR SIDES AND THIS IS HOW IRAQ WAS RUNNING ALL THESE YEARS  (fe_03_02571-B-0046)
THIS IS HOW MOST OF THOSE COUNTRIES RUN IN  (fe_03_02571-B-0047)
EURO ASIA OR MIC- OR ASIA MINOR THAT'S HOW MOST OF THE COUNTRIES MOST OF THE COUNTRIES RUN SO SINCE THEY RUN LIKE THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE AN  (fe_03_02571-B-0048)
ENTIRELY BRAND NEW SYSTEM YES SOME PEOPLE WILL EMBRACE IT BECAUSE THE CAPITALISM ASPECT WILL COME INTO PLACE THEY WANT MONEY BUT NOW YOU ST- SO WHAT YOU NOW YOU DO YOU CREATE THREE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_02571-B-0049)
THE RULING CLASS THEY'RE SLIGHTLY OUT OF POWER BUT THEY'RE GOING TO STILL HAVE A LITTLE POWER IN THERE THOSE THAT ARE STRONGEST FROM THE WEAKEST OF THE PEOPLE TO GRAB ON TO HOLD ONTO THINGS AND YOU STILL HAVE THE WEAKER SET OF PEOPLE SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T SOLVED YOUR PROBLEM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02571-B-0050)
WELL THEY REALISED THAT BUT THEY THEY NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE ONLY THING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT IS QUICK VICTORY AND  (fe_03_02571-B-0051)
NOT TOO MANY DEATHS BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO DISCUSS THE AFTERMATH  (fe_03_02571-B-0052)
BECAUSE THEN ONCE YOU DISCUSS IF YOU DISCUSS THE AFTERMATH BEFORE THE BEFORE  (fe_03_02571-B-0053)
[MN] WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PEOPLE SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE WHY ARE WE GOING OVER THERE IF WE HAVE TO WIND UP STAYING THERE THAT LONG  (fe_03_02571-B-0054)
WELL YOU SEE BUT NOW YOU HAD A TANGIBLE TARGET OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS FLOATING AROUND THEY SAY HE'S ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIRST STREET IN HARLEM SELLING VIDEO TAPES BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02571-B-0055)
YEAH WELL NOW YOU HAVE A PERSON YOU HAVE A PERSON SADDAM HUSSEIN RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT SO YOU HAVE A PERSON THAT'S IN PLACE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN THERE AND DO SOMETHING SO YOU SEE WE'RE FIGHTING THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM DO THEY HAVE TO FIGHT A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM YES  (fe_03_02571-B-0056)
IS CAN A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM BE WON NOT REALLY  (fe_03_02571-B-0057)
YOU CAN MAKE YOU COULD YOU COULD DAMPEN IT FOR A WHILE BUT PEOPLE SIMMER FESTERING SPIRITS  (fe_03_02571-B-0058)
THE LITTLE KIDS THEY CARRY A._K. FORTY SEVENS FIVE AND SIX AND SEVEN YEARS OLD ALA AKBAD JIHAD KILL THE JEW KILL AN AMERICAN KILL THE INFIDELS  (fe_03_02571-B-0059)
YES  (fe_03_02571-B-0060)
YES BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO THE SUB CULTURES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE THAT CALL THEMSELVES OUTLAWS AND THUGS I- IT'S REALLY NO DIFFERENCE IT'S IT'S THAT BELIEF THEIR PARTICULAR BELIEF THAT THE THE WORLD C- THIS  (fe_03_02571-B-0061)
THE WORLD OWES ME EVERYTHING AND SINCE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME I'M GOING TO TAKE IT [LAUGHTER] YES  (fe_03_02571-B-0062)
BUT UM AND AND UM THE MY SON IS OVER THERE ANYWAY IN IRAQ HE'S A MARINE HE'LL BE COMING HOME SAY I I HEARD FROM HIM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE'LL BE COMING HOME IN ABOUT ANOTHER MONTH  (fe_03_02571-B-0063)
HE'S IN SPECIAL FORCES WITH THE MARINES  (fe_03_02571-B-0064)
HE'S SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF ACTION I'M I WAS IN VIETNAM SO YOU KNOW THE MILITARY RUNS IN THE FAMILY SO I I SORT OF LOOK AT THESE THINGS FROM ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS  (fe_03_02571-B-0065)
THE ONLY THING I COULD SEE THAT'S REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT NOW IS WHEN THEY DID THE INSERTION AND THEY THEY WENT INTO IRAQ THE LOSS OF SOLDIERS WAS VERY LIGHT  (fe_03_02571-B-0066)
IT WAS VERY LIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE THAT WHEN THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT UP AS BEING ALL THIS TERRORISM AND POWERFUL AND STUFF THAT THESE SOLDIERS WERE LITERALLY SURRENDERING  (fe_03_02571-B-0067)
SO NOW IT MAKES YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE THE BULLY ON THE BLOCK BECAUSE YOU GO IN THERE AND EVERYBODY'S RUNNING DOWN THE STREET HEY I WANNA SURRENDER FEED ME FEED ME I NEED WATER I NEED WATER [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW SO IT WAS LIKE BUT THE THING WAS IS THAT YOU DID HAVE THAT ONE SMALL SECTION  (fe_03_02571-B-0068)
IN THAT I THINK THEY DID THE BEST SAYING LOOK IF WE'RE ONLY GOING IN THERE TO GET THIS PARTICULAR GROUP  (fe_03_02571-B-0069)
WE'RE NOT GOING IN THERE TO MESS WITH ANYBODY ELSE THAT PRECISION BOMBER WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT I KNOW NO NO BOMB IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PRECISION BECAUSE THAT'S THE BOMB IS A MINDLESS THING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER OR NOT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02571-B-0070)
OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I MEAN I I LIVE HERE SO THAT'S PART OF I THINK I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE FREE  (fe_03_02571-B-0072)
YEAH BUT THEY SAY THAT THOSE THAT STAND AND SERVE THEY ST- YOU KNOW THOSE THAT STAND AND WAIT THEY TOO SHALL SERVE BECAUSE I HAD A WIFE WAITING FOR ME TO COME BACK HOME MY SON HAS A FATHER WAITING FOR HIM TO COME BACK HOME YOU KNOW AND HE HAS FRIENDS AND  (fe_03_02571-B-0073)
OTHER LOVED ONES SO IT ALL WORKS OUT TOGETHER  (fe_03_02571-B-0074)
