L:  Hi, my name is Kelly.
R:  And I'm Claveen[?].
L:  Hi, Claveen, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Um, yes, so, you're supposed to talk about this topic now [MN], right?
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Um, so, do you agree that a cold would le- -- would be qu- -- be done quicker if you go to the doctor or no? [MN]
R:  I don't know.  I just recovered from a cold right now and, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I didn't go to a doctor.  I didn't get the flu shot, in fact.  I just -- I -- I'm usually hesitant of all this, um, this whole medicine thing itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I usually avoid, and I believe that I'm pretty robust, so I don't really fall sick so often --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and so my strategy is do nothing.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you use any over the counter medications or anything like that or ...?
R:  Very little.
L:  Oh.
R:  Very little.  I -- I avoid as much as possible because I have this idea that this whole, um -- introducing these unnatural chemicals in your body is not a good thing. [MN]
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  For the most part, unless you are really [MN] um -- you really are in a position that you can't help it so I -- I usually -- it's not that I have got anything against science or medicine it's just that I usually avoid.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, that is what I do.  What about you?
L:  Okay.  I agree with you. [LAUGH] It seems like, um, every time I go to the doctor for the flu or a cold or anything they only tell you, "Drink fluids and [LAUGH] --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- stay in bed" anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't really feel that they help too much.
R:  Right.
L:  And I guess I believe more in -- I kinda grew up with the whole home remedy and I've -- as -- as I've gotten older I've gotten more into the holistic healing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kinds of things where I -- I like to be more natural --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than -- I do end up sometimes with my [inaudible] cold and sinus. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  If it just gets to be too much --
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I --  and I've gotten sick more the last couple of years because I work full time and I've started school full time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I have a lot of stress and I don't get enough sleep as I should.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, yeah, I've gotten the flu shot in the past but I haven't gotten it the last couple of years.
R:  Right.
L:  And I haven't gotten anything major so ...
R:  Right.
L:  I'd have to say that I agree with you that I'd like to keep things more natural and ...
R:  Right.
L:  But I do agree that the changing seasons does affect you somehow. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  It does.  I mean, I just got -- last week, I had -- I was actually not at all good for the last, like, four days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it -- I -- I'm a little obstinate about it.  I guess I could have, uh, taken medicine earlier but I just refused to and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I think in -- in time it anyway goes away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ultimately the natural things like drinking a lot of fluids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and drinking, like, tea and stuff like that.  I like that.
L:  Yeah
R:  So, that is usually my fix to it but maybe -- I mean, is the question more general than just things like colds or ...?
L:  Um, well, I know they had brought up the cold.  They also talked about, you know, the changing seasons and that kinda --
R:  Right.
L:  -- thing so --
R:  Right.  Right.  So, they want us to talk -- okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Um, do you -- now, do you ever get that seasonal disorder where when you get less sunlight you seem to be more tired and -- do you have a hard time with the change of seasons?
R:  No.  No.  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  I have a very hard time with that.  For the first month or so, it's -- I only want to sleep and I kinda get a little depressed too.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, yeah, that one -- that one's a rough one on me so even if I don't get sick I do get very tired and kind of hard for me to function when I go to work at -- in the dark and come home in the dark. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Seems like and -- seems like the days get so short that you're ready for bed at six o'clock at night [LAUGH] because it's pitch black.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I haven't felt that.  And I don't know if the doctor can fix that.
L:  No.  I've seen ads for, you know, like the -- those special lights or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess I kinda just try to deal with it on my own and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, these are like really heavy lights on your desk so you feel that there was day.
L:  I'm sorry.  What was that?
R:  Now, these are really powerful lights that'll make you feel that there was a day outside.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [MN] I'm like, "Oh, yeah.  I don't think a light's going to do that". [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Sounds strange actually.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think about, um, doctors and medication and stuff for more major ill- illnesses though other than colds?
R:  I -- I have a really strange theory about that because, um, you heard about the placebo effect, right.
L:  Mm mm.  No.
R:  Which is basically what they do is, um -- so, you fall ill, so instead of giving you a drug I give you basically a harm -- a harmless substance, basically something which has neutral effect on you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  And if you feel that this is the right drug and this will cure you, it cures you.  Okay --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this effect is the placebo effect.  Now, of course, it doesn't work one hundred percent of times because then medicine will be used less.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there have been lots of studies, scientific studies and we -- they've found that thirty percent of the time you could give this inert substance and it'll produce the same effect as the drug would.
L:  Mm.
R:  And what that says basically is a lot of, um, the healing that happens is basically psychological.
L:  Okay.
R:  You feel -- you feel like you're getting better, therefore you get better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think a lot of medicine actually works like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, a lot of it is in your head, I think, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  I mean, I don't think medicine in itself is such a developed science.  I mean, they don't really have, uh, very good models.  I mean, the drugs that they give you when you fall sick it's just because they've done -- collected some statistics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and correlations.  They don't tell you why something lowers your body temperature.  They know that it does because for six out of ten people it does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right.  So, so, I don't have a whole lot of strong belief in medicine as a science.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, anyway, I -- I don't know if this is what you meant?  What your question was trying to --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That -- that's what I meant.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- 'cause I -- I have the same feelings as you and, um, I actually -- I had gotten bronchitis really bad a couple of years ago and I actually ended up in the emergency room because I was given so many different kinds of antibiotics to try and get rid of it that I actually ended up -- the emergency room doctor kinda -- his theory was that I had actually gotten poisoned by the antibiotics.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I ended being in the emergency room and I kinda -- so that's when I stopped going to doctors altogether and just try to go to a holistic healer.
R:  Right.
L:  But then, um, last year my father had a heart attack and, um, a friend of mine knows my beliefs that I don't really like doctors and they're like, "Well, if these doctors hadn't made these advances, your father wouldn't have survived his heart attack" which that's true too.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I suppose, in a way and for certain things, I believe in the medicine and that kinda thing but as far as some issues, I think, you know, the whole holistic and the, you know, w- -- eastern medicine is a lot better than [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- just everybody just wants to pop a pill.
R:  Right.  That is --
L:  So --
R:  That is true.  But what exactly is the kind of medicine you're talking about?
L:  Um, well, like, more like herbs and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, even just meditation and Reiki healing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, going to that kind of thing.  That's the kind of stuff that I would rather do.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  As opposed to, you know, taking these pills that -- I mean, they got a pill for everything now and there's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so many side effects and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Right.  Right [COUGH]
L:  So, yeah -- so, I don't kn- -- I don't know what -- [LAUGH] what we can do. [LAUGH].  It seems like they're just -- the pharma- pharmacies are out to make a quick buck and feed you any kind of pill. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess the -- it's -- it's all just business for some people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if I necessarily trust that they do enough testing or anything for some of these. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And -- and see the thing is it's -- uh, the science, it's a strange science, right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, I mean, medicine is not so developed.  They really don't know why these things work.  Okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  The only thing they know is they go and, like, basically first test these on, like -- to begin with a new drug is basically tested on animals, right?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And this -- let's see what it does and based on that they -- and based on a little bit of knowledge about what are the chemicals that are involved they make some predictions that this will do this thing on human beings and then they test on people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's it and then they give it to lots of people and ask you because [inaudible] you're one of the data points for them in some sense.
L:  Right.
R:  And they go through this data from hospital records and stuff like that and then they figure out the correlations and that's all th- there is.  I mean, they really don't know why.  It's not really fine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so -- so, one of the things that happens is, um, somehow people think that a doctor is not scientific, then some of these holistic methods that you're saying because they -- they're not really, like, good -- a good science, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're -- they're -- they're not as scientific as the [MN] -- the whole western medicine system, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I doubt that whole thing and doubt that whole idea is more scientific or less scientific than that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, um, I don't know.  I -- I don't know maybe -- but we -- we're -- we're actually [several inaudible words] philosophy of science, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I know.  I think we got a way off the subject a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Do they tell us when, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when we are done or is this -- uh, we can just keep talking until we feel that we've exhausted the subject?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think we have to go for at least ten minutes so I think they might tell us when we're done.
R:  Okay.
L:  This is the first one I've done so far, so ...
R:  Okay.  This is my first as well.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, we're learning together. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it is a strange thing, I mean, I'm -- okay, let's -- let's stick to the topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay [LAUGH]
R:  So, well, why don't you tell me some, like, experiences, like when you fell ill or you went to the doctor or, in fact, this holistic medicine when you fell ill and you went to one of these people and how -- how that worked or didn't work?
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, well, actually I ended up meeting a spiritual healer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, through -- kinda through a friend who went to her because she also does massages and that kind of thing.  And, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I started having, like, Reiki treatments where they kinda just use energy and they lay their hands on you and kinda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, try to take the bad energy off and put it up back into the universe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know it sounds kinda silly but I believe in it and it works for me so I guess that's all that really matters.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um, but I've -- I went on a trip with her and while we were -- we were driving we played a tape about a women who had gone and stayed with the aborigines.
R:  Right.
L:  And she was saying about their -- they have all the holistic healing and one aborigine on this walk had broken his leg and they -- they did what they do to fix it and he was fixed with -- and the next day he got up and walked again.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they don't know hospitals.  They don't know what -- what casts are.  They don't know what x rays are.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, the healing process that they have is totally different and I think that, you know, the holistic -- the people who do the holistic, like the Shaman and the Native Americans and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all that.  I mean, it's in almost every different region in every different kind of culture and religion.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, they have their beliefs and they use all natural things from the earth and I really think that's what heals us and makes us better as opposed to, you know, the scientific medicines.  So, I've had really good luck --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- with going and having herbs and that kind of thing done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, and like I said, I mean, after one experience where a doctor put me into a hospital [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I thought, "Well, this can't be right" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "This can't be good at all" and then I was upset too because after I was in the emergency room they couldn't really give me an exact answer and I had been there all night long and I was exhausted and, you know, obviously not feeling well.
R:  Right.
L:  And they really couldn't give me a straight, honest answer and then till someone finally came and said, "Well, I think you -- you know, because antibiotics are poison, I think you were poisoned by 'em".  So, yeah, it's a rough thing with the whole health issue and illness and --
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  But I -- I grew up with, um, a grandma who believed heavily in -- in home remedies so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, I did that one but ...
R:  So, I mean, uh, do most insurance plans cover for this treatment at all?  I mean --
L:  None that I know of.  Every time I go I pay for it out of pocket.
R:  You have to pay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Mm.  That is a -- that is a problem with actually following -- I mean, there are many problems.  One is, first of all, this kind of other alternative method, really they don't have a --
