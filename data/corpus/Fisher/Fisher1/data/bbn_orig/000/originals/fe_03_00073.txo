L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- this is Steve.
L:  Kevin here.  How are you?  What was that again?
R:  Steve.
L:  Ah, pleasure.  Do you actually watch shows like that?
R:  I watched Survivor, actually.  I'm a bit ashamed to admit it but [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- I do.
L:  -- more astonished at the other ones, you know, that's -- you know, Who Wants to Become a Concubine?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- I find those to be distasteful.  Um, Survivor -- Survivor is -- it's -- I wouldn't quite call it a reality show.  It's, um --
L:  Well, it's definitely nothing to do with reality.
R:  No.  It's more --
L:  I mean --
R:  It's more of an exotic game show, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Because --
L:  Any minute you expect Monty Hall to jump out of a coconut.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] So, do you -- do you watch any of these?
L:  No.  I [SIGH] -- I -- I find them repulsive in the extreme.
R:  [LAUGH] You should g- -- you should give --
L:  I mean, this whole --
R:  -- Survivor a chance though.  It's -- it's -- it's actually quite fun, I think.
L:  Well, think of it this way.  There used to be a rea- reality show called Candid Camera.
R:  Mhm.  Yes, I've heard of it.
L:  In which people, uh, were exposed to little bits of strangeness and whatnot.
R:  Right.
L:  I view some of that -- you know, again, take someone who is basically -- the problem with the shows is not just -- it's the mean spiritedness of them, the competitiveness.  The idea that, "Gee, we're not looking at the idea that one person's going to win.  We're looking at the idea that we're going to see twenty people voted off the island.  We're going to see who is the weakest link".  I mean, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a show where basically, you know, everyone's exposed to the great iron nanny. [MN]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Well, that -- that really isn't so much of a reality show.  It's a --
L:  No.  But i- it -- it pulls directly from the other shows the idea of that let's get rid of -- let's basically sit there and watch people voting off -- and let's eat 'em.  You know, let's get --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- right down to -- reality shows like -- or Big Brother, they all require a degree of attrition otherwise --
R:  Mhm.  That's right.  Yeah.  Well, tha- that's the point of the game.  It's who -- who -- who suffers attrition first.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, uh, in -- in a way I -- I see what you mean.  You're -- you're -- you're delighting in other people's misfortune.
L:  You know, "Welcome to Shake[?] and Freud". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A word that no one ever used to use except psychologists but now it's rapidly becoming practically the national passtime.
R:  [LAUGH] But I -- I do think that the -- well, all right, I mean, so some -- some -- on Survivor, you know, which -- which I watch occasionally, I mean, some of the puzzles are just -- are just interesting.  It's -- it's not very, you know, a- a- --
L:  I remember the first one when they were on a desert island.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they were showing people going out looking for f- -- you know, they -- they -- they were looking for -- they were looking for yams and tapioca and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you had people looking up into the trees.
R:  [LAUGH] For a yam. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't eat the rats.  Don't eat the rats.  Eat the snakes --
R:  It --
L:  -- that eat the rats.
R:  It's funny though.  It's really funny and -- and, you know, people will --
L:  I wonder if people are going to come back and say, "Gee, I'd really like a McRat". [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever talked about performing?  Like -- somehow the idea of, you know -- i- it's just a little too much.  I think you could have just as much fun taking photographs of a little old lady on the side of the highway with a flat tyre.  Just wait and see who stops and who drives by.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey, that was our car going by. [MN]
R:  Well, the- there is a difference, you know.  You have -- you have these actors or, you know, these -- these agents who are -- who are honestly trying and so you can -- you can, you know, identify with their aspects of their failures and it -- it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I mean, one -- one -- one finds oneself saying, you know, "If I were there, this is what I would do".  Um --
L:  There are three words that come to mind when I see these shows.
R:  Okay.
L:  Bread and circuses.
R:  [LAUGH] It's --
L:  We're in an age where forty percent of the white collar workers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who are being fi- -- who are being let go are effectively being told, "Gee, there's no way we can put you back into the economy".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're seeing factories shut down.  We're seeing industry moved anywhere on the planet where cheap labor can be obtained and whatnot, and this is such a blatant extreme divertissimo.
R:  Well, I -- I think there are worse things.
L:  There are.  There are.  When you sit there -- I -- I have a favorite term I use.  Try to explain to people how most o- -- you know, most of the world sees America --
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
L:  -- through CNN.  In other --
R:  Could you say that again?
L:  -- words, most of the world thinks that America is one gigantic suburb of Atlanta.
R:  Yes.  I -- I know what you mean, exactly.
L:  I used to --
R:  But the --
L:  -- live in Canada and just a little difference of seeing foreign news coming in and whatnot, the different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- perspectives --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- changes things in -- your mindset on the world drastically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, now, the Big Brother game actually sta- -- like, all American television starts in Europe.
R:  Yes.  I -- I've heard that, yeah.
L:  But if you want scary, have you ever heard what they do in Japanese game shows?
R:  Yes.  I've heard of one game show where they lock these people into a house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And require them to live off of deliveries.  They have to, you know -- you know, get free samples from various -- from various, you know, companies and -- and [MN] they have to call people up to bring them food and whatnot.  And, you know, if they --
L:  That -- that pushed the sport into -- into the element of -- of desperation.  Me, I know exactly how to do it, "Hi, wanna be on television.  Bring me a pizza".
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  In fact --
R:  But then it -- it --
L:  -- I call another company and say, "Hi, I want you to make up some tee shirts that say, 'I brought Kevin a pizza'". [MN]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  That -- that's pretty clever.  Yes.  It could be done, certainly.
L:  But --
R:  I -- I think that the -- the thing -- the thing about the Japanese versions, I think there -- there's a deliberate, you know, measure of sadism in it.  Um --
L:  Well, they're in a culture where everything is regulated and set.  You study.  You get -- you -- you do your tests.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, once you theoretically find that job, they're stuck with you for life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in the last twenty years that's gone out the window.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, you've got a whole chaotic generation there but the game shows there, they'll do something like they'll pack you on a seven forty seven with four hundred other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They will fly you five hundred miles away.  They will only fly back the top one hundred.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's great.
L:  Hey, you know, you walk into these things knowing these rules and knowing that these people voluntarily said that -- they've done a parody of it on the Simpsons that was disturbingly accurate, "And now we have --"
R:  Really?
L:  "-- a Canadian couple who do not like scorpions".  So, of course they dub scorpions on them.
R:  Exactly.  Yes.  Exactly that attitude.
L:  You know, Fear Factor.  Okay, there's another one, "Let's strap somebody into the dentist chair with the flame thrower --"
R:  That's crazy [inaudible]
L:  "-- at crotch level".
R:  That's terrible, you know.
L:  What moron -- "Why don't we put them in the oven when we're done?" [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I just don't understand why people will -- will go on that show and -- and eat slugs and endure these horrible things.  It's just not worth it.
L:  Well, they had an interesting little thing on the, uh -- the T- -- the Thai, uh, survival game.  Couple of Thai soldiers came over, took out a -- machetes, showed them how to build chopsticks.
R:  [MN] All right.
L:  Then showed them how to build damn near anything in a matter of about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thirty minutes.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Then took everything they built and walked away.
R:  All right.
L:  They passed on the basic information.  Naturally nobody really caught on well enough to actually do any of it.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  But, uh, it's -- the emphasis on, "Hi, you know, any minute now you could be dropped on -- on a mountain top somewhere in Brazil and, um, well, at least you'll have a couple of good recipes of knowing how to cook your fellow here --"
R:  But that's --
L:  "-- your fellow passenger".
R:  -- not so much of the -- to the worst case scenario calendars you see now.  Have you -- have you -- you know, the book?  The book series.
L:  Worst Case Scenario?
R:  Have you heard of it?
L:  Yes.  I have.
R:  You know, you know, like, they have these calendars now.  I mean, each day, you know, these day calendars where you rip off the sheets, I mean, each day they have some tip, like, "Wanna [inaudible] a -- a mountain panther, you know, do this" [LAUGH] and -- and the funny thing is that people who buy these things and read them they're never going to run into a mountain panther and, you know, like, I -- I don't understand.  I -- I guess they're sort of --
L:  There's a scene I've always wanted to think of in my mind, if I were in Jurassic Park --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sitting there on the toilet, facing down a fifty foot high man eater.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you know what I'd be doing?
R:  What would you be doing?
L:  Well, I was on the toilet to begin with so I think it would be easy.  But, uh, I would reach into my pocket and pull out a cigarette lighter.
R:  What would that do?
L:  "Hello.  I'm a -- we're descended from those little egg sucking bastards you used to have to deal with [MN] and now I play with fire".
R:  I don't know if that gets you alive though, you see. [LAUGH]
L:  Ever heard of an animal that will run toward a fire?
R:  Well, it's a kind of a little speck of fire.  I mean, surely --
L:  Guess what?  Tiny little speck of fire is all it takes.  I've seen people drive off a grizzly bear.
R:  Really.
L:  With fire.
R:  Wow.  I had no idea.
L:  They're not dumb.  We -- you know, we -- we have that interesting little quirk with us.  You know, it just -- it took -- it took a hundred thousand years of domestication to get a dog to a point where it will approach a fire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most animals don't like it.  But, uh, no.  Reality based shows like that, you know, wh- where, "Gee, I really have to know which grubs and rats can be eaten".
R:  [LAUGH] I guess -- I guess part of it is that fundamentally one's -- one's basic needs are -- are entirely met in this society.  I mean, they're exceptions of course but generally one has enough food to eat and one has shelter, one has all these things --
L:  I'm swigging down a two liter bottle of Dr. Pepper as I talk to you and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm perfectly aware of the people who go on these survival episodes are provided with their own water because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pure and simple, most people under ordinary --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- circumstances would contaminate their water supply in a matter of hours.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  Put twenty people together and suddenly, "Oh, what's toilet paper?"
R:  Yeah.  And it -- this is a peculiarity of -- of our society really because if you -- if you go to other places where people --
L:  Well, we all expect --
R:  -- are --
