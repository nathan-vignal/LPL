L:  Hello?
R:  Mike, hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  This is Mike.
L:  Hi, this is Nevine[?]
R:  Nevine?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you doing?
R:  Okay, thank you.
L:  Um, [NOISE] shall we start the conversation or you want some more formal introduction?
R:  No, I'm fine.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  So, do see any of these, um, uh, entertainment and reality shows? [NOISE]
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, I'm here.
L:  Okay, do you -- do you see these shows?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  What do you think about them?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, some I enjoy, some I don't.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] Survivor I think has some, ah, insightful value to it but not -- most of the other shows I don't particularly care for.
L:  Okay.  So, ah, what do you like about this Survivor?
R:  Uh, I like the way that it plays on people's, um -- it tugs at peoples' [LIPSMACK] their character, I guess I would say, their -- their willingness to, uh, play fair or with dignity or respect.  Or just play outright for a million dollars and disregard honesty and integrity and [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, but I -- I don't know, but I'm not too sure about this kind of, um, reality shows on the TV.  I think it's too much information to make public.  Don't you agree with me?
R:  Yes, I -- Yes, to -- to a great degree I agree, wholeheartedly.
L:  But still it's [inaudible] so people like to peek into other's personal lives and -- I mean, I think they like it.
R:  [NOISE]  I -- actually I also like, uh, some of the challenges that they have.  I find them interesting.  But [MN] I don't like the -- in particular some of the challenges that they give them, uh, in regards to some of what they may have to eat in order to contend this last particular, uh, Survivor challenge, I thought was over the top in that regard.  Um, and some of the other reality shows that do the same thing, those I'll turn off.  At those points I [NOISE] I don't enjoy it any more.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um.  The -- how about the -- The Bachelor?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  The -- the showed called The Bachelor.
L:  I've never seen that.  What's it all about?
R:  That's, uh, a single male, uh, unmarried.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Who's, um [LIPSMACK] who's put in a position to intermingle date with several different, uh, also unmarried, attractive young females.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And during the course of a period of time, I'm not sure if it's six to eight weeks or whatever it is, he's --he's expected to get to know them and, uh, dismiss them as he goes along, until he comes up with -- as the show goes along, until he comes up with, uh, one particular female that he thinks he's interested in, uh --
L:  Mm.
R:  Extending a relationship with, um, and that becomes really, uh, too -- too public in regards to personal ah --
L:  Yeah, I would -- I would agree with that.  But, uh, do you think these guys who participate in the show really mean it?  I think they ju- they are just there because they want popularity and they are not -- they might not be serious about their -- whatever they are doing on the screen.
R:  Oh, yes, I also agree with that.  I think their -- the majority of it is good acting.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I would think.  It's -- it's a good way to publicize yourself, get to, you know, get on the screen for an hours worth of lot on prime time.
R:  Agreed.  [MN]
L:  Um, uh, but still these [inaudible] are popular.  I think they are -- they are -- people might -- people inter- people get interested in these, um, dra- I would call them dramas because they -- they have a perception that it might be a reality [LIPSMACK] and that's, I think, one of the factors that, um, excites them.  That, I mean, this -- this perception of the reality.
R:  [NOISE]  You- You're probably right.  Um, the perception of it, I think, is a good way to word it.  I -- and to a great degree I think that it's gonna -- I think it's gonna phase out very near future.  I think it's -- to a great degree I liken it to daytime soaps.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, th- that's -- that's what I -- I extremely agree that it's, uh, it's just like that soap operas.
R:  They play it over the top what, you know, I guess is a phrase that I'm, uh, familiar with for a long time.  Over the top in trying to attract, uh, certain age groups, I imagine, in, uh --
L:  Wha-
R:  In -- in -- in their interests in, ah, out of the ordinary circumstances and situations.  I don't really consider it reality.  I think it's a misnomer in itself.
L:  Uh-huh.  It's, uh, yeah, that's -- that's what I was calling the perception of reality.  It's not actual reality.  And since -- since you've raised this topic of the age groups, has there been any survey on this kind of, um, reality shows where they, sort of, uh, study the various age groups to find out their customer base, how it's distributed, um, along the age axis?
R:  Oh, I'm sure they have.  And I'm sure that the advertisers were probably the supporters of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  Or -- or the funders of -- of that study.
L:  Mhm.  But -- but they never publish this kind of information.  I -- I -- I'm not a regular reader of these magazines where they publish these, ah, new serials and these reality shows and their information.  But have you ever read these kind of, uh, magazines, where they give this information?  The various statistics?
R:  Uh, no, I have not.
L:  Mm.  But this will be a great thing to look at because I -- my -- my guess is that these, ah, reality shows, they will have a very big popular base, mostly among young, maybe twen- ah, ten to twenty year old, ten to twenty five.
R:  Probably right.  I -- that's probably exactly right.
L:  And --
R:  But I think it extends then beyond that age group too, but that's probably the biggest percentage of it.
L:  That's right.  And I think as you go along, like forties or fifties, it going to gradually decrease.
R:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE]  Um, I don't know that I'll watch Survivor series after this -- this particular one and I don't -- I didn't watch much of -- or maybe more than half of two different episodes of The Bachelor series.  Um [LIPSMACK] what are some of the other ones?  Uh, oh gosh, I can't think of it.  Uh, Fear Factor.
L:  Fear Factor?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you seen that?
L:  I have may have skimmed -- I -- I -- I usually go -- get home from work and I would skim the channels.  And I think I have come across it, this -- this Fear Factor.
R:  That's [LIPSMACK] also another kind of ghastly, uh, challenge game.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's pathetic [LAUGH].  Like, I won't get -- some shows are just too, I don't know.  I can't even see it.  And people would eat anything --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for a couple of dollars.  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Or they'd be placed in a -- in a cage, or a glass cage and have, um, spiders or, um, uh, other things dumped on them and they'd have to stay in it for a certain length of time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that becomes -- again, that's like over the top for me too.  You know [NOISE] nothing in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the amount of money is worth me considering doing ever, or watching.
L:  But -- but that's -- th- this is -- the interesting thing about the show is that it shows how the people would go to any extreme to get money.  I mean --
R:  Yes.
L:  And sometimes it's -- it's more than money also.  I've seen a lot of people who were straight but they still want to do these crazy things just -- they just take it as a challenge.
R:  And perhaps there's a certain desperation in their [NOISE] lives or something that may cause them to go to such extremes [NOISE] for that kind of money.  But I -- I [NOISE] in most cases I doubt it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [PAUSE] [NOISE]  Well, do you have anything more?
L:  Well, I -- I would -- I -- I see more of TV other shows, rather than these reality shows I think.  But [NOISE] because I'm -- I'm -- I'm probably not interested in these kind of shows.  But I think these are -- they don't give me the information that I -- that I want to get out of T- TV.  I would rather see a news channel or the score, rather than seeing somebody doing -- I mean, it's -- it's just the way I prefer.
R:  And I'm the same in my -- I'm in my upper forties now so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those -- you're [NOISE] right, the things you just mentioned are more my main interest for the free time that I have during the course of a day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or a good movie or something when I'm home during the evening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- versus these shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [PAUSE]  Now, do we -- do -- is there a length of time that -- that we talk on such --
L:  Yeah, that's what I was wondering.  Um --
R:  Because I'm -- I'm act-
L:  Maybe just ten minutes, I don't -- but I'm not sure about it.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I'm actually filling in for my son who signed up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for this.  But, um, he told us about it and had had a couple of good discussions thus far on other topics, so, uh, in lieu of him not being here at the moment I thought that I'd --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's an hour and five, over five now, it's been already five minutes, I think, since we've been talking.
R:  Oh.  Sean.  And here is the boy now.  Is it -- is there a length of time?  Ten minutes, oh, okay.
L:  Okay, so we've got to talk for five more minutes?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So, uh, okay, let's start this way.  What do you think was the best, um, Survivor that you liked?  Did you like any of the Survivor?
