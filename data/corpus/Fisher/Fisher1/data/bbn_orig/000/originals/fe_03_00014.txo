R:  Hi, I'm Denise Best.
L:  Hi, I'm Emily Kendall.
R:  [MN] Hi, Emily.
L:  [MN] Hi.
R:  So, what is your opinion about the ...?
L:  About the cold?
R:  About the c- --
L:  I've actually had one myself this week.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it.
R:  [MN] That's e- --
L:  I've --
R:  Same here.  Same here.
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm very sensitive to when the -- the seasons change.  I have a -- um, it triggers allergies that are -- have the same symptoms as colds so it's kinda hard to, um, figure out do I need to see a doctor or do I need to just go to the pharmacist.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  And [inaudible] with this to go away I woke up Monday morning with a cold and I'm feeling better now 'cause, you know, I've been sleeping several more hours than usual each night and, yeah, it's going away.
R:  So, any home remedies?
L:  Home remedies?
R:  Other than sleep.
L:  No, my roommate is- is giving me vitamin C and zinc and says that that makes it go away or go away faster or prevents them and --
R:  Do you feel --
L:  I don't know.  It seems to work.  My mom -- my mom swears by that too and, yeah, it is effective.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, but, hey, there is some kind of -- I think, scientifically, you improve --
L:  [inaudible] it.
R:  -- without --
L:  Well, yes.  I'm not sure what it is about it that -- the zinc anyway, but it does seem to work.
R:  It -- it doesn't work, you don't think?
L:  Is it -- no, it does seem to work.
R:  You know, I think they had some kind of, um, remedy just recently that was called, like, um, Coldeze or something l- --
L:  Coldeze.  Yes.  That's what my mom keeps telling me to take.  
R:  Oh, I don't know --
L:  She says there's zinc in that as well.
R:  -- I've taken that and I feel very hyper and, you know, I -- it's --
L:  Really?
R:  -- too much of a stimulant for me.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  I get like the jitters.  It's almost like drinking, you know, high octane coffee [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I tried it once and I've stayed away from it, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- chicken noodle soup, lots of nice co- [LAUGH] --
L:  Right [LAUGH].  That just makes my nose run.
R:  Soft [inaudible].
L:  But, yeah.  Yeah.  I have a friend who swears by echinacea.  Says that --
R:  Oh, have you tried that?
L:  I have.  I -- it tastes so awful that I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- avoid it but, yeah, it --
R:  I think for me it's sleep.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  I can tell when it's a cold or if it's fever or -- I definitely -- I -- the more sleep that I get the better I feel or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe it's just that I'm not dealing with the symptoms --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- when you're sleeping.
L:  Or -- or definitely if I go for very long in the winter without sleep I'm then definitely going to get a cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Well, I think --
L:  It does just seem to be--
R:  -- there is a difference.  I think maybe too it's hard to adjust, "Well, what do I wear?" when you have a sudden change in temperature.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you don't have your clothes out yet and you have that day that your hair is wet and it's cold outside, and that's all it takes for me.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Where do you live?  Do you have cold out there?
R:  I live -- uh, actually we just got, uh, a snow storm yesterday.  I live in Maryland.
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  Where -- do you live on the East Coast?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm in -- I'm in Boston now, so, yes, we--
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- have lots of sn- --yeah, --
R:  Oh, well, so, you're used to that.
L:  -- lots of snow yesterday also.
R:  You laugh at us down here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  We -- yeah, so, um, that was the only topic that we were supposed to talk about?
L:  I think so, but were we supposed to talk for ten minutes or ...?
R:  I'm not sure, to tell you the truth [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I need to reread the, um, issues.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they said ten minute conversations.
R:  Okay, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know --
L:  All about colds.
R:  -- have you been timing this or not? [LAUGH]
L:  Have I what?
R:  Have you been timing the conversation or ...?
L:  No.  I haven't.
R:  Y- you can hear I actually have a cold. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah, unfortunately for me it's, um, even if I wanna see a doctor around here it, um -- at least at Maryland, I work for Maryland University, um, the -- the HMO providers here have just about killed the -- any kind of medical, um -- [MN] it -- it basically has destroyed the medical field here -- d- down here.  It's hard to find a good doctor and then when you do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's hard to -- so, if they say y- -- if you have a cold and it only takes you a week, you're doing really good 'cause usually it's two weeks there.  You have to be the -- you pretty much have to go to the emergency room.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I -- here when you -- they ha- -- you have a cold the first thing they do is you just stop by the university pharmacy and pick up a cold kit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It has medicines and stuff and information, and the information they give says that, you know, a cold shouldn't last more than ei- eight days or so that, you know, it'll start getting better after four or five and, I don't know, I guess that's seems usually to be the case without seeing a doctor or anything.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, they just give us cough drops and Tylenol and cough syrup.
R:  And [LAUGH].
L:  That [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  No --
L:  It always seems to work.  That, plus sleep.
R:  I think that's what -- basically what it is.  Uh, many students -- I think that's probably the number one reason why people get colds.
L:  Right.
R:  Is that -- the lack of sleep.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And for students that's a regular event. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.  Well, I'm not sure what else you wanna talk about?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's -- I guess the -- the computer tells us again when to stop.
R:  [MN] I thought I heard the di- -- something come in the conversation and I thought it sounded robotic.
L:  Oh.  I didn't -- didn't hear anything.
R:  Oh, this is going to be a -- a nice, uh, recording with two people with colds [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  Talking about colds.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They, um -- they need to develop a new, uh -- hey, I would like to be the person that develops, uh, a -- a cure for the common cold [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Um [PAUSE] are you still there?
L:  I'm --I'm still here, yes [LAUGH].
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I was trying to find something in my ph- the call timer on my phone, but it doesn't have one.
R:  I don't have one either over here.  I'll have to remember to be prepared the next time.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what do you normally do?  W- --how do you distinguish whether it's a cold or it's not a cold?
L:  Hum, I -- I don't know I -- I don't really have allergies very badly so, yeah, just whenever I suddenly feel unusually tired or runny nose and sore throat and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I sneeze a lot.  I've been sneezing constantly and, yeah, it's -- it's clearly a cold.
R:  Yeah.  For me it's if I'm not running a fever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I- it's a virus if I have a fever.  If I don't have a fever, it's a cold.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that's just how my body is.  And I -- I'll sleep like forty two hours straight without getting up at all.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's when I know I'm really, really, really sick [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But with three kids it's real easy to get sick, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're -- they're like --
L:  But I be- I bet it's not easy to sleep forty two hours with three kids.
R:  No.  It isn't.  It isn't.  That's when you have to call in the troops, like your mom.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  And, um, mai- mostly juice and soup that's all, if I'm awake, that's all I'll eat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, vitamins, I don't know.  Like I said, I was so desperate at one time 'cause I was getting colds left and right, you know, um, so Coldeze, I used the Coldeze but that really didn't ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Other than th- -- it was just too much of a stimulation.  I -- my heart --
L:  Yeah.  How about antibiotics?  I don't know.
R:  Um, antibiotics, I've, um, sometimes I -- I don't know.  I think maybe there it's gotten to a point that maybe I'm immune to a lot of the -- the --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- over the c- -- I don't even go over the counter.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah.  I think that while it's cold, um, bacteria [MN] are immune to certain antibiotics so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's not helping.  I'm not sure that I'm making the situation any better when we do use the antibiotics but --
R:  I try to stay away from it, you know, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at the very last -- you know, as a last resort then I will go to the doctors and I beg them, "Please, give me something" you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I've been like this for three weeks.  I have to get -- have something.  I can't breathe".  You know, and unfortunately -- and maybe that's not the best course of action.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Is, you know, wait till you're so sick that, you know, you're on the verge of going to the emergency room.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  Well, my -- my dad hasn't been to the -- he's just given me a bu- a bunch of antibiotics to keep on hand and tells me to use them whenever I'm feeling sick.  I don't feel like that's probably the wisest thing to do but, yeah.  He's given them to me --
R:  'Cause sometimes you need that fast --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, turnaround especially if you're -- you said you were a student, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  With mid terms and stuff like that?
L:  Right.
R:  Where you can't -- you've done a semester worth of work, and you're gonna mess it up because you have a cold.  No. [LAUGH] [MN] Sometimes you have to.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, now, I know this has to be at least ten minutes.
L:  It has to.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [MN] we can just --
R:  So, we can't -- do they tell us when to hang up, or -- I don't -- this is my first t- uh, conversation so I don't know.
L:  This is my first also.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, it's definitely been only ten minutes.  I guess just hang up --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- and if they --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- decide they don't like this then we can do another.
R:  May- -- well, they'll tell us if the conversation was up to par.
L:  Right.
R:  So, okay --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- well, it was nice talking to you.
L:  All right.  Yes.  Good bye.
R:  Take care.
