L:  Hi, I'm Leigh.
R:  Hi, I'm Teresa.
L:  Um, so [LAUGH] --
R:  So, the topic is sickness. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] So, have you done this before?
L:  Yes, I have.  This is --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- my second time.
R:  Okay.  So do we just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- keep talking about it till we run out of things to say or --
L:  Um, it just keeps going round until they stop you.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  It's timed.
L:  Yeah.  There's a --
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know [MN] -- I think it's around ten minutes or so.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And then they'll stop you.
R:  Oh, good.  Okay.  So, have been sick this winter? [LAUGH]
L:  Actually I think I'm getting a cold now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I don't -- actually I was sick a few weeks ago.
L:  Mhm.  So, like, it does seem that when the seasons change p- people can do -- people tend to get sick --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially like -- stressful times is when I tend to get sick.
R:  Stressful time?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Like, around like tests or like other big things.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.  Are you in school?
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I go to the University of Pittsburg.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, it's very cold up there.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Has it -- has it snowed?
L:  Um, yeah.  We have about f- four inches on the ground right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really, wow. [MN] Well, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Atlanta and, like, they were making a huge deal about a possible ice storm a couple of days ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they were, like --
L:  Did you get anything?
R:  They were, like, issuing warnings e- -- like, every hour, you know, and, like, all -- all that happened was, like, it rained all night and nothing happened. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It didn't freeze, so [LAUGH] --
L:  We weren't supposed to get a snow storm and then it, like, turned north instead and then we got hit.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. [MN]
L:  Like, Maryland and stuff got a lot.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- right.  Uh, [MN] what was the ta- -- the -- the quote, like, if, um, when you have a cold it takes seven days to get -- get better --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- if you go to the -- if you don't go to the doctor and a week if you do, or something.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I've never heard that before. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd never either but I think it's kind of true because there's really nothing you can do to sort of hurry it along once you get it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  You just have to let it run its course.
R:  Exactly. [SIGH] So, I think the best medicine is, you know, preventative medicine.
L:  Um, what do you do to prevent getting sick?
R:  Um, let's see [NOISE].  I, um -- well, I try to, like, yeah, get enough rest and sleep -- sleep enough and eat, you know, pretty decent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I take my multivitamins. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Do you do anything special?
L:  Um, well, last year I got a flu shot but I didn't get one this [LAUGH] -- this year.
R:  Oh.
L:  Sometimes vitamin C helps.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I do get sick I like to eat soup a lot. [LAUGH] Drink a lot of --
R:  You do what?
L:  -- fluids.  If I get sick, drink --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a lot of fluids and --
R:  D- -- yeah.  Do you find that it helps?
L:  [NOISE] Um, it helps in my head so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't -- I don't really know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Um, did you get sick last year when you got the flu shot?
L:  Um, I had a couple of colds or whatever but I never really got, like, real sick last year at all [NOISE].
R:  Okay.  But this year you feel like you're getting really sick?
L:  Um, no.  I don't -- I don't think I'll get really sick.  I just think I'll get a little cold again.  I don't know.
R:  No.  So, it's not a flu.  You think it's just a cold?
L:  No.  I -- I think it's just a cold.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  That's good.
L:  Do you not miss snow? [MN]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, when's school over?
L:  Um, we have finals next week, so --
R:  Oh, really.  Okay.  So, is everyone stressed out?  Actually, are a lot of your friends getting sick?
L:  [NOISE] Um, actually yeah.  I think -- well, I -- [NOISE] I know a few other people that are sick too.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you ever get sick in the summer?
L:  Um, I think on occasion.  How about you?
R:  Yeah.  Whenever there's a sudden shift in temperature, either hot or cold, it seems to be more susceptible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll have problems with, like, allergies in the summer.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Not necessarily getting sick, just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feeling sick. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Which is very annoying.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, okay.  What else? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Like have you had, uh [LAUGH] more serious illnesses?
L:  Um, no. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.
L:  Just, like, the normal, like the chicken pox when I was little.  That was about it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Actually I think chi- --
L:  How about you?
R:  I got chicken pox when I was, like, twenty and it was really bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  When it -- the older you are the worse you get them.
R:  Yeah.  And then I guess you can get them again after you get it the first time and -- but it's like shingles or something.  Is that right?
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I -- I thought you could get them again, like, if you -- you had like a really mild case you can get 'em again but I don't know, like --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- if you had a regular -- if you could still get 'em again.
R:  Chicken pox.  Okay.  Good to know then.  'Cause, um -- yeah.  I think my sister had it when she was younger and then she got it again, like, a couple of years ago --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and apparently it's like a virus which just sort of stays in your system.  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] I've --
R:  But --
L:  -- never actually heard of, like, someone -- like, I heard that it could happen but [LAUGH] never --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- knew anyone that got 'em a second time.
R:  Oh, really.  Yeah.  I guess most people don't, which is good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's no fun. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [MN] So, what was your -- we -- so, do we just keep on the topic?
L:  Um, we're supposed to. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] What else --
L:  At least try.
R:  -- can we talk about --
L:  Um --
R:  -- sickness? [LAUGH]
L:  Just trying to think.
R:  Sickness.  And, like, we're supposed to just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk about, like, colds, I guess, since that was what the quote was about.
L:  Um, yeah.  The quote was about colds like if you don't go -- yeah, you don't go to the doctor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you, um, get better in a week or whatever and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- if you go to the doctor it's seven days.  I don't know if it was that way or the other way round.  Something along those lines.
R:  Yeah.  Basically the same thing, yeah.  So --
L:  So, bas- --
R:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry. [MN]
L:  I guess, basically it means the doctor doesn't really -- can't really do anything for a cold. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't help.
R:  Do you know of any, like, home remedies that -- that you've found helpful?
L:  Um, no. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes I'll drink hot tea or something. [MN]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's good for sore throats but --
R:  Yeah.  Just something warm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know of any home rem- remedy?
R:  Um, [SIGH] no.  I think just the basics is something warm and I think something salty helps your throat feel better --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just rest, yeah.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is a hard topic.
R:  There's not much to say.  Like, you know, it's a pretty straightforward thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, isn't, like, zinc supposed to help prevent you from getting colds, I think?
R:  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  So, have you tried it?
L:  Um, no.  I've had, like, zinc cough drops and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That try to make -- but I've never really noticed a difference.
R:  Yeah.  Y- -- like, the Halls with zinc?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I've tried that too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Um --
R:  [MN] Forty four.  Sorry, I'm, like, doing work at the same time. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH] that's fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  Uh, let's see.
R:  Do you usually get sick every year?  Like, are you from the north?
L:  Um, yeah.  Like, I'm from Pennsylvania.  Like, I never get really sick though.  I just get little colds.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You've always been pretty, like, hardy?
L:  Yeah.  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's good.  Built up your immune system. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R: [MN] What else?
L:  Do you get snow down there?
R:  You know, I've only been here for a year and last -- or I guess this January they got a little snow and, like, the whole city basically shut down.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's pretty rare I think. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Are you from, um, around there or ...?
R:  No, I, um -- I grew up mostly in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Oklahoma but I actually went to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- college in Philadelphia so --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] So, you had to deal with the snow a lot then. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it was so frigging cold and you had to, like, walk to class --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know [LAUGH].  It was like -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's what makes people sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I remember this one time I was in lecture and there was this guy behind me who was just really sick and, like, he sneezed all over my back.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then, like, the very same day, like, later that day, I started feeling sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  It was not fun and, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] You just want to tell those people to stay home --
R:  I know.
L:  -- so they don't spread it around.
R:  Exactly.  Have you -- have you ever caught something like that, directly from someone?
L:  Um, I always blame other people.  My room mate used to get sick a lot last year and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I would get it.  We'd just give it back and forth, pretty much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] First manage to get sick and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I -- I lived in a, um -- I had a suite of eight last year.  So, we just passed colds around like [MN] --
R:  You lived with eight people, did you say?
L:  Well, we -- there were four rooms of two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but we had, like -- we shared two bathrooms.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really -- 'cause you're in such small quarters everybody ge- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gets sick and passes it round -- passed it around.
R:  Yeah.  College life, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so have you ever lived somewhere, like, warm?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  I've always lived in Pennsylvania where it's freezing cold and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I think Pennsylvania's better than, like, upstate New York where, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, I went -- also went to school in, like, Syracuse and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their average snowfall was, like, two fifty or something.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Inches, yeah [LAUGH] and one --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- time they said it -- it snowed, like, seven inches in July.  It was crazy.
L:  That's so weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  I can't imagine having snow in July.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, things can always be worse. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  We used to see a lot -- a lot more snow when I was younger.  I remember getting, like, three feet -- three feet in the winter.  We didn't get that much last year, I don't think.
R:  Oh really.  Oh, it's that global warming thing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] So --
L:  It has to be some --
R:  Huh?
L:  There has to be some cause for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, do you know anyone else who's sick at the s- -- right now?
L:  Um, I just have one of my friends who's, like, really sick.  He's been, like, missing class all week and stuff.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And he came across the other day and he sounded absolutely horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no. [LAUGH].
L:  So, hopefully -- I didn't -- I didn't sit next to him though so hopefully I won't get it. [MN]
R:  Yeah. [MN] That's good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, when you -- you get colds do you find that it usually lasts, like, a week [NOISE]?
L:  Um, yeah.  I think it usually does last about that long.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] And how about flus?
L:  Um, I haven't really had the flu for a long time.
R:  Really.
L:  Uh --
