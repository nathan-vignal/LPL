L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Ted.
R:  I'm Bridgette.
L:  Cool.  Where do you live?
R:  Um, I'm in Boston.
L:  Oh, cool.  I'm in -- in Columbus, Ohio.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  So, do you watch any, uh, reality television shows?
R:  I actually don't.  Do you?
L:  No.  I don't either.  Well, unless you count the news.  I suppose that's sort of the -- the ultimate reality television show.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that -- that's the thing that truly boggles m- -- boggles the mind because, uh, you end up with, you know, news shows that, I mean, the media in general sort of mass television stuff ends up so, like, bland and sterile that people do anything to, you know, watch actual people do things.
R:  Yeah.  For sure.
L:  And so, I mean, like, that's actually -- y- you can draw the exact same analogy with the news.  You have things like, you know, CNN or Fox news or whatever and I much prefer watching CSPAN and watching actually people who actually do things.
R:  Yeah.  I love CSPAN.
L:  Yeah.  And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- th- that -- that's sort of been my, uh, take over the past year or so.  It's just like I'm -- I've completely given up on the television news and trying to get actual information from it, so I've just started watching CSPAN.  The really cool thing about CSPAN is that, you know, since they're -- obviously proceedings only go on during the day, and so they'll, uh, play all sorts of interesting -- interesting things at night.  I got to watch, um, an AEP thing on, um -- which isn't the American Electric, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Power Company.  Um, on, uh, how they're rebuilding Afghanistan which is very interesting.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- the thing that's always boggled my mind a- about reality television shows as well is, uh, the -- the whole, uh, interest factor for the enlarged bulk of American people and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of this weird like, um, uh -- what's the word -- kind of voyeuristic thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the people who go on it I can't understand their mentality either.
L:  [MN]
R:  My, um -- my mom's cousin went on that Blind Date show.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And he had, like, the worst time on there and just got humiliated on, you know, national TV.  It was horrible but I have a tape of it and it's so funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I mean, I felt so bad for him. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, those shows in particular I -- I really don't understand because who'd want to participate because obviously you're probably not going to end up with anybody in the first place, although I th- -- I think that's happened a couple of times that I've been randomly skipping through channels, but otherwise, I mean, you get humiliated.  Everybody laughs at your expense and the shows are so mindless that I wouldn't understand why you'd want to watch them anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, it -- it's gotta be just some weird, I don't know, urge that I can't understand, at least.
L:  Well, the ironic thing is here we are participating w- with a study talking to relative strangers but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's a little irony in that, isn't there? [MN]
L:  Yeah.  But, uh, the really crazy thing is, um, like, the Japanese have been doing this for much, much longer than Americans have and, uh, the -- the reality television shows that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have, like, blow anything that the Americans could possibly do away.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  There's this one called, uh, Eggplant boy, or something like that where they, um -- they basically, uh, asked a bunch of actors if they were um -- uh, interviewed a bunch of actors and then they kidnapped one, put him in a room, locked him in there and he was supposed to survive, um, merely on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, like, mailing contests.  So, they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, stripped him down totally naked and the reason why it was called Eggplant Boy is they'd always cover his, uh, uh, lower -- uh, nether regions with an eggplant.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, and he -- he ended up just like living in there and, like, sending away all these, uh, things in the mail and, uh, he -- he'd, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- end up, you know, finally getting food or whatever after a while and things like that and, uh --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that sounded considerably more, uh, dramatic and, uh, people were sort of worried about the human rights ramifications of that particular show, but apparently it --
R:  Yeah.  Apparently.
L:  -- was very entertaining.
R:  [LAUGH] No food for a week. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's amazing what people will put on television now.  The -- the interesting thing is watching all these spin off shows like -- particular like the Blind Date shows and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  TLC actually has Blind Date shows where people's friends will pick other people up so, you know, the dates actually tend to work out or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, people actually have a fun time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's no, like, audience to, you know, laugh at the expense of these people or whatever and those are -- I mean, like, I -- I actually -- those are fairly interesting.  Um, TLC has, like, become, like, my new addiction as far as television goes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they've got all sorts of really cool shows.  Uh, mainly home improvement shows.  Those things are really cool.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I love those too.  Changing Spaces and all those shows.
L:  Yeah.  And then w- -- uh, there -- let's see, also the, um -- the Empty Barge[?], uh, and various mechanical things like gr- -- uh, Junkyard Wars and, uh, Full Metal Challenge, or whatever.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Unfortunately, I -- you know, in my dorm I get three channels.  I get NBC, ABC and PBS.
L:  Oh. [MN]
R:  So, I'm quite limited. [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I- in -- so, you're probably a college student then as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what u- university do you go to, out of curiosity?
R:  I'm at Harvard.
L:  Oh, you're at Harvard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Cool.  I've got a friend who goes there.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  Her name's Jan, although I haven't -- I'm pretty sure you probably don't know her. [MN]
R:  No, probably not.  It's a big place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know anyone. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  But that's sort of the -- uh, Harvard seems like a very interesting place.  My mother did her masters there but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've visited the campus.  I really like Harvard Square.  It's very interesting.
R:  Yeah.  It's very fun.
L:  But, yeah, I'm at OSU, Ohio State.
R:  Cool.  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  But, uh, let's see.  What were we talking about?
R:  Uh, TLC, I think we were talking about.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I don't have a TV in my room unfortunately so some of my suite mates have, you know, televisions and things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I usually end up usually watching TV when I'm back at my parents' house or whatever.  So, I mean, it's weird because my -- my dad was gone for three months and I was sort of like staying at his house and, uh, so he -- he had only the basic cable so we could keep Road Runner connected.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and so, I mean, there [MN] -- no music television type shows which aren't really music any more anyway so who cares.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the -- the major thing that I was missing was, like, you know, the food network which is great to watch.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah. [MN]
L:  I mean, it -- it's weird to see all these -- the -- the truly interesting cable shows are, you know, ones that are all these, like, weird specialty networks and things like that.  So, I've completely given up on main stream media.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  I -- I love the food network and, um, like, Discovery Channel and that kind of thing.  I like watching the sort of realistic shows.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  It's -- it's sort of weird.  So, I mean, like, the -- the truly interesting things are the r- -- I mean, the shows about reality, but the reality television itself is sort of, uh, uh, disturbing.
R:  Yeah.  It's not my reality, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [MN] Yeah.  It's -- it's much more interesting seeing actual people do things as opposed to people who show up for a TV show and go, "Okay.  We're supposed to make things happen".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, my -- my room mate always watches the Real World which is --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- interesting --
R:  On MTV.
L:  Yeah.  O- -- and -- and -- and the fact that, regardless of who's on the show, a fight always breaks out.  I -- I've never understood that. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't -- I mean,  like, I suppose that's the appeal and everything but, I mean, like, if I wanted to see people argue and fight I just have to, you know, like, talk to my girlfriend about what her room mate's doing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Which is, you know, ten times worse than the real world could ever be so --
R:  Yeah.  Really?
L:  I mean, wha-- [MN] I -- I guess people are, you know -- want to [MN] -- I mean, like, I suppose the usual line is people want to, um, you know, spice up their life and watching other people argue or something, I have no idea.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.  Very strange to me.
L:  Yeah.  Also it seems sort of odd because you really don't get -- I mean, it's very, like, sterile and you don't really get to meet interesting people, I guess.  I mean, like, they have -- I mean, since all those have screened, I mean, if you've been to Harvard for a while -- well, I doubt actually Real World comes there, but the Real World occasionally comes by Columbus and says --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, "Anybody want to try out" or whatever, um, and then, you know, they -- they screen whoever the contestants are and then they ship them off to whatever city and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a fight breaks out.  Like, now, do they plan that?  Do they go, "Okay, yeah, their personalities are going to clash so we need to put them in a room together"? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, like, that seems perverse.
R:  Yeah.  Pretty twisted.
L:  Yeah.  Quite strange.
R:  Yeah.  I've always kind of wondered whether they have, like, a psychologist working behind the scenes like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Oh, let's -- let's try to get personalities that just really are not gonna work and then we'll just get the two that are just absolutely, like, the love match" you know.
L:  Right.  Well, the -- the interesting thing is, like, you know, everybody, or -- or a few of the people will be dating people, you know, and now that they've moved away from wherever they're living, you know, you have a long distance relationship going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And see how they're, you know, trying to screw with people's relationships and stuff like that.  It's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how incredibly demented we -- I -- I mean, disturbing is this?  I mean, they're trying to, like, mess with people's lives.  It's like --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  And I -- I suppose they're signing waivers.  I mean, you know, they -- they say, "Okay.  Sure.  Abuse me however you want" but still.
R:  Yes.  I guess, like, "Whatever psychological damage you cause, I'm not going to hold you responsible for".
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Seems like these people are going to end up pretty messed up.
L:  Right.  And, I mean, I suppose the -- the allure is large sums of money and, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the same thing happens to, you know, like, Microsoft interns[?]. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Please sign away your -- your, uh, mental health for money, please".
R:  Yeah.  Really.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't know, it -- it's seems to be a fairly bizarre phenomena but I guess --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I would agree with that.
L:  Not entirely a -- I guess it is reality i- in a way but only on a mental level.  If you're actually watching the show and you think that that's real then, you know, that's not really --
R:  I think you have problems if you think [LAUGH] that's a reality. 
L:  Right.  Which is kind of weird because then I guess you're just saying that real life is like real life, if you're talking about the mental levels of a television show. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy.  Crazy.
L:  Uh --
R:  Well, I don't know what we're supposed to do with this thing.  Are we supposed to just keep talking?  Is it going to tell us?
L:  Yeah.  Um, I had a session yesterday and you just keep on talking for ten minutes and then they give you thirty seconds at the end and, uh -- to say goodbye and things like that.  So, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I don't know how long we've been talking but I suppose we should keep talking.
R:  Oh, well, that's fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think if they count Who Wants to be a Millionaire as the --
L:  Yeah.  That was --
R:  -- reality TV show.
L:  That was one of the things that --
R:  I guess --
L:  -- they -- they suggested.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's kind of curious where they draw the line between, you know, game show and reality television.
R:  Yeah.  Because to me, I mean, I would watch that show.  That's not really too far beyond the pale for me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, they actually do recruit a lot of people for that show from here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And um -- yeah.  One of my friends whose, um, our linguistics leader, that's how I heard about this survey.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, was on it and won sixteen thousand bucks.
L:  Cool.
R:  So, that was pretty good.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It was kind of funny because that particular show was, um, driving the network crazy because what people would do was, rather than go for the, you know, million at the end with the really hard questions, they'd just get up to a point where they had a whole lot of money and then call it quits. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, apparently the network was -- was losing tons of money with that.  It was like, oh --
R:  Yeah.  They want people to lose big time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they give out a -- a million bucks once it's a lot better than giving out sixty four thousand a lot of times.
L:  Right.  And th- that -- that's sort of the -- the funny thing but I think they revamped the show or something like that.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, have they?  I haven't seen it in so long.
L:  I think I've only seen, like, one or two episodes.  I -- I was ne- --
