L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Hey, how's it going?
L:  Good.  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm good.  I'm David.
L:  I'm Leigh.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so, we're supposed to talk about food, huh?
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  All right --
L:  I guess the -- what was the topic?  Um, if we'd --
R:  Uh, it was --
L:  -- rather eat out or ...
R:  Would you rather eat or in and, uh ...
L:  Why.
R:  Why, I guess, yeah.  All right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, well [COUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think I have a clear preference either way.  I don't know about you [SIGH].
L:  There's, like, advantages to both [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely. [MN]
L:  Because if you stay in you can, uh, make whatever you want or -- but then you actually have to make it yourself [LAUGH].
R:  Right and this whole clean up issue, you know, and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But it is much cheaper.  It's also much cheaper.
L:  Yeah.  You don't have to ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can take the ten dollars from this call and, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- buy groceries instead or something.  I -- I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  That would make more meals but you'd only --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get one if you went out [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Do you have -- do you have restaurants nearby that you like to go by -- go to or ...?
L:  Um, yes, actually [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I'm in college so I mostly eat at the dining hall, so I'd rather go out than --
R:  Excellent.
L:  -- eat at the dining hall [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So, wait -- okay, so, does the dining hall count as in or out?
L:  Um, I don't know.  It could go either way.  I don't have to pay for it.
R:  Yeah.  But at the same time you don't prepare it, right?  So ...
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess it is out.  It's just really nasty out.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Although I feel like when I was in college, like, you know, there was -- there were nights, you know, that I looked forward to at the dining hall, you know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Ours was called the commons.
L:  [LAUGH] Rare occasions. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You know, I mean, there were -- Tuesday night was -- was spicy pasta night, you know.  That was one of my absolute favorites.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But the weekends were pretty rough.  I don't -- I don't know --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Especially --
R:  Because a lot of people went home and so they, you know, tailored their cooking accordingly [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was useless.
L:  Did you have, like, special nights for the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- food -- the different food?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it was, like, -- it was on this, like, two week cycle, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, um, you would kind of know what was -- like, you didn't really know but you knew kind of vaguely what was coming if you showed up on a Tuesday or a Wednesday or a Thursday or something.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, like, Thursday was fried chicken night, you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Tuesday was spicy pasta night, um, gosh, the rest of the stuff is escaping me but --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, we don't have special -- it's just, like, you show up but you hope it's something decent that you'll eat.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Where -- where --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do you go do school?
L:  Penn
R:  Penn, okay.  I'm a grad student at Penn, so [MN] --
L:  Oh.
R:  Although [MN] um, yeah but I've never been to the Penn dining hall so I don't really know what it's like there but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah.  I guess I -- like, you sort of cross this line I guess when you go to college and you have to start cooking for yourself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  If I had a stove, I'd cook for myself [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I felt that way too, you know, but you'd be surprised, like, they charge you so much for room and board in college.  It's ridiculous, you know, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you just lived and ate on your own you could save a lot of money but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's how the college makes money off of you.  You know, it's one of the ways that the college makes money off of you.  There's al -- there's al --
L:  So, what's your favorite meal? [MN]
R:  Ooh, favorite meal.  I don't know.  I -- I go in phases, right.  Right now I'm really into, like, the Indian food around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like New Delhi and, um, whatchamacallit, the w- Sitar, isn't it?  On thirty eighth and -- or thirty ninth and Chestnut.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and this -- the -- the -- what's it called?  Saag panir, something like that.  Anyway, that's really good, um, but I can't really cook -- I -- I do make this chicken and avocado business.  That's -- that's really good --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when I cook for myself.  What about you?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I like a lot of, like, seafood or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, Italian food or Chinese really too -- well, I like Chinese soup, like egg drop and wonton.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I don't eat seafood.  I -- I don't eat anything that used to swim but --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Um, [MN] I know that's kind of rigid but, uh, I don't know ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I had a bad experience when I was a kid [LAUGH] or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just doesn't do it for me.
L:  Well, like -- like, do shrimps swim?  Like, they kind of, like --
R:  They sort of --
L:  -- crawl or whatever.
R:  They -- w- well, shrimp, they -- they can sort of leap and stuff, right.  I g- I mean, l get lobsters and crabs I guess I -- I could -- I can eat because -- but --
L:  Yeah, they crawl.
R:  They don't technically swim.  All right.  They crawl.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they do exist under water.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But if I wanted to extend this further, you know, I would -- I would expand the band to all things that l- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That live and [MN] r- reproduce underwater, I guess [MN].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah.  Um, yeah, I like Italian food but, um, I grew up in Jersey and, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there's an Italian restaurant, like, on every corner of New Jersey so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it gets a little old after a while.  I -- I like it.
L:  Um, I can imagine [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, just because it's -- if you've seen The Sopranos then you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what I'm talking about [MN].
L:  [LAUGH] That's what I like at the dining halls, you can almost al- -- you can always get pasta every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you can't eat pasta every day, like --
R:  No.
L:  --you can't live on Italian food.
R:  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's not -- it's not really good for you either because there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no protein in pasta and stuff.  Although have you seen they have this new kind of pasta that's, like, infused with all this protein and stuff.  I don't -- I've never tried it but --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It sounds -- sounds like an interesting option because when I first started cooking for myself after college, like, that was all I knew how to make, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I bare- -- I barely knew how to do that.  Like, I didn't know you needed a colander to drain the water and stuff like that.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's how, like, inept I was.
L:  [MN] I hope you've learned a lot more since then.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yes.  I ha- -- I have.  I have.
L:  [MN]
R:  I have my own cookware and I have cookbooks and -- which I [NOISE] rarely use but --
L:  So, you cre ate and not cook? [MN]
R:  Yeah, usually --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See [MN] to cook stuff out of a cookbook is -- it takes so much more time, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than if you just, like, kind of open up a bunch of stuff and throw it in and spice it up.
L:  And hope it tastes okay or ...?
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, I make stew, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um -- and I just feel like you throw the meat and the beans and all the sauce in there and -- and then, I mean, you can work off a recipe but you can also just open your spice cabinet and, like, toss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in oregano and all this stuff [NOISE].  I don't know.
L:  I'm not that brave.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I usually just follow a recipe [MN].
R:  True, true.
L:  And make what -- I have my mom -- I ask my mom what I should [MN] put in.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, moms -- moms are good sources of recipes, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, my mom -- my mom made me this little stack of recipe cards for when I graduated from college.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have used them -- I have used them several times.  They come in handy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's a recipe for broccoli casserole.  It's just [NOISE] good stuff.  Good stuff.  Do you -- do you cook anything in particular if you do cook?
L:  Um, I like to m- -- I make chili.
R:  Chili.
L:  Sometimes I really like that or, um, chicken enchilada casserole.
R:  Chicken -- chicken what?  Enchilada, did you say?
L:  Chicken enchilada casserole.  It's this, like -- you, like, layer the shells and then it has, um, like creamed soup in it and, like, just, like, spicy chicken and you put cheese.
R:  Excellent.
L:  It's really good [LAUGH].
R:  That sounds very good.  It all sounds very good.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I like to bake more than to cook.  I like baking cookies and stuff.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know -- I don't bake much.  I was in a place without an oven for, like, a year so [MN] it made it kind of difficult, um.
L:  Yeah.  All I have is a microwave.  I don't have much to work with right now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That kind of limits you a little bit, like, to Uncle Ben's quick meals and stuff, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Like, Roman noodles all the time.
R:  Oh, Roman.  Yes, yes.  Roman noodles, the -- the staple of my diet for one summer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think it's very good for you [LAUGH].  Have you ever looked at the -- the nutrition information on the back?
L:  I try not to. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's, like, nine hundred percent of your daily sodium.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, uh, like soy sauce is really bad for you, you know.  Full of salt and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't really care, you know.  I just kinda like to eat what I eat, you know.
L:  I try not to pay much attention and just eat what I want [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Hope for the best.
R:  Exactly [MN].
L:  [MN]
R:  Because I feel like every few years that -- that, you know, the -- the doctors come out and say something's bad for you, you know, um, and I just  -- I try not pay any sort of --
L:  Well, then they change their mind and say it's like -- first they're like, "Eggs are bad for you" and then they're like, "Eggs are good for you" and --
R:  Exactly.  The whole medical paradigm, like, the last thirty years has been overturned in the last year.  They're like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Oh, no, you don't really want to eat twelve things of bread and pasta a day.  You'll weigh, like, eight hundred pounds" you know, and "You wanna --"
L:  Yeah.  That's t- --
R:  "You wanna eat protein" you know.  And then you've got this whole other set of doctors that's like, "No.  Protein is bad.  It'll kill you.  It'll cause you heart attacks and --" [MN].  Who to believe, right?  I don't know.  I'm not a doctor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just [MN] -- I just eat [MN].
L:  [LAUGH] Just eat whatever you want.
R:  Right. [MN] Whatever fresh grocers are selling for cheap, I guess, that's what I'll eat.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Whatever's on sale.
R:  Yeah, exactly, or [MN] two for one, um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What's that?
L:  What?
R:  Nothing. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so what -- is there anything good at the dining hall at Penn?
L:  Um, I go to Ped.
R:  Oh, Ped.  Gee.  Sorry.
L:  That's all right.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  Um, some s- -- well, there's some stuff that's good.  Like, if you get lucky, like, certain days they'll have good stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it all depends.  Well, there's some -- like, there's a whole bunch of different dining halls and you can get, like, chicken, like, fried chicken, every day, or hamburgers, pizza.
R:  Right.  Is it an all you can eat kind of place or is it one of those really like --
L:  Um --
R:  -- meal plans or ...?
L:  There are a couple that are all you can eat and there are a couple that, um, you can just use, like, you have, like, blocks.  They're each, like, five dollars and then you can buy whatever --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you want, so ...
R:  Interesting.  We mostly just had the all you can eat options which -- which turned out to be quite disastrous for some people, I think [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I can imagine.  Some people are -- take that too literally.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly.  Like, all you can eat all day long.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what it is.  Open all day, right?  So, you just sort of walk in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to go -- you know, we used to go at eleven when it first opened and then eat for, like, an hour, you know, and then talk, so, like, queue and then eat again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's one way to get your money's worth.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, what I miss really -- it's one of the main things I miss most about college is, uh -- it's, like, being able to eat, like, with a big group of people, like, at a -- an assigned time every day, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It, like, really builds community, I think [SIGH].  Um, you kind of miss that once you get out but ...
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Um ...
L:  [MN]
R:  So, uh, those are my thoughts on food [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, oh, yeah, okay, that's [inaudible], okay.  So, I was reading this thing on line the other day, so what's your favorite movie about food?
L:  About food?
R:  Mm.  A movie that involves food in some way?
L:  I don't -- trying to think of a movie that involves food.  I just saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  That had food in it.
R:  My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Indeed, yeah.
L:  They're always eating.
R:  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  It was hilarious.  Uh --
L:  Well, they chose to eat at home and not eat -- well, I guess they do eat out at the restaurant sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  They have a diner but I guess that's -- it was a lifestyle sort of --
L:  That's still like they're cooking it so it's not really --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's like a dual thing.  It's like the college dining hall, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um
L:  But they have to clean up too so that's more eating at home than eating out.
R:  But you could hire somebody to clean up, right?
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  You kn- -- you know, the help cleans up and -- and you sort of eat the leftovers or whatever you've cooked or -- or you can make your own stuff and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Kind of a mixed bag.  Have you ever seen Big Night?
L:  Big Night, no.
R:  No.  Great movie.  It's a great movie.
L:  Really.
R:  My all time favorite.  Um --
