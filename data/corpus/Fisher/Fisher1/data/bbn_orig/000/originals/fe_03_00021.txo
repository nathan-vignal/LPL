L:  [LAUGH]
R:  H- hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Caesar.
L:  Caesar?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.  I'm Nicky.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Is this the first time that you've done this or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Yeah.  This is my first call.  I was just wondering, like, do they let you know when the ten minutes are up or ...?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  Like, if you don't stick to topic do they not pay you? [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  Well, they said you didn't have to necessarily stick to the topic.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They, like, s- -- they suggest one or whatever but if -- they said you -- if you wanted to talk about anything, you talk about it.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  Uh, well, I'm from California but I'm in Chicago now.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do y- -- that's a -- that's a nice extreme. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You went from, like, nice beach weather in your bikini to, like, freezing Chicago with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And a -- al- -- ain't it a bit cold? [MN]
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's not pleasant. [LAUGH]
R:  Y- you're in Chicago for school or ...?
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm a --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- graduate student so ...
R:  Oh, good for you.  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia.  And that's where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you are now?
R:  Yeah.  I'm in Philadelphia now, yeah.
L:  How -- how's the weather there?  I mean, it's not nice or any- [LAUGH].
R:  Well, we just got, like, seven inches of snow yesterday.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  The East Coast snow storm. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's a big deal for us because, you know, when it -- we -- we've been having warm winters.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, actually, a -- a friend of mine is in Chicago now.  He works for the, uh, United States Hispanic Leadership Institute.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh, w- -- actually once a year I go to Chicago for a conference.  I love Chicago.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  It's t- too cold for me but [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] I don't like it but that's probably more to do with my class mates though. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Just school [inaudible], I guess.  But, anyway ...
R:  You do- -- you don't head on down to the harbour there and, uh, visit Navy Pier?
L:  No.  I've never even been there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, girl, you gotta go travel a little bit.
L:  Yeah.  I do.  But, you know, I don't wanna do, like, a lot of stuff alone and for some -- well, for whatever reason, like, the people in my graduate department are really just like not --
R:  They're not?
L:  -- not up to, like, leaving the house.
R:  Oh.  Is this your first semester in -- in your grad program?
L:  No.  Uh, no.  It's been -- this is my, uh, second year.
R:  Second year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you're almost done.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  No.  What are -- what are y- -- what are you studying?
L:  Linguistics.
R:  Oh, linguistics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ho- how long is the program?
L:  Uh, well, it's as long as you take to finish [LAUGH] basically.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that varies from person to person, which is --
R:  If you go full time --
L:  -- to say anywhere from three to twenty years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But I think, like, an average of eight [LAUGH] or something like that.
R:  And you want to graduate, like, a doctorate?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  See, I got my -- I got my doctorate in law so that only took me --
L:  Oh, you have yours too.
R:  -- three years. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  Uh, that -- that was fine with me.  I don't know if I could do the twenty year plan. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.  So, um -- so, Chicago, I guess, is known for, like, their linguistics.  There wasn't anything out in Cali?
L:  Uh, we -- no.  It's interesting, like, I applied to nine schools and got accepted at eight and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the only one I got rejected from was USC which is the only one in, like, a warm --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- weather place. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  And the tuition's, like, cheap or, like, nothing, right?
L:  Where?
R:  For Californ- -- I thought, like, California residents, like, the college, like, at USC -- USC is, like --
L:  USC is a private school though.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Like, UCLA is state but --
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, do you have any family out in Chicago or ...?
L:  No.  I have family in Madison though.  They just --
R:  Mommy --
L:  -- moved up actually.
R:  Mommy and daddy are worried about you, huh?
L:  No.  No.  I -- I've had experience living alone.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's cool.  So, did --
L:  [MN]
R:  Did you wanna stick to this topic about winter illness?
L:  Well, I was just about to ask you.  Are you sick, [LAUGH] Caesar?
R:  [LAUGH] No.  I'm all right.  I just got over, uh, a cold a couple of weeks ago.
L:  And would you attribute that to weather changes?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] No.
R:  Uh, yes, I would. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How about you? 
L:  Uh, I'm -- I'm -- I'm okay.  Yeah.  I'm a pretty -- I'm a pretty, uh, hardy girl, so I don't -- yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, uh, couldn't you tell if I was sick?  Like, wouldn't that be in my linguistics or --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know how --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you normally sound, right.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, is that what you do?  You, like, compare?
L:  -- that could have just b- -- that could have just been, like, how you -- maybe you just, like, when naturally we have a raspy voice or something.  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] I sound like a waitress and, "Hey, hun, how ya doing?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.  That's funny.  So, do you plan on going back to Cali when you graduate, or wherever life takes you?
L:  Um, [SIGH] well, yeah, I -- I -- I can live in several places but I don't wanna live in a cold place.
R:  [MN]
L:  This is just, like, not -- this is -- I mean, I just wake up and either, one, it's grey and it's gloomy looking or, two, it's like this -- it's, you know -- it's deceptive.  You look outside and it's sunny and you think it must be warm but, no, it's like twenty degrees, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  I grew up in Philly all my life and I'm -- I'm planning on in the next year just going to Miami.
L:  Miami?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you -- you visited there before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you loved it?
R:  I love Miami.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've got -- I've been, like, on vacation there, like, eight times in the last --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- two or three years. [LAUGH]
L:  I've never been to Miami.
R:  No.
L:  I went to Orlando, but I never visited Miami.
R:  No.  Miami's hot.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I hear.
R:  Yeah.  Not in terms of weather.  I mean, it's hot in weather too but, you know, it's a -- it's a party little -- little city there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard.
R:  Yeah.  Nice bit of beach.  It's got that Cali feel to it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Beaches there.
L:  We're, like, in a competition for hottest city of US. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do, uh, uh, E special.  Wild on E.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, yeah, I don't know.  You're brave.  I couldn't do what you did.  I don't think I could go from, like, a nice seventy weather or eighty, you know, to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- twenty below.
L:  Yeah.  I guess --
R:  You really must --
L:  -- you just, uh, have to -- to go where -- where you can and get what you want, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was just going to say it's dedication towards your linguistic profession. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- well, I --
L:  Oh, well, it was either that or, like, go back to temp work answering telephones so I decided to --
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you, buddy.  See, I'm thinking ten minutes is up, but I [LAUGH] --
L:  Like, will they just cut us off in, like, mid sentence [LAUGH]?
R:  I don't know.  Let me -- actually, let me check my phone for a second.  Let me see.  Uh, no.  It's only been, like, uh, seven minutes, actually.
L:  Oh.  Are you on your cellphone?
R:  Yeah.  Aren't you?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, I thought it was like a cellphone study.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  [MN] Maybe just is on my end. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Did you -- what, did you dial in or did they call you?
L:  Mm, they called me.
R:  Oh.  That's funny.  I thought it was just, like, a regional -- like, people from Philadelphia, whatever, would call.  Then when you said you were from Chicago, I thought, "Wow".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nationwide.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, tell me about your roomies?
L:  My what?
R:  Tell me about your roomies or your school mates?
L:  Well, I live alone so there are no room mates.
R:  No.
L:  But, um --
R:  You --
L:  [MN]
R:  You like -- you like living alone as opposed to, like, having a room mate?
L:  Oh, yes.  I live in this little box and it's -- I'd rather live in a little box than live in a -- well, a big box with other people. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really.  W- why?  They, like, would irk you or bother you or ...?
L:  People just work my nerve.  I just, you know [LAUGH] -- like, they're okay for a while but I just can't live with -- I mean, like, I just wanna get away and I can't, like, feel free and comfortable with other people.  Do you live alone?
R:  I live alone, yes.
L:  And why?
R:  But I've had -- well, I've had room mates in the past and, uh, it's been fun.
L:  Really.  I had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one room mate that was terrible.
R:  They left the toilet seat up?
L:  N- no.
R:  No.  I'm only kidding. [LAUGH]
L:  It was a girl but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she was really, uh -- she was really, like, obsessive compulsive about some things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it was kind of frightening. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really should have a room mate because I'm -- I'm really never home so [LAUGH] it would be nice to just split the cost with somebody. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  For a place I'm hardly ever at.
L:  Yeah.  Money.  Yeah.  That's the thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, wait a minute, you have your JD, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Are you working yet?
R:  Yeah.  I'm on a -- I'm in a non profit agency out here.
L:  Oh.  Now, that's the problem is you [LAUGH] -- if you were working for, like, a for profit place you wouldn't even care about splitting anything.
R:  [LAUGH] Why?  Because I'd be making so much money or ...?
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I don't know.  Attorneys don't get paid that much, like everyone thinks.  I mean, if you --
L:  Well, they get --
R:  -- if you land --
L:  -- paid enough.
R:  -- a large law firm --
L:  My mother is actually -- has her JD.
R:  Uh-huh.  Does she practice?
L:  No.  Not now.  Not any more.  She's had some sicknesses and stuff but -- in fact, just sort of like a year or two after she got her deg- -- she went back when she was older.
R:  And did she work in, like, a mid size firm or --
L:  Well, she worked for --
R:  -- large law firm?
L:  She worked for, like, the state government or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, like, I don't know --
R:  Well, she did all right --
L:  -- in prosecution --
R:  -- there then.
L:  -- or something or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- county gov- [LAUGH].  And she really just did not like it but, I mean, it would certainly be enough to, like, live alone. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, well --
L:  Especially after --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a year or two.  Is someone calling you?
R:  No.
L:  What is that?  Is that --
R:  I --
L:  -- my phone? [MN]
R:  I don't know.  What did you hear?
L:  I keep hearing like breaks in your voice.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  Like call waiting.
R:  -- it's a cell phone and I'm in my car so it may like --
L:  Oh.
R:  May be, like, me just --
L:  Oh, car, that's nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's not a surfboard though.
L:  Wow.  Who cares?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What could I do with a surfboard out here? [MN]
R:  True.  True. [LAUGH] It's funny because I -- I've met some people, like, from the Mid West, like, Ohio and, like, Min- Minnesota and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're like, "Oh, yeah.  We have snowmobiles in our house".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm like, "Yeah".  They're all excited when it snows again. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Nah.  It's okay". [LAUGH]
L:  Snowmobiles in the house.
R:  I -- I ho- -- I hope I never own a snowmobile. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] So ...
L:  Um.
R:  So, where do you go to, uh, [NOISE] -- so, your linguistics is for grad.  Where did you do your undergrad?
L:  Where or what?
R:  Where?
L:  Uh, do you know Pitzer College?
R:  Wow, never heard of it. [NOISE]
L:  It's in Claremont, California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And --
R:  And wha- what did you take up there?
L:  Uh, anthropology.
R:  Mhm.  You're a people person, huh?
L:  Actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I really don't like people very much but I've always been [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it i- -- but it is kind of bizarre to me which I guess made me wanna like find out what's going on with them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You -- you don't like the living.  You like the dead.  You [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know -- no, no no.  I just, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just out of curiosity, like, you know, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why do people do the things they do?
R:  Huh. [NOISE] So, what do you plan on doing [NOISE] with your linguistics degree? [NOISE]
