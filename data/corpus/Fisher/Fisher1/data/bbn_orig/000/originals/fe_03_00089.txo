R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Oh, hello, it's --
R:  My name's -- my name's Mueno[?].  Who is this?
L:  Ah, this is Zack.
R:  Hello, Zack.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Ah --
R:  So, reality shows, do you watch those?
L:  I actually don't watch much TV so it was kind of, ah, um, a topic that I wasn't so prepared to talk about [LAUGH] but --
R:  Actually, I -- I -- I don't watch them either because I don't watch TV much either.  But I used to.  Um, I remember seeing some of them when I was younger.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I know a lot of people who watch them, yeah.
L:  But only I have watched a couple of shows.  One -- I -- I think I have watched one or two episodes of Survivor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then a different version of Millionaire, um.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not Who Wants to be a Millionaire?  I think -- oh, well, I guess I have watched the other one, Who Wants to be a Millionaire?  I don't think that classifies as reality TV, do you?  That's more like a quiz program, right?
R:  [MN] Mm, um, I -- I guess so.  Um, more, yeah, like Survivor ones are more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of what they're talking about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think.  But I -- it's always been so strange to me that people get really hooked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into, um -- you know, I think it gives them a sense of, um [LIPSMACK] people always want a peak into other people's lives.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, also I think it might be, ah, the fact that it feels like participating in it, in the way they're --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- sort of glamorizing and putting a whole set and having a well arranged story.  It's more like bringing that down to the level of everyday life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where people see, um, errors, people see, I mean, funniness, clumsiness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I guess that --
R:  Social -- social relationships.
L:  Right.
R:  And with these shows it's usually set in, like, extreme cases.
L:  Yeah, a-
R:  And I think it's that part of it that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because we -- a lot of people have such normal lives that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they get into, yeah.
L:  It -- it's the same sense of, ah, I mean, needing the element of surprise.  Or in the newspaper, the element of scandal.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think what -- when it -- it used to be like when people used to read documentaries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things like that.  And with the TV age --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and people don't read anymore and this is -- this is it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's, ah, a good, ah, way of looking at it as well.  Um, to me it seems, um, part of it is also related to, um, provoking people to do things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, they try to put people in very, ah, sensational scenarios, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- throw something that really [MN] creates a response or a -- a knee jerk reaction, which tests their, ah, automatic impulses.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, not something you can sit back and prime and think about and then respond.  It's more trying to --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- get people to react quickly.  [MN]
R:  And then every -- every week you wonder what's going on and you have to watch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But there's always the -- when there's those shows there's two sides to it.  There's the audience and there's people who really want to participate in these things.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And [MN] some exposure, ah, element [LAUGH] of wanting to really be in public in a way, because there's always cameras, tons of cameras --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's following you around in your bedroom --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or when you're showering.  Everywhere, yeah.
L:  Well, there was one that I had read about in newspaper.  I think it was put on by some channel in UK.  It was about -- oh, no, sorry, I think it was on a web cam.  Ah, this person had basically fixed, ah, cameras all over in -- in his house which was [COUGH] being streamed on the web --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- twenty four hours, seven days a week.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  What kind of life --
R:  And when --
L:  -- would that be?  [LAUGH]
R:  And I think when he went to work or he went to the bathroom, he'd put some object in front of the camera.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or there -- there was a woman who used to do it and, um, you know [MN] twenty four hours basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do -- do you know who actually started this?  I mean, which show can you think of as --
R:  Um.
L:  -- the harbinger of this stuff?
R:  The earlier one that I can remember is MTV.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, when they started doing The Real World.
L:  Oh, I see.  I haven't seen any of those.
R:  Do you remember that?  I think I remember watching it -- that was in the late eighties.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  Wh -- what was it about?
R:  It was, uh, these -- they got about seven people, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, got, ah, a loft to live in, in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And got different young people together to live together.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this was for a period of, ah, like --
R:  About, ah, I'm not sure.  More than half a month, I think.
L:  I see.
R:  Maybe almost a year.
L:  And -- and was there anything common between these people?  Did they have a particular taste of music or something which ...?
R:  Ah, no, I think they took different people from different fields.
L:  I see.
R:  But just one was a model.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The other one was a dancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  One was a poet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think one was, ah, maybe a musician.  And different people but around the same age.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then all these, you know, different friendships, um [LIPSMACK] fighting, romance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- starts to [LAUGH] come in.
L:  So it seems like these people were all, ah, mostly from arts.  People with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, high levels of creativity and emotion probably.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And it was MTV driven, which means it's probably the pop culture.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The younger generation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I have -- it's -- it's beginning to catch up in other countries as well.  I had seen some shows in India as well --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- where they had something similar.  Not quite --
R:  Are you from India, or ...?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I -- I -- I've been here for a long while.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whenever I visit I tend to see one or two episodes or a little bit of TV, so at that time I had noticed that, ah -- I mean, things in US influence -- or the media anyway influences --
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the [inaudible] everywhere else quite quickly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm from Japan but it's --
L:  Which country?
R:  The media -- Japan.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And the media really takes over people's lives and they now -- they started having, maybe ten years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, dating online.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or -- and then actually the -- the other person is not a real person.
L:  I see.
R:  So, this is the opposite.  And you -- I don't know how they did it but you have a relationship with somebody which is actually not real.  And --
L:  So, what do you mean?  I mean, so are the two are not on the show at the same time?
R:  They -- they go online and they have a -- they have a relationship and they -- these people -- it was mostly males --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- who were getting into this and they called them their girlfriends --
L:  I see.
R:  -- basically.  And it was a strange thing.  And they were interviewed and they -- they said they don't really want real relationships, like, they don't want a real person because you can't control it.
L:  Right.  And it's also complicated [LAUGH] sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.  I never thought about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  But when it gets out of hand like that it begins to become, ah, a very strange sickness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of not being able to be in the real world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And it's -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, is other -- I mean, the TV [MN] that you see in Japan, episodes and serials, are they very similar to US, or is there more -- I mean, are there different --
R:  It's got a different -- ah, the -- it's different taste through it.  Maybe it's a little -- a little sillier, a little, um, less censored.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there used to be in Japan, when I remember when I was very young --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, these broadcasts of, um, almost like competitions but they go through all these harsh conditions --
L:  I see.
R:  -- to be the winner.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's similar.  And they -- they would create these tents that would heat up to, ah, so hot, then whoever stays inside the longest [LAUGH] ah, gets elected --
L:  So, this is more like a physical -- physical endurance or a physical test and things like that?
R:  Yeah.  It goes through the, you know, they go through the ocean, they go -- they take different sides.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, did you say there's more censor- censorship or less censorship?
R:  There's less censorship.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's interesting.  But wouldn't, ah, because of the traditions, isn't Japan more conservative that there would be some self censorship as well?
R:  In media it's -- I think it's because they're so constrained maybe in the real personal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- level that these [MN] medias and comic books there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, start to take over and they want to play out their fantasies --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- within what they see.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now I don't know.  At this stage everything is very crazy over there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- you know, more people killing each other and [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I think I can relate to that because in India, too, they make a lot of movies and it's actually, um -- it's popular because, ah, mostly it's an escape from reality --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for, ah, for most people.  Especially for people who just don't make enough money to at- attain material wealth or live in comfort.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They -- they go to these movies and they are totally transformed or taken into --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a different world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where they can live out their fantasy and meet these, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, people, I mean, actors and actresses who are, of course, handsome and glorious and gorgeous --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that.
R:  So, there's a ca- a paradox there.  You know, they call them reality shows but it's for everyone else to escape reality.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that's, I think, a good way of putting it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, so --
R:  Well, if this -- yeah, go ahead.
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  No, I was going to say that -- that you -- I -- people begin to act differently when they are on camera.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is, ah, another interesting aspect.
L:  Well, I -- I guess it depends on how, ah, people are brought up.  Ah, like in the US, ah, kids are allowed to be very extrovert so they tend to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be, ah, very easy in front of the camera.
R:  Mhm
L:  Or -- or
