R:  Erin.
L:  Meghan.
R:  Okay.  What are we supposed to do now? [MN]
L:  Um, I guess we're just supposed to talk about illness.
R:  Okay.  Um, they were talking about if we get sick when the seasons change and I don't know about you but I tend to get sick a lot after the seasons change due to allergies and such.  So, I don't know.  What about you?
L:  Um, [COUGH] where are you from?
R:  I am from in Illinois originally but I go to school here at the University of Illinois in Champaign.
L:  Okay.  Um, I'm from Arizona where the seasons don't really change that much.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't really tend to get sick when the seasons do change.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I, um, actually this semester it -- it's been -- it's really cold here right now.  It's about thirty degrees here. [MN]
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um, I tend to kind of, like, if it's been warmer and it gets colder then I usually get a lot of allergies, just sinus infections, fairly often.  I probably get, I would say, five per year and normally when I get 'em treated they do go away a lot faster but the last one I had I was pretty bad because I, uh, got sick during one of my big exam weeks and I did go to the doctor and I started to take medication, but once I got better I stopped.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, then, over actually this past week or two at Thanksgiving break I ended up getting sick again and I think that was why because I just didn't take all the medication so -- but, yeah.  I don't really know [MN] what else to say.
L:  Yeah. I have allergies, um, but they don't really come when the seasons come.  It's just -- it feels random.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if it's from, like, a weather change or, like, with the wind or something blowing things up in the air.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I do have allergies and I don't really get it treated because it's not that bad.  I just kind of ignore it and it usually goes away.
R:  Mhm.  Is, um -- the humidity's not really bad out there though, is it?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes in the summer it is but not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- very often.
R:  Does that make a difference to you?
L:  I think it does.  I think the humidity does make a difference.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause that's what happens during our summers like -- like I said, I was originally -- I'm originally from southern Illinois and when I'm home over the summer the humidity gets really bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I tend to get sick then a lot too.  But not as much as, like, the switch from hot to cold.  There's more of a -- I get more sinus infections then than I do when it actually gets warmer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  I find --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that, like, a lot of people that I know that have allergies that that's the case also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The switch from hot to cold is the big one.
R:  Y- yeah.  That's kinda how my room mates are here too.  Like, especially one of 'em.  He has pretty bad allergies and he's always, like, I don't know, coughing a lot and stuff and he tends to kinda do the same thing that I do.  A lot of people I know are like that.  My parents are the same way.  Um, my mom gets a lot of migraines and my dad has really bad allergies.  I don't really have allergies, per se, but I just get a lot of sinus infections, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know. [MN]
L:  I find that, um, at a university, like, people living in the residents halls and things that overall sickness of, like, a big population, it gets worse from hot to cold, like, when people -- when it starts to get a little bit cooler here people start to get sick --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's, like, a trend of sickness for a while, for about two weeks, where everybody is sick and coughing, who lives around, um, a lot of other people, and when it gets hot.
R:  Right.  It seems to be that way here too.  Like -- like you said, a lot more in the residence halls because a lot of people, um, just being so close in the -- like, a lot of the dorms here have community bathrooms.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they're even around, you know, other people even more than some other dorms that have private bathrooms and they're really, um -- they influence you to go get flu shots here and stuff like that.  They're real pushy towards that but I've also known people that have gotten flu shots and then they end up getting sick right after that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, my dad was actually -- actually that happened to him th- -- recently he ended up going to get one and then got sick probably two days afterwards.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I think it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just depends on the person. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I've never gotten a flu shot and I've never gotten the flu around flu season.  Maybe --
R:  I --
L:  -- I just have a good immune system.
R:  Yeah.  You prob- [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sounds like it.  I got one my freshman year but I haven't since and I don't really get the flu I -- it's just sinus stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, but, you know, that can be, for me, just as bad because, like, I end up not feeling like doing anything and have headaches and such, so -- but I think it's just all a lot of the weather so it gets really, really cold here.  It's real windy and -- I don't know if you've ever been out this way?
L:  No, I haven't.  I've never been to Chicago or Illinois for that matter.
R:  Yeah. It's -- Champaign's about two hours south of Chicago so -- and then my home town is about three hours south of here which the humidity level down at home is always like a lot higher than it is even here.  It's kinda weird how that works out but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you go to University of Arizona then?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's cool.  It's kinda -- actually I'm in the process of applying in grad schools and that was one of the areas I was looking at and it'd be a big change, you know, in terms of weather and everything so --
L:  Yeah. It really would. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Is that all we're supposed to talk about?
R:  I think so. I don't know what else we can talk about in terms of sickness [MN].  Um, I think we're pretty much in agreement on it and I don't know what else we're supposed to do.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what shall we do?
L:  Um.
R:  Just stay here or [MN]?
L:  I guess we just hang up.
R:  Okay.  All right.
L:  It was nice talking to you.
R:  You to. [MN]
L:  Bye.
R:  Bye.
