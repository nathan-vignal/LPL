L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Ann.
R:  Hi, Ann.  I'm Aurelia.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Oh, I'm doing pretty good.
L:  Um, I don't care if the thing said, um, to start talking about illness right away.  How did you find out about the linguistics thing?
R:  Uh, I, uh, found out about it through, uh, foreign language teach.
L:  Oh, so what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in, uh, Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in -- I'm in, uh, Massachussetts.  I live in North Hampton, Massachussetts.  Um, I actually have a cold right now.
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, what do you think about that statement?  Do you think --
L:  Goodness -- goodness me [LAUGH] um, I've had it.  Um, I'm feeling better.  Um, I think that I'd never heard that expression, "A cold last seven days".
R:  [MN]
L:  Had you heard that expression?
R:  Uh, yeah. [MN]
L:  Oh, really.  I -- I -- that was the first time I ever heard it [MN].  Um, um, but, uh, is everybody sick out in Michigan?
R:  I hope not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No.  Everybody here's pretty, uh -- pretty healthy.  Um, so far.  It -- It'll probably turn, uh, in January.  Let's say January February it starts really getting cold.
L:  It's funny 'cause everybody in the office seems to have something and a lot of my friends have something right now, but we've been getting a lot of snow so it's unusual 'cause -- well, not that unusual for New England, but last winter we got nothing, snow wise.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, now everybody seems to have something and it's -- I actually thought I sounded a lot better today but my mom was saying, "Oh, you sound awful and you're --"
R:  No, I can't even tell --
L:  [MN]
R:  If you hadn't have told me you had a cold I wouldn't have known.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  So, you say you're fr- -- you're from Maine?
L:  Um, my mom's up in Maine.  I'm from Massachussetts.
R:  Massachussetts, I'm sorry.  Okay.
L:  And, um, yeah, I'm headed to Jamaica, actually, on Sunday because my boyfriend won an all expense paid trip for two to Jamaica on Jeopardy last year.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, people actually do win these things.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm really going [MN].
R:  Oh, that is really nice.
L:  [MN] Yeah, the timing is really good [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, and I -- and I love Jeopardy.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  Apparently they are not giving away, um, trips any more as prizes.  They're just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- giving away cash.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  No.  Suppose we ought to be back on our topic though [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I know.  Okay.  So, illness, right.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Illness.
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I've heard that growing up, you know, that it doesn't matter that a -- a cold is going to run its course whether you take something or not and personally I think that, um, the medicines that we do take usually just allow you to get rest so that your body can heal itself.  I don't think --
L:  I think that's a pretty -- that's a pretty good point actually.  It's -- it's funny.  I almost declined illness, uh, because my mother's a Christian Scientist but my father's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- an episcopa- was an episcopalian and I'm an episcopalian now so, um, I don't mind taking medicine.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but it's -- it's funny 'cause, for some reason, with this par- particular cold I've been trying to just sort of stick to cough drops as opposed to, you know, hitting it full on with the Nyquil and, um, I've been sleeping pretty well.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, it's just sort of running its course and, um, but I -- maybe that does rel- relate back to that expression where it's like if you go to the doctor or not, [MN] you're just going to have to wait it out.
R:  Have you ever gone to the doctor for a cold?
L:  Um, for a cold, no.  I ha- -- I mean, it seems a little like overkill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, have you?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's why I -- I guess why people don't think that it will do, uh, any good, whereas I think that other types of things like sinus troubles, um, I've let those go and those have just gotten worse.
L:  Oh, and that's pretty serious.  That's -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a whole nother kettle of fish.
R:  Yeah.  Whereas colds they just seem to go away on their own.  Yeah, once -- my first time getting a sinus, uh, infection, I got it in October and I didn't go and I didn't go, and here the season had changed again, um, like, it was in March or April and I really had a hard time.
L:  Now, how did --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know.  I -- how would you -- I've never had one so h- how do you know that you have a sinus infection as opposed to just, you know, a runny nose or something?
R:  Well, you know, that first time I didn't.  I was taking cold medicine for it and it wasn't doing any -- its job, or more than a week had passed [LAUGH] and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I still had it and, um, it -- I just kept getting worse and worse and worse and, um, finally when I did go I had to have, uh some very, very strong antibi- -biotics and it, uh, cleared up my passa- my nasal passages, and they were full.
L:  Wow.
R:  Stuff came out for about a week.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But I had this, you know -- so, that was my first experience with it.  And it -- it was just terrible because --
L:  Are they, like, recurring?  I mean, once you get one do you just keep getting them or ...?
R:  They -- they can.  I did have them, uh, continually, uh, for a while.  In fact my nose would bleed, like, every day, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at the same time, like, eleven o'clock, I would have a nose bleed, you know, somewhere, for about a week in -- in Mar- uh, in the -- in the spring and th- that happened for several years and then finally, uh, because I realized that it wasn't a cold I finally started going to the doctor, like, right away when I, um, knew.
L:  Because you started to recognize after a while, probably, the sign.
R:  Recognize.  And the difference between, I think, uh, like your -- your coughs in regarding sinus infection and a cold, I think with a cold you cough more in your chest area.
L:  Oh.
R:  Whereas with sinus it's -- it's -- it's in the head and you can feel the dripping --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- of the nasal passages in the back of your throat and it tickles your throat and that's what you get a cough from as opposed to something being in your chest or, you know, down in your --
L:  It's funny you should mention that because it's like this cold sort of started out and it was just this dry, annoying cough, and nothing else.  It felt fine, except for this cough, and I swear I'm like, "Is this some kind of a weird post nasal thing?" and so I --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- took Afrin for a little bit and I think that was helping for a while, but [MN] now it's just sort of settled right in the chest, I think it's exactly classic cold that I'm thinking a little sun [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and some fruit juice [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I might be [MN] -- I might be a lot better, but vaporizer helped last night too.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I might try that because they say that, um, sometimes it's just -- it helps to keep it all sort of soft and warm and moist as opposed to this dry winter air which I think makes it worse.
R:  Right.  I had gotten where I was taking a -- I think it was, uh [MN] -- it was a -- [LIPSMACK] some -- some brand but what it did is it -- it was designed -- you know, it was designed to dry you up.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it dried me up too much until it actually produced a dry cough.  I w- --
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  So, I stopped taking that for the sinuses because it was just too dry.
L:  Mm.  That's -- wow, I never would have thought of that.  I just -- I just know that I hate that feeling where it's just tickling the back --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- of your throat and you're just like, uh, it gets very frustrating and, of course, the other thing I'm a little nervous about is, you know, being on the plane because they say that air in the plane is supposed to be recirculating the same air --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that everybody else was breathing and [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, um, it should be a little better.
R:  That's good.
L:  But, so, your -- your weather has not been so far -- you -- you guys get it more in January?
R:  Well, we -- yeah, we have a little bit of snow but January and February are [SIGH] our hardest, uh, months.  Like, right now there's a little -- a little bit of snow in our -- the streets are clear so there's the, uh -- the lawn has snow on it but the streets are clear.
L:  Oh, well, that's not bad.
R:  Yeah.  Come -- come January, February, I mean, everything's going to be snow so [several inaudible words].  We're d- doing pretty -- pretty good so far.
L:  That's -- that's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what do we do next?  Are we --
R:  Well, I guess we keep talking to the phone [LAUGH].
L:  Does it --
R:  Till the --
L:  -- tell us when to stop talking?
R:  Yeah.  I think they'll tell -- tell us when to stop.
L:  Okay.  Well [LIPSMACK] --
R:  But I also wanted to mention to you too about, uh, a- [MN] back to my story about, uh, my -- my history of sinus infections.  Well, last, um, time I got it I took silver so I'm into minerals.  I -- I didn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- use medicines, but I also believe in, uh, helping the body heal itself and I took the silver and just breathed some in my nostrils.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And I -- I didn't get it at all this year.  It cleared up then.  That was the earlier part of, uh, this year and then I didn't get it at all.
L:  That's fascinating.
R:  It is.
L:  So, how do you -- where do you find that?
R:  There's, uh, this company that is called Eniva, if you wanna look on the, uh --
L:  How do you spell it?  A.N.E.V.A.?
R:  It's E.N.I.V.A.  Eniva dot com.  And they should have some.
L:  That sounds really interesting.  How did they find out about that?
R:  You know, I have a -- a friend that actually h- -- that got me hooked on some other stuff and th- they have a lot of different minerals, single minerals, um, and the difference is -- is they're clear so it looks like water.  When you're looking at the bottle you're, like, "This is water" and I was really sceptical [LAUGH] at first.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But when you taste it, oh, you're like, "Oh, this is a mineral [LAUGH] because it --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- tastes nasty". [LAUGH] And they all have their different tastes, you know, and the -- the silver -- silver is horrible.  I can see how it would [LAUGH] clear whatever ails you.
L:  Do something up there that -- wow.  That's --
R:  And I take the --
L:  -- really interesting.
R:  -- uh, gold which helps me to sleep a- and, uh, calcium and magnesium.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because a lot of the vitamins that you take, um, you know, they -- they are not absorbed by the -- the body.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You only absorb about ten percent of it because they're just -- they're in such a hard form.
L:  Yes.  Oh, sure.  I've heard that they're really not that good f- -- I mean, they don't do as much as they pretend that they do.
R:  No.  They j- -- they really come back out.  That's -- that's [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it seems sort of, yeah, I was talking them for a little while and sometimes when I'm ill I'll take some but it doesn't seem like they do that much for you.
R:  Mm.
L:  A healthy diet's important but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- so, wow.  I know there's a guy at work who does the whole, um, copper and mag- magnetic sort of therapy.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, I think he wears a lot of those magnets on -- on his arms and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my boyfriend has, like, a problem with his knee occasionally and he used t- [LAUGH] -- he was icing his knee [MN] all the time and he had, like, frozen -- not frozen peas.  He started with the frozen peas but he found that he liked the brown sugar, to keep it in the freezer, and he put that on his knee and I'm like "This is getting ridiculous".
R:  Brown sugar?
L:  Well, because [LIPSMACK] he could just keep reusing it and he's like a very parsimonious sort of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, individual, and I couldn't take it any more so I used, um, the Discover Card and they give you cash back and you can get double plus bonus points if you shop at certain ve- vendors and so shop --
