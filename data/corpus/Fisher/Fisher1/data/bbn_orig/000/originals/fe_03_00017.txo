R:  Hi, I'm Matt.
L:  Hi, I'm Maria.
R:  Hi, Maria.
L:  So, uh, a- are you, uh, where is -- where there's snow because it's really heavy snow around here?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Lots of snow is falling.
L:  So, not good for health.  [LAUGH] I try not to go out too much.
R:  No, yeah.  I'm not used to snow, although it's really pretty to look at.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's very pretty.  Do you, um --
R:  So, this -- this topic, it's, uh, illness, colds.  What was, uh -- did you understand it?
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think we're supposed to talk about what we do to keep out, um, you know, if -- you know, seasonally there's supposed to be more illness, I guess.  If there's a cold or allergies or whatever, and whatever we're supposed to do to stay out of it and, you know, what we think about it and the doctors and et cetera, et cetera [MN].
R:  Oh, okay.  Hm.
L:  That's why I mentioned snow [LAUGH].  I'm trying to stay with the topic.  Um, so, uh, actually I was going to, um, get a flu shot this season.  It would be my first.  I haven't actually never done this before but I know a lot of people do.  Do you ever do it?
R:  Actually, I think that -- that, uh, every -- every time I've known someone who got a flu shot -- or actually, no, I can't say everybody.  My grandma, every year the doctor would tell her to get a flu shot because she's elderly and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she would always obey the doctor and go and get it and then immediately afterwards she would get really sick --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and I've never seen the flu shot really have any effect.  I mean, she comes down with the flu anyways every season and usually it's pretty bad.  I mean, she's down for a couple of weeks so, uh --
L:  Is that after the shot or -- or, uh, you know, some time after the shot because the way the shot's supposed to work, I think, is -- isn't it?  And then you're supposed to get a little -- probably a little cold after the -- after the shot itself.
R:  No.  It's not -- it's not immediately after.  It's like a couple of weeks after or ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, maybe, you know, that's not exactly a scientific experiment.  I mean, you know, maybe she gets less sick than she would if she didn't get the shot [MN].
R:  It's possible but given that kind of track record especially knowing what the flu is.  It's a rapidly mutating virus.  How can they -- how can they prepare a vaccine for that?
L:  That's true.  [SIGH] I don't know.  I'm just a little bit paranoid this -- this, uh, winter.  Just want to make sure that I --
R:  Did they say that the flu is going to be real bad?
L:  I don't know, actually.  I haven't heard but my husband and I are trying to have a child so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's not a good time -- not a good time to get it -- you know, to get a flu so [SIGH] just want to make sure, you know, I'm all prepared and everything.  But actually, generally -- I -- I do generally get some sort of a cold every winter.  I think, um, I actually had pneumonia when I was really li- um, I think, uh, nine or so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was -- it lasted for six months so it was --
R:  Ew.
L:  -- pre- pretty bad.  Well, this was in the Soviet Union and it was misdiagnosed as bronchitis and so it wasn't treated properly and, you know, et cetera, et cetera [MN] so, um, I've been sort of getting sick every winter since then.  So, maybe that's -- I don't know if that's really it or not [MN].
R:  What do you do when you get sick?  Just rest --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it off or ...?
L:  -- I used -- I used to just not really do much.  I'm -- I'm not much a believer in -- in medi- in medicine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I guess that comes from, you know, from where I'm from.  You -- you don't usually take a lot of drugs like [MN] American's do [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, my first -- my first instinct is not to take something so I usually just, you know, drink warm, you know, tea or milk and, uh, sleep and, you know, but, uh, since I married my husband he kinda introduced Nyquil into our lives so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I sort of g- -- I've been going that route because, you know, as you get older you don't wanna be sick because -- not because of the health.  I mean, that too but you don't wanna -- you know, when you're a child you wanna miss school so, you -- you know, you don't want to get treated but when you're adults you don't want to miss work and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the other engagements so you're more pressured to get healthy more quickly [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Do you do anything?
R:  I usually take something to control the symptoms.  Uh, and otherwise I just sleep and drink lots of fluids.  I don't like to go to the doctor unless I begin to suspect that it's -- it's, uh --
L:  Something more serious.
R:  -- a pretty serious infection.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  Since I guess that I had -- I had pneumonia so I think I have a pretty good handle on what, you know, its pretty serious symptom -- symptoms mean, so if I don't get them, which usually I don't, I don't go to the doctor either.  It's like the same thing with the -- with medicine, I don't go to the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think of the doctor as something that -- you know, that's like for emergencies and, you know, for unbearable pain and that sort of thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, it has to be -- for me, it has to be a sore throat accompanied by fever and nausea that goes over about four days or an extremely sore throat that goes over two --
L:  I don't -- 
R:  -- before I'll worry about it.
L:  Actually I don't -- I don't think I usually think of sore throat as like a serious -- unless I can feel it's in my -- you know, in my chest because I know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that that just means that it's pretty serious.  It's like, you know, this is what the doctor listens to when you go to the doctor.  He listens if you have any, you know, serious, um, I don't know what the word is.  Like, uh, sounds in -- in your chest because that means there's something --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- more wrong.  But, you know, if I don't hear it myself, it's usually -- if you take a really deep breath, y- you know, if it hurts --
R:  You can tell.
L:  -- then -- yeah.  Otherwise I just drink --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, tea and -- and milk with butter, which I absolutely hate, and it's like -- for me it's -- it's a symptom -- you know, it's something that's associated with a cold so I -- I hate it which is, by the way, I -- why I hate popcorn because it has exactly the same smell [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- you know, like I said I had pneumonia for six months.  You can imagine how much, you know, warm fluid I had to consume and -- and milk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with butter is just not [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I really hate it [LAUGH].  The same goes, by the way, for tea with, uh -- with, uh, raspberry which was also --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- like a Russian remedy.
R:  Tea with --
L:  So --
R:  -- raspberry.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Here, it's chicken soup.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everyone always has chicken soup whenever --
L:  Yeah.  That too.
R:  -- they get sick.
L:  I -- I wasn't surprised with that.  It sort of seems to be an international kind of, uh, cure.
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] It's, like, kind of always interesting to observe the, you know, the home remedies of different countries and see if they're similar or, you know, the ways in which they're different and ...
R:  Yeah.  Now, peppermint tea I can imagine.
L:  Which tea?
R:  Peppermint tea.
L:  Peppermint tea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think I've ever tried that.  That's -- is -- yeah.  I don't know.  I -- I wonder if we're tal- -- supposed to talk just about the colds or about other seasonal, you know, stuff like -- I don't know.  Al- allergies, I guess, would be the -- the, you know, seasonal stuff.  I've never had them so I -- I never -- I never give it much thought [LAUGH].  It's just how when I see all those incessant advertisements on the TV that there seems to be, I guess, a lot of people who are affected by it, judging by the a- --
R:  Yeah.  Hay fever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hay fever bothers a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.  Do y- -- do you suffer?
R:  It's usually only twice a year.  Yeah.  I do.  I've had that since I was a kid.
L:  Yeah.  See, like, I --
R:  Usually --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Usually you can just -- I can -- when I was a kid I worried about controlling it more because I really hated it but then I got older and I just kind of ignore it now.  Occasionally --
L:  Is it like a cold?
R:  -- I'll take Benadryl.  It becomes kind of like a cold except you don't have a fever.  You just -- itchy --
L:  You sneeze and, yeah.
R:  -- watery eyes, sneezing, sometimes coughing, a lot of mucus in the throat.  Uh, it's a pain.  It's mostly just a nuisance.
L:  Yeah.  Actually I, yeah, I hate that.  That's -- I don't know.  That's truly awful.  Like, you feel really powerless because there's nothing that really treats that [LAUGH].  It's like the --
R:  Mostly you just drink a lot.  That's about the only thing I've seen.  Because, uh --
L:  I mean, do y- --
R:  -- Benadryl and the like -- uh, Benadryl will knock you out.  Um, most of the decongestants make me grumpy, uh, so sometimes the medicine is worse than just taking it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- living with it.
L:  Yeah.  I used to take, uh, some sort of, uh, antihistamine for my cold and I only -- I -- I noticed that I only could take it i- -- uh, at night because otherwise I wouldn't be able to do anything.  I'd be like a zombie.  Do you take the, uh, like, brand stuff or do you -- do you not care, [MN] in terms of medicine?
R:  I guess mostly brand stuff but it's not because I care it's just because I go into the store and I recognize the names and so I pick it up, I guess.  It's ...
L:  My father, he's, uh -- he's actually not a doctor but he worked in -- at a medical institute in [inaudible].  He was always interested in, you know, like home medicines.  He was sort of our family first, uh, um, you know, defense [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh -- and he, uh, kind of told us what medicine to buy when -- when my brother and I left home and I kind of stuck with them [LAUGH] and they're usually like non brand stuff because, you know, as long as you know what the ingredients are, because, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  If you c- -- if you look you can see most of them have exactly the same ingredients.  Just maybe like the strengths may be different.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, yeah.  I don't know.  It's kinda funny that -- about the cold that, uh, it's been around for so many years and, I mean, centuries, I should say.  Still not much progress, you know [LAUGH].  Made into -- you know, it's even made into the proverb, you know, cure for a common cold and [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, people have been wrestling with it for a long time, I guess.
L:  Hm.  So, I wonder how long we're supposed to stay on this topic since, uh, I think --
R:  I think it was --
L:  -- we've covered almost everything.
R:  -- ten minutes or is it sup- -- does it automatically shut off after a certain amount --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- of time or --
L:  I don't know if -- if we're supposed to finish it or does it -- this is the first time I'm doing this.
R:  Huh.
L:  Is it for you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So [LAUGH] we both don't know how this is supposed to end.  Mm [LAUGH].  Let's see.
R:  Well, how long have we been talking because it said ten minutes?  I thought that it would shut down after ten minutes, but ...
L:  Um, I -- it's been close to -- close to ten minutes because I picked up the phone around five.  I don't think it's been ten minutes completely [LAUGH] which reminds me I don't know if you watch, uh, Friends but, uh, there was an episode -- you know Friends, the show, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Uh, there was a new episode yesterday in, uh, um -- I don't know if you know the characters, but, you know, Ross met another guy, who was a boyfriend of his friend, for a beer and they had absolutely nothing to talk about and they just stand, you know, like, half an hour just, uh, you know, in ten minutes you're sort of staring into the ceiling and -- and trying to find a topic to talk about [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  Did y- -- did you look at the list of the topics for this, uh ...?
R:  Yeah.  There was illness, food, uh -- oh, what else was there?  I forget what they were, actually.  They've got it on the website.
L:  Yeah.  I couldn't -- for some -- I misplaced the link.  Um, do you think we should try to stick with the topic for the next three minutes and see if, you know, if this doesn't go off by itself then we can just --
R:  Then I guess hang up.
L:  Yeah.  Just hang up.  All right.  What else haven't we covered [LAUGH]?
R:  Gargling with salt water, that works.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Actually, no, that's funny.  I was going to mention that.  But we don't do it with, uh, salt water.  We do it with baking soda.
R:  Oh, I've not --
L:  I wonder --
R:  -- tried that.
L:  I wonder if -- if -- if it was just the, uh, like, the abrasive, um, uh, powder that -- that works or ...?  Because both of -- you know, both salt and -- and, uh, baking soda are a bit abrasive.  I don't know if that's the reason for why both of them seem to work because, yeah, baking soda works for me.  I've never tried it with salt.
R:  Yeah.
