L:  Hi.  My name is Judy.
R:  Um, I'm Amy.
L:  So, I guess our topic is illness then?  Uh --
R:  Um, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't really get sick.  I guess I'm pretty lucky.  I have only needed to see the doctor once this year and that was in April.
R:  Yeah.  That's me too.  I usually -- it'll just be a cold or something small.  I don't get sick too easily.  My, um -- I think a cold usually does last around seven days. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Like the thing said.
L:  Yeah.  I don't remember when the last time it was I had a cold.  I -- earlier this year I had food poisoning --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and, uh -- well, it was my fault because I -- I undercooked some eggs and I knew that I probably shouldn't eat them but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I did anyway.  And I paid for it the next day. [MN]
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I d- -- I've never had food poisoning but [MN] I know it can be pretty -- pretty bad.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  And people at work are coming down with colds too.  I don't think I am although my throat felt a little clogged up today so I was going to have some tea after I've finished eating dinner.
R:  Yes.  My room mate said her throat was starting to hurt a lot yesterday and I told her to have some tea but I don't think she did. [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, for me having tea is more of an excuse to, um, have some honey because I have a sweet tooth.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  And I bought some exotic honey when I was in New York for the holidays, so --
R:  Oh.  That sounds good.
L:  Yeah.  Some buckwheat honey and [inaudible] and some other stuff.  So, I have several jars of honey in my cabinet. [MN]
R:  [MN] I don't usually put honey in my tea but I have tea a lot.  I don't know, I just -- I feel, like, healthier [MN] even though it pro- -- might not make a difference, it still feels like I'm doing something good.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it helps my throat feel better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] But I usually only have +honey -- honey with black tea.  Uh, if I drink Chinese tea I won't put any honey in it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Or herbal tea, I -- I -- I put honey in that too.
R:  I don't think I've ever had herbal tea. [MN]
L:  Well, supposedly some sorts of herbal tea help when you get sick like echina- +echinacea or whatever that's called.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, it's -- it's supposed to prevent colds or something.
R:  Oh.  Hm.  Didn't know that.  I only know --
L:  Because that's what I've read.
R:  I only know, like, green tea.  That's the only, like, healthy tea that I really know of.
L:  And, um, chamomile tea is supposed to help you sleep better and --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  make you calm.
R:  -- have heard about that.
L:  And supposedly mint tea is good for di- digestion, I guess.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] And my friend made [MN] this concoction of ginger and honey and water for me when I got sore throats earlier in the year and I think it helps.  It -- well, I liked the way it tasted but, um, if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you boil some water and grate some ginger and, uh mix it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mix it all up with lots of honey, um, it -- it soothes a sore throat.
R:  Oh.  I didn't know that.  Is that like a home made tea, considered or ...?
L:  Hm?
R:  Is that considered a home made tea or is it just mixing spices?
L:  Um, I don't -- I don't think of it as tea.  It's more like one of those home brewed me- -- remedies or something.
R:  Okay.  Yeah
L:  He said he learned it in Japan though.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's neat.  I like all those sort of non -- I don't know what you call them.  The unconventional medicine ideas.
L:  Oh, the alternative medicines?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's interesting.
L:  Um, some of my friends have gone to, uh, Chinese herbalists recently.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  Well, like, the last year or so.  I don't think they've gone this year.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  A friend of mine had this chronic hacking cough for several months last year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No.  Maybe it was two years ago and, uh, he went to a western doctor and the doctor just couldn't figure out what on earth was going on.  Like, he thought it might be bronchitis but does bronchitis last that long?  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- his mother dragged him to this Chinese herbalist in New York.  I don't know if that helped though.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  I think it's -- he -- I think he had that cough because he was in his senior year of college and he was really stressed out about it.
R:  Yeah.  That was my boyfriend last year.  He had a cough that lasted for a good couple of months at the end of the semester.  It was probably stress related too.
L:  [MN]
R:  But the doctor said he -- they didn't think that he had bronchitis.
L:  Hm.
R:  But ...
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Stress definitely affects how you, [MN] um -- how well you fight off disease [MN].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Two years ago when I was still in college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I [MN] decided to finish getting my hepatitis B vaccinations because I was vaccinated, um, in nineteen ninety six just before I went off to college but for some reason I didn't get all three shots as I should have --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, uh, a few years later I decided, "Oh,  I'll just finish it" so I got two more shots and after the second shot, um, one weekend I developed this rash and I think I developed the rash not because of the shot, as the college infirmary thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but because that was a really stressful weekend.  I had a lot of stuff due, uh, on that Monday and I had a concert to perf- perform in on Sunday night and all this other stuff and this rash broke out on my shoulders.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But once I got everything done, it miraculously subsided. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Of course, when everything's done, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all right. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think it had anything to do with the -- the shot at all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But the infirmary refused to give me any more shots because they thought that it caused my rash so ...
R:  What is hepatitis, actually?  Do you know?
L:  Um, it's this disease that affects the liver.  It -- I think there are three forms that are currently recognized.  The hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, hepatitis B is spread through, um, contact with blo- with body fluids like blood, and, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- sexual fluids.  So, um [COUGH] -- so, I think it's recommended that everyone get a hepatitis B shot if they can, even children.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because if you get the vaccine then y- you won't get hepatitis B.
R:  Oh, it only blocks that one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Hepatitis A isn't that serious, I think.  I'm not sure.  I don't really know much about hepatitis but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I do know that hepatitis B is considered -- hepatitis B is considered a serious public health threat in the US because --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Because it's -- it's preventable but it's -- it spreads so rapidly because people don't take care of themselves during sex and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and no one gets the vaccines too.  Um, hepatitis A, I think, is spread through fecal matter, but I'm not sure.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  And C, I don't really know much about but C is very deadly.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  But I'm not sure how that spreads though.
R:  Mm.  I'm impressed you know that much. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I like to read about things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Like my -- I work at a p- -- [MN] I work in a place where I have to sit in front of the computer all day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I read stuff while I wait for, uh, web pages to download.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah.  So, you don't feel sick these days, do you?
R:  No.  I don't -- I had -- I usually only have a cold.  Every once in a while I get a cold but I think I've only had the flu, like, twice in my life.  I -- I, like, never get the -- my stomach never gets upset or anything.  Um, I can't think of any major illnesses that I had.  My dad just had to go to the hospital a few weeks ago.  He had some sort of pain in his stomach.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he thought it was, um, his appendix burst.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they went and they never found out what it was so they're still trying to do tests and stuff and he says he can't sleep on his back or his one side and, I don't know, it's kind of scare but ...
L:  Hm.  Oh, the flu, that reminds me, last month, I got a flu shot and I told one of my friends at my work place and he didn't want to get the flu vaccine because he's, uh -- he has this needle phobia or something.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  And, I don't know, I just thought it was a little silly [MN] not to get the shot just because he was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- afraid of needles because, I mean, the company was paying for it and, um, it's better not to have the flu if you can avoid it, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  My mom this year at her work they always give it for free and she used to never get it and then two years in a row she got the shot and just happened to be those two years was when she got the flu too and she, like, usually never gets the flu so now she's totally against the flu shots and [MN].  So, I don't know if it was just bad luck or what but --
L:  Yeah.  Maybe so.
R:  Or maybe her body couldn't fight off the little bit they -- whatever they put into you, I don't know.
L:  Were they the same strains that she was vaccinated against?
R:  Um, I -- probably -- I wouldn't -- don't know.  I have no idea.
L:  There's lots of flu varieties floating around.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I should get a flu shot this year and I'm in college still so a lot more prone to getting sick, I think, here with all the people that you can come in contact with.
L:  Yeah.  And all the stress.
R:  Yeah.  That too.  Mm.
L:  Uh, I -- sometimes I miss college.  It -- it's different.  I miss the social atmosphere.
R:  yeah.  I know.  I'm dreading having to have, like, a real nine to five job. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, having a real job is different.  It's not easier or harder.  It's just different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Different problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I like not having to do homework.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I miss being able to just chat with people randomly and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- 
R:  Like, always having someone there.
L:  Yeah.  And also, uh, college students feel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- it's like college students feel like it's appropriate to invite people to come over to the dorm rooms any time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and in the real world you have to, like, invite people in advance and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- make sure that no one's busy and it's just --
R:  This year I'm in a --
L:  -- a hassle.
R:  -- an apartment and it's a lot less, um, social than the dorms were.  I kind of miss the dorms but --
