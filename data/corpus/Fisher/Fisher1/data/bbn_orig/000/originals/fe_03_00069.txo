L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Holly.
R:  My name is Melanie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Nice to meet you. [MN]
L:  [MN] You too.  Where -- where are you?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, very good.  I finally got somebody from out of state. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, where are you?
L:  Yeah.  I'm in Arizona.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well, I spoke to someone from Arizona last time too.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, how did you find out about this, um, survey test thing?
L:  Well, I -- from a foreign language teacher list serve that I'm on.
R:  Oh.  I got it from the linguistics, um -- from Georgetown's, uh, serving thing.
L:  Oh, did you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, funny 'cause I -- I passed it on to an old professor of mine and the girl I got matched with last time was her student. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] It's a small world. [MN]
L:  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- okay, that was a really long question. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Okay.  So, which one did we think is the worst habit of all of those not -- okay, it was drinking, smoking, eating excessively, not exercising -- I don't remember -- gossiping.
L:  Oh, right.  That was the first one.
R:  Too much caffeine.  I think [LAUGH] I feel -- I feel like I've had some but I don't have any caffeine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- I think smoking is the worst of all these ones that I can remember. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  That was one of 'em.  Okay.  Let -- go -- go over these again for me.  Let's see.
R:  Okay.
L:  I know the gossiping.
R:  I remember there was gossiping, um, drinking, smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, the -- in -- uh, too much caffeine.
L:  Right.
R:  Not exercising.
L:  That's right.
R:  I think overeating was maybe one of them too.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  I'm not even reme- -- I may be making this up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well.
R:  I remember what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  As I was listening to it I remembered smoking was gonna be my answer but -- and gossiping is not since I like to [MN] do that myself.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  Well, see, as soon as I heard gossiping, I -- you know, that was the first one and I though, "Ooh, that's really bad" you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and, you know, things like drinking and all that stuff, and those are personal choices but gossiping --
R:  Gossiping.
L:  -- hurts o- --
R:  -- I guess negatively --
L:  -- other people.
R:  Yes.  It --
L: [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- especially if they find out about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, okay, so, your answer is gossiping because it will hurt other people's feelings.
L:  Well, yeah, but, then again, now the smoking --
R:  Y- smoking --
L:  Um --
R:  -- causes cancer.  Gossiping doesn't cause [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true.  You know, I think --
R:  I guess you could die of mouth cancer. [LAUGH]
L:  I think I'd have to agree with you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because smoking -- smoking damages other people through secondhand smoke.
R:  Yeah.  Secondhand smoke.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, let's see --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, well, it costs a lot of money too.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Well, it --
L:  You know, it costs --
R:  [LAUGH] Gossiping could cost, like, us friends if you c- [LAUGH] -- if you have to keep replacing them. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  But then, yeah, you have to consider the, uh, public health hazards and, uh, things like that.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  N- -- oh, gosh.
R:  And I guess, like, pollution but I -- I'm trying to think and I guess overeating, well, let's see.  Caffeine, my mom -- my parents both drink caffeine and I'm only, like, five feet tall so I think it may have stunted my growth. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Because my mom drank coffee when I was -- when she was pregnant with me.  Maybe -- maybe caffeine is bad but, um [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know if that --
L:  No.  No.  
R:  -- might be a rumor.
L:  Oh.  I don't --
R:  That's not the worst thing. [MN]
L:  I don't think so.  I mean, my mother smoked the entire time she was pregnant with me so --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, and, um, she thinks I'm overly sensitive to tobacco smoke.
R:  Oh.
L:  She -- she's a radical smoker.  She's in her eighties.  She lives in Connecticut.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's where I grew up and, uh, yeah, she, uh -- she's gotten a little bit better.  I mean, because the world has changed so much but, you know, when -- when they were banning smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot, um, she just, uh -- oh, she couldn't stand to ride in an aeroplane, you know [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I guess, they could -- it could damage your whole [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, way of life if you can't, like, adjust to not being able to either smoke or not be able to, like, be next to a smoker or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do they have, um, like, a smoking -- well, I'm sorry if I'm, like, losing it today. [MN] I was, like, probably going round saying stuff.  My answer or -- doesn't make any sense.
L:  Oh, that's fine.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, um, yeah, no.  I -- I think, um -- I -- I don't even know what I'm saying about.  That, like, I guess, being addicted to smoking could -- I don't know, I guess if you -- if you can't be in like a -- if you can't like eat in your favorite restaurant because they banned smoking and now you can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, stand to be without it for to long a period of time.  I know, I was going to ask you do they ban smoking from restaurants by you or is that California or ...?
L:  Well, you know, it's -- I'm trying to think if it's -- it's not an Arizona State law.  I don't think it goes by state law.  I think it goes by locality.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, but, yeah, I live in Flagstaff and it's a town of about fifty five thousand way up in the mountains.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And we [LAUGH] --
R:  Huh.
L:  It's a very bizarre place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but y- --
R:  How's the air?  Is it a different, like -- is it -- if you go up in the mountains, like, some people have trouble breathing or something.
L:  Well, I'm from the East Coast.  I grew up in Connecticut.  Yeah.  And --
R:  You don't sound very West Coast so I couldn't exactly place your accent.  I wasn't listening at -- as intently as my usual [MN] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some -- I like accents but yeah you sound kind of East Coast in your --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I definitely act like it when -- I mean, Californians are very strange people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They're very laid back.  It makes me more uptight when I see there's somebody from California. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, I know.  Yeah.  Now, are you -- are you a linguistics person too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Have you ever read De- Deborah Tannin's book, um, oh, the one where she recorded, um, the four hour Thanksgiving conversation?
R:  I -- actually, I didn't read the book but I've seen her present because she was, uh, she's a professor at Georgetown.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, I kind of  -- I kind of know her even though I don't, um, -- I'm -- I'm not in the socio linguistics department as she -- you know, I -- I was doing the computational type --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I like to annoy her because I feel like because I'm from New York and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, she has this whole, like, New York Jewish thing going on so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I always, like, go over to her and annoy her for no apparent reason.  Everyone's very respectful of her except for me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, she knows -- [MN] I feel like we're old buddies now even though like [LAUGH] I'm just a g -- person who feels like, you know, I don't -- I don't have to be like reverent and, you know, like, people are very, like, you know, subservient to her and I think it gets on her nerves because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, she's a person like everybody else, you know.  So, um, yeah.  I -- I, uh, I know what you're talking about though.  Her an- analysis of the conversation with the New Yorkers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they just dominate like the whole entire, like, Thanksgiving dinner or something.
L:  Right.  And -- and they feel like they're bonding very nicely with the other New Yorkers but the Californians --
R:  Are withdrawn.
L:  -- feel like they're being attacked.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I was just explaining that to a friend of mine last night because I actually had it happen here in Arizona where, um, see -- now, are you at Georgetown now or ...?
R:  I, um, graduated last year but I'm still on their, um, email list.
L:  Okay.  'Cause I got my bachelors there a long time ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh --
R:  In linguistics also or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Linguistics and Spanish.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I do linguistics and Spanish, also undergra- -- I did a double major undergrad and then I stayed a fifth year for the masters in computational.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, yeah, I did linguistics and Spanish [MN] so probably --
L:  Oh, well [MN] --
R:  -- met some of the same teaching professors.
L:  Wow.  Well, when I -- I took a course in computational linguistics.  Now, I graduated in seventy nine.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, it was practically punch cards. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, did you know Cathy Taylor or Cathy Ball?
L:  I don't really know a lot of people I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- went to school with, yeah.
R:  No.  I think -- I think -- I don't know if they were students or if they were like doing PhDs but I remember them talking about, um, they were doing some kind of Russian translation --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The --
R:  -- thing.
L:  The professor I had, yeah, his big famous contribution was this machine translation of Russian.
R:  I definitely heard of that. [LAUGH] It sounds like -- and they said, like, the way they used to do it was on, like, the punch cards, I guess, and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Before there --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- were, like, computers. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I though I was old because I -- I know what Atari is but [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  I guess n- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I met this woman when I -- I came here [MN] to get my second masters degree actually, and I met this woman and, um -- and we start talking and we had all these things in common, you know.  We had kids the same age and she was interested in linguistics and I was, you know, I was going, "Oh, this is really great" and I'm -- I'm thinking, "Oh, gosh, we could be friends and everything".  She didn't talk to me for a year after that.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And she asked -- we were all living on campus in family housing.  She -- she finally asked a friend of mine -- a good friend of mine -- you know, "Is -- is Holly always that aggressive?" you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And -- and I -- and it was so funny 'cause I said, "This is perfect.  Deborah Tannin would love this" because here --
R:  Aggressive.  Yeah.
L:  -- I was thinking we were really bonding.  We had so much in common and she felt attacked.  She felt like I was jumping down her throat.
R:  That's so funny. [LAUGH]
L:  And she has never really --
R:  Maybe that's why they -- they -- they put our phones together.  They, like, found the people from the East Coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, "Yeah, let them kill each other". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's so funny.  Like, if you -- you know, I know, um, I roomed with a girl from Oregon, or, as she says, Oregon.
L:  Right.
R:  And she -- I -- I've been talking and she'll go, like, "Shh" like, to -- for me to lower my voice.  I'm like, "What, I'm the only one --".  You know, we were rooming and I knew we were the only ones home.  I'm like, "Who are we waking up? There's no one in the house"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's like, "Lower your voice".  I'm like, you know, I happen to have sensitive hear- -- like, sensitive ears so if I was that loud I know I'd be hurting my own ears.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it wasn't like, you know, the pain threshold or anything like that but, um --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- she would just always shush me and I thought it was the rudest thing I've ever heard like who would shush -- you know, like, the last time I was shushed was in, like, the first grade when I talked too much in art classes, like, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, a friend to shush me because, like, you know, lower -- doing like the hand signal, like, you know, "Lower your voice" I'm like, "Oh, that is so obnoxious". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I guess to her, like, I was, you know, completely offensive to the ears.
L:  Well, that's really interesting.  Yeah.  I -- I have a good friend, um, I went -- I actually went to the University of Connecticut for two years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And I met, um, a friend there who's still a real good friend and -- and she's, like -- her parents are, like, your loud New York Jewish people but she grew up in Connecticut and it's very bizarre.  She was interesting to me.  Actually she was the first person I knew who ever majored in linguistics.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, she was rather an inspiration.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, she has a very strong New York accent and her younger sisters don't at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, but, yeah, when we would get on the phone when -- when I was at Georgetown and my room mates would -- you know, like, I would get louder because she would be loud and -- and I would be practically yelling. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my god.  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and on the phone my friends, like, would always say my accent got worse or something, you know, and like -- I don't know, to me I -- I don't think I -- you know, change around but I guess in class I'd try to kind of curb the, you know -- like, the -- my first day of Georgetown, um -- it was actually my second -- uh, first class of my second semester, I was in an English class and they made us -- I hate reading, like, plays because I don't like to get into them like some of the people in class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they had to read this -- this Shakespearean play line and it was some -- it quotes somebody -- sounded like an incredulous dog and I said the word dog and half the class just started, like, laughing themselves to death and they're like, "Say it again.  Coffee pot, dog"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they would like all -- and I'm like, "No".  This is a great way to, like, disrupt the entire class.  I'll just -- just ra- -- whenever I know now the answer I'll just, you know, make sure I say a word with the "or" sound --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they'll all just be like complete anarchy.
L:  Well, that -- that's one of the few things I say that I think makes me sound like that that I say, "Coffee".
R:  Yeah.  It sounds nice.
L:  Yeah.  And I guess I say, "Dog" and, uh, I mean, very few other words.  I mean, I grew up in Fairfield which was, you know, I mean close enough to the city and my parents were both from the city and, um, but that's the only thing I bring with me but you really notice it out here.  Um, like, I work with several people.  I ha- --
