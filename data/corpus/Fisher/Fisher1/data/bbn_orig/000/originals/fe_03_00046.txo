R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, my name is Brooke.
L:  Hi, Brooke, I'm Kristin.
R:  Hi. [NOISE]
L:  So, uh, we're supposed to talk about illness, huh?
R:  Apparently. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, uh, do you struggle with the winters?
R:  Um, I haven't in the past couple of years actually.  How about you?
L:  Um, I always go through a period where I feel like a bear because, uh, from, like, a lot of it -- well, basically from when the time zone, you know, changes when we have the fall back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I always, uh, go through a period of about a month where I have to -- I have a really hard time adjusting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I find that I sleep a lot more than I otherwise normally do because I guess it's getting dark earlier.  It sends a signal to me that, you know, I should be sleeping.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, yeah.  It's really hard to deal with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm always, uh [MN] -- I'm always very opposed to getting the flu shot for some reason because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, I never tend to get the flu [MN] and I always feel like it's something I should do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But at the same time why waste a couple of days of +discomfort if I'm not going to get the flu anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Well, uh, it's a terrible thing too because, uh -- well, I don't know.  I don't like getting the flu shot either.  I just don't like shots.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, and I'm just one of these people who are of the mindset that, you know, if you're going to get sick you might as well get it and ride it out.  Kind of a more ma- natural thing than immunizations, I suppose --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a roundabout way.  But, um, my company where I work, they give free fl- flu shots. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, if you don't go for a flu shot and then you get the flu, and this has happened in real life, my --
R:  You don't get time off or ...?
L:  Well, no, we do but my boss laid a guilt trip on me.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, if you had a flu shot this might not have ever happened. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just kinda like, "Well, gee, I'm sorry but I think it's my choice how I choose to do my body" but --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, yeah, so, it's a strange thing so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but I'm with you on that one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] No.  I --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- also have kids so, uh, it's -- it's also one of those deals where, uh, they always bring something home so, in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my mind, I'm getting the best immunization possible because [MN] I'm being exposed to everything under the sun.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I used to get sick when I was much younger.  I would get sick even two or three times in a given winter, but in -- actually just in the last couple of years I seem to have grown out of it, which is nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  And --
L:  Getting sick is no fun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Seems to always be harder on you when you're older too, doesn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I guess just, you know, we're older and our bodies aren't quite what they used to be so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the aches and pains are, you know, on top of pre existing aches and pains --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and all that kind of stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My daughter, as a matter of fact, just, uh -- and this is really crazy, she, uh, just got over chicken pox this past fall.
R:  Oh.  Horrible.
L:  So, talk about, uh, childhood diseases.  It was one of those --
R:  How old is she?
L:  She's, uh, seven.  She'll actually be eight in about a week.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, uh, it was one of those funny things where her pediatrician and I were talking about it and I'm like, "Now, how did this get passed us" and he's like, "You know" he says, "I think I do know" and we kinda went through what had happened.  You know, we had one of those, when she goes in the kindergarten, had the whole gammit of immunizations she had to do and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it was one of those deals where he said, "Oh, you know, you could get the, uh -- the pox vaccinations but she's had so many we probably shouldn't do it now.  Why don't we wait and --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, come back in, you know, six months or whatever when she has to come in for another routine check" and of course that never hap- --"
R:  And [MN] --
L:  I mean, like I said, my kids are constantly exposed to something so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're always in there for earaches, you know, something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, so we never did have that routine check and then next thing we know she's got -- she's got chicken pox so ...
R:  Chicken pox, I definitely consider to be the worst illness I've ever had because I got it when I was thirteen.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  With those -- pretty -- I mean, I had it at the same time as my brother, who was fifteen at the time, so he was even worse off than me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I was running like a hundred and three degrees fever for many, many days and --
L:  Ew.
R:  -- just -- yeah.  I was just -- I was completely covered.  It was a very, very horrible experience. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  We both got it from my younger sister who was -- let's see.  If I was thirteen then she was, uh, seven at the time so, you know, it's a normal age for chicken pox but [LAUGH] --
L:  Dour.  Oh, yeah, and th- then you get the whole thing, you know, "Don't itch or it gets a scar" and all that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And I definitely scarred. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, my daughter, I -- I don't know, I -- maybe this is normal but she even had 'em, like, in her scalp.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I had a lot --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- in my scalp.  Yeah.  They were cut like -- I would just run my hands through my hair and they're -- following weeks even and I would still be, you know, pulling them out.
L:  Oof.
R:  It was really gross. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, it's just k- -- it's an awful disease to have in -- in general, you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  What's even worse is the way people react when they -- they -- they hear you've had it.  They [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  They get that, "Oh, quarantine you". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  She's had, uh, chicken pox and she had, um, -- uh, oh what's that called?  Uh, scarlet fever.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  She had that when she was, like, six.  And that about sent my mom through the roof because I guess, uh, she had it before they came out with the, um -- you know, with antibiotics and --
R:  Right --
L:  -- that kind of thing.
R:  -- and now it's like nothing but it used --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to be a really big deal.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, when I told her that she's like, "Oh my god" and she's [MN] going on and on and of course, you know, even though I've got two little girls, you know, when your mother starts going off --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the handle about an illness you're just like, "Maaaaa".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I had to call my doctor right back after I hung up and I'm like, "Is this true what my mom said?" and she's like --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  --"No".  She's like, "You have to understand your mom got it when, you know, this is pre, you know, antibiotics and that kind of thing and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- that's all.  It's okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But we had to definitely quarantine then.  We -- I mean, we really couldn't go round to anybody that time.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  That's rough.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- glad I'm in -- in good health in general.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  This has been a pr- pretty good, uh -- knock on wood, I guess, because I don't wanna just jump prematurely, but pretty good winter for us, really.  We've not -- we've not had too many illness, you know, I mean, we've hit the major ones for god sakes.  We had chicken --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- pox and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I got bronchitis and my daughter got bronchitis but we both have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- asthma so --
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  -- we had a -- we had the cold and I don't know, maybe you know the strain, um -- god, it's some kind of, um, virus that usually hits in the fall.  I can't think of it.  The doctor told it to me and I've heard it before but anyway he said that there's just something about this one particular virus that, you know, people like us who have asthma are susceptible to, uh, having bronchitis.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  I'm not sure what that is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Doesn't sound nice.
L:  No.  It wasn't.  'Cause, uh, there's nothing worse than not being able to breathe, you know.
R:  Oh --
L:  Even --
R:  -- definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Even something as simple as not being able to pick, uh -- or trying to take a shower was challenging, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was rough.
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really --
L:  [MN]
R:  It's really just an -- an unacceptable thing for me in my life to get sick at this point.  I mean, I guess -- I guess you can say the same for anyone's life but I just simply do not have any time for it and, uh, because I'm a student and I just -- I can't get sick and then not be able to study --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- on a given night.
L:  Jeeze, well.  I know.  And if you miss one class, god forbid, you don't have a -- a -- a good friend or a partner in there to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- share notes or something, 'cause, boy, that messes you up.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like, only a few of my lectures are video taped and I can watch them on line if I have to miss them but it's more of just that I have, you know, hours and hours of reading to do every night and if -- and if you just have that sick feeling to you there's just no way that you can concentrate on reading and it's just --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- it's such a step back so --
L:  Oh, I know.  That's true, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, even if you can make it through your normal day routine and, you know, because I -- I tend to never miss class.  It's just kind of an [LAUGH] obsessive compulsive thing I have but, um, even if you can make it through your routine of going to classes and going to everything else you have to do, you know, at the end of the day [LAUGH] you still need to be able to think clearly and so that's -- that's just what I get very scared of.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it's rough 'cause if you are sick and you go into class then everybody harasses you, "Oh, why are you coming in --"
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  "-- you're going to give it to me". [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I'm always -- I'm always very upset when people come into classes sick and yet I do it myself.
L:  I know.
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  It's a double whammy, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy.  I hear you though because, uh, whenever I get sick at work like there is, uh -- when I got bronchitis, before I even knew I had it, I actually fell asleep at my desk.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I take night classes also, um, so [LAUGH] it was one of those deals where, you know, I finally sent an email to my friend 'cause, uh, I -- my boss is a very difficult man, and told her -- I'm like -- because it's in the middle of an audit -- I said, "I'm so sick I can't even keep my eyes open.  I'm going out to my car to take a nap" and I had to, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- describe where I was going to sleep and, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- where I was parked and all that and I told her, I said, "If they come looking for me you have to come and get me". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I had to, like, make a little map for her where I was in the parking lot and then somehow, miraculously, I did wake up, like, two hours later but I was worthless.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I was worthless.  I couldn't do anything.
R:  Oh. [MN]
L:  I -- then luckily I knew what the auditor was looking for so I kind of formulated the response that god forbid he would ask me anything else 'cause I had been like, "What? [MN] When do I get my next dose of medicine?"  I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] "What was the question?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I have friends who, um -- where I work who have to travel from time to time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, there's only a few people in our company that have to travel a lot but I have more friends that go to our company's headquarters and wind up -- 'cause you know, when you travel, you go into different areas you get exposed to whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is going around in that city --
R:  Right --
L:  -- at that time.
R:  Not to mention that flying on planes is just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- horrible.
L:  Oh, I know because of the air circulation's not --
R:  Right.
L:  You don't get the fresh air that you need.
R:  Right.
L:  But I have more friends say that they -- they take these planes and they -- they go to the corporate headquarters and then they get these hotels and they get deathly ill.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, one friend in particular, she's like me, she's asthmatic and -- and she's prone to illnesses anyway too and, uh, she's actually had -- like, she's gotten sick on a Wednesday and had to stay [MN] clear through till Sunday 'cause she was too sick --
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- to leave the room.  And I'm like, "Oh my god, Lynne, that's gotta be horrible" I can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think of anything worse than not being at home when you're sick, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Ugh.
L:  Every time I think I got it bad I figure there's somebody out there that's probably got it worse than me.
R:  Oh, definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well ...
L:  So, uh, are we --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- supposed to keep talking for, like, ten minutes?
R:  I guess so.  I was assuming that we'd get interrupted but [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  I was thinking so too.  So, you've not done this before either?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.  Yeah.  I've not either.  I just -- I came across this by chance actually over the internet.
R:  Oh, really.  My, uh -- my linguistics professor emailed it to us yesterday, I think, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, uh, gosh, I don't want to deviate from the plan.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] Let's see, um, do you do anything specific to prevent illness?
L:  Um, you know, I -- it's funny you should ask because just this year, um, actually, I'm not sure if it's doing any good because before I got bronchitis I, uh, kept telling myself, you know, I'm going to take vitamins.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm really bad about taking pills.
R:  Mhm.
L:  God forbid I should, like, in my --
