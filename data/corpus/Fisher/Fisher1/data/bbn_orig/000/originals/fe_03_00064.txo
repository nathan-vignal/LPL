R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Um --
L:  How are you?
R:  Good. [LAUGH] My name's David.
L:  Oh, my name's Shelia.
R:  Shelia?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Um, what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you -- what do you think is, uh, the worst personal --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- habit?
L:  Well, lately I've been, uh, focused on gossiping.  I think that's very bad.  But I don't know if it's as bad as smoking.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think smoking.  I'd have to pick that.
R:  Smoking.  Yeah.  I -- I think gossiping is [COUGH] -- is -- is probably worse because I think, um, most of those other things, you know, only affect one person whereas gossiping usually doesn't affect the person who's doing the gossiping.
L:  [NOISE] That's true. [COUGH] Well, I -- I don't know.  Maybe, in fact, uh, it does.  I think a lot of people who gossip, a lot end up spending a whole lot of time, uh, thinking about negative things and then that could have a negative impact on their life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- focusing on, um [COUGH] you know, all the things that other people are doing that are interesting to gossip about you just seem to be kind of stewing in your negativity --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  No.  I definitely, I mean, I -- I agree but what I was -- you know, I -- I think that, like [NOISE] whether they're -- whether someone that gossips is negative or not, like, a [NOISE] negative person doesn't really bother me but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they start talking about other people. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And then --
R:  I --
L:  -- there's smoking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, you know [COUGH] -- that could bother other people, all the secondhand smoke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that.
R:  I take it you don't smoke?
L:  No.  But my husband does.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  And so --
R:  Um --
L:  -- [COUGH] he's recently switched to cigars and I don't [COUGH] feel so great about that but it's better than the cigarettes. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Hm.
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  I've actually contemplated that same move myself.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  I think that would be like something that I could do.
L:  Right.  And it worked for him so he --
R:  It did?
L:  Yeah.  He, uh, switched a year ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  But now he's, like, smoking, like, four cigars a day.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so in one hand it's good because you're not inhaling the smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  But it -- it still is compulsive as it ever was.  You know, the -- the need to light up and to have something in your hand and, uh, the cigar just replaces the cigarette.
R:  Right.
L:  And then another -- the smoke co- -- that comes off a cigar is much, I think -- unhealthy.
R:  It's very pungent.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so I worry that really you're being exposed to a whole lot of smoke even though you're not smoking cigarettes.
R:  Right.  So -- so, does he smoke in the house or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I've been very conflicted about that.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, you know, if -- if one nags a person, they might give it up but I'm thinking, "Well, you know, there's personal liberty."  You know, a person has a --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- right to do what they want.
R:  Right.
L:  And who am I to say that you -- you know, smoking should be completely done away with.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a stupid habit.  I mean, you know, I admit that.  It's just -- I don't know.
L:  How long have you been smoking?
R:  I guess, probably [MN] eighteen years.
L:  So, about what age did you start?
R:  Twenty.
L:  Oh, that's pretty late. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I started late.  I was over in, uh -- in Europe.
L:  Well, my father's been smoking since he was five, and so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- both of my parents smoke and I think they always will and, um, a lot of people start really young and they just never stop.
R:  Yeah.  Wow, five is really young.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, you know, a little k- kid kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- playing around and then by the time you're twelve you're hooked.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Oddly enough, I was pretty -- I was anti smoking up until the time I started smoking. [MN]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I wouldn't -- I remember when I was, uh, younger, I first got my -- I wouldn't let people smoke in my car.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And whereas now I smoke, I mean, I -- I smoke outside.  I don't smoke in the house, um, because my wife's kind of against that.  But --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I do go outside.
L:  Yeah.  You hear that a lot.  A lot of people will have people smoke outside of their house and -- and I contemplate that but I just -- I don't know, I just think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "What's the point, you know, I mean, smoke --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- goes everywhere".
R:  Right.  Well, are you in a warm weather environment or ...?
L:  Pretty mild, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess if it were colder you -- you'd get stuffy inside.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, um -- although I never really noticed it but I just thought it -- it -- I think it's effective, like, I have cut down a little bit.  Like, generally speaking, we have our, uh, TV room up on the second floor and, um, when I go up there to watch TV pretty much I'm done for the night [COUGH] whereas a couple of years ago when I was smoking in the house, I would -- I would, you know, occasionally smoke up there as well.
L:  Well, my husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, he's forty five and he got a lung x ray and the doctor told him he had the lungs of a ninety five year old man.
R:  Oof.
L:  So, that did it.  You know, that was the -- the, uh, motivation to stop smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, in fact, uh, the breathing and everything got much better immediately.
R:  Oh, it did.  You -- with smoking -- with switching to cigars?
L:  Yeah.  Immediately the breathing was, uh, improved [MN].
R:  Huh.
L:  But I can't imagine -- you know, it's just a slow -- a slowing of the -- decline of the lungs that has happened and so the other smoke is going to affect it as well.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  Right.
L:  I wish you the best.  I mean, I hope you don't get emphysema or something terrible like that.
R:  Oh, thanks. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda [MN] um, yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- you know, keep saying I'm going to quit.  Maybe -- maybe I will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after having this conversation.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I've always -- I've never been a big cigar smoker though.  Um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- but I -- I think it's like -- it's something I thought maybe would be like a good crutch for a while.
L:  Oh, I think so.  I think there's, um -- you know, there's a certain compulsivity to smoking and the cigars seem to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to satisfy that because there's all this stuff on the internet.  You can, you know, order cigars over the internet.  You can order these humidors, you can -- you know, there's all these accessories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for cigars and that really kind of fills that need to obsess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about the -- the thing and --
R:  Yeah.  No, uh, interest -- you know, does he smoke big cigars.
L:  Yeah.  They're pretty big.
R:  I'm actually curious because [MN] -- yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And so they last for a long time?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And -- and that's kind of an interesting dilemma because you know a cigarette is -- if it's half --
R:  Couple of minutes.
L:  -- done you kinda just toss it but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a half done cigar you don't really wanna toss it.
R:  Right.
L:  And so we're --
R:  Like it -- oh --
L:  He's always saving them and --
R:  Okay.
L:  But --
R:  Well, I guess that's kind of interesting because like if it m- m- -- certainly must have -- must cut down on, like, those, like, cigarettes where you're just kind of compulsory -- you know, like, I know I -- I teach at the university and after class I have a tendency to go outside and smoke a cigarette, just because I've been doing that for so long and, um, I guess if I smoked cigars I would probably stop doing that.
L:  Mm.  Because of the time?
R:  Because of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- time.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You only have a couple of minutes in between classes or something and --
L:  That's true. [MN] You couldn't really easily -- because the -- the fire on the ends takes a while to go out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you can't really tamp them down, apparently, the expert cigar smokers say. [LAUGH] You're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not supposed to do that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, then, uh, you're stuck with this lit cigar. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I actually contemplated going to a pipe.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, be- -- just because of the -- the, you know, you can -- from what I've ex- -- from what I've seen pipe smokers seem to always be lighting and putting out, lighting and putting out.
L:  Right.
R:  But I really should probably just quit cold turkey.  Might be the best.
L:  Right.  But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, the -- the pipe and the professorial thing that would go -- go together.
R:  Yeah.  I guess. [LAUGH] Uh, I don't see too many people smoking a pipe any more.
L:  No.  It would draw -- draw attention.
R:  Yeah.  Um, where are you calling from or ...?
L:  Oklahoma.
R:  Oklahoma.  Okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  Uh, Philadelphia.  So, do you -- does it get cold there in the winter?  Is it cold there now or ...?
L:  It -- it gets damp.  Like, this week it was in the thirties.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it was chilly.
R:  Okay.
L:  But that was the first time this year.
R:  Oh, all right.
L:  [MN] And, you know, probably February, January it's quite cold and sometimes icy but not for very long.
R:  Okay.  Hm.
L:  Are you guys under snow?
R:  Yeah.  We are.  Oh, it's so annoying.  We're not really -- like, we don't really get it every year and when we do it doesn't stick around or it usually -- um, and so it's just -- no one's really prepared for it.
L:  Right.
R:  It just becomes kind of chaos to a certain degree.  Fortunately I live near the, uh -- near the university so I can walk and everything like that.  But it's still, um, kind of frustrating.  But --
L:  Yeah.  I -- when I moved out here I thought I would miss the snow --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um -- and I do.  I miss how it looks but I really don't miss, like, walking around in it and --
R:  Yeah.  Especially in the city, you know, a couple of days it gets all black and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gross and --
L:  And the --
R:  -- everything.
L:  -- stuff on the street and you step in it and it gets all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- over your clothes and it's just very unpleasant.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from originally?
L:  Uh, West Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  I'm actually from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, wow.  So, [MN] not so far.
R:  Never left.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, I think I'll eventually have to -- have to leave though.  I'm trying to find a more permanent position.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  How do you like academia?
R:  Um, I like it -- well, that's one of those things -- one of my things about gossip.  It's very, uh -- I'm in a small --
L:  Really.
R:  -- department.  I'm in a German department.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, I have been at -- at various places, um, in the, uh -- they gossip.  I -- I don't know.  I guess at a certain point you have to draw a line between politics and gossip.  Right now they kind of all seem like one to me.  And it's just -- it's just really bad.  You know, the he said, she said stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a small department is -- is really bad.  Other than that I like it a lot.  I -- I like, um, I like, uh, the teaching it, uh, um, both at graduate level and undergraduate level.  I enjoy that.  Um, were it not for the politics and the lack of funding [MN] --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, lack of resources in a, uh -- I guess, this department, it doesn't really bring in a lot of money so, you know, we don't get a lot of money, but other than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that it's fi- -- other than that I like it.
L:  Yeah.  I don't like the politics either and I -- I didn't think there would be so much.  You know, I think I picked, you know, graduate school and academia because I thought for some reason it [MN] was going to be different from the rest of the world.
R:  Yeah.  I did too. [MN]
L:  And I was wrong.
R:  Oh, yeah.  To a certain degree I think it might be even worse.
L:  Right.  Because the stakes are so small.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's what I've come to see is it, you know -- people just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fight over the smallest and stupidest things.
R:  Right.  Fighting over the -- over, yeah.  And I think they're probably, you know --
