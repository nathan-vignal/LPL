R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How ya doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  My name's --
R:  My name's E- -- sorry?
L:  [LAUGH] What's your name?
R:  Erica.
L:  Hi, Erica, I'm Sean.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  I'm okay.  I'm not sick that's for sure.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I'm not either.
L:  That's good.
R:  I'm, uh, crossing my fingers that I won't get sick.
L:  That's good.  I do sometimes.  Um, it seems to be actually like when seasons change or something like that, sometimes.
R:  You really think it's affected by that?
L:  Um, I think so by, like, say, weather and things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, if -- if it gets colder then it seems to me that, for some reason, that I notice that, uh, it's not just myself getting sick, more people around me are getting sick.
R:  I think the difference is that, like, when the weather gets cold people close the windows so you're breathing more of everybody's germs rather than getting fresh air inside.
L:  Yeah.  That's a --
R:  So, it's not so much, like, a factor of the weather.  It's, like, it is -- I don't know, some secondary cause.
L:  Yeah.  It's indirect cause.
R:  There you go.
L:  I -- I didn't think of that but I -- I was thinking that especially when it gets colder I know that, um, it doesn't -- it doesn't affect germs.  I think germs grow better or something when it's colder or something like that.
R:  Hm.
L:  But --
R:  I don't know about that.  But I try to keep myself, you know, free from the germs and wash -- wash your hands often, that's what they say.
L:  I surely do that.
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, I can try and remind myself to wash my hands so that, you know, I'm not sick and I don't miss work or --
R:  Yeah, I'm totally paranoid about it at work.  I wash my hands so often and use, like, antibacterial gel because someone's always sneezing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just so easy to pick it up.
L:  Yeah.  Especially when you go to public places like baseball games or, you know, sporting events or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  movies or something, the mall or -- you know, uh, there's germs everywhere on doorknobs and stuff so it's -- I read in a magazine called The Bottom Line --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, that washing your hands is by far the number one way to prevent yourself from getting sick so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I definitely do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try and eat healthy too.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do, also.  I'm a vegetarian but I don't know if that's so much for my health.  It's just like a preference.
L:  Well, I -- I think it helps you at least watch your diet, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you eat well so that's good.  It seems to me that people that, uh, don't eat, like, vegetables and get vitamins and -- or take vitamins and things like that then they get sicker more often.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you don't have the, like, natural defenses to -- to fight it off.
L:  Definitely.  But then there ha- -- there's seems to be, like, other people that there's just about nothing they can do.  Like a friend that when I went to college, um, he was sick all the time.  He had [inaudible] and then the next week --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he had, like, uh -- one time he [MN] pneumonia and then he --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He would just have a cold and everything all the time.
R:  It's gotta be probably not very fun [LAUGH].
L:  No, not at all.
R:  To be sick all the time.
L:  Yeah.  Live your whole life sick.
R:  Yeah.  No kidding.
L:  [MN]
R:  Bad genes, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  Well --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do you consider, like, um, like, if you went out and you were drinking all night long or something and then you were, um, throwing up and stuff would you consider that being sick or just --
R:  No.  
L:  No.  Not really.
R:  That's different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that's making yourself sick.
L:  Yeah.  Very true.  But you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But you're still sick then, maybe.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you get like the symptoms but it's not like a bacteria or a germ cause.  So- -- I mean, that's something you could have prevented.
L:  Right.
R:  You did it to yourself.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, but, you know, sometimes you just get a bit sick.  Like, so many people I know, friends of my family, are so si- ill right now and it's -- it's just a very sad story and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- because there's nothing you can do to protect yourself against it, like, cancer.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  You know, so, like, there keeps -- there's always studies and the [inaudible] is like, "If you eat broccoli then you're going to protect yourself against this sort of cancer --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- but then it's going to cause this other kind of cancer".
L:  Yeah.
R:  It doesn't make any kind of sense.
L:  Well, I -- I heard on the news the other day that they had like a vaccine, uh, especially for women that, um, you could take, uh, that would prevent, uh, cervical cancer, which I --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  I thought was very cool.  I mean, like, cancer's probably, like, the most -- one of the most deadly diseases that we have and, you know, and it's very sickly and things so I think it's cool that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're making strides to help prevent it and --
R:  I'd be curious to see how that worked out in the long run.
L:  Yeah.  That's all I know is that they did a study and they gave a bunch of women pills and the ones they gave 'em to they didn't get cervical cancer but the other ones did or something, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That was the basis of that.
R:  Well [SIGH] --
L:  Do you live in, uh, like an urban area or suburban, or rural?
R:  No, I live in a city.
L:  Yeah, I live in rural -- rural area, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I kinda think that, uh, um, people get sicker -- I -- I'm not sure if people -- more people would be sick in the city or ...
R:  Well, it's more people in a lot closer quarters.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think there's much more opportunity to, you know, to pick things up.
L:  Yeah.  But I also wonder if you did, like, you know, like, a per capita percentage study or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if, like, the same -- you know, say, there's fifty people that live around me and then there's five hundred people that live around you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if there's, you know, a hundred people that are sick that live around you but only, you know, there's -- there's ten that live around me that are sick --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- that's the same kind of percentage, so I don't -- I guess that would mean you can't really make a correlation out of it.  I wonder if -- if a correlation can be made between the city and --
R:  [MN] That's a good question.  But I don't know, I -- I don't feel like I get sick more often since I've lived in the city and I've lived here for, like, six years.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it could also be that I just keep better care of myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than I used to.  I feel, like, as I get older, and I'm not very old, but I just feel that it's increasingly important to take care of myself.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause you start to realize your own mortality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know, if -- I definitely feel that that's the direction my life is heading in and, I don't know, need to eat right and watch your weight and -- because I intend to, like, live a long and healthy life and that's how I plan to do it.
L:  Yeah.  I'd like to.  As far as I can see if you eat healthy and, um -- and, you know, do your best to stay healthy then you will for a long time.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, but --
R:  But then again you could get hit by a car. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I know.  In the next ten minutes.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what about when you -- you know, you are sick?  Like, do you just have a cold or something?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What kinda things do you do to try and get rid of your cold?  I mean, do you take all kinds of pills and drugs and -- or what -- what do you do to try and get rid of them?
R:  I don't know.  I'm [SIGH] -- I'm actually -- I -- when I get a cold, I get -- I feel reluctant to take the medicine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because even if it, like, helps the symptoms go away you still feel like groggy and horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'd rather be clear headed.
L:  That's the way I feel, like, I'd rather not take, like, you know, drugs and stuff just 'cause -- I don't know a lot of times I feel like that's all so expensive and it seems --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to be like a psychological thing.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes it is and, like, a cup of tea will do the same thing.
L:  Yeah.  It's like, "Oh, I can -- I'm doing something to help myself" you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then your mind tells yourself or som- -- that's the way it seems to be anyways. [SIGH] I know that if I have just, like, a cold and, um, I'll just drink water.  I mean, like, probably two gallons of water a day.
R:  Yeah.  You have to hydrate yourself.
L:  Yeah.  Just so I'm going to the bathroom all the time and it flushes my system out.
R:  Do you take vitamins or anything?
L:  Um, usually I don't.  I tried --
R:  I kno- [MN] --
L:  -- and it doesn't seem to make any difference so, I don't know, just --
R:  Yeah.  Like, I know people who swear by echinacea.  Do you know what that is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I don't know.  I don't feel that that's, like, [MN] really very beneficial [LAUGH].
L:  I know.
R:  Just because it never really made a difference, like, when I tried it.
L:  My mom -- I think my mom uses that and that -- again that's where I think it's, like, more one of those, like --
R:  Psychological things.
L:  Yeah.  Just what you make yourself believe in, uh, you know.  And a lot of these companies have ads out, "Oh, this will make you better" and everything else, you know, and then they pay celebrities --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- or they're people that advertise for 'em and then, "Oh, that must be great stuff then".
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's all abou- -- it's all about, like, the commercialization and the privatization of drug companies.
L:  Oh, god, they're h- --
R:  But it's holy cow [LAUGH].
L:  God, they're horrible at it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's sickening that they -- you know, they obviously take advantage of people and just --
R:  Absolutely.  I mean, putting prescription pills on advertisements on the TV is just beyond my comprehension.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I can't believe it -- they're allowed to do that.
L:  They're all over all the time.  And that --
R:  [MN]
L:  Every other day -- every day I'm seeing a new add for a new kind of pill or drug or something to help and they never explain, like, what it's for --
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  It's like "Oh, go see your doctor and find out".  Well, see --
R:  Okay, they shouldn't bring that up, you know.
L:  And you know what that does?  It has people go see their doctor and it, uh, y- -- I don't know, for me -- but for me it's, like, five dollars to go see my doctor [inaudible] or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, some people might be twenty but they just wanna go and find out and that's the only way to find out about it for some people, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Or they want the doctor to say, you know, "Oh that'll cure this thing" and then they'll think the people will go, "Oh, well, you know, sign me up".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, these insurance companies are making all this money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In medical [MN].  God.
R:  So, uh, [MN] we're a big -- the only industrialized nation that doesn't have --
