R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, uh, my name is Shal Fay Lu[?].  I'm from China, and how are you doing today?
L:  Good, I'm -- my name's James.  I'm in Massachussetts.
R:  Uh, cool.  So, are you studying there?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- I'm working.  I -- I actually work for, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a dictionary company.
R:  I see.  Um, right now I'm a graduate student at the Ohio State University.
L:  Uh-huh.  Are you doing linguistics?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It sounds pretty interesting.  So, we are supposed to talk about illness today.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Um, how do you feel about colds and illness in the winter time?
R:  Um, actually when I was back in China I do often get colds from time to time.  Especially --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in winter and, uh, well, I -- I kind of believe that if you don't take any medicine it does automatically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You do automatically go back to the, uh, normal situation but actually since I came here I have never caught a cold. [MN]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I've been here for -- for more than a year but I have actually never caught a cold here.
L:  Wow.
R:  So --
L:  I --
R:  -- what about you?
L:  I, um, I rarely get sick in the winter time.  I, um [MN] --
R:  Really. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I think -- I don't know.  I mean, s- -- I'll get sniffles and stuff in the fall.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sniffles and, um, sore throat but I -- I never -- I -- it's been a long time since I've had a cold.
R:  I see. [LAUGH]
L:  And I think it's, um, I don't know, good luck and diet. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  And ac- --
L:  Um --
R:  -- actually I think the air here is pretty good so in China you've got -- [MN] pollution's very heavy and I guess a lot of bacteria --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the air so that's why a lot of people do get, uh, flu from time to time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I went back to China, actually, last winter and it was such a bad epidemic there.  And now I caught a really, really bad cold and, um, but anyw- -- and especially I got a cold ju- just before I -- before I had to leave for the States.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I stayed on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the plane and it was like feeling really bad but, after I came back here, I don't recall that I took any medicine.  I just slept for a day and a half, something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like that.  Well, with the jet lag as well.
L:  Right.
R:  So, well, I --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- I recovered. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think sleep is -- is really just one of the -- the best ways to get rid of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- any -- any sort of sickness.
R:  Yeah.  It seems to me too, yeah.  You know, you -- you just feel drowsy.  You don't feel like doing anything when you've got a cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's an excuse and it's -- it's also a cure [MN] for it.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  But do you just -- you know, do you actually do something regularly to -- just to keep healthy, not -- not just, say, food, but just to keep healthy?
L:  Um, nothing actively.  You know, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's just a question of, um, for me I -- I -- I -- I drink a lot of water.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, people make fun of me because the -- they claim I'm over hydrated but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I -- I really like just the fact of drinking water, you know, a gallon a day or so and I -- I can't help but imagine that that has some sort of salubrious effect on, you know, the overall health 'cause you're -- you're flushing out all -- every -- every bad thing that gets into your body.  Just flush it out. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I agree actually.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, um, yeah, I drink water and I -- I'm taking -- I don't know whether people will call me a freak or not.  I take a vitamin -- something every --
L:  Right.
R:  I take a pill.  I t- -- I take a vitamin tablet every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I make it -- I make it a point to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables every day.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I just feel that if you get all your vitamins and stuff that may help to -- may help to enter the immune system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, but -- that kind of proves again that that a kind of advertisement is everywhere so I tend to believe that I say -- yeah.  Just go with it.   It doesn't really have -- you have to like fruit and vegetables anyway.
L:  Right.  I -- I think just, you know, fresh fruit and the -- the least -- the less processed food that you eat the -- the better it is for your body and especially in the winter when, you know, th- there's not that much -- I mean, around here, you know, it's --  it's harder to get fresh fruit and vegetables in the winter. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, it -- it is, you know, an orange a day is a -- oranges and bananas --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- are really --
R:  Yeah.  I like --
L:  -- good for you.
R:  -- oranges very much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you -- do you do sports?  Any kind of sports, do you do that every week?
L:  [NOISE] Do I do what?
R:  Sports.
L:  Oh, um, I -- I used to, um, be more active in sports but it's -- nowadays it's just going to the, um, gym and lifting weights and --
R:  I see.
L:  -- riding -- riding the bike at the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the gym and, um, you know, that -- that's good too to keep the circulation going, you know, circulatory system, keep it active and healthy and the heart --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pumping and getting the blood through the body.
R:  I see.
L:  All this stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I just -- you know, th- -- I feel that when you -- when I do these sorts of things without -- it's, you know, just preventative maintenance basically for the -- for my body and it -- it's really done a good job in terms of keeping me free from illness --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over the -- over time.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I think there's a long term thing as well.  Yeah.  Uh, as for me --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- much so.
R:  Yeah.  For me I -- I -- I guess I at least spend at least one afternoon on whatever, either volleyball or tennis or table tennis or badminton.
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  I don't really like going to the gym that much because I think it's kind of boring.
L:  Well, it -- it's -- it's really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hard because, I mean, w- when you play sp- -- you know, when you play a sport like football or baseball or something you're supposed to go to the gym to work out.
R:  Oh.
L:  You understand the point of going to the gym.
R:  I see.
L:  But when you're just doing it for the [NOISE] -- you know, for some sort of long term health goal it's really hard to stay motivated --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for going to the gym when there's -- it's really going to the gym for the sake of going to the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the gym.  You know, and you're like, "Oh, this is making me stay healthy" but, you know, in reality [NOISE] it's -- it's just the way to spend an hour. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um [NOISE] I really wish that there was, you know, the -- I -- I really wish I could be more active in, you know, specific sports rather than just going to the -- the gym because it -- it's really hard to stay motivated to keep doing that.
R:  Yeah.  And if you play a ball game it's just -- you play with other people.  It's just --
L:  Right.  And it's more --
R:  -- more fun and it's easier.
L:  -- of a social thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And that -- I mean, you can't discount the impact of just having good social relations on your health too.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's- everything really impacts on, you know, how healthy you are, just like how you interact with other people and the stuff you do for yourself just in the course of your day and, um, the social aspects of sport certainly cannot be overlooked in terms of what they do for your overall health. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But it's kind of surprising to me that, uh, I think especially from my experience, I think I used to get a lot -- get a lot of various kinds of illness when I was in China because I think partly because of the air and because of my diet, um, habits.  But here I think the air here is so good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, it seems to me that it's not really -- really easy to catch a cold anyway.  But, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know, sometimes when I go to the hospitals you will see -- well, hospitals are always busy and doctors --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are always busy and you have to -- sometimes you can make an appointment.  You have to wait for, you know -- maybe you don't w- -- you won't get an appointment for the -- for the same day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know why there's still some people, [MN] [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] -- I don't know but s- still there are people who are getting colds every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do you think that's just because their immune system's not working well and maybe sometimes you are -- when you are stressed out you are more likely to catch a cold or ...?
L:  I think that -- I mean, there -- there's a lot of -- I mean, the stress keeps the -- weakens the immune system and people, um, I think people are -- are too sedentary and, um, restrict themselves indoors and so when you spend all this time sitting around indoors with recirculated air, without getting the fresh air --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, there's just all the germs floating around in the air and you don't get the chance to get out and get fresh air in your lungs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you're too stressed to do anything about it to treat yourself well so you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you eat poorly, you don't sleep as well
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all th- -- all these things just sort of contribute to a general, you know, sort of feeling lousy, you know. [NOISE]
R:  That's right.
L:  And it's the sort of thing that if -- if you got fresh air and, you know, ate well and slept properly then -- that your -- you'd less likely end up in hospital, you know, seeing the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doctor because you're sick.
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [MN] But actually this is like the finals week, um, for us.
L:  Oh, god, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, we have the [inaudible] in Ohio from time to time and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, sometimes I feel really bad and I feel when I'm out there I feel -- I feel so low and I wonder at such times if I -- I don't -- I don't wear -- wear enough, I may actually [MN] get something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's, uh -- what the -- I always -- there -- there was a kid I knew from high school who'd always wear shorts and a tee shirt in the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in the dead of winter and you'd --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, I saw a guy who j- -- who -- who was just wearing a tee shirt.  And it was like, huh, that's --
L:  And I -- I don't know how they don't get sick.  He -- he was never sick and he -- he would never wear a jacket.  He would always, you know, walk betw- -- walk around town in the middle of winter in shorts and a tee shirt and you just sort of wonder how --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and it -- it wasn't like he was, you know, fat with this huge insul- -- layer of insulating fat.  He was just a skinny kid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he n- -- I never saw him get sick.
R:  I -- I think it's something genetic maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Somehow they're just not sensitive to cold air.
L:  [MN]
R:  Or maybe there is some kind of heating system, you know, body element -- yeah, I actually have a class mate and he -- he's an American student and he -- he always wears socks and, uh, sandals.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  No matter what.
L:  Right.
R:  And sometimes if -- if it gets really cold then he will wear a -- a pair of jeans --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Otherwise he just goes with those shorts.
L:  Wow.
R:  And now, well, I guess, these days it's really cold so he's wearing something long.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, but, he is just one typical guy and I was talking to my friends, I would say, I -- when it started snowing the other day I was saying, "I really want to see what he's wearing today". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, he was wearing -- wearing jeans and a t- -- a long shirt that day.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, yeah.  He didn't wear a sweater or whatever.
L:  That's a little better but --
R:  Yeah.  And he's really fit.  You know, so, I don't really think that's related to whether you have a lot of fat in your body to burn or what.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  But it's just -- I -- that's a miracle.  They just have something -- I guess it's something genetic, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, some people have got it and some people don't and, uh --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if they're lucky or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what because I don't mind wearing a j- -- I'd -- I'd feel weird just not wearing a --
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, the, uh, seasonal changes are kind of -- there has to be some [inaudible] for us --
L:  Right.
R:  So, if you feel that -- and I spent two years in Singapore where you -- you -- you -- you only have to wear shorts and tee shirt all year round.
L:  Right.  'Cause it's always eighty -- eighty degrees [MN] and humid.
R:  You feel it's kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, kind of monotonous and boring, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You -- you want to experience the cold air and you want to be in the cold air for some time so I guess, yeah, maybe it's hard to say whether they like it or not but maybe they -- they will also be less likely to catch cold, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Because the -- they're, you know, not treating themselves right and not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- doing what they're supposed to do to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- adjust to the seasons. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, have you been travelling around?
L:  Actually, I'm leaving for Jamaica --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- in, um, a day and a half.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, with six inches of snow on the ground up here right now, I, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- can't wait to be on the beach in, um --
R:  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  a -- a couple of days.  It's a perfect time to be taking this trip.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I'm very much looking forward to it.
R:  I see.  Are you going to stay there for a long time?
L:  I'm going to be there for a week.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, um --
R:  But you --
L:  I was -- I was on Jeopardy last year and I -- I won a trip to Jamaica.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I, um, I'm finally taking the trip now, this --
R:  Good.
L:  In the middle of the winter --
R:  Good.
L:  -- which is just perfect.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  But maybe you should be prepared that when you're on your way back you should -- you know, just be enough snow to --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kinda --
L:  People here have promised us --
R:  It's kind of troublesome --
L:  -- deep snow.
R:  -- you know.
R:  It's kind of troublesome, you know.  I -- I remember when was a travelling from Singapore to China in November
