L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Holly.
R:  Hi, this is Umlitz[?].  How are you?
L:  Oh, good.  Ah, where -- where are you?
R:  Ah, I'm at Providence.
L:  In Providence, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, Rhode Island.
L:  Oh, I'm in Arizona.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  So, do you watch reality TV?
L:  [LAUGH]  You know, no, I don't.  Although I have to say I do -- I've watched some of the PBS ones, [MN] the ones like Frontier House.
R:  Oh, I never -- oh, I know those actually but never watched them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They are with kids and parents building stuff, right?
L:  Yeah.  Where they, um, they put these people, um -- they use -- for Frontier House they used three families from different parts of the country and they trained them how to live like people did in ... I'm trying to think what year they used.  It was the late eighteen hundreds.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was, like, eighteen -- eighteen eighty something.
R:  Right.
L:  And they put them out in the middle of the woods and they had to survive.  [LAUGH]
R:  But they don't earn money or anything li- like Survivor or --
L:  No -- 
R:  -- some such thing?
L:  it's not like a prize.
R:  Oh.
L:  No, it's a more educational thing to see how people cope with it.
R:  Oh, I guess it's, ah ...
L:  Yeah.  So, I watched that one.  [LIPSMACK]  There was another one they did.  The first one was called Nineteen Hundred House.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so they -- they outfitted a house in England just like nineteen hundred and the people had to live like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  But they didn't go out to, you know, crowded factories and coal dust and stuff.  That -- it will be okay, you know?
L:  Um, no.  What they did was in Nineteen Hundred House the kids could go to school, to the regular school, but they had to wear the period clothing --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- when they were home.  So, they had to leave the home and then change when they left the house.
R:  Oh, they -- they -- so no one made fun of them?
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] that's okay.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah.  Now, what do you watch?
R:  Ah, I don't watch it either.  But, you know, the Big Brother show?
L:  I think I've heard of it.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm from Turkey.  I've been here for three years almost now.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Good.
R:  And Big Brother is the biggest show in Turkey.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, people go crazy because they let the public decide.  You actually pay for voting somebody out or the leader-- I mean, the winner of that certain week.  So, everyone talks about it when I go back to Turkey and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, when I'm commuting in public transportation, I hear -- overhear people fighting, you know, each other because of somebody.  They support somebody and hate the other guy, you know?
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So, it's kind of weird and I think ugly as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, um, I figure everyone [MN] -- I mean, I tried to watch it once but I -- I really felt bad about it because there is one channel, ah, on cable that all -- gives live broadcast.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, while they're sleeping, while they're in shower, et cetera.  And it makes you feel real weird and perverted, you know what I mean?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I hated it actually in that sense.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, I don't mean to, you know, everyone can watch whatever they want but I don't appreciate it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [several inaudible words] and people talking about that.
L:  Now, is that what Big Brother is?  They just watch people?
R:  Yeah, there are cameras -- they put, ah, like, twenty people in a house.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they have to -- one of them goes out to drive a cab every day.
L:  Oh, I think I heard about this.
R:  The rest have to stay indoors all the time, except for when their turn to drive the cab.  So, they -- and they have no contact from outside world.  They don't get newspapers or, you know, they can't access on the internet or watch TV in the house.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they hear the rumors.  And they don't see each other all the time in the house so, ah, they hear the rumors from the guys who ride on their cabs.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think the idea come from a -- it's originally German.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- you have this show in here too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- I think it's nasty.  And the most -- those people, some of them became singers or, you know, celebrities.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Small celebrities, you know.  And the channel that broadcasts that, ah, you know, abuses that all the time.  They might tell all those people to fight on TV, after -- even after the contest is finished.  And the winner is -- you know, they take it real personally, I guess and -- or just -- just they play along with the game, you know?
L:  Wow.  So, in Turkey they actually show the American show Big Brother?
R:  No, it's with -- with Turkish people, Turkish production.
L:  Oh, so they have -- you have your own version over there?
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  Oh my gosh.  Wow.
R:  And they -- you know, those people they have romances and stuff, or they pretend to be hoping that maybe they won't kick them out because they get the ratings because of that, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I don't believe it's also fair, you know?  Like, I think that, ah, the broadcasting company manipulates stuff in those shows to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to make it more interesting to the public.
L:  Wow.  So, why do you think people watch shows like this?
R:  Ju- I mean, it's -- I don't know the psychological, you know, term for that, but it's some sort of -- like perversion, I can tell.  You know, voyeurism.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And to feel better about yourself by watching, you know, screw up -- screwed up people like that, you know?  You think, "Oh, I have a nice life --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- compared to those guys".
L:  That's true.
R:  Or, "I am not that bad" or, "I am not -- or you think you'll learn something out of it, you can know people better, you think.  So people watch it.  I mean, it's -- before there was a TV people were watching their neighbors, right?
L:  That's right.
R:  In every neighborhood there was an old lady with --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, always, you know, lift the curtain from the corner and watch what's going on, who is dating who and, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  And it's everywhere, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have them here too and it's the same in Turkey.  So there -- this is like a convenient way of gossiping --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the global village, let's say, you know?
L:  You know, you just made me think of something.  In my neighborhood, and there may be, ah, let's say eighty houses in this area [LIPSMACK] I have the only house where my kitchen has a window that faces the street.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, when I'm washing my dishes I can look out at the street and see what's going on.  And nobody else has a house like that.  There are no kitchen windows that face the street, all the other kitchens are in the back.  And, you know, that's something people used to do.  In my mother's neighborhood, you know, much older houses, you know, there are more people who have kitchens in the front so you can always look out while you're just working in the -- in the house and see what's going on.  And I -- I think it's good for safety in one respect but, ah [LAUGH] you know, you do get to see what's happening.  But maybe that's why people watch reality shows because they're -- they can't watch their neighbors anymore.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's humanity at its worst because there's money and they are playing each other, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Manipulating and stuff.  So, ah, people like that.  I mean, it's -- morally they like it because they are not the same.  They feel better about themselves also.
L:  Yeah.  Do you think people have too much free time?
R:  [MN]  Ah, I mean, the- yeah, modern soc- modern society people ju- work during the day and come back to television, right?  Not to each other and families.
L:  Well, see, I almost never watch TV.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm too busy.  [LAUGH]
R:  I watch it but, you know, on the background usually.  I don't think -- without thinking or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I watch movie, films and stuff.  But I -- I was never crazy about any soap opera or a TV show particularly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Well, I remember thinking when I watched, um, Frontier House on PBS that it was very educational.  And my daughter watched it with me and she really enjoyed it.  But then of course you started liking one family and not liking another family.  There was one family, they were really, really rich and they were from California and they had a really hard time adjusting to life on the frontier --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with none of their luxuries.  And the teenage girls tried to smuggle some make up into the [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- into the country and they were just going crazy because, um, well, they used up their food too fast and then they were hungry.  And they kept saying, "It's not fair.  It's not fair".  And there was another family there that -- they were much more practical people and they kept saying, "Well, you know, life is not fair".  [MN]  And here I was watching this show and watching these three families and, you know, liking one family and not liking another.  And then I thought, "You know, PBS has tricked me into watching a reality show".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, I thought I was watching something educational and, ah, you know -- and it was educational, you know, it's not where like they were competing for money or anything.  But it was still a reality show.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  So, ah ...  But I enjoyed it.
R:  I think maybe it was --
L:  I wouldn't watch it all the time.
R:  -- educational in that sense too, I mean, witnessing other -- how other people live and relate to each other, et cetera.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it's dangerous to make, you know, generalizations about it.  Maybe that's the whole point.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You have to apply this kind of censorship to yourself and making general- "So, rich people can't do that then --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words]" you know?
L:  Well, I guess it was, you know, maybe confirming a lot of people's stereotypes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of people from California.  "Oh, they have way too much money" and I don't know.  But, ah, sometimes I think that maybe reality shows are so popular because they've run out of ideas for other kinds of shows.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, it's the fastest growing type of shows, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they -- they had another show in Turkey with, ah, baking -- making a family to live as minimum wage.  And they -- they got work and they have to buy food and pay the rent and electricity, et cetera.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they -- it's kind of a -- maybe it's more like your Frontier House thing, but it's in the modern world with the real minimum wage that's going around in Turkey today.  So, it was -- it was slightly more interesting.  I never watched it, I didn't have any chance, but --
L:  Oh.
