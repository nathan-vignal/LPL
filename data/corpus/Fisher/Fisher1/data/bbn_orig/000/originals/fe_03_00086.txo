L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Hannah Halamarie[?] from Florida.
L:  Hi, my name is David.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH]  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  So, we will be talking about the reality shows?
L:  Yes.
R:  You watch them?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  I don't either.  I mean, I have occasionally seen a few of them.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, just in passing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I kind of have an idea of what they are like but I really [LAUGH] don't watch TV that much.
L:  Oh, okay.  I mean, I watch TV but I don't watch them.  Um, I see the previews for them a lot.
R:  The which one?
L:  I see the previews.
R:  Ah, right, yes.
L:  Um, but that whole, like -- I don't really like it.  I -- I -- I would watch it, I mean, I'm not averse to watching TV but I don't under-
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't understand the point of Survivor.  What, do they vote -- vote against themselves or something like that?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I don't either.  I -- I guess they kind of like drop these people.  I think it's -- I read somewhere that it's, um, it's a cheap way of doing TV and people who don't have lives like to [LAUGH] --
L:  Like to watch.
R:  -- look at other people have these interesting experiences, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe I've -- because I have -- I have children at home --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they sometimes watch these so I've -- I've seen some of the, like, dating or --
L:  Oh, right, yeah, like The Bachelor or something like that?
R:  Something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  And I think that is such a [MN] surrogate way of living for people [LAUGH] who really want them.
L:  Right.  Well, I have to admit, I did watch that -- it was a couple of years, maybe three, when they did that Who Wants to Marry A Millionaire.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watched that.
R:  Yeah. I -- I've never watched it, what is it like?
L:  Pardon?
R:  What is it like?  I haven't watched it.
L:  Oh, it was just a one time thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where, ah, it was like this staged thing and they had contestants and the winner got to marry this millionaire.
R:  [LAUGH]  Did they stay married? [inaudible]
L:  No, it only last like a month.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was a horrible, you know -- the, ah -- I don't know.  Like, they went away and, like, a day later she came back.
R:  Oh, ooh.
L:  So, it was -- it was just kind of funny though, you know.  It was just, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I got hyped into that one but --
R:  Yes, right, right.  Yeah.
L:  But I think everyone was [MN] a lot of people watched that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's -- most of the stuff though is ridiculous --
R:  It is ridiculous.
L:  -- you know.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's very -- very -- yeah.  We were just actually yesterday discussing something like Jackass.  And I haven't watched that.
L:  Right.
R:  But some of my colleagues had and -- and -- and the only thing I had about it was that there had been some instances where -- where young kids were then inspired to do something as stupid --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And then ending up in these horrible accidents.
L:  Right.
R:  But I --
L:  Yeah, but they could get like, crazy ideas from books too, kids, so --
R:  Um, the ones who read books?  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know like -- like, I'm a German professor, for example, and, um, I know that there was a box, you know, that caused some suicides in the early seventeen hundreds in Germany --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one of [inaudible] books, called Young -- Young -- Young [inaudible - not English].
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And inspired people to dress a certain way.  And if you read back, like, the -- of what people said around then, they were calling these people fools, these kids, you know what I mean?  Like, because they were dressing in this weird way.
R:  Right, yes.
L:  And then a lot of them committed suicide.
R:  Yes, I --
L:  Well, not a lot but, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I heard of -- I remember hearing about that too, or reading it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it's a --
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess it was the seventeenth century --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- version of reality shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess.
L:  Or, I mean, I just think it's just a sign that, you know, kids will do stupid things.
R:  Yeah, yeah, well that's -- yeah, that's a good -- that's a good point.
L:  You know.  And they'll get the influence from anything.
R:  Right because they get these influences from other than reality shows as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like movies and so on.
L:  Right.  But it's kind of fun to ask somebody that, like, um, I didn't realize it the first time but what -- the first time I asked for someone, I said, you know -- you know, "Have you seen that movie, Jackass?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they didn't really know what I was talking about.
R:  Have you seen it?
L:  So, like, you know, it's like call- it was like I was calling them a jackass or something.
R:  Oh, oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Like evocative, "Have you seen that movie comma Jackass?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's funny.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Well, I guess we -- we're not two very good people to discuss this topic because we don't -- neither of us watch the --
L:  Yeah, but we talked about it.
R:  Oh, we did, that's right.
L:  I don't think they were looking for -- I -- I -- you know, I just think they want voices talking about a topic.
R:  I guess.
L:  They're not looking for us to solve the --
R:  Any problems.
L:  Any problems or, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- create a hit reality show.
R:  Is this the first discussion you are doing?
L:  No, this is my second.
R:  Okay.  So, is there going to be some kind of a signal at the end when the ten minutes is over?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Yes, yes, there will be.
R:  Okay, good.  Yeah, I -- I just figured if we have to estimate it ourselves, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, no, no.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you in Florida?
R:  At University of Florida in Gainesville.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  I've never been to Gainesville.
R:  Um, have you heard of the Gators?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean, Florida Gators, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gator country, the whole -- yeah, I've all that, but --
R:  Yes.  Yeah, this is the gator country.  And you're from, what, Philadelphia?
L:  Philadelphia, yeah.
R:  Yes, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, you probably have the same kind of weather we have?  Snowy, wet, snow?
R:  Actually not.  It's -- they say -- this is only my second year in Gainesville.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They say that it doesn't usually snow here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But -- but it's been cold up there?
L:  Yeah.  It was cold last but, you know, it's -- it's not bad.  Once it snows up here it gets wet and it generally warms up.
R:  Yes.
L:  Then it just becomes messy.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, what do you do for work?
L:  Me?  I teach German.
R:  You teach German?
L:  Yeah,
R:  Oh, okay.  In -- at the university?
L:  Yes.
R:  Of Philadelphia?
L:  In Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah, or what university?
L:  Oh, the Curtis Institute of Music.
R:  In Munich?
L:  No, no, the Curtis Institute of Music.
R:  Oh, music, okay.  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah, it's fun.
R:  Yeah, I teach linguistics so I guess it's --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- language people who they got to do this project.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Where do you -- and you te- oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the finals time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  For the students.
L:  Yeah, well, I was glad we had our last day of classes of Friday so --
R:  Oh, good for you, yeah.
L:  I was pretty psyched.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, so, ah, do you go to Germany often?
L:  No, not that often.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I go but, ah, you know, I don't -- you don't nec- I don't think you necessarily -- at a certain point I got to the point where I was, like, you know to teach the -- to understand the grammar of the language and to read the literature you don't really have to go there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The internet has made me li- I use to go to Germany and one of the big things that I would want to do was buy, you know, some books because I would gain -- have access to all this, you know, music and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
R:  Right.
L:  Now I can get that all delivered to me from the --
R:  From the internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, my -- there is that drive to go [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, yes.
L:  -- is really cut down.  It's -- I mean, I hate to say it, but it's true.
R:  Well, that's an -- that's an interesting aspect of this whole -- whole internationalization that the internet has provided.  It provides, like, equal access but then it deprives people of the motivation to actually travel places.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, to me it has.  It really has.
R:  Yeah, yes.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I use the -- the web, I mean, I pre- pretty much get all my material that I teach, that I use in a range of classes, I get it all off of the web.
R:  What kinds of classes do you typically teach then?
L:  I go every -- everything from, you know, the -- the seminars and, you know, the thesis advising to, ah, German One.
R:  Okay.
L:  And everything in between.
R:  Yes, so you have a pretty extensive German program there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  Well, that's -- that's great because I hear that German programs in many universities today are kind of struggling to survive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  I think all arts and sciences.  It's not the way it used to be.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I wish someone had told me that when I was going to graduate school.
R:  Well, where did you do your ...?
L:  Ah, graduate school?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I went to Penn.
R:  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Well, not a bad place to go.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.  It's not.  It's, you know, it's okay.  But ...
R:  Yeah, yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, you know, they didn't -- I mean, but if you look at the statistics like twenty years before that, I would have a full time tenured position somewhere, which I do not have right now.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well --
L:  You know, where am I -- where am I -- you know what I mean?  It's a lot harder.  There are a lot fewer jobs.  Not like ...
R:  Yes.  Yeah, it's -- it's true.  You pretty much have to take what you are offered.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not that much possibility to select, like, where you want to be and where you want to teach and so on.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless you're like, you know, the hot -- a hot person.  How you get to become a hot person like that, I do not know.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, publish yourself crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not have a life.
L:  Right.
R:  Yes, yes.  So, you know, I guess that'll be the equivalent to watching these reality shows, not have a life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just right articles.
L:  I guess, yeah.  I mean, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's tough.  I'd just like to, you know, I pretty much like to teach.  I have some ideas but, you know.  And I write a few things, do go to a few conferences every year but, you know, I'm not going to kill myself .
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I pretty much killed myself at one point.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I tried to -- tried to get stuff out and that helped me to get a job, but I'm still an assistant professor.
L:  Right.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's tough some --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yes.
L:  So, you're a -- you went to --so you've been at Florida for two years then?
R:  Right, this is my second year in Florida.
L:  Right.
R:  I was in Texas before for six years.
L:  Oh, wow, okay.
R:  Yeah.  And before that I was in California.  That's where I did my PhD.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  Wow.
R:  [SIGH]  And before that I was in Finland.
L:  Finland?
R:  I mean, I come from Finland.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's fascinating.
R:  Can't you hear my accent?
L:  I heard you -- I know you have an accent but I didn't know which one.  I'm reading a book right now by a Finnish author.
R:  Oh, really?  By whom?
L:  Translated into German.  Um, wait a minute.  [NOISE]  I forget the name of it.  It's in my bag.  It's, uh
