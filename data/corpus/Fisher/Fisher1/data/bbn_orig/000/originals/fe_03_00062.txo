L:  Yeah.  Um, mm.  Yeah.  I think -- I think I think gossiping is worst.
R:  No.
L:  'Cause --
R:  Well --
L:  -- the other stuff [COUGH] I mean, for the most part I think the other stuff, um, you know, is basically just stuff you do to yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess gossiping you do to other people.  It affects other people.  I mean, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I know secondhand smoke and everything but, like, gossiping is more about other -- you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I don't know though.
R:  Uh, probably smoking.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, probably gossiping is really bad --
L:  Yeah.  It is.  I mean --
R:  -- if I think about it. [MN]

L:  Really.  I thought it was a lot.
R:  Well, I mean, that you don't get so much snow in the --
L:  Oh, no, yeah, we don't.
R:  So, you are not used to it so everything --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- gets closed and --
L:  Yeah.  Like everybody -- you know, everything's closed down and everything --
R:  You don't -- you don't have the equipment to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to deal with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I can't stand it.  It's just -- it's just a major --
R:  [MN]

R:  [MN]
L:  Um, but, well, do you exercise?

L:  Right.
R:  Do you exercise?
L:  Um, well, what I do, I have a dog so I --
R:  You walk --
L:  -- have to.  I have an active dog so I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to run with it every morning.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I guess, you know, I do exercise but it's more like work. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, um, I mean I don't --
R:  What about --
L:  Pardon?
R:  What about overeating?
L:  Oh, oof, I could overeat every day of my life. [LAUGH]
R:  Really. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, when I got married I gained like sixty pounds.
R:  Sixty pounds?
L:  Sixty in two years.
R:  Wow.
L:  I lost --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it all again.
R:  D- do you recommend to get married?
L:  Pardon?
R:  [LAUGH] Do you recommend anyone to get married? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I fight with my wife all day and, you know, I gained all that weight.  I was like, "God almighty, what did I do to myself?"
R:  [MN]
L:  You know.
R:  Wow.  Yeah.
L:  I was a happy person three years ago. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  But --
R:  I'm in kind of that similar situation.  I'm n- -- I'm not married but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I live with -- I live with my girlfriend.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, it's kinda hard to live with someone.
L:  Yeah.  You know, yeah, it is.  Um, it really is.  I don't know what I was -- I don't know.  I mean, days like today I'm like I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but my wife's a lot younger than I am so I think that might, uh --
R:  Really.  So, how many years younger?
L:  Pardon?
R:  What did you say?
L:  Oh, I said my wife's a lot younger than I am.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I think that might be a, you know, part of the problem.
R:  Mm.  What's the age difference?
L:  Uh, fifteen years.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I'm forty.  She's twenty five.
R:  Oh.
L:  I thought I was doing the right thing. [LAUGH]
R:  What?
L:  No.  I said I thought I was doing the right thing.
R:  Right.

R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  Just tell me, I don't know -- I don't know what right -- sometimes do you -- you just want to be by yourself and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's really hard to --
L:  Right.  I know.  Right.  It's -- it's --
R:  You just don't want to -- you just don't want to talk to anybody and --
L:  Right.  Yeah.  That's the way I get especially after, like, a har -- you know, a -- not a hard --

R:  Oh, that's the hardest talk. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  It's a hard talk [LAUGH] you know.  Um, I mean --
R:  What do think --
L:  -- I guess if you're not -- if you're not -- I -- I guess if you're not married it must not be that difficult but, I mean, you can at least say, "Well, we have to get married first" but if you're already married it's tough talk.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  So, you don't wanna have children?
L:  No.  I -- you know, I don't -- I'm somebody that, uh, -- I don't, um -- I don't m-  -- I -- I'm not, you know -- yeah, I wanna have children but I'm somebody it's just gotta happen, you know.  Like, I can't plan.  Like, I can't say, "Well, in --"

R:  Right.
L:  I gotta be, like, "Okay, it's happening" you know.  What's this -- you know, it -- it happens but, um, I can't plan it.  My wife likes to plan things. [MN]
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, which, uh --
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I -- I just -- I just don't even think about it.
L:  I don't either.  It just never enters --

L:  -- time thinking about, uh, Monday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  Let alone having something --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like having children.  It's hard.  For me, I mean I guess that's, you know --

L:  I -- I'm so- -- I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.
R:  Like, you -- you should do an exam, just ask questions to students, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I do that sometimes in some of the upper level classes.  It's hard in the, um -- in the lower level.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  The oral exam is always good. [LAUGH]
