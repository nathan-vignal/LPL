R:  [inaudible]
L:  Hi, my name's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Andrew Green.
R:  Hi, Andrew. [MN] It's quite a topic, isn't it? [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where's your -- [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  I didn't write everything down.
L:  Oh, that's okay.
R:  Be- because, um, there's a couple of these habits I have so you --
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  Yes.
L:  I find that's the only one of the ones that they mentioned that I can't ignore.
R:  [MN]
L:  The, uh, other ones, I mean -- you know, the other ones just don't affect me.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, if somebody overeats it doesn't affect me.
R:  Right.
L:  And if somebody gossips I don't have to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- listen to 'em.  But, uh, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I've had to work in close quarters with a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- smoker and I'm allergic to tobacco.
R:  [MN] Well, I can appreciate what you're saying and, um, my, um, heart goes out to you, but, um, I try to, um, be aware of the other person, um, if I should be outside and there's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so much now, um [COUGH] prohibiting smokers so, um --
L:  Well, ou- --
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  -- outdoors it's not such a problem, you know, in a small office [MN] that'll keep you -- that'll keep you sneezing.
R:  Oh, sure.  And so many things that we're learning about it, you know, it is dangerous.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, I've -- I've always tried to find a nice, um, little table outside rather than be inside.
L:  Well, that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, if it's raining or it's very, very cold it makes it a bit difficult.
L:  True.  I can understand that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I'm not -- I'm not unsympathetic, uh, certainly.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's mostly a matter of -- of, you know, the person I s- -- I -- I shared my office with was very addicted and, you know, I recognized this fact, you know, so, uh, for the most part he just found other places to smoke but sometimes he was unable to because our work required us to be in that room, you know, and he'd have to light up, and he would do it without thinking.
R:  Oh, definitely.  But he can't do that now, can he?
L:  Oh, no.  No.  Not now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then I don't work there any more anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, have you -- have you done more than one of these?
R:  I did one last night.
L:  Right.
R:  And that was an interesting one, um, the cold season.
L:  Yes.  I had that also.
R:  Yeah.  This --
L:  Anyway, um, well, what about the other ones?  I mean, certainly gossip --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- can affect you even if, you know, you're not the direct, uh, uh, target of it, you know.  I mean, people could gossip about you.
R:  It depends what you're gossiping ab- -- gossiping about.
L:  That's true too.
R:  Yeah.  See, I have some, uh -- I grew up in New York.
L:  So did I.
R:  Um, on the East Side.
L:  Yeah.  Where abouts?
R:  Um, Allen Street, near Rivington, Houston.
L:  Oh, Houston.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I can picture the area.  I haven't walked through there in ages.
R:  [MN] And, um, there was gossip.  Some of it, um, was uncalled for, especially if it was malicious.  But, um --
L:  Well, you know.
R:  But with my friends we gossiped, you know, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  There were several of us --
L:  Oh, pardon me.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  I said, "Pardon me".  I coughed.
R:  There were several of us living in this one apartment house.
L:  Right.
R:  And there was always somebody, you know, to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk about.
L:  Oh, yeah.  No.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know what you mean.
R:  But we -- we did it in, um, in -- you know, in a good way.
L:  That's true.  I mean, being -- being malicious certainly doesn't, uh, you know, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- certainly doesn't, uh --
R:  But in the workplace it can be awfully, um --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- bad.  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know, but [COUGH] -- pardon me.  In the workplace, I tend to believe that, you know, any excess --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- communication is probably unnecessary.  You know, I mean, you're there to work, basically.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, during lunch, uh, people talk, you know, about whatever, uh, they're going to talk about.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I --
L:  But I've --
R:  I've been home for the last, um, couple of months, um, recuperating from an operation and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I've been so darned bored so I've been watching some of the shows that they have on in the morning.
L:  And that's all lots of gossip.  Yeah.
R:  And [MN] it is.  It is and they're into rubbing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- each other for them to get their own little, um, stick in.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's funny.  It really is funny.
L:  No.  I know what you mean.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Obesity, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me, um [COUGH] it's -- it's sad.
L:  Well --
R:  You know, especially if people, you know, have, you know, a problem of, um [SIGH] -- of really overeating.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can be a -- you can be an addict.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just the same way as you can be an addict to cigarettes or to -- or to other things but, again, it's one of those things where I say, you know, if somebody wants to overeat, or take drugs or, you know, whatever -- you know, it is as much as this -- as much as it might sound, uh, uncaring, I also believe that people have a fundamental right to be stupid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I've had people -- I bite my nails.  I'm thirty five years old and I bite my nails.  But, you know, somebody points it out to me.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks for mentioning it.  I've been doing it for thirty five years.
R:  Uh-huh.  But that doesn't stop you, does it?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, it hasn't been important enough.  It would be different if my fingers were going to fall off or something.
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, it hasn't been a -- a big enough deal in my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, so I'm not a hand model. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, the one thing that ticks me off is, um, people that, um, you -- like, you make an appointment with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, um, time wise that ticks me off.
L:  Oh, I d- -- a lot of people have a very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- poor sense --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of time --
R:  And then there is that long --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- excuse, you know, that when you couldn't really care less, here we're finally together let's do what we have to do and, um --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  That ticks me off and I -- I find myself, um, [SIGH] getting moody over it.
L:  Well --
R:  You know it --
L:  -- that can be seasonal also.
R:  No.  There's some people, like, um, that [COUGH] -- that's -- they've been doing it all their life and, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, when you -- like, I -- I pick somebody up, um, to give them rides.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, this person just cannot, um, work her time out.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's true.
R:  And, um --
L:  It's one thing if you're chronic about it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that's a problem because then it, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, causes everybody around you a --
R:  Well, I was very assertive.  I tried to keep my, um, voice calm but it [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was the first two times then I -- I finally told this person --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [COUGH] you know, "Look, um, I'd be happy to do this but if this is con- continues, I'm not".  And that -- that felt good.
L:  That's -- but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have to at some point.  You know, at some point you have to tell somebody, you know, you know, that, hey, you have problems and unfortunately they're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- starting to impact on me.  You know, I've had to do that.  I've been in positions where I've, you know -- I've hired and fired people and, you know, and I've had to tell people that, you know, "Hey, uh, you know, you have -- you have had so many chances.  You continue to show up late.  I'm very sorry, you know, like, I don't know what's making you late, but frankly it doesn't matter to me any more [MN] -- any more --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as I have to run a business --
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- and, you know, if you needed some other, you know, time to be available you should have made it clear when, uh, you started working here, you know, that you wanted different hours" and, uh, you know, some of them straightened up and, uh, a lot of them didn't. [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  And those you just had to let go, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, look it's very sad.  A young woman is working for me.  She's got a baby.  She doesn't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sleep well.  I mean, I'm not a heartless bastard but I gotta run the b- -- a -- a store.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, at some point, I simply have to say, "If you need welfare, you need welfare and, if you need work, you need to show up". [MN]
R:  True.
L:  I'm not -- I'm not welfare and I can't be because, you know, I have a very little -- I have very little, uh, budget.
R:  No.  That's important for, um, somebody especially, um, you have certain X amount of hours.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, "You wanna be paid for all your hours.  If you needed more flexible hours then unfortunately you're going to need to work some place they can give flexible hours.  I've got, you know -- I have to work within my limitations and you have to work within my limitations also. [LAUGH] That's why I'm boss".  You know, I never like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- doing it.
R:  No.  It's -- it's -- it's not pleasant but for me it felt good, you know, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this way, um [COUGH] I had the, um, choice --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, um, if you don't have the choice that's when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anger starts for me -- anger starts coming into it.
L:  Oh, I understand that.
R:  [MN] So, what else is on our list?
L:  I don't -- I don't know.  We could talk about, uh --
R:  Oh, can I digress for a minute?
L:  Please.  Please.
R:  Are you still -- are you in New York now?
L:  No.  I'm in Philadelphia.  I moved --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- years ago.
R:  How's the weather there?  Cold?
L:  Uh, we've got about five inches of snow still laying around.
R:  Oh, wow.  Wow.
L:  It's not so bad.  I mean, you get used to -- you get used to the snow and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although, hey, there is a bad habit.  I hate it when I clear out a parking space and find somebody else in it by the time I move my car to it.
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  People have been shot over this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wouldn't do that but sometimes you want to. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, I'm enjoying the sun.  I'm in Southern California.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been out there.
R:  Yeah.  It's lovely.  It's really lovely, um, the days are warm.
L:  Mm.
R:  Just need a -- like, just a turtleneck and, um, the nights get a bit, um, chilly but nothing like what you have.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, so far it's so good.
L:  Well, that's not -- that's not such a bad thing.  Uh, a lot of things also are, uh -- I mean, in terms of bad habits, you know, some people just have a lot of tolerance for things.  I've been on long car trips with people who'll hum continuously.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, some people who would drive nuts.  I just tune it out after a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, boy, we must be working on almost ten minutes.
R:  Or incessant talking [LAUGH] --
L:  Well --
R:  -- never giving up.
L:  -- if we're being paid to talk incessantly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Not such a bad thing.
R:  I mean on a long, um, car trip.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [COUGH] Or a good argument going --
