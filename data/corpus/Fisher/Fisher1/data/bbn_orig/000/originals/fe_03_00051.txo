L:  Hello, this is Saskia.
R:  Hello.  Hi, this is Steve.
L:  Hello.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Um --
R:  Can you hear me all right?
L:  Do you have any strong opinions on any of these things?
R:  Um, I would have to say gossiping is the worst.
L:  How come?
R:  Well, oh, um, it's an intuition.  Let me think.  All right.  Let me put it this way.  How does one gossip in moderation?
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, rarely do it. [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so --
L:  I don't know.
R:  So, one can eat in moderation.  One can drink alcohol in moderation but one really can't gossip in moderation.
L:  Mm.  Really?
R:  Well, I don't think so.
L:  I feel like that's what I do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I feel guilty about it.  I -- It's funny because I feel the opposite.  I feel like, well, okay, gossiping involves other people so that's not good, but as far as like surviving --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's the least threatening of the other things which are all physical.  Um, and I don't think that any of them are good but I was thinking, at least as far as surviving, the other things are not so good. 
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, but that they're all equal.
R:  True.
L:  Because, um, not exercising, overeating, smoking -- well, maybe smoking is the worst because it's direct pollutant to your lungs.
R:  Well, I guess -- okay, here -- here -- here's something interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't gossip by yourself.
L:  Right.  Oh --
R:  So, the --
L:  -- so there's two people involved. [LAUGH]
R:  -- necessarily involve other people.  Right?
L:  [MN] At least three other people. [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so, you can -- you can drink excessively by yourself but, as long as you're in your own home and you're not causing trouble for anybody, you're not doing anything harmful to anyone else.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're simply harming your own body, whereas when you're gossiping, you know, it may not be the -- the content of your gossip may not be very harmful but you're -- you're still doing something to somebody else without that person's permission.
L:  Right.  No.  I do agree it's really disempowering actually, um, to the whole community, like, everyone involved, including the gossiper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm.  Gosh, maybe they're not -- ma- -- well, I was thinking on a very basic level, you know, of human survival so -- but maybe socially, at least, they're all the same.
R:  Right.
L:  Like --
R:  [COUGH] W- would you agree that not exercising is the least harmful?
L:  Um, well, yeah.  Just it's all contextual really because --
R:  Because plenty of people don't exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not such a terrible thing not to exercise, right?
L:  Oh, I don't know because I think that's one of the -- like, uh, the causes of cancer and things like that because, um, you know your cells need to move and +regenerate and I feel like exercising helps that renewal process and if you don't exercise I feel like that's where all the toxins get stored and then you look at how many people are dying and aren't healthy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think ac- you know, kids naturally exercise but as we -- we get older we get more sedentary and we get more diseases and I think it's partly related to that.
R:  Hm.
L:  To stopping -- hm.
R:  That's true.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  You know, in terms -- still going back to the gossiping thing, I'm thinking maybe -- maybe even not as harmful, you know, on a physical level, to some degree, whether we can track it or not.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Be- because it is negative.
R:  True.  Mm.
L:  And, like, when we gossip it's really, like, it's -- it's, like, coming from a disempowering place so I'm sure that there is some kind of chemical that must be released from that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Probably.
L:  It's maybe a more subtle neuro chemical or something.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, it -- it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it -- I mean, like you said, gossiping makes you feel guilty sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that maybe why it has an adverse effect on your health.
L:  Right.
R:  Or, um --
L:  W- --
R:  The -- the consequences of gossiping, sup- suppose you gossip about someone and then that person treats you less nicely because you gossiped about that person.
L:  Well, of course, right. [MN]
R:  And that -- that -- that definitely affects your health.  You know, how people treat you, you know, affects your mood and -- and that's -- that's definitely -- you know, that can be very unhealthy for you.
L:  Hm.  Yeah.  Definitely.  And how you treat other people too whether you're aware of it or not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think has negative impacts.
R:  Right.
L:  So.  Hm.  Maybe -- yeah, maybe they are the same.  Or maybe -- maybe they're, um, [LIPSMACK] it depends on the motivation.  Well, gossiping doesn't seem to have any good motivations but I think sometimes, um, drinking alcohol can actually be a positive thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  And overeating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can do positive things sometimes.
L:  What's that?
R:  Overeating, I think, can be positive sometimes.  I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- there's overeating, I have to say, but -- but if -- if -- if you have a big holiday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like Thanksgiving dinner, I think that's a good time to overeat.  You know, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  I think -- I think it's good to feel really full and have this, you know, excess of food at Thanksgiving just to remind you of, you know, how much people -- people can give, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Interesting.
R:  So, overeating sometimes I think also is -- is a good thing.  Um, when it --
L:  That's interesting because I think about other animals, you know, that do that and, um, specifically like lions it seems like they do it sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll eat an incredible amount and then just sleep all day, right?
L:  Mhm.  Hm.  Interesting.  Okay.  What are the other things?  There's alcohol --
R:  Smoking.
L:  Smoking.
R:  Um, caffeine.
L:  Gossip, overeating and not exercising.
R:  Right.
L:  Not exercising can also help be positive too, right, because you need your body to repair itself.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  So, I mean --
R:  -- guess --
L:  Are you still there?
R:  Yeah.  I'm still there.  Um, w- what do you mean by -- like -- like, not --
L:  Well, like, people who exercise every single day can damage themselves.  So --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I'm starting to think about, like, the balance of things.
R:  Mhm. [COUGH]
L:  Like, even that there's a balance in overeating, like overeating can be good sometimes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause you can feel good though your stomach is full and ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And the same with alcohol even.  Like, you can become intoxicated and have it be a completely pleasurable experience.
R:  True.  Yeah.
L:  And I guess sometimes that -- that can actually be good because it can relieve stress or it can just be really good.
R:  Mhm.  What about caffeine?  Caffeine is mentioned, right?
L:  Caffeine.  Did we talk about caffeine?  Is that on the list?
R:  Uh, I think -- I think that was mentioned too, in the topic.
L:  Oh okay.  Uh, I don't know.  I don't really use caffeine very much.  Um --
R:  I don't either.  I don't tolerate it very well.
L:  Right.
R:  Um.  But, like, is -- is that a -- is that a good feeling to have too much coffee in you? [LAUGH]
L:  Like, uh, [MN] oh.  Well, y- yeah.  We're talking about too much -- right, uh, I don't -- I don't know.
R:  Like, do people actually try to get caffeine highs?  I -- I [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  They are, right, because, um, in highschool people would take, um, Nodoze. [LAUGH]
R:  What kinda highschool --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did you go to? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] A regular high school. [LAUGH] Lots of --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- lots of kids took Nodoze, you know, for experimenting with -- with caffeine.
R:  Nodoze. [LAUGH]
L:  God.  Um --
R:  I don't know.  Most kids did marijuana when I was at school, not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Nodoze [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  Whatever's available, I think, was the mentality.
R:  I -- yeah, well -- so, is th- -- is that -- is that harmful, overuse of caffeine?
L:  Yeah.  I feel like it is but, you know, I stay away from it so -- same with smoke.  Um --
R:  But you never hear of people, like, getting health problems because they drink coffee too much, do you?  You know, it's -- it's not like --
L:  Um, I know that it -- yeah.  I think that there are.
R:  Really?
L:  I think there are studies that link to that and I think that, um, definitely agitation, diarrhea, like, those are the immediate effects but also, like --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, it's -- it suppresses the adrenal glands.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't think that's very healthy over a long period of time.
R:  Probably isn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's probably n- I mean, clearly it's not as bad as smoking but it's probably still bad.
L:  I feel like smoking is the number one thing because as soon as you smoke it begins to clearly poison your lungs but, you know, some people really like it and maybe I -- it's because, uh, smoke is a thing that I'm most sensitive to, but I also hate gossip, and gossiping is, you know -- I don't know.  I'm just thinking even just a little bit of smoking is really unpleasant for me to be around because that's -- because that's just what I'm sensitive to.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And clearly excessive smoking isn't -- is never good, is it?
L:  Um, right.  But then also, you know, the thing about gossip is that, like -- that's what comedians do and on some level [SIGH] I think comedians are great, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and they take all these things about people, and figures that we know, and -- and they -- they almost turn gossip into an art form. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it makes us look at ourselves so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that would be a positive use of it.
R:  Or I guess -- I guess gossip that's harmless is -- is okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As long as you're not -- you're not putting people down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For example, for example suppose -- suppose you're trying to fix up your friend with someone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and so you gossip with all your other friends about how, you know, they're going to go on a date or something and --
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  -- and it's cute.  It's cute, you know.
L:  It is cute. [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  Right.
R:  And also -- also it is in -- in some way almost supportive of your friend, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you're so interested in -- in how -- how, you know, the relationship might turn out that -- in that case gossip is entirely a good thing.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I think I -- I r- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I revise my original opinion.  I -- I guess --
L:  Yeah.  I understand.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  I think I would pick smoking then, too.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I guess it's just -- the other things it's, like, how they're used.  But, like -- but, you know, that even I'm totally biased because I'm sensitive to smoke but, like, even smoke, like, in Native American rituals and other cultures, you know, is supposed to be really positive.  It's supposed to make you stronger and in touch with the spiritual world.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I think even that can be used, uh, positively but I think it's probably the rarely least positive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to use.
R:  Most people in society don't do that.  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Come again?
R:  Most people in this society don't do that though.  You know, they just go out and have their smoke break?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty much it.  So ...
L:  Right.  Yep.
R:  Hm.  Interesting.
L:  Mm.  And then --
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess -- I guess I would just come to you, like, how things are being used and what the motivation is, like, the underlying motivations behind them are, is what --
