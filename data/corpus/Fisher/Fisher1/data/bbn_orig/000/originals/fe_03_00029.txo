R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Uh, this is Ted.
R:  Hi, I'm Cory.
L:  Hi, Cory.  Um, well, gee, I guess we've just heard what they want us to talk about. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Sounds like illness is the topic of the day.
L:  Yes, it is.  Um, well, gee, um, I -- let me start out and say that I don't believe that there's such a thing as this seasonal, uh, seasonal devel- -- uh, what do they call it?  SAD, seasonal affective disorder.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think a lot of it just has to do -- I think a lot of it's psychological, obviously.  But I think that a good bit of it is just, um, people are -- it's a natural thing and people just are trying to give it a name.
R:  Yeah.  Although I think, um, lack of sunlight does have an effect on how people, um, react to the seasons, um, in the winter when the days get shorter and there's less sunlight.  I think that does play a role in health and wellness and things like that.
L:  Well, [MN] I think I see what you're saying but I also think that that's -- that's probably able to be overcome.  I mean, I think if you go to a place where there's light or you have a -- a lot of light in your own home or a lot of light in your own, uh, apartment or you go to places where it's light it -- it takes -- uh, you -- you can counteract it.  I guess you don't have to suffer from it.
R:  That may be true.  I don't know if artificial light has all the same things that sunlight does.
L:  Yeah, well, well, r- right.  But -- but, I mean, I think we're assuming that there's something psychological here more than there is something chemical.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Though, I don't know.  It could be both. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know either but --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, my own thing is I -- I'm a person who -- who just -- who reads a lot and likes to read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what I will often do, particularly on winter days, [MN] is to get some of my favorite books out which often take place in places other than the north, other than the cold.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and just sort of escape to, uh, whatever island I happen to be reading about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that works for me.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I know that I'm the kind of person who in the fall did -- I just always seem to get sick right about the time the weather changes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] You know.
L:  D- d- do -- do you take vitamins or ...?
R:  I don't -- no.  I -- I don't know if it's really the weather so much as just I think it's that time of year it tends to be -- you know, I've been busy all summer and you end up getting kind of run down and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the fall comes and by then, you know --
L:  Something gets you.
R:  Yeah.  If you -- you know, the right germs find me and just always seem to happen about the same time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I sometimes have allergies so I'm sure that weakens my defense system too.
L:  Maybe I've been lucky but, uh, when I was younger -- I'm in my forties now -- but when I'm -- when I was younger I got sick a lot.  Uh, and since I hit about thirty five or forty I -- I -- believe it or not, I'm sick a whole lot less than I used to be.  I can go a year and a half, two years, without getting a cold.  Thank god.
R:  That's nice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope by the time I'm thirty five or forty it's -- I can -- I won't have colds as well.
L:  Yeah.  Somethi- something to look forward to, right?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That sounds like a good part of aging.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, there are others that aren't so good [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, uh -- yeah.  Um, th- -- what was the other thing that they -- oh, yeah.  About a cold taking seven -- if you take -- medicine would take seven days and if you -- if you don't take medicine it takes a week.
R:  Or if you go to the doctor.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I've heard that before and -- and I think that's pretty true.
R:  Yeah.  Well, otherwise I'm one of those people who, by the time I make the doctor's appointment for the next day, I'll be fine by the next day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Right.
R:  You know, because I always wait so long, I guess.
L:  Well, yeah, things have a --
R:  I tend to be --
L:  -- way of working themselves out.  I mean, I -- I guess -- I guess, I don't know how old you are, but in my -- in my experience the, uh -- you know pretty early whether it's something serious or something not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and then you just sort o- -- most of the time you just sort of let it ride itself out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate going to the doctor and they've been, like -- having them say, "Oh, you're fine". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So I always tend to wait to make sure it's not --
L:  I know.  That's really --
R:  -- just something that's --
L:  -- embarrassing --
R:  -- gonna pass.
L:  -- isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, I know I was teaching and I found that, uh, I would pick things up from my students, you know, and, you know, if you get a sore throat, you're like, "Well, is this just a sore throat?  Is it strep throat?  Do I need to go?" and every time I'd wait and then finally I'd be like, "Oh, it's just not going away.  I'd better go" and by the next day when I went to the doctor I'd be like, "Sorry.  It's fine now". [MN]
L:  But on the other hand if you're -- if you're working with students and such you should have been exposed to just about every possible illness that there is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, y- you know, over time I would think you probably build up a pretty good immunity.
R:  Yeah.  I think you do but, I mean --
L:  But --
R:  -- there's always --
L:  -- over time --
R:  -- so many different viruses and bugs and everything else that --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I was teaching band so, like, you know, the kid would play on the instrument.  They'd be like, "This isn't working right" you know, and I'd never think about it and just start playing on it to see and then --
L:  Oh, ev- [MN].
R:  You know, I mean, direct contact.  It wasn't just like they were breathing on me, so --
L:  So -- so that -- now, did these kids keep their own instruments or did they -- did they share them with the next period and the next period after that?
R:  Oh, no.  They had their own instruments but --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- you know, a lot of times --
L:  So, at least they --
R:  It would just be me who was gonna get sick some more. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Terrific. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  Made -- made you long for the violin, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [MN] Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  I looked forward to those percussion lessons instead.
L:  Yeah.  Indeed.
R:  [MN]
L:  Something where you don't actually need to blow. [MN]
R:  Right.  So -- and then, of course, it -- you know, sometimes it's a matter of you didn't realise they were sick until after you did that.  You know, I'd go, "Oh no".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you can't help but wonder if it's -- was I just starting to feel sick because I -- you know, I knew, "Oh, man, now I'm going to get sick" and then you do or is it really the germ?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I -- the ul- -- I mean, getting sick and, like I say, I haven't been sick in a while and of course now that I've said that I'll probably --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- end up getting sick tomorrow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but what I always do is I kind of look at it as this is somebody's way of telling me, "Hey, slow down".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and usually it's -- you know, I can use -- even if -- even if my throat stops hurting or my nose stops being stuffed or whatever, it's one of those where it's really good to just -- to just [MN] rest and not do anything for a couple of days.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes your body just needs that break. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's real -- really kind of healthy just every now and then to lay in bed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see.
R:  I always like those kind of days where you can catch up on your reading and the videos that you haven't had time to watch and things like that.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, like -- well, I [MN] -- long story but -- but we were -- I was out of -- I was out of town but the people where I am here, um, had a snow day earlier this week.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I was talking to [COUGH] -- to some of them today at work and they were saying it was just great.  They woke up and it was like they didn't -- they knew that they didn't need to do anything and they couldn't do anything because they couldn't drive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they thought, "What a great day just to turn over and go back to sleep".
R:  There is something about those days.  Like, the day after Thanksgiving where you have the day off and --
L:  Yeah.  It's just --
R:  You're not gonna go shopping.
L:  -- down time.
R:  [MN] You know, you can just snuggle in and, you know, I always want to set the alarm on those days just 'cause I can finally just turn it off and go back to bed.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Sort -- sort of to spite it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  To spite the alarm clock.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, my husband doesn't understand that though, so usually I don't get to. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, sorry to hear that.  Yeah.  Very well.  Hey, so tell me, how long are we supposed to talk in this thing?
R:  Uh, ten minutes.  I don't if they break in and tell you when that's up --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- or not.  I haven't done one of these before.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I haven't done one of these before.
L:  No.  Me neither.  It came in -- in an email and I thought, "Well, gee, what the heck, let's give it a try". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I thought, "Ten bucks, I can talk for a while". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And they said they -- they might -- they'll call you as many as twenty five more times.
R:  I know.  That's a lot of times. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'll talk about the entire thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, anyway, so back to illness.  Um, do y- do you have kids?  Do you -- have your --
R:  No.
L:  -- kids been sick or ...?
R:  I'm expecting my first one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- right now, so --
L:  W- well, won't that be fun then?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I can remember -- I -- I've got -- m- -- now my kids are both in college.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, when they were younger it was always, "Oh my goodness" every time one of them would cry --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it would be, "Oh, is she sick.  Does she have an earache?  Does she have this, that and the other thing?" and you get so sensitive to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then after they get to be about six or seven years old you kind of throw up your hands and you say, "What the heck?" you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  "Let 'em suffer for a day or so". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, it's definitely different.  I, uh, was student teaching in first grade this semester and to see how -- how sick some of those kids would come to school and you're just like, "Why are you here?" you know, "You're green.  You obviously feel terrible.  Why are you here?"  "Oh, I thought I'd feel better if I came to school.  Mom said I'd feel better if I came to school"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just like --
L:  Well, that's somewhat of a copout.
R:  Oh, I'm just like, "Your mom didn't want to take off work that's why you're here".
L:  That's it.  That's it.  Well, that's true.  We were lucky though, when my kids were young, um, either my ex wife or I could always finagle a way to stay home.
R:  That's nice.
L:  So, yeah, I -- I actually had a job that -- that was really flexible in that respect and so when the kid was sick it was like, "Okay, I can just, you know, work from home".
R:  That -- that's a nice thing to have.
L:  Yeah.  Of course, as a teacher you can't really do that.
R:  No.  No.  That wouldn't work.  My husband sometimes will have the freedom to do that but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He also has a job where there's a lot of meetings so, depending on the meetings of the day --
L:  Mhm.  Sure.
R:  -- we'll see. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  But the -- the key thing is no matter what -- uh, I'm speaking of kids now.  Doesn't matter how sick they are, how well they are, they all -- you know, ninety nine point nine percent of 'em turn out just fine.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  And, you know, it's interesting because everybody's told us, "Oh, when you have your baby, you'll be amazed how often you have to run to the doctor and you just get used to it.  You'll go and they'll tell you the kid's fine and all these things" and I'm just like, "Oh, man". [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not looking forward to that part at all.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because I'll be one of those parents who's a little more like, "Well, we'll just let it go a little bit longer and see if everything's o- --"
L:  Well, I was going to say read a lot.  You'll get a whole -- get a handle on that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, when to freak and when not to freak.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [MN] well, the, uh -- when are you due?
R:  January tenth.
L:  Oh, man, so you're -- you're big then?
R:  Yeah.  Five weeks.  Five weeks and a day.
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  Any time would be fine. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it's exciting.
R:  Yeah.  It is exciting.  We're -- I'm ready. [LAUGH]
L:  You're ready.
R:  I'm ready now, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I hate to think how I'll feel in five weeks but --
L:  Yeah.  Well, good.  I hope your -- I hope your husband, uh, is supportive to you and all that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  He's been great.  He's gone to all the doctor's appointments and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sometimes I think he's more excited than I am, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, wait till the second one comes around and then the third and then it's, uh --
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Then it's a whole different thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm one of four children.  I know that by the last kid we have like two pictures of them from age zero to probably twenty.
L:  Right.  Sure.
R:  My older sister --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she sneezed when they took a picture, I think, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.  That's true.  Though my -- my second kid, the one who -- who is actually, uh, less healthy than her -- her older sister, um, we don't have nearly as many pictures of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and that's just number two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
