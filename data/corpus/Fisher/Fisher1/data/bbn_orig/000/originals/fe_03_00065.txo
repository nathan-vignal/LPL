L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?  I'm Kelly.
L:  I'm Heather.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you from, Kelly?
R:  Um, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in Louisiana right now.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh, yeah, actually I'm heading north soon though, so is it cold up there yet?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's cold. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  So -- so, we have to talk about personal habits?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I quick wrote 'em all down.  It was which was worse out of gossiping, smoking, drinking alcohol, overeating or not exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that's a real tough topic. [LAUGH]
L:  I love gossiping.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Me -- see -- see, I do too but I always -- I'm always worried it's going to come back at me or that I'm -- someone's going to hear it and I'm going to hurt somebody.  So, I mean, in a way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do it but I feel really bad about it. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I don't.  Do you go to school?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  See, I think that's -- um, in school everybody knows everybody so somehow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I guess that can happen but --
R:  Yeah.  I go to, um, a real small private college here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I also work there full time so I know everybody and I work in an office where a lot of the problem students come in and cause a problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's really hard for me to disassociate that between that and talking to the students and saying, "Oh, by the way, so and so came in screaming at me the other day". [LAUGH] I really have to kinda watch that.
L:  I would be terrible at that job.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like if ever you seen 'em in the hallway and you just wanna be like, "Why were you yelling at me the other day?" [LAUGH] Or in a class with you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Now, do you do any of the other things like the smoking or ...?
L:  I smoke.
R:  You do.  Okay.
L:  And it's terrible.  I think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's -- for me that was the worst one.
R:  The worst one.
L:  Because -- yeah, and I don't even smoke that much.  I smoke, like, less than a pack a week.
R:  Okay.  Oh, so that's like hardly anything really.
L:  Hardly any but I've been smoking since I was fourteen and I ca- -- I still can't quit.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it's like -- I'm more of a social smoker but it's enough to -- it -- I know it's harder to quit than I thought it would be.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so that's -- that's the worst one for me.
R:  Okay.  Yes, see, I don't smoke but my boy- -- my live in boyfriend does smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, actually my father also is a very heavy chain smoker.
L:  Is he?
R:  Yes.  And my father just had a heart attack this -- uh, in last March.  My boyfriend, it scared him so much that he quit smoking.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And he lasted until about a m- -- about three weeks ago he started smoking again.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we just moved into a new house while he had quit smoking and now the house smells again and all that but I see how bad it is because I thought he was doing fine and having no cravings and he just all of a sudden started up again after nine months.
L:  It's so easy.  Yeah.  I quit for sixteen months once --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and then I -- and then I moved and I went to grad school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I met all these people that smoked and it was just so easy to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just go right back into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, I think it was easy.  I quit after I graduated college.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And I -- I lived at home again for a while and nobody smokes at home and -- and nobody smoked where I worked so it was easy.  Like, I associate with people but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's so easy.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, he lasted a long time.  He had all of his --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- friends smoke and he even went on a trip to -- a hunting trip to Canada with some friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and he drove a -- a twenty hour trip without smoking, with two smokers in the car.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I'm like, "You did all that and you came back" so I -- I believe smoking is one -- probably one of the biggest evils. [LAUGH]
L:  I agree.
R:  But, you know, you just can't get away from it but, I mean, even with the alcohol too though I'm thinking is, you know, if you're just a social drinker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't drink that much it's fine, but when it gets to the point where you become violent or it affects your family or your work then, yeah, that's kind of just up there with smoking for me. [LAUGH]
L:  I think so too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Personally, I don't know any -- anybody that -- I don't think I know anybody that has any serious alcohol problems.
R:  Okay.  See, I had a couple in my family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have a prior boyfriend who was, um, a very violent alcoholic.
L:  That's horrible.
R:  And so I had to -- I lived with that and I eventually did get out of it but I still -- I still wonder about him because I know he has two kids with a prior girlfriend.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, when these kids -- he's from down south and when the kids come up to visit him, he's off at the bar and they have no food in the house to eat and they have -- they don't go anywhere and --
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I feel so bad for --
L:  That's rough.
R:  -- the people in his family and the people around him and he's ruining himself and everybody that loves him.  So --
L:  I have a friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who -- who -- who's father was an alcoholic and he -- he won't even let himself have a glass of wine or anything because he's terrified of becoming like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I can't imagine that.
R:  Yeah.  See, I have -- I have an aunt and uncle, um, that were -- my aunt was the kind who would hide the vodka bottles and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, those collector cans of beers, like, for Harley Davidson and all that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Her son -- well, my cousin had those and she even -- I mean, even af- after they were, like, ten years old she was drinking those when she got desperate.  And she lost her --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- licence through drunk driving, so she'd be walking up to the liquor store and she was -- I mean, she was my grandma's age so she was in her late seventies when she was doing this, and the alcoholism eventually killed her because her -- she got diabetes but they couldn't treat it 'cause her liver and kidneys were so bad and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- that eventually killed her and she really -- and her hus- -- her second husband is the one who kinda forced her to drink.  'Cause she'd never drank until she met her second husband.
L:  Do you think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um -- do you think some people are more predisposed to -- do you think it -- I mean, I guess I'm asking do you think it's a genetic thing?  Do you think it's a family thing? Or just an environmental thing or ...?  'Cause it -- 'cause it seems like some people I know are just affected by it more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- easily and are more --
R:  See, I think that part of it is, um -- I think a very small part of it is genetic.  I -- I -- my guess is that it's more environmental.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think too as like w- what I told my boyfriend is I think he has a very, um, addictive personality --
L:  Yeah.  I guess that was what I was getting at.
R:  -- where I'm very much of a control freak.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it -- to me as an -- and I -- I mean, in high school I tried smoking and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But to me it was -- this isn't, you know -- I couldn't imagine something like that controlling my life because I'm such a control freak.
L:  It's not even fun. [MN]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think people who are, like, more laid back and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, kinda like just let things go and, you know, they kinda allow themselves to almost be more controlled or --
L:  That --
R:  -- be more addictive.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe.
R:  I don't know 'cause it's -- I always tell him, I always say, "You're weak.  I don't need that kinda thing.  You're just weak because you can't walk away from it" and, I mean, I'm, like, joking with him but, I mean, I keep telling him I think he -- he must have more of an addictive personality than me if I could have one and then say, "Well, whatever" 'Cause even when he started back up again it made him sick -- sicker than a dog for two weeks.  His stomach hurt.  He had --
L:  I can believe that.
R:  Yeah.  His stomach hurt.  He had diarrhea real bad.  He was, like -- you could even tell he was coughing more and --
L:  Oh, my gosh.  I didn't realize it would be that bad.
R:  Yeah.  It was his sinuses were bugging him and, you know, he had more phlegm and he -- he noticed all these kinds of things yet he lived through that to keep smoking.
L:  Did -- did he pick up where he left off or did he just gradually start smoking again?  Was it a couple every now and then or did he just start --
R:  He just -- I mean --
L:  straight in?
R:  -- he's back to -- he's back to smoking as much as he did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  From what I understand.  It was funny because he was on a hunting trip and he came home and he had a pack of cigarettes in his pocket [LAUGH] so he had started for probably, like, three or four days before he even came home.  Before I even knew about it.  But -- and originally he was saying, "Okay.  I'm only going to smoke outside" but then it got really cold up here. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, then eventually it just seeped back into the house and he started smoking like normal right away and, like I said, he put up with being sick for a good two weeks.
L:  Wow.
R:  In order to be able to smoke and I thought, "My god.  How much of a control does that substance have over you [LAUGH] in order to put up with that?"  'Cause to me I would be -- I would be like, well, I'd rather be not smoking which is healthier anyway.
L:  It's interesting that you said he went hunting when he was doing it because I have some friends who live in Michigan who always go camping and that's always the time -- nobody can quit smoking when there's a camping trip involved.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You have to put it off until after camping because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But always tell him, "It's like you're always going to go every year --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- so you gotta survive it at least one year" so -- although, now, with the last two, the overeating and the exercising, that's my problem.  Where I may call him addictive, but I -- I mean, and I'm not obese.  I'm not heavily overweight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd like to lose, like, maybe twenty, thirty pounds which I put on in school. [LAUGH]
L:  I gained a lot of weight when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I went to school too.
R:  Yeah.  But it's -- and I -- and I'm kinda like I try to do like the heath food and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that kind of stuff and -- but I no- -- I notice if I'm, like, stressed out or bored is I automatically -- when I was young I was very, very overweight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As a child.  I probably weighed more in grade school than I do now. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] But I mean I -- I still -- so I struggle with my weight a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I see that as being more of a problem for me and more of a habit for me.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I am very lazy and I do not like to exercise. [LAUGH]
L:  Now, see, I'm the opposite.  I don't mi- -- I haven't been exercising because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's been finals week and I had three papers to do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I would rather exercise than -- I love eating.  I love --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eating. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't want to, like, think about what I eat and I -- it's disgusting what I eat sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, oh, I -- my -- I have friends at home too and they can go on diets and they can be so careful about what they eat and I ca- -- I don't have that kind of willpower.  I have the willpower to exercise but not to eat h- healthy, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, see, I just did that where last week I decided I was going to start eating better again and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because, with me, I work full time during the week and then I go to school on the weekends full time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm busy Monday through Sunday full time, basically, so I don't really have a lot of time to go shopping.  Well, we had extra time off because of Thanksgiving --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I made sure -- I went -- I had all my salads pre made.  Well, yesterday, instead of eating the salad I had pre made, I ate almost a whole frozen pizza in [MN] one sitting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I got two pieces left. [LAUGH]
L:  I do stuff like that. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, and I'm just like -- and, like, even tonight for dinner I actually just got done eating before the phone rang.  I bought a vegetarian frozen dinner with a vegetarian Salisbury steak and I'm sitting there eating it and I had to throw it away it was so nasty.
L:  I was just going to ask I -- is -- was it Amy's by any chance?
R:  Yes, it was.
L:  I've seen those and I've been -- I like that brand normally but I -- I haven't tried the Salisbury steak [MN].  I wasn't --
R:  Well, I tried it in the microwave, oh, like a long time ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and if you make it you have to make it in the oven.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It does not taste normal in the microwave and it was okay but it -- it kinda had, like, the -- it reminded me pretty much like a vegetarian hamburger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know how there's only certain brands of those you can eat --
L:  Yeah.  I do.
R:  -- of the veggie burgers?
L:  I do.
R:  It kinda -- the Salisbury steak kinda reminded me of one of the brands I don't like so much. [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- but, I mean, the -- the potatoes were really good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's so hard to eat healthy.  Every sort of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you a vegetarian?
R:  I'm -- I have attempted it.  I've -- I always say I wanna be and I buy vegetarian cookbooks and I attempt it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I live with a hunter [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that I cook for and it's -- it's v- -- and I'll even sit there -- well, I'll be like, "Mom, I want meat loaf tonight.  Please make me meat loaf". [LAUGH] So --
L:  I was a vegetarian too.  I'm not --
R:  Were you?
L:  -- any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I just like to try different foods but I -- in general I don't eat a lot of meat.  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And where was I going with that?
R:  Oh --
L:  I was gonna -- oh, I forget.  Never mind.  Something about -- oh, oh, I was going to say especially for vegetarians it's -- it's really hard to eat well because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everything's expensive if you wanna eat --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- fresh produce and it -- it's time consuming so --
R:  Yeah.  That was my thing is it seems like it's so much more work and to have my food -- you know, and -- and everything pretty much seems that it has to be more home made.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, time is just -- I don't have it. [LAUGH] I mean, y- you're going through the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just don't have the time.
L:  Well, jeeze, if you work too on top -- work full time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you go to school for?
R:  Um, communications.
L:  What does that mean?  I -- I really don't understand what communications is.  I --
R:  Um, I actually --
L:  -- know it's huge.  It's a giant department.
R:  Yeah.  I actually just switched to it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's, um -- just switched to that major, so I'm kinda just starting out in there.  But, um, I think I'm going to kinda lean more towards, you know, um, like, being, like, a trainer.  Like, a human resources kinda trainer type person.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Or, you know, where, you kn- -- you know, you get -- got to stand up and talk to people and -- although I'm also really into the photography.
L:  I like photography too.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not very good at it but I like it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
