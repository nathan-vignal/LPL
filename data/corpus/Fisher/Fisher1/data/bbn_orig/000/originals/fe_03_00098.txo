L:  Angel.
R:  Linda.  [PAUSE]  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Um, my name's Linda.
L:  My name's Angel.
R:  And we- I guess we're supposed to talk about reality TV?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you watch, like, any reality TV show or anything like that?
R:  I've never watched any of it.  None.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Do you watch them?
L:  Yes.
R:  Which ones do you watch?
L:  Mainly, like, The Real World, 'cause, like, it's always on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, yeah, like, it reruns on, like, five different channels and --
R:  Yeah.  And there's -- there's never any more music on MTV.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, so ...
R:  But -- but I never have watched any of the other ones.
L:  Neither have I.
R:  The, um, Survivor or any of those.  Although I know people who were just com- like, completely addicted to them.
L:  I know.  Like -- like, that sort of amazes me 'cause they're just so contrived and the people are just sort of, like, so over the top.
R:  Yeah.  So, have you watched them at all?
L:  Um, no.  Like, usually it's just like in, like, the commercials and the sound clips and hearing it, like, on the news and --
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible].
L:  -- Jay Leno and everything else like that.
R:  Yeah.  So, why do you think they're popular?
L:  I think just because people are, like, extreme voyeurs and they just don't really want to admit how voyeuristic they are.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I hadn't thought of it that way.
L:  So, it's sort of like you get to see peop- it's like twenty four seven Jerry Springer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like, you've always got the opportunity to see somebody, like, doing [NOISE] something really odd, like eating worms or --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- jumping off of buildings and everything else like that.
R:  The -- the part of it that bothers me, I guess, is that it seems so brutal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The way they have to make a decision, um, and, you know, who to kick off.  So there's all of this forced -- you know, they're forced to -- to -- to be on teams and pitted against each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I found that -- and that is truly contrived.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  And the part that they're -- they're talking about starving to death and they're weeping and, you know, somebody's going to die, and there's a whole crew sitting, you know, ten feet away --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- filming them.  So [LAUGH] it's like, you know, just how real can that possibly be?
L:  I don't think you were supposed to think of that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I -- I could -- I don't think I could ever get past that part.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  But I've never watched them.  I did watch The Real World when it first came on --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I watched a bit of it.  And then it seemed like it was, you know, it was just on all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah -- and the only other one that I've watched and I must say that I really enjoy, is The Osbournes.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's 'cause they're just really sick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  They're just so odd it's just --
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I tried watching the Anna Nicole Myth --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just out of curiosity and I -- I couldn't last more than, like, two minutes.
L:  Yeah, that -- that was me.  Because everybody was talking about it and I was like, "Well ..."
R:  Well, I had been watching, ah, another program that had done a skit that was a take off on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought, well, I really wasn't getting all of the joke because I didn't -- I'd never seen the real show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I thought well, maybe I should go actually see this but ...
L:  It -- there was too much pink for me.  It was just sort of like --
R:  Oh, it was --
L:  -- like the idea of, like, the this, like, thirty or forty year old woman just surrounded by that much pink --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was just sort of frightening.
R:  And she's obscene.  I mean, she's just grotesque.  And she talks in that bizarre voice.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the only little bit that I saw was when she was doing her -- she was doing her bedroom and she wanted her entire bedroom done in pink --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- satin and white fur.  And the walls and everything.  And that's when I figured that it -- I -- you know, I -- we had to change the channel.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We couldn't handle it anymore.  But -- so The Real World is on other channels now, is it?
L:  Yeah, I think it reruns, like, on ABC or --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- like a WD something.
R:  Oh, it's probably on everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've made a fortune off of that.  That's been a long time.
L:  They have.  Like, I think it's, like, the tenth season or, like, the eleventh or twelfth season or something.
R:  Wow, that's wild.
L:  'Cause I think, like, the season -- like, two seasons ago was, like, the anniversary season.
R:  Yeah, and they brought everybody back.
L:  And they said it's been on for ten years.  And I was, like, "Wow, that's quite a while".
R:  Yeah, it's hard to believe.
L:  Like, I'd say, like, the first season I was probably about, like, ten or eleven.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I enjoyed the first season and it was good and it was still, like, realistic and it wasn't as contrived.  And I wasn't as bothered by the people and the people to me seemed more realistic.
R:  More honest.
L:  Yeah, they were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more honest with like who they a- who they were.  But now it's sort of, like, really formulaic where you always have to have, like, the one person that's never met a black person before and like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the one person that's a nymphomaniac and, like, it just continues on.  And you have to have that person in the show.
R:  But [MN] it seems to me that all television is that way.
L:  That's true.
R:  It's even -- no matter how good a sitcom or a show is, you know, any show that comes on that the first year or so is very different.  And then it's -- they figure out what it is in the show that works and then they just beat it to death.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they just keep doing the same thing [NOISE] over and over again.  And, you know, like, that's why nothing can last for very long unless it's really well written.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, you know, things like Frasier, I mean, I don't even watch that anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's gotten kind of old and -- the script -- the writing is still good but, you know, it's the same -- it's the same story week after week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It gets kind of boring.  And --
L:  Frasier's been on for quite a while.
R:  Yeah, it has been.  So, how come you don't watch them?
L:  Um, I don't know.  Like, just -- like, TV in general I just usually use it as, like, background noise.  But I'm never actually, like, deliberately sitting in front of the television, like, "Oh well, it's ten thirty and this is on and I have to watch it at this moment".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's just sort of, like, you've seen it before.  Or after a while it just gets, like, really, like, boring and inane and just, like, silly.  'Cause, like, I don't know.  Like -- like you said, like the first season of different things are really good, so you'll watch, like, the first season of, like, The Practice, or the first season of Alias.  And it was really good because you didn't know what was going to happen.
R:  Right.
L:  But then by the second season you're like, "Yeah, I know these people".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know exactly what you're doing.
R:  And the same stuff happens over and over again.  Yeah.  I just was never very interested in it.  And, I don't know, I forget when it was exactly but for some reason I just sort of stopped watching television in general.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I sort of resented the fact that, um, uh, things like mini series where they -- they just get you pa- plugged in and you have to wa- I think the last thing I watched where I wouldn't miss an episode was probably Twin Peaks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was, you know, that was a long time ago, was the last time I was tied -- tied in to something on a regular basis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Aside from that, there's just not much on that I really want to see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- you know, I -- I watch The Simpsons regularly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though I've seen them all a million times.  [LAUGH]  It's one of -- one of my guilty pleasures.  They still make me laugh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But there's really not -- I can't think of anything that's on regular television that I watch.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  I remember when I was in -- when I was in school and studying, all I could think of [NOISE] was I wanted to get to a point in my life where I had a regular job so that I could come home and watch television and not feel guilty.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then once my studies were done and I had that opportunity, I realized that there was nothing to watch so ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That was how it was for me because I started, um, like I had a job where, like, I worked from five till ten --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I never got to see anything that was on the TV.  And it was sort of like I would just be sitting at work going, "Friends is on" and, "I'm missing ER" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "This is on and that's on".  And now that, like, my work schedule's changed where I'm home for all those things, I still don't watch them.
R:  You still don't watch them.  Oh, I still tend to read a lot and, you know, people will ask me what I -- you know, I'll say that I read this or I read that, and they say, "Well, where do you find all that time to read?"  And I -- I -- I think part of it is that I just never think to turn the television on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that it really does afford you a lot more time if you're not glued into it.
L:  That's true.
R:  Although there's some interesting -- there's some bizarre stuff on.  Um, I'll watch the Spanish channels every once in a while --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just to try and -- I speak just enough of it that I don't exactly know what they're talking about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you have to kind of guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's kind of enjoyable.  But I -- I could never understand why Survivor, when it first came out, why it was such a hit.  I mean, I have friends who had Survivor parties.  It was like their --
L:  Wow.
R:  They based their week around -- they would all get together and watch it.  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess it was the whole -- the lure of being able to vote somebody off the island, I think.  It was just sort of, like, to have that kind of power over somebody, where you were just like, "You must go".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "We don't want you in our group anymore".  Like, I don't -- I'm not really sure -- like, the one that amazes me now, there's one that's, like, on NBC.  I think it's, like, Monday nights or something, where, like, they have, like, four people or I don't know how many people, but they do, like, really odd and gross things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like you have to eat maggots or, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- jump in, like -- like, the -- an ocean with, like, live sharks and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like all this, like, really odd, bizarre things.
R:  Where they're facing their fears.
L:  Yeah, I think it's -- yeah, that's what it -- it's Fear Factor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's just sort of, like, what someone would do for a million dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is just, like, so creepy.
R:  Ugh.  Well, I don't know, but I would do it as long as it didn't involve snakes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah, I -- I've -- I've always been amazed at why those things are so popular.  And then there was that whole series of things, Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was so popular.  And then it was -- like, it was on every night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I never watched it.
L:  See, I -- now, that one I watched because it was sort of entertaining to see how far someone got, or to see, like, what question it was that they lost on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But some of the questions are, like, really simple and --
R:  Well, the only little bit of it I saw, the questions were so dumb and I just got frustrated.  I thought if these -- you know, it was almost as though they were bringing the people on to make fools out of them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for being stupid because the questions to me seemed so simple.  But then I always have to remember that if I were -- if I were in that place, even if you had that knowledge, you know, you're so out of your element and you've got all of these people and there's lights
