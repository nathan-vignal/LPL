L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um --
R:  This is Saskia.
L:  Hi.  Oh, I think I spoke to you before and then we got --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- disconnected.
R:  -- is this Adrienne?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  I hope -- I hope we, uh, last. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know what?  The last time I had them on my cellphone and, um, I told them to change it to my regular phone because I don't think my cellphone hung up on 'em but their system has to detect a constant signal.  You know, that's why, like, if you use, like, caller ID it doesn't work.
R:  Mm.  Okay.
L:  So, I think that my phone faded and their system hung up on me.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  That's my theory.  But it doesn't really matter because now I think it'll be okay.
R:  Okay.  I'm all, "Oh, we better talk about the thing". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you watch any reality shows?
L:  Um, I don't watch anything really frequently but I -- I like those kind of shows.  I like, like, the Survivor and Fear Factor kind of ones where they're doing like -- like, I don't know.  You know, sort of -- not dangerous but, like, things that I wouldn't necessarily do. [MN]
R:  [MN] Um, why do you think you like those or why do you think people like those?
L:  Um, I don't know, to me it's, like, cooler than watching, like, um, whatever, like, fictional TV because, like, there are a lot of things that aren't really exciting because it's just an illusion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like -- like, I like watching, like, Fear Factor kind of stuff because they're actually having to do it whereas if it's, like, in a movie they probably aren't actually doing it.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  I haven't go- -- you know, I haven't -- I haven't watched either of those shows.  I never watched Survivor and I didn't watch Fear Factor but I've seen the commercials and it looks interesting.
L:  Do you watch --
R:  I've only --
L:  -- any other ones?
R:  -- watched, like -- what's that?
L:  Do you watch any other, um ...?
R:  I have actually watched, um, a couple, like, where the parents take your date and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  That actually was pretty fascinating, uh, and I watched the original one.  The MTV whatever it is.
L:  Oh, the Real World.
R:  Yeah.  The Real World.  Um, and it's in generally -- in general, it's kind of disappointing but I find myself watching it 'cause -- yeah, because it's real and because, you know, I -- I think people are definitely interested in -- in understanding, like, how the human mind works, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the ethos.  That's par- part of it.
L:  Do you feel, like, when you watch these shows, like, it's actually realistic?
R:  Um, no.  
L:  No. [MN]
R:  Because it's all edited, you know.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do -- I do on some level and then I -- in -- a lot of times, like, if I watched the MTV Real World --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- show, I'm just like, "Oh, life sucks" because it's so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- banal -- banal.  It's, like, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bottom of the rung [MN] as far as the ways we can interact with each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's --
L:  I sort of -- I find it, like, amazing that those --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people were so obnoxious and mean and, like, rude to each other when they knew they were on TV because I would think that, like, if I were being videotaped I couldn't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- be, like, that obnoxious because I would be, like, thinking about the fact that I was being videotaped and I wonder sometimes --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- if they did it, like, on purpose so that people would remember them, almost.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, like, we all remember Puck, right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, he was, like, the most obnoxious person ever to be on the Real World and that's, like, his claim to fame.
R:  Oh, wait, who?
L:  Puck.  Wasn't it -- maybe --
R:  Oh, you know what, I do remember that name though I -- yeah, I'm not a --
L:  You don't remember --
R:  -- big fan though.
L:  -- why.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see, he got exactly what he wanted.  He got --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to be famous for that, having people remember that he was a -- like, a jerk. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] That's funny.  Wow.  What did he look like?  I'm always [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Wha- what do I look like?
R:  No, what did Puck look like?
L:  What did he l- -- oh, okay.  I was, like --
R:  It gets worse --
L:  Um, he had sort of, like, funky blond hair.  Sort of, like, spikyish.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, he had, like, an eyebrow ring, I think.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  And he made, like, all these guest appearances on other shows after his Real World was over.
R:  Oh.
L:  Just like everybody, like --
R:  That's 'cause his Real World was over.  That's --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's back in our fake world now and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he's making TV appearances.
R:  Wow.  Interesting.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know, I mean, I think -- I think probably the participants are confused about what Real World is, you know, at that level.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Like, I didn't feel like very many of those people seemed to have, like, an intelligent seeming perspective on what they were doing.  Like, some of the shows, um -- I'm trying to think.  Like, they had something called The Mole for a while where it was like an actual game where, like, you were there with, like, twenty people and somebody is the spy and, like, isn't really playing the same game as everyone else.
R:  [MN]
L:  And you're supposed to try to figure out who it is.  And that seemed like cool because the people there were all, like, "No.  You know, I'm just here to play the game and you can't trust anyone because, like, that's the whole game but it's a game and we're trying to win money" and that seemed, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know, realistic to me.
R:  Right.  Interesting.  Realistic like ...?
L:  Well, it didn't seem like those people had forgotten that they were on TV.
R:  Right.  I see what you mean.  Mhm.  Although there's also -- what is that -- what is that other one?  There's Real World and then there's that one Road ... Rule --
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  I'm not -- I kinda like those ones.  I like that one because --
L:  Yeah.  Roa- -- yeah.  That's the same kind of thing like The Mole where there's, like, an actual game going on.  Something that they actually have to do.
R:  Yeah.  And then they actually, you know, have more of a chance for friendship.  It still gets kind of dramatic when they're all disappointed in each other for failing or whatever. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they, like, film them aside. [MN] I don't know, I have really mixed feelings about reality television.  Um, yeah.  Just because it's -- because it's -- just because of the authenticity of it, that's for sure. [MN]
L:  Um, like, you think it isn't?
R:  I -- I think that it's just really mixed and that you can't really tell, on some level.
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  Because --
L:  -- that, like, even if they're trying to make it, like, reality, like, there's no way that -- there's nobody who's going to act exactly the same way when --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they know somebody's taking a picture as they would if they were really, like, quote unquote, in their real lives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't think that it's possible to have, like, true reality television.
R:  Yeah.  Or mayb- -- I mean, maybe they get numb to it but, like -- especially, like, all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those bed scenes.  Like, come on. [LAUGH] 
L:  W- what scenes?
R:  And I'm, like -- all the bed scenes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it's just sick [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, like, that's what, like, they to tried to do with the Truman Show.  They tried to show, like, what it would be like if somebody actually didn't, like, know, I guess.  Did you see the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Truman Show.
R:  Yeah.  It was great.
L:  Yeah.  I really like that.  Um --
R:  Mm.
L:  I thought that was really, like, interesting 'cause, like, I don't think -- I mean, I don't know.  It's sort of, like, cool but, like, I think a lot of people would be really creeped out if that were actually going on.  We just wanna see, like, something that's, like, almost real. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  Well, I wouldn't wanna watch a show where it was really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody's life.  Like, that would -- I don't know.
R:  I'd probably end up watching it but I'd be horrified by it but the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- truth is -- is that I probably would watch it.
L:  I'd probably --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- watch it, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to see what it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- was like but I -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it would, like, bother me to watch it much because, like, if you start getting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- attached to the person, if you start, like, liking the person then you'd feel so bad for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, like, they have that life.
R:  Totally. [MN] Yeah.  It would be really weird.  It would be like [LAUGH] com- -- there'd be, like, [MN] guilty addicts to the show. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  Reality television.  It's funny 'cause I've always wanted to, um, do -- I love documentary work and I've always wanted to document, like, if I have kids and, like, really document that but I've started to realize, like, wow, the dangers of it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, because when they're little they don't know and they're not self conscious so if you grew up with a camera then --
L:  Yeah.  That's totally true.
R:  -- you know -- well, that you like it and then also it's really important for kids to have privacy too, so -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And anonymity so I don't know.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  My parents have a lot of videos of me as a little kid and, like, most of it's, like, fine but, like, I know they have pictures of me, like, pretty much naked that they've, like, shown to their friends and I'm, like, you know, "I know I'm a little kid but that's a little weird". [MN]
R:  Hm.
L:  But you -- I'm, like, three.  I'm not, like, a baby.  Like, I've still got -- I've got all the parts, you know. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Mm.  Yeah.  I don't know but I -- at the same time it's like -- I think it probably comes from partly 'cause I have hardly any photographs or anything.  I don't have any video footage at all so --
L:  Of, like, yourself as a little kid?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  So, it's, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gosh, I -- I'd love to have a picture of me --
L:  It is definitely fun --
R:  -- nude.
L:  -- to watch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, especially --
R:  But I wouldn't --
L:  -- 'cause you just totally don't remember at all what being that age is like.  It's like watching somebody else.  Actually, like, I recently watched a video of myself as a little kid and I didn't understand something I'd said.  Like, I didn't understand, like, what I meant and my brother actually figured out what I was talking about.  It was just --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- funny that, like, I was watching me and I was like, "What the hell do I mean by that?" [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then my brother's, like, "I think you meant, like, bubble car" and I was, like, "Oh" [LIPSMACK]
R:  Wow.
L:  It was sort of, like, strange.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause -- well, the thing about -- that's the thing, so, like -- because the camera can totally give you insight, right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into what it is to be human, but it's weird with reality shows because I don't think it's very effective. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  I think they've gotten sort of, like, carried away with making so many different, like, versions of, like, the reality shows.  I think that that happens, like, a lot with, like, genres of TV shows and then, like, all of a sudden, like, they just sort of scale it down and it's back to, like, the original and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, like, how many reality shows could you possibly watch?
R:  Right.  Well, there's a lot of, uh -- it's weird to hear there's a lot of other countries doing the reality shows, like, stranger, weirder versions. [LAUGH]
L:  Really.  That's really funny.
R:  Yeah.  I think, like, in Russia there was a -- just a woman's life and it was, like, everything.  Everything.
L:  Like, one woman?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like the, uh -- the Osbournes?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I [MN] do actually like that show. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?
R:  I do. [LAUGH]
L:  I've never --
R:  I [inaudible] a lot.
L:  -- really watched it.  I don't know enough about the Osbournes to appreciate it.
R:  I didn't really know much about them either.  I mean, I know about Ozzie but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- but it's, um -- I don't know.  It's sort of reminds me of my family in some weird way.
L:  Okay.
R:  [inaudible] Ozzie Osbourne.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, it's weird.  I don't know why I like it.  And it's kind of boring but it's kind of weird.  It's like -- it's weird because if you have a reality show in some regard and you turn it on and it's not particularly exciting or dramatic it's almost like you're -- they're in your living room [MN] or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really weird.  I don't know --
L:  Yeah.  It is really weird.
R:  -- I like -- I guess -- I guess I like it because they're alternative and, um, feels embarrassing to say there's a lot --
L:  [MN]
R:  But it's just like -- it's got, you know, rock star dad, you know --
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Of cour- -- it's definitely --
R:  -- being regular.
L:  -- like, it's interesting because you're watching, like --
