R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Heather.
L:  Hi, my name's Sheila.
R:  Hi, Sheila.  So, Sheila, do you watch, um, reality TV shows?
L:  I've watched The Osbournes.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I really like that one.
R:  I like The Osbournes too.  I don't know if that counts.  I guess that kind of counts.  I don't know how --
L:  I watched the first Survivor but not any of the rest of them.
R:  I don't watch them, any of them.  I -- I just don't understand.  I don't understand why people like them at all.
L:  Have you watched any part of any of them?
R:  [MN]  I've seen, like, maybe an episode or two of the first Survivor.  I could see doing it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I guess like [MN] well, not -- not Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? or anything, but Survivor, I -- I mean, I think it's interesting and I think it'd be kind of exciting [LIPSMACK] and I would want to be on it for a chance to win a lot of money and to do it.  But I -- but I don't -- I don't understand the appeal of watching other people do it.  I don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Would you feel odd about having everything taped?  I mean, having everything that you do taped and people seeing you at your worst or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I suppose so but ...
L:  I think that's why people watch.  I think people enjoy seeing other people at their worst. 
R:  I wonder how much of it really is, um, [LIPSMACK] how much of it's scripted, if at all.
L:  Ri-.
R:  Or if they encourage people to act certain ways.  I don't really know that much about it.  But, yeah, it's such melodrama, I think.
L:  I think it is scripted to a degree, and the editing.  Because, um, after the first Survivor there was a lot of articles about, ah, how the producers kind of went around and encouraged people to do the things they were doing or not to do --
R:  Really?
L:  -- the things they were doing.  So, in some ways it is manufactured for TV.
R:  [MN]
L:  But like the Osbournes, I think, you know, watching people in their own homes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or like the Big Brother show, which I never really liked.
R:  No, I never re- really saw that.
L:  Well --
R:  That's a bunch of people in a house, that's like the MTV show, right?
L:  Right.  Yeah, like I watched the MTV Real Word series.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so that's the same idea.  And that was pretty compelling because you get to see people fight with each other --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, the kind of gossiping that goes on.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know, I think maybe I like The Osbournes better because I don't see them as real people.  I mean, Ozzy Osbourne [LAUGH] he's -- he's not a real pe- you know what I mean?
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  He's kind of --
L:  It's very strange, but yes.
R:  -- this figure that, um, you don't see him as a normal person.  I mean, just, you don't see him like an every day person.  So, maybe that's why I separate that.  Yeah, he's --
L:  Yeah, it's almost a caricature of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of one's self.  Which I think maybe is why it's compelling is, you know, who is -- who are people really?  Who -- who is the individual and -- you know, in our every day lives we kind of do the same thing, you know?  You put on the public face to go to work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or to go to school and then there's the private you.  And, you know, being able to look in somebody else's private life is probably kind of interesting.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I guess maybe that's what it is that I don't buy into so maybe that's why it's not interesting to me.  I don't think it's real.  I don't think it's genuine so ...
L:  Well, that's the question.  Is anybody real?  Is anyone genuine?
R:  Oh, my [LAUGH].  That's a topic of conversation that I've had a couple of times this semester.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.  But, um, [MN] well, some [MN] We were tal- I took this class on creative and I don't know how we got on to, like, the subject of people who -- um, different personalities and how many per- like, how -- I think the question we were talking about, how many me's are there, you know?  I'm one person when I go to work.  I'm another person when I hang out with my friends.
L:  Right.
R:  Or, um, [LIPSMACK] see, I don't see it that way, though.  It think there's just one genuine you person and it's like how much you let other people see it, though, is what varies maybe.  So, I think [MN] I -- I don't know.  I guess what makes people genuine is when they're not trying to do anything.  Not trying to be funny.  Not trying to get a reaction.  They're just -- that's just -- they're just, you know?
L:  Right, which is why I think maybe we kind of hope that these reality shows will show us the real people.  You know, when you are out there in, ah -- where were they?  The first one of the island.
R:  Mhm, uh-huh.
L:  And they're starving and they're dirty and [LAUGH] you expect the real person to emerge or in your own home.
R:  That would -- yeah.
L:  And I think that's why we watch.  And I think your point is a good one that, you know, it's very scripted and it wouldn't get on TV unless it were entertaining.
R:  Do you think, um, people identify with it?  Or do you think that they don't identify with it and that -- that's why it's appealing too, it's something that they wouldn't do?  Or do you think they see themselves in it?
L:  I think a lot of people, especially in this generation, I'm not sure why, it seems to be getting more and more.  But people want to be on TV themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so they do kind of maybe imagine, "Oh, what if they were sh- you know, taping my life?"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, but in some ways I do think it's also like watching a car wreck, you know?  People are intrigued by other people, often most when things are going horribly wrong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when people are, you know, cursing and doing bad stuff and getting caught on camera, you know, all those TV shows were people are caught on camera doing really bad stuff.  Those are usually on Fox or --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- some cable show.
R:  I think I saw something on Fox not too long ago.  Like, something that you said made me think of, oh, that other TV show, and I didn't watch it either, the one -- the people singing.  It's a contest for American, or pop star, pop ... do you know what I'm talking about?
L:  The American Idol?
R:  Yeah, American Idol.  So, I saw something, it must have been on Fox where there was an audition and there was hundreds and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hundreds of people in Detroit and in California, just standing around waiting to get in and just showing up didn't guarantee they even got an audition.  But I was amazed, amazed.  There was hundreds of sixteen to, like, twenty year olds.
L:  Right, yeah.  [COUGH]  It is amazing.  It's almost as though, you know, people really just hope and pray that one day they'll be famous.  [LAUGH]  And, ah, you know, I just think that's very unrealistic and I don't know, really, why people would want to be famous.
R:  No, that's what I was thinking.  I don't think I'd think I'd want -- I wouldn't want that at all.
L:  Because then, you know, the -- the tabloids would be writing bad staff about --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about you and, you know, and none of it would be probably pleasant.  Because they, you know, Amer- American culture somewhat likes to build people up and then knock them down, which is kind of like all these reality shows.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, The Bachelor, which I didn't -- I couldn't stomach it at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, the whole idea is at the end -- the first one at the end, you know, he didn't really marry the person.  And, "Oh, he's a horrible person for that" and ...
R:  Um.
L:  Very bizarre.
R:  Well, yeah.  I was actually surprised because I remember after -- after the first show, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?  I think that was the first one like that.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And it didn't seem to do very well and people -- [LIPSMACK] a lot of people seemed to be upset about it.  So, I was surprised that they picked it up again.
L:  Right.
R:  And they're -- they keep going with it.
L:  And that the guy and the woman also who were on the original show, they've been on all the talk shows.  They've -- they've stayed in the media.
R:  Yeah, I did see -- I know the -- I forget her name right now, the first woman.  I know she's been in Playboy.  I saw her on some talk show.
L:  Right.
R:  And she's back in nursing and in Playboy and [SIGH] um.  I don't know.  If it makes her happy ...
L:  Did you ever see that movie, Notting Hill with --
R:  Um.
L:  -- Julia Roberts and --
R:  I did see it.
L:  -- Hugh Grant.
R:  And I -- oh, okay, you're right.  I did it see it, yeah.  She's an actress.
L:  Yeah.  There's a great scene in the movie where she starts -- she's talking about being famous and having -- every time her heart is broken it's on the tabloids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's entertainment.  And that's just sort of the kind of voyeurism I think these shows, you know, promote.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  People aren't really real.  Like, yeah their real people and it's reality, but it's not real.  Like you were saying, it's -- people sort of approach it in this very cold and callous and entertainment sort of way.  Whereas, you know, who would want their daughter to be on The Bachelor, you know?  Would you want your daughter --
R:  No.
L:  -- to go on a show like that?
R:  I suppose part of it is too -- is then [MN] if you are on that show you don't -- you're not expected to be yourself and so you don't have to be, and that way it's -- you can keep yourself emot- if you were famous I'm sure you would probably be very emotionally detached to the way you were presented or some situations you were in.  So, you can -- because you're acting and, um -- so maybe it's easy for people though.
L:  I think so.  I think that -- but again, I think people act in their every day lives as well, you know?  When you-
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're in school or you're with one group of friends you kind of -- you can modify how you come across and -- and then you emotionally distance yourself, if you want to, from, "Well, they didn't like me when I was that way, and that wasn't really me so it doesn't really count".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it's just little games people play with themselves, you know?  [LAUGH]  But in the end, ah, um, you know, it's up to each individual how much you do act in every day life.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, but I guess we're -- we -- still we watch these shows because we think in some ways that that's, "Ooh, we're going to see something very authentic in these people's lives".
R:  Mhm.  I'm trying to think about the TV shows that I watch and why I watch them and I really don't watch too many because -- I watch up -- do you know Twenty Four on Fox?
L:  I've heard of it and about it but I haven't watched it.
R:  I've see- I watch that and The Simpsons and that's about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you watch Friends?
R:  No.  Well, I've seen it, I've seen it a bunch of times, but I don't watch it frequently.
L:  I think people like that show because it's this -- this fantasy that most people have of having this in tact group of friends that everyone's there for each other and nobody's really out to do anyone harm.  [LAUGH]  And it really doesn't exist in real life.
R:  No, it's a kind of nice fantasy too, to be young and in New York and working in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- coffee shops and having nice apartments too and --
L:  Right, exactly.  And nobody moves away, nobody gets a job in another place.  And nobody steals anybody's boyfriend.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And everyone stays friends.  And, you know, that just doesn't happen.  And like The Bachelor, you know, there's this Cinderella fantasy of, "Oh, you'll grow up and marry a prince and, you know, he'll sweep you off your feet and everything will be happily every after" but, you know, it's a fantasy.
R:  I was just thinking about the -- another one that had, I think, maybe four women going to Alaska to choose a guy.
L:  Oh, I saw just a snippet of that one.
R:  I don't even know if it stayed on but there were maybe twenty guys and four women.  And it's kind of interesting too that the ones that are highly promoted are the -- the fairytale prince choosing.
L:  Right.
R:  The same story.  But, um, um, it's interesting that it doesn't switch genders --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- so easily.
L:  Yeah, 'cause
