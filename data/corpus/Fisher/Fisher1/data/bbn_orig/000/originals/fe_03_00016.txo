R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.  My name is Tracey.
L:  I'm Julie.
R:  Hi.  Um, as far as the topic goes, um, I don't get sick very often so it [LAUGH] doesn't really apply to me.
L:  Well, I don't really get sick often either, although this past weekend I -- I seem to have contracted a cough [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-oh [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  So, will you go to the doctor for it?
L:  Uh, definitely not.  I tend to [MN] not go to doctors [LAUGH] as often as I should.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't either and -- I've got two small kids and [MN] I agree with whatever that saying was that if I take the kids to the doctor they're still going to go through seven to ten days with a cold so it doesn't really matter either way and [MN] --
L:  Yeah.  I don't even take Sudafed or [MN] medicine usually becau- --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me neither.
L:  I actually think that it prevents you from getting, uh, better as quickly as you would without taking medicine.
R:  Sure.
L:  Because it just temporarily relieves you.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it keeps whatever's in you stuffed up your nose.
R:  Right [MN].
L:  But it's probably better to just blow your nose a lot and get it out and then [MN] you're done.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I will take the medicine sometimes if -- like, if I have to work, you know, if there's something I have to do that I have to get through it without, [MN] you know --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- coughing and sneezing the whole time but otherwise I --
L:  Right.  It's a temporary relief that prolongs it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it might be worth it in some situations [MN].
R:  Right.  Exactly.  So, I don't know how long we're supposed to talk for.
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oh, is it ten minutes?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You were listening better than I was [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was on hold for a really long time so I kind of spaced out for a while.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, it'll tell us when the call is over.
R:  Oh.  Have you been doing this for a while?
L:  This is my second call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I did one yesterday.
R:  Ok- -- oh.  That's kinda cool.  So, yeah, this is my first one so I didn't know, and we just keep talking about cold stuff or we talk about --
L:  And illness.
R:  And illness.  Yeah, I -- I don't know.  I don't -- I just don't get sick.  My husband doesn't get sick.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Where do you live?
L:  Um, I live right now in Philadelphia.  I'm a student.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I was just going to suggest, depending on what kind of seasons you have where you live, if the changes in weather cause sickness?
R:  Um [SIGH] I mean, they do, you know, with a lot of people, obviously, everyone's worried about the flu season coming but, um --
L:  Does it get -- I'm sorry, I don't even know the weather patterns in Wisconsin.  Does -- does it get cold in the winter and hot in the summer like usual or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like today it's about twenty degrees out.  Um, yeah, we get the typical -- I mean, Milwaukee is a little bit better because we're right on the lake so our winters are a little bit warmer than the wes- rest of the state, um, but it's, you know, everyone -- my husband and I get our flu shots every year so -- to help stay away from that but, uh, that's just because we work with oodles and oodles of people and [LAUGH] they all get sick and we don't want to get what they have.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, we get our flu shots so that, you know, hopefully our kids don't get anything.  They're not in daycare or anything yet so they've been pretty safe, um, my son will start pre school in the fall and I fear that he will end up getting sick, you know, getting colds and things, just --
L:  Right.
R:  Just being exposed to other kids, so I'm not looking forward to that but --
L:  When he's sick, like, would you keep him out of school or would you just give him medicine and send him to school?
R:  Um, I would keep him out.  I mean, ah, because I'm a teacher and I can't stand it when students come to class sick because all they do is get other kids sick.  So, if they'd just stay home even on -- even if it's just a day, just, you know, during the worst of it, they feel better and then they can come back and concentrate better.  Uh, it's just not worth it to, you know, especially while -- especially in pre school.  You know, it's not like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're going to miss that learning about the letter B today so you gotta go [LAUGH].  They can just get that another day.
L:  Right.
R:  So, no, I'm not gonna force my kids to -- to go and then get everybody else sick, it's -- which is part of the problem so -- do you have kids?  No.  You're --
L:  No. [LAUGH].
R:  No [LAUGH].  So -- so, yeah, I'm not gonna do that and my daughter is susceptible to ear infections so the last thing I want is to expose her to more of that stuff, but she won't be in pre school for two more years so I don't have anything to worry about there. [SIGH] So --
L:  For me, I live in a dormitory so it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- along the same lines as everyone going to class sick.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I mean, I -- I teach at a university and I'm amazed at how the students will just come to class sick as two dogs instead of just staying in their dorm or at their apartment or whatever and just get --
L:  Well, what I'm saying is that even if they stay in their apartment or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the dorm, we're all here [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.
L:  So, if someone in the hallway is sick, the rest of the hallway gets sick.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just remember last year I came down with pink eye and I was just flabbergasted.  I'm like, "How did I get pink eye?"  And it turns out about half the students in my class go, "Oh, I had it last week.  I had it yesterday" [LAUGH] I just [inaudible] and I'm like, "Why were you here giving me pink eye?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was so angry. [LAUGH]
L:  What do you teach?
R:  Um, actually, I teach linguistics [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that's why I wanted to help out with this study.  I'm curious as to what they're really looking for, you know.  Um, I teach things like the power of words and language and gender.
L:  Uh, I just took positive psychology last semester.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I know a little bit about it.
R:  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's really interesting so I'm -- I'm curious whenever they, you know, publish the results of the study which I'm sure will be years down the road but, um, I mean, obviously you've taken linguistics classes, you know, whatever they're looking for they're not telling us.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so I'm just curious as to what they're really trying to get at and if we're giving them good data [LAUGH].  So, I think it'll be -- it'll be fun to say you participated.  So, now, some of the topics on there, I think, are pretty interesting so I hope I get some of the, you know, hot topics that get people talking.
L:  Like illness [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting those colds as the seasons change [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't know what else to say about it.  Ten minutes is a long time to talk about colds [LAUGH].  I don't know.  Do you have anything else?
L:  Well, we can also talk about our thoughts on doctors.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  [MN]
R:  Doctors.  I don't know.  I -- I actually teach a class on, like, patient provider communications so I'm pretty hypercritical of doctors just, you know, if I have a hard time with them.  It's usually because of the communication problems.  You know, the coming in and them acting like God.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And them not realizing that I have a choice to go to them or somebody else and, you know, where I appreciate all the hard work they did to go through school and all that fun stuff, I still -- I am still, you know, [SIGH] the one making the choice to go to them.  So, I try to stay away from doctors as much as possible.
L:  Do you find that they make +misdiagnoses of sicknesses often, or not really?
R:  Um, not necessarily that, um.  I mean, if I were really sick I guess not kinda that I've been very, very lucky as to, um, being very healthy throughout my life but, um, I just -- I get frustrated with the power struggle, I guess.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess I'm thinking mainly of my kids.  My daughter was born with a congenital defect in her eye and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Does that mean we're done talking?
L:  No.  I'm sorry.  That's my other phone.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's -- and just dealing with surgeons and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, being her advocate as the parent is very trying.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know -- do you have to answer that?
L:  We're not supposed to [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, so, you know, I struggle with that, with dealing with that type of relationship.  I guess I'm not really thinking of me going to the doctor per se.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, although I guess when I was pregnant I was pretty -- I definitely wanted to go to doctors -- like, I was only going to let an OBGYN deliver my children who had -- who was a woman who had had children herself because I wanted somebody who had been through exactly what I was gonna go through.  You know, I --
L:  Right.
R:  Not that I have -- you know, male OBGYNs are fine, I'm sure, but I want people who relate to whatever it is.  So, when my daughter was born with this eye problem, you know, I wanted to go to doctors who could really relate to the problem to what was going on.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's not always easy to find that, of course, but -- so, I don't know, what about you?  What do you think of 'em?
L:  Um [NOISE] I just usually find that it's not worth my while to go to doctors.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not really because I don't trust them but more because I find that, you know, when I weigh the costs and benefits I don't really have time to take two hours out of my day to go see a doctor when the chances are that he'll probably just prescribe, you know, some sort of medication that I already plan on taking anyway [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  That sort of thing and I've had actually a lot of situations with +misdiagnoses so --
R:  Oh, that's not good.
L:  Last s- -- uh, year -- about a year ago from now, actually, I had problems with my left eye and I thought maybe I had pink eye.  I wasn't really sure what the problem was and I went to student health [LAUGH] and --
R:  Mm [LAUGH].
L:  And they told me that I had pink eye and they prescribed medication for it and a few weeks later my eye was still in terrible condition.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I went back and they were like, "Oh, you actually didn't have pink eye.  We think you have some sort of, um, cut on your eye.  Maybe you should go to the hospital and see what they think about it".
R:  Oh, my god [LAUGH].
L:  So, I went to the hospital and it turns out I had, um, an ulcer on my pupil.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And that was definitely not good because they said if I hadn't actually gone to them, like, that day or within that week I would have gone blind in my left eye.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah.  And that it was very, very --
