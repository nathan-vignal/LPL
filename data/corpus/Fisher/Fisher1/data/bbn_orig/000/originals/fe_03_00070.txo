L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Cross.
L:  I'm sorry.  What?
R:  I'm -- my name's Cross.
L:  Cross.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.  My name's Sarah.
R:  Hi, Sarah.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay. [MN]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's kind of a weird thing but --
L:  Yeah.  It is sort of an odd thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, reality television.
L:  Yeah.  Do you watch it?
R:  Um, no.
L:  No.  Yeah.  Me either.  I mean, I -- I've flicked by it.
R:  Mm.  My -- well, my -- my family does.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I get like the highlights.  Like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my brother and sister and my mom watch it.
L:  Oh, so you know people who -- yeah, I don't really even know people who watch it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kinda sad but, um --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, some of it's -- some of it's okay.  I mean, it depends on what they put under reality shows.  I mean, I certainly don't know if I'd watch Survivor.
R:  Mm.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But there are some game shows that sort of -- that are more reality like than others that I've -- that I've seen and I like.
R:  Do you know, like, any specific ones?
L:  Um, have you ever seen Junkyard Wars?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Oh, it's so -- it's a really funny British show.
R:  What's it -- what happens in it?
L:  Well, they have a, um -- they have a junkyard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they gather up two teams, one of 'em is usually a team that specializes in some engineering or mechanics or something like that and the other one is sort of randomly put together, often 'cause -- like, they're all wrestlers or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're asked to sort of create a machine out of parts that they find in the junk yard in about ten hours.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they then have to -- the next day they have competitions as to which machine works best --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- under the task.
R:  And they don't have any, like -- do they have a specific requirement of what sort of machine it's supposed to be or ...?
L:  Well, usually they define the task, like, okay, you have to build, um, um, something that -- some vehicle that travels up to a train track, sits on it and then travels along it for a specific distance.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you'll be judged on speed and distance and --
R:  Wow, this is much more creative than Survivor.  Like, ingenuity kind of exercise.
L:  Yeah.  It's really -- it's really fun to watch because it's sort of interesting to see how they come up with solutions --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- too.  They really describe -- they spend a l- -- more than half the show describing how they come up with the plan of what they wanna make and actually actualize it.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's -- it's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there's one for kids on, like, Saturday mornings, um --
R:  I --
L:  -- that's American.  But I -- I have never seen that one.
R:  Saturday morning.  I don't -- I've never seen it either.  I don't know.  I've seen -- I mean, I've seen an episode of Survivor twice.
L:  The same episode twice?
R:  No, not the same one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Like, two different Survivor groups, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they do like Survivor Africa, Survivor Australia, or whatever.
L:  Huh.
R:  And I've seen two different ones but that's only one episode of each.
L:  Only one episode of each.
R:  And they were both the last episode. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.  There -- there's a lot of hype surrounding the last episodes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, my family gets really into it [LAUGH] like, they'll -- like, of course they're going to root for, like, whoever they like but they just -- like, they'll scream at the -- at the people who are, like, against their favorite person and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're crazy. [LAUGH] It's -- it's like a sport.
L:  Well, I mean, honestly, it's not like -- it's not that much different than, say, watching a sports event.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  So -- so, it's not like -- I mean, if you enjoy it, then I think it's fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think it's interesting though --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like when -- when -- when we were in -- we were in Germany two years ago, living in Germany, and they came up with Big Brother.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It must have been -- well, they didn't come up with it.  I mean, it was -- it's, like, Dutch I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, but they started the season and there was a lot of press in Germany about whether or not it was ethical to put these people on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- television in this somewhat caged setting.
R:  Aren't they volunteering though?
L:  Yep.  They volunteer and they win lots of money for it but Germans are very careful about treatment of others.
R:  Well, that makes sense too.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And they're -- they're also really, really, uh, easily pulled into random intellectual discussions. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, they had lots and lots of discussions on it.  And -- but the actual show turned out to be a huge hit, just absolutely gigantic.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  And then they did Survivor a little bit after that and it --
R:  The German version --
L:  -- totally flopped.
R:  -- Survivor?
L:  Mm?
R:  German version Survivor?
L:  Yeah.  The -- pretty much the same thing.  They called it something like Go to an Island or --
R:  So, it did the opposite of here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because Big Brother was not very big here.
L:  Right.
R:  And Survivor was huge.
L:  Yeah.  And I --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- wonder why that is.  Like, I mean, to some extent it probably has to do with the fact of which came out first.
R:  Mm.  That -- that's true.  Um, I don't know, what are -- what are the elements of -- of Big Brother?  They're just kind of, like, a bunch of people in a house with cameras.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is sort of like -- except they can't -- I mean, it's like, um --
R:  I was going to say it's like Real World but --
L:  Yeah.  It's like Real Wor- -- World but they can't get out.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  And they have to do various tasks in order to m- make enough money to supply their house with food and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, sometimes they have to raise chickens --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- or --
R:  I wonder if there is a cultural thing about that that's -- makes it so different, between the two.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't -- I -- I don't see it if there is.
L:  I'm thinking that it might have something to do with what is allowed to be shown, how much.
R:  Oh.
L:  Maybe.
R:  [MN] Mm.
L:  In -- in America, somehow the context of Survivor being out somewhere, it -- it'll -- it'll -- that's not in a normal domestic situation that allows, um, them to take a little bit more liberty with what they're allowed to show.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and in Germany you can just show anything all the time.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, you know, sh- -- and they -- they'll even advertise later they started, like, doing, like, Girls' House so they just had a bunch of girls and really the main premise was, like, get old men to watch women in the shower together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause they could.  Right?
R:  Wow.
L:  [MN] It wasn't -- it was -- in America, I think, they may not show the showers often or if they do then the contestants all wear all their clothes all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  But, so I think that -- that might be -- I think that's sort of the thing that pulls people into Survivor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's 'cause -- it sort of puts --
R:  Well, it distances you from it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It allows you -- and it allows you to see people doing things that have some sort of semblance of --
R:  Mm.  Yeah. [MN]
L:  -- I don't know, true interaction.
R:  Yeah.  They're -- well, also they're not ki- -- they're not in a societal setting so they're not necessarily governed by the principles of society.  Like, they're kind of in their own -- they have to formulate their own, like, way of living.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.  Now I think I like it more than I used to. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Intellectualize it and then it's more interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I don't know.  I still -- I -- I guess I don't have m- -- the -- my main reason for not watching it is I usually either don't watch television on the nights stuff like that is on or there's something else that I'm already watching.
R:  I watch Friends and Will and Grace that night so --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's -- yeah.  I'm -- I'm a big fan of those too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although Fr- -- Will and Grace has had too many very special Will and Grace episodes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this -- this season but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I still like it.  Yeah.
R:  Um, oh, I forgot what I was -- I just thought of something else, like, that really appeals, um -- one of the questions wasn't it that what was the appeal of ... oh, I had the thing.  Oh.  I lost it.
L:  Yeah.  I never remember what the robot voice asks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Asks. [LAUGH]
R:  You ha- have to wonder about the guy that just sits there and reads off those things.
L:  I think it's a computer.  I think the --
R:  Do you think so?
L:  -- computer -- yeah.  I think it is.  I -- I don't know though.  I mean, I've only --
R:  Like, maybe, like, the guy records it.
L:  Yeah.  That's probably what it is.  In the -- in the -- in the -- 'cause there's like a shift in the voice tone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I think that they -- it -- it reads a certain script and then it adds in certain elements --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when necessary.
R:  Like -- like when you say, like, "You have called eight nine five" or whatever, like that.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Yeah.  How did you learn about this?
R:  Um, I'm taking a linguistics course, actually, right now.
L:  Oh, where?
R:  Um, Harvard.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's sort of how I learned it.  My boy -- about it.  My boyfriend is a linguistics graduate student.
R:  Oh.
L:  At Ohio State University.
R:  Oh, okay.  Are you in Ohio?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] That's fun. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  It's okay right now.  I -- I -- I guess living would be like quite a stretch of the imagine since I really only sit in front of my computer and write. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Are you a writer?
L:  Um, no.  I'm working on my dissertation.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, theoretically, I sit in front of my computer and write. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Often I just sit in front of my computer. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Some -- sometimes just nothing comes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.  What do you study at Harvard?
R:  Um, I am undecided at the moment.
L:  Undecided.
R:  Um, I'm debating whether I should go to med school or law school.  So ...
L:  Wow.
R:  That's always fun.
L:  Yeah.  How long do you have to decide?
R:  Um, I have a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a few years.  So --
L:  You just started?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Cool.
R:  Very much.
L:  Do you like Boston?
R:  Um, I love it.  I mean, I'm from New England originally anyway.
L:  Where in New England?
R:  Connecticut.
L:  Connecticut?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I miss New England.  I went to school at Smith.
R:  Oh, really.  I have a friend who goes there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Both of my little sisters go there right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, little.  They're not little any more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Keep forgetting that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was like, hm. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Both of my sisters go there. [LAUGH] One's a first year, 'cause they don't say freshman, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, the other one's a sophomore.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I love New England and I grew up mostly in Vermont.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Every once in a while -- uh, parts I was in other places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, mostly, I would say, like, if you had to pick one place I grew up it would be Vermont.
R:  Yeah.  Was it Summit Row[?], Vermont, or was it ...?
L:  Yes.  Well, both.  Um, I -- first Bennington, Vermont.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, southern Vermont and then later my mother moved up to outside of Montpelier, Vermont.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that was more rural.
R:  Mm.  It's sad.  I've never -- I -- I mean, I live in New England and I've never been to Vermont.
L:  Oh.  Oh, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should take a --
R:  I've been --
L:  -- road trip.
R:  -- to New Hampshire and I've been to Maine but I've never been to Vermont.
L:  Oh.  With -- with all the free time I'm sure you have [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] take a -- take a road trip up to, like, uh -- B- Burlington is just a gorgeous --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- place to be.
R:  Well, um, a guy in our hallway is from Vermont so probably -- we have something called intersession and we go do whatever we want so we're going to go to Vermont and visit him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That should be fun.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- I miss it so much.  I mean, I -- I -- I've like -- I'm -- I like all of New England but I'm very partial to Vermont. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. [MN] But, um, yeah, no.  I moved -- actually I was sort of freaked.  I -- I was at Smith and then all of a sudden they -- I got into a mid western school.  I actually app- -- go to Washington University in St. Louis.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  Missouri.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm going to the Mid West". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [MN]
