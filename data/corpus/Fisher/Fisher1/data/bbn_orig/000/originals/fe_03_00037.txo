L:  Hi, my s- -- I'm Samir Jan[?], uh, I live in Ohio city.
R:  Hi, Samir.  This is Fox at Chester[?] Networks in Kansas.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello. [MN]
L:  Hi.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  [MN] Yeah.  I cannot hear you clearly.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, give me a second here.  Let me adjust this [MN].  Can you hear me better now?
L:  Yeah.  Yes.  Sort of.
R:  Right.   I'm kinda leaning out of a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- phone --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --
R:  -- cabinet.
L:  [MN] No.
R:  Um [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, so [LAUGH] how is it in your city right now?  Is it -- is it really cold?
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I haven't been outside in about a day and a half.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- I live in a city and it's pretty cold.  I do realize that as the seasons change the p- -- a lot of people do -- I myself find I have a tendency of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting allergies as the seasons change.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I really don't see that much of a difference.  It's --
L:  No.  Yeah.  Probably [LAUGH] you are used to all the seasons.  I -- I -- I've been living in Ohio city for, uh now al- almost three years now so I'm not used to that much of cold and so when it gets -- really when it gets cold I really do feel it on my body and I do get allergies, cold.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's, um [MN] -- it's mainly -- my take on it is people get more colds during the winter it's because they're inside with other people a lot more, like at the shopping mall and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I suppose so, yeah [LAUGH] yeah, tha- -- I also agree to that.
R:  [NOISE] The thing is -- it's not -- I don't -- I don't see it as the weather.  I see it as just, you now, um, lifestyle changes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like --
L:  Yeah.  I do realize but I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also feel sometimes that they are -- people are also sometimes more prone to allergies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I have other f- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- members in my family and it's only me that I seem to get allergies when the seasons change and I am always, I think, at least for ten or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eleven hours in a -- a day I am with my family members and th- they never seem to get the allergies so I think that people are also kind of prone to allergies and some people -- others just aren't.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- it's the conditions like the plants and animals changing for the winter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like [MN] -- like, between winter and spring the trees are releasing all this pollen and, you know, it's mainly [MN] -- so, that's mainly when I head inside.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Even the [SIGH] -- the cold -- the cold thing that it asked me to -- asked us to talk about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um [MN] I -- I -- you know, I -- I really don't go to the doctor for colds, like [MN] I'll just -- I'll just come into work and be sick as opposed to going to the doctor and sitting in the waiting room and him telling me to go home and be sick.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I also -- I do get allergies.  I'm really prone to allergies and I do get allergies but I rarely go to the doctor for the allergies either.  Uh, some -- try some --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- drinking more sort of liquids because I do feel that I know that doctors also they don't have any remedies.  They would just either prescribe, uh, anti allergic or something like that or nas- nasal dis- decongestant and they also prescribe just more -- drink more liquid so I -- I would rather just -- now I'm used to it and I know what to do so I just stay home or [NOISE] take more liquids and try --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be normal and not get really upset with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- allergies and I -- I'd sort of like to overcome the allergies.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I -- I -- I'm allergic to cats and stuff but [MN] I g- -- the trees really don't do anything to me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's I think a different kind of, uh, allergy that y- you -- you can't do anything, just stay away from cats.  But these seasonal allergies I think you have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this tendency once a- after --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- two or three years, so you know what -- what kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- allergies you have and what kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- precautions you can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take or what really helps so -- because many a times in colds I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- feel that drinking something hot, coffee or coke [MN] th- that really helps.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you can just see I -- I -- now I know as soon as I start feeling, uh, something is g- going to be wrong tomorrow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just start taking more liquids and I also sort of try to minimize the effect of allergies.
R:  I mean, that's why I don't do anything because I drink like three pots of coffee a day. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  When I have allergies like this really, uh, then I go for three or four teas a day.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Normally I take, yeah, one cup of tea a day but when I have allergies I sort of go three or four times more.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  It's like -- [MN] yeah, at work my desk is right next to the coffee pot so it's [MN] --
L:  Oh, wow [MN] that must be a lot of very, very [MN] convenient.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- it'd be -- it'd be interesting to find out if more people get sick because, um, the mother in law is coming over.
L:  Ooh. [LAUGH] I don't think that would be any -- if that was the case, I -- I don't even think that lots of people who'd likely do that.
R:  [MN] All right.  Do y- -- do you get sick because of your mother in law?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I --
L:  Nobody would --
R:  -- I run.
L:  Nobody would dare [MN] to c- -- confess that.
R:  [MN] Or do -- do you get -- do you get sick because you ate grandma's turkey?
L:  Oh, no.  Actually.  I'm total complete vegetarian so I don't even know.  I never --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- even tried turkey.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I -- I try -- I try and avoid the turkey --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like -- you -- you see me, like, on Thanksgiving, I'll be -- I'll be sitting there eating the salad and everybody's eating the turkey.  I'm like --
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm -- I'm the only one three days later that's still on its feet.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] Yeah.  So, uh, are you saying your table is right beside the cof- coffee machine?  So, do you feel some effects that, uh, people just -- if they are more sick they are m- -- they make more visits to the coffee pot or something like that or do you --
R:  Um --
L:  -- just feel that it's normal the people who are close tend to -- tend to take three or four cups of coffee.  They just go for the normal when they are sick or not?
R:  I usually work odd shifts so I never see.  I moved my desk next to the coffee pot so I'm not walking back and forth across the office all night.
L:  Oh, yeah. [MN]
R:  So, like, like, the day shift comes in, they're like, "Why is this desk here?"
L:  Oh.
R:  "Why are all these empty foam cups on the floor all bitten?"
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  "Who's that asleep under the desk?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] This thing seems to -- the -- this automated thing seems to know right when I'm about to go to the bathroom too.
L:  Oh, really. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Like, I -- I'm getting ready to go to the bathroom and the -- the phone starts ringing.  I'll pick it up and, oh, damn it.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  You know, it's ten bucks a call [LAUGH]
L:  OH. [LAUGH] So, you must be pre- -- feeling pretty uncomfortable right now?
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I'm trying to be polite because this is a call to [inaudible] being polite and not heading down there but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It'd makes something interesting for their study.  "Mm.  This person seems --"
L:  Yeah.  I hope it helps.
R:  "-- to have gone to the bathroom". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE] Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, I -- I just came to know today about this study and just, okay, I thought it would be something interesting and might be it could help them so I just volunteered for that. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it -- it's something where a whole bunch of us down here at the office, uh -- someone put up a flyer about it.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, you just -- [inaudible] ought to do this and, just as a joke, see if any of us get each other.
L:  Boy.  Oh, I see. [MN] So, where do you work?
R:  Uh, it's a -- it's a provider of telecom services that, you know, we -- we work with, like, MCI and Sprint to provide the network infrastructure.
L:  Oh.  I see.  So, how did this thing get -- get to your place, workplace?
R:  Uh, probably someone found it on the internet.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I -- I am --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] in Ohio city and sort of -- since one of my brothers is taking a path[?] -- he's a member of this city or something like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he forwarded the email to me and that's how I ended up over here. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- [MN] oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] It's -- just one -- one of those weird things like -- like the time I had to give TV ratings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that was weird. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  That -- [MN]
L:  So, do you like winters or do you like s- summers more?
R:  I like spring and fall because then, you know, it's a nice temperature up on top of a phone pole as opposed to it being, you know, three hundred below or three hundred above.
L:  Oh, yeah.  So --
R:  C- -- c- --
L:  Do -- do you like something -- like, here it should be always like spring or fall throughout the years because I --
R:  It's --
L:  -- really -- I like -- though I get sick but I really like that's to -- changes in the weather and changes in the climate.  I like to have different seasons.
R:  Yeah.  I'm more partial to spring because there's no squirrels up on the -- up on the boxes on the poles.
L:  Oh.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [MN] I don't think this thing can count time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It was supposed to be ten minutes.  I think it's passed --
R:  Yeah.  My -- my -- my cellphone says it's been eleven minutes and fifty three seconds.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  Yes.  It's probably the missed time.
R:  [MN] What -- what's kind of ironic is that my mom makes me hug her cats even though she knows I'm allergic to 'em.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I don't even know what to talk [MN] -- I'm running out of conversation.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah.  Like, you know -- you know what I think this is for, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is so the government can listen in on our phone calls and tell if we're smuggling nuclear weapons. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And inst- -- and instead of having the little FBI guy in the truck with the headset, have a computer doing all of it.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Maybe.
R:  [MN] The -- the website's quite, uh -- quite informative.
L:  Which website.
R:  Uh, the website for this project.
L:  Oh, uh, I didn't really go to the website.  I just said --
