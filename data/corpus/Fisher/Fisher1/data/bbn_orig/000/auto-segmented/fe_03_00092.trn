HELLO  (fe_03_00092-A-0001)
HI MY NAME'S SHEILA  (fe_03_00092-A-0002)
I'VE WATCHED THE OSBOURNES  (fe_03_00092-A-0003)
I REALLY LIKE THAT ONE  (fe_03_00092-A-0004)
I WATCHED THE FIRST SURVIVOR BUT NOT ANY OF THE REST OF THEM  (fe_03_00092-A-0005)
HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY PART OF ANY OF THEM  (fe_03_00092-A-0006)
OH REALLY  (fe_03_00092-A-0007)
WOULD YOU FEEL ODD ABOUT HAVING EVERYTHING TAPED I MEAN HAVING EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO TAPED AND PEOPLE SEEING YOU AT YOUR WORST OR  (fe_03_00092-A-0009)
I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WATCH I THINK PEOPLE ENJOY SEEING OTHER PEOPLE AT THEIR WORST  (fe_03_00092-A-0010)
THINK IT IS SCRIPTED TO A DEGREE AND THE EDITING BECAUSE UM AFTER THE FIRST SURVIVOR THERE WAS A LOT OF ARTICLES ABOUT  (fe_03_00092-A-0012)
AH HOW THE PRODUCERS KIND OF WENT AROUND AND ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO DO THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING OR NOT TO DO THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING  (fe_03_00092-A-0013)
SO IN SOME WAYS IT IS MANUFACTURED  (fe_03_00092-A-0014)
FOR T._V.  (fe_03_00092-A-0015)
BUT LIKE THE OSBOURNES I THINK YOU KNOW WATCHING PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR LIKE THE BIG BROTHER SHOW WHICH I NEVER REALLY LIKED  (fe_03_00092-A-0016)
RIGHT YEAH LIKE I WATCHED THE M._T._V. REAL WORD SERIES  (fe_03_00092-A-0018)
AND SO THAT'S THE SAME IDEA  (fe_03_00092-A-0019)
AND THAT WAS PRETTY COMPELLING  (fe_03_00092-A-0020)
BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE PEOPLE FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER  (fe_03_00092-A-0021)
AND UH THE KIND OF GOSSIPING THAT GOES ON  (fe_03_00092-A-0022)
YES YEAH IT'S VERY STRANGE BUT YES  (fe_03_00092-A-0023)
YEAH IT'S ALMOST A CARICATURE OF OF ONE'S SELF  (fe_03_00092-A-0024)
WHICH I THINK MAYBE IS WHY IT'S COMPELLING IS YOU KNOW WHO IS WHO ARE PEOPLE REALLY WHO WHO IS THE INDIVIDUAL AND YOU KNOW IN OUR EVERY DAY LIVES WE KIND OF  (fe_03_00092-A-0025)
DO THE SAME THING YOU KNOW YOU PUT ON THE PUBLIC FACE TO GO TO WORK OR TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THEN THERE'S THE PRIVATE YOU AND YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO LOOK IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S PRIVATE LIFE IS  (fe_03_00092-A-0026)
PROBABLY KIND OF INTERESTING  (fe_03_00092-A-0027)
WELL THAT'S THE QUESTION IS ANYBODY REAL IS ANYONE GENUINE  (fe_03_00092-A-0028)
REALLY  (fe_03_00092-A-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00092-A-0030)
RIGHT WHICH IS WHY I THINK MAYBE WE KIND OF HOPE THAT THESE REALITY SHOWS WILL SHOW US THE REAL PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE IN AH WHERE WERE THEY THE FIRST ONE OF THE ISLAND AND  (fe_03_00092-A-0031)
THEY'RE STARVING AND THEY'RE DIRTY AND [LAUGHTER] YOU EXPECT THE REAL PERSON TO EMERGE  (fe_03_00092-A-0032)
OR IN YOUR OWN HOME  (fe_03_00092-A-0033)
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE WATCH AND I THINK YOUR POINT IS A GOOD ONE THAT  (fe_03_00092-A-0034)
YOU KNOW IT'S VERY SCRIPTED AND IT WOULDN'T GET ON T._V. UNLESS IT WERE ENTERTAINING  (fe_03_00092-A-0035)
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_00092-A-0036)
ESPECIALLY IN THIS GENERATION I'M NOT SURE WHY IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE AND MORE BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON T._V. THEMSELVES AND SO THEY DO KIND OF MAYBE IMAGINE OH WHAT IF THEY WERE SH- YOU KNOW TAPING MY LIFE  (fe_03_00092-A-0037)
UM BUT IN SOME WAYS I DO THINK IT'S ALSO LIKE WATCHING A CAR WRECK YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE INTRIGUED BY OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_00092-A-0038)
OFTEN MOST WHEN THINGS ARE GOING HORRIBLY WRONG  (fe_03_00092-A-0039)
AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW CURSING AND DOING BAD STUFF AND GETTING CAUGHT ON CAMERA YOU KNOW ALL THOSE T._V. SHOWS WERE  (fe_03_00092-A-0040)
PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT ON CAMERA DOING REALLY BAD STUFF  (fe_03_00092-A-0041)
THOSE ARE USUALLY ON FOX OR  (fe_03_00092-A-0042)
SOME CABLE SHOW  (fe_03_00092-A-0043)
THE AMERICAN IDOL  (fe_03_00092-A-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00092-A-0045)
RIGHT YEAH [COUGH] IT IS AMAZING IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH  (fe_03_00092-A-0046)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE REALLY JUST HOPE AND PRAY THAT ONE DAY THEY'LL BE FAMOUS [LAUGHTER] AND AH YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THAT'S VERY UNREALISTIC AND I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHY PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO BE FAMOUS  (fe_03_00092-A-0047)
BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW THE THE TABLOIDS WOULD BE WRITING BAD STAFF ABOUT  (fe_03_00092-A-0048)
ABOUT YOU AND  (fe_03_00092-A-0049)
YOU KNOW AND NONE OF IT WOULD BE PROBABLY PLEASANT  (fe_03_00092-A-0050)
BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW AMER- AMERICAN CULTURE SOMEWHAT LIKES TO BUILD PEOPLE UP AND THEN KNOCK THEM DOWN  (fe_03_00092-A-0051)
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE ALL THESE REALITY SHOWS  (fe_03_00092-A-0052)
YOU KNOW THE BACHELOR WHICH I DIDN'T I COULDN'T STOMACH IT AT ALL BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE IDEA IS AT THE END THE FIRST ONE AT THE END YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T REALLY MARRY THE PERSON  (fe_03_00092-A-0053)
AND OH HE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON FOR THAT AND  (fe_03_00092-A-0054)
VERY BIZARRE  (fe_03_00092-A-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00092-A-0057)
AND THAT THE GUY AND THE WOMAN ALSO WHO WERE ON THE ORIGINAL SHOW THEY'VE BEEN ON ALL THE TALK SHOWS THEY'VE THEY'VE STAYED IN THE MEDIA  (fe_03_00092-A-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00092-A-0059)
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT MOVIE NOTTING HILL  (fe_03_00092-A-0060)
WITH JULIA ROBERTS AND  (fe_03_00092-A-0061)

BEING FAMOUS AND HAVING  (fe_03_00092-A-0064)
EVERY TIME HER HEART IS BROKEN IT'S ON THE TABLOIDS  (fe_03_00092-A-0065)
AND IT'S ENTERTAINMENT AND THAT'S JUST SORT OF THE KIND OF VOYEURISM I THINK THESE SHOWS  (fe_03_00092-A-0066)
YOU KNOW PROMOTE PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY REAL LIKE YEAH THEIR REAL PEOPLE AND IT'S REALITY BUT IT'S NOT REAL LIKE YOU WERE SAYING IT'S  (fe_03_00092-A-0067)
PEOPLE SORT OF APPROACH IT IN THIS VERY  (fe_03_00092-A-0068)
COLD AND CALLOUS AND ENTERTAINMENT SORT OF WAY  (fe_03_00092-A-0069)
WHEREAS YOU KNOW WHO WOULD WANT THEIR DAUGHTER TO BE ON THE BACHELOR  (fe_03_00092-A-0070)
YOU KNOW WOULD YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER  (fe_03_00092-A-0071)
TO GO ON A SHOW LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00092-A-0072)
I THINK SO I THINK THAT BUT AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE ACT IN THEIR EVERY DAY LIVES AS WELL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU-  (fe_03_00092-A-0073)
YOU'RE IN SCHOOL OR YOU'RE WITH ONE GROUP OF FRIENDS YOU KIND OF YOU CAN MODIFY HOW YOU COME ACROSS  (fe_03_00092-A-0074)
AND AND THEN YOU EMOTIONALLY DISTANCE YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO  (fe_03_00092-A-0075)
FROM WELL THEY DIDN'T LIKE ME  (fe_03_00092-A-0076)
WHEN I WAS THAT WAY AND THAT WASN'T REALLY ME SO IT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT  (fe_03_00092-A-0077)
YEAH IT'S JUST LITTLE GAMES PEOPLE PLAY WITH THEMSELVES YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] BUT IN THE END AH  (fe_03_00092-A-0078)

YOU WATCH FRIENDS  (fe_03_00092-A-0084)
I THINK PEOPLE LIKE THAT SHOW BECAUSE IT'S THIS THIS FANTASY THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE OF HAVING THIS IN TACT GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT EVERYONE'S THERE FOR EACH OTHER AND NOBODY'S REALLY OUT TO DO ANYONE HARM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00092-A-0085)
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T EXIST IN REAL LIFE  (fe_03_00092-A-0086)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00092-A-0087)
RIGHT EXACTLY AND NOBODY MOVES AWAY NOBODY GETS A JOB IN ANOTHER PLACE AND NOBODY STEALS ANYBODY'S BOYFRIEND  (fe_03_00092-A-0088)
AND EVERYONE STAYS FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN  (fe_03_00092-A-0089)
AND LIKE THE BACHELOR YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS CINDERELLA FANTASY OF OH  (fe_03_00092-A-0090)
