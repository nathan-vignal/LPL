SO I ENDED BEING IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND I KINDA SO THAT'S WHEN I STOPPED GOING TO DOCTORS ALTOGETHER AND JUST TRY TO GO TO A HOLISTIC HEALER  (fe_03_00036-A-0045)

AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS KINDA SILLY BUT I BELIEVE IN IT AND IT WORKS FOR ME SO I GUESS THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS  (fe_03_00036-A-0070)
UM BUT I'VE I WENT ON A TRIP WITH HER AND WHILE WE WERE WE WERE DRIVING WE PLAYED A TAPE ABOUT A WOMEN WHO HAD GONE AND STAYED WITH THE ABORIGINES  (fe_03_00036-A-0071)
AND SHE WAS SAYING ABOUT THEIR THEY HAVE ALL THE HOLISTIC HEALING AND ONE ABORIGINE ON THIS WALK HAD BROKEN HIS LEG AND THEY THEY DID WHAT THEY DO TO FIX IT AND HE WAS FIXED WITH AND THE NEXT DAY HE GOT UP AND WALKED AGAIN  (fe_03_00036-A-0072)
AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOSPITALS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT CASTS ARE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT X RAYS ARE AND I MEAN THE HEALING PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT  (fe_03_00036-A-0073)
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE HOLISTIC THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE HOLISTIC LIKE THE SHAMAN AND THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND AND ALL THAT I MEAN IT'S IN ALMOST EVERY DIFFERENT REGION IN EVERY DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURE AND RELIGION  (fe_03_00036-A-0074)
AND I MEAN THEY HAVE THEIR BELIEFS AND THEY USE ALL NATURAL THINGS FROM THE EARTH AND I REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT HEALS US AND MAKES US BETTER AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00036-A-0075)
THE SCIENTIFIC MEDICINES SO I'VE HAD REALLY GOOD LUCK WITH GOING AND HAVING HERBS AND THAT KIND OF THING DONE  (fe_03_00036-A-0076)
SO AND LIKE I SAID I MEAN AFTER ONE EXPERIENCE WHERE A DOCTOR PUT ME INTO A HOSPITAL [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00036-A-0077)
I THOUGHT WELL THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT [LAUGHTER] THIS CAN'T BE GOOD AT ALL AND THEN I WAS UPSET TOO BECAUSE AFTER I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM THEY COULDN'T REALLY GIVE ME AN EXACT ANSWER AND I HAD BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT LONG AND I WAS EXHAUSTED AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY NOT FEELING WELL  (fe_03_00036-A-0078)
AND THEY REALLY COULDN'T GIVE ME A STRAIGHT HONEST ANSWER AND THEN TILL SOMEONE FINALLY CAME AND SAID WELL I THINK YOU YOU KNOW BECAUSE ANTIBIOTICS ARE POISON I THINK YOU WERE POISONED BY 'EM  (fe_03_00036-A-0079)

I DIDN'T GO TO A DOCTOR I DIDN'T GET THE FLU SHOT IN FACT I JUST I I'M USUALLY HESITANT OF ALL THIS  (fe_03_00036-B-0006)
UM THIS WHOLE MEDICINE THING ITSELF SO I USUALLY AVOID AND I BELIEVE THAT I'M PRETTY ROBUST SO I DON'T REALLY FALL SICK SO OFTEN  (fe_03_00036-B-0007)
AND SO MY STRATEGY IS DO NOTHING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00036-B-0008)
VERY LITTLE VERY LITTLE I I AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I HAVE THIS  (fe_03_00036-B-0009)
IDEA THAT THIS WHOLE UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0010)
INTRODUCING THESE UNNATURAL CHEMICALS IN YOUR BODY IS NOT A GOOD THING [MN] FOR THE MOST PART UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY [MN] UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0011)
YOU REALLY ARE IN A POSITION THAT YOU CAN'T HELP IT SO I I USUALLY IT'S NOT THAT I HAVE GOT ANYTHING AGAINST SCIENCE OR MEDICINE IT'S JUST THAT I USUALLY AVOID  (fe_03_00036-B-0012)

RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0025)
RIGHT IT DOES I MEAN I JUST GOT LAST WEEK I HAD I WAS ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR THE LAST LIKE FOUR DAYS AND IT I I'M A LITTLE OBSTINATE ABOUT IT I GUESS I COULD HAVE  (fe_03_00036-B-0026)
UH TAKEN MEDICINE EARLIER BUT I JUST REFUSED TO AND BECAUSE I THINK IN IN TIME IT ANYWAY GOES AWAY AND ULTIMATELY THE NATURAL THINGS LIKE DRINKING A LOT OF FLUIDS AND DRINKING LIKE TEA AND STUFF LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00036-B-0027)
THAT IS USUALLY MY FIX TO IT BUT MAYBE I MEAN IS THE QUESTION MORE GENERAL THAN JUST THINGS LIKE COLDS  (fe_03_00036-B-0029)
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY WANT US TO TALK OKAY  (fe_03_00036-B-0031)
UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0032)
NO NO DO YOU  (fe_03_00036-B-0033)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00036-B-0035)
RIGHT RIGHT I I HAVEN'T FELT THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE DOCTOR CAN FIX THAT  (fe_03_00036-B-0036)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0037)
WELL THESE ARE LIKE REALLY HEAVY LIGHTS ON YOUR DESK SO YOU FEEL THAT THERE WAS DAY  (fe_03_00036-B-0039)
NOW THESE ARE REALLY POWERFUL LIGHTS THAT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL THAT THERE WAS A DAY OUTSIDE  (fe_03_00036-B-0040)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00036-B-0041)
[MN] SOUNDS STRANGE ACTUALLY I  (fe_03_00036-B-0042)
I HAVE A REALLY STRANGE  (fe_03_00036-B-0043)
THEORY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_00036-B-0044)
UM YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PLACEBO EFFECT RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0045)
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY DO IS  (fe_03_00036-B-0046)
UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0047)
SO YOU FALL ILL SO INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU A DRUG I GIVE YOU BASICALLY A HARM A HARMLESS SUBSTANCE BASICALLY SOMETHING WHICH HAS NEUTRAL EFFECT ON YOU OKAY  (fe_03_00036-B-0048)
AND IF YOU FEEL THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT DRUG AND THIS WILL CURE YOU IT CURES YOU OKAY THIS EFFECT IS THE PLACEBO EFFECT NOW OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF TIMES BECAUSE THEN  (fe_03_00036-B-0049)
MEDICINE WILL BE USED LESS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF STUDIES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AND WE THEY'VE FOUND THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE TIME YOU COULD GIVE THIS INERT SUBSTANCE AND IT'LL PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE DRUG WOULD  (fe_03_00036-B-0050)
AND WHAT THAT SAYS BASICALLY IS A LOT OF UM THE HEALING THAT HAPPENS IS BASICALLY PSYCHOLOGICAL YOU FEEL YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING BETTER THEREFORE YOU GET BETTER  (fe_03_00036-B-0051)
SO  (fe_03_00036-B-0052)
I THINK A LOT OF MEDICINE ACTUALLY WORKS LIKE THAT I MEAN A LOT OF IT IS IN YOUR HEAD I THINK SO  (fe_03_00036-B-0053)
SO I I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I DON'T THINK MEDICINE IN ITSELF IS SUCH A DEVELOPED SCIENCE I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE UH VERY GOOD MODELS I MEAN THE DRUGS THAT THEY GIVE YOU WHEN YOU FALL SICK IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE  (fe_03_00036-B-0054)
COLLECTED SOME STATISTICS AND CORRELATIONS THEY DON'T TELL YOU WHY SOMETHING LOWERS YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE THEY KNOW THAT IT DOES BECAUSE FOR SIX OUT OF TEN PEOPLE IT DOES  (fe_03_00036-B-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0056)
SO I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF STRONG BELIEF IN MEDICINE AS A SCIENCE  (fe_03_00036-B-0058)
SO ANYWAY I I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WHAT YOU MEANT WHAT YOUR QUESTION WAS TRYING TO  (fe_03_00036-B-0059)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0060)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0062)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0063)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0064)
RIGHT THAT IS THAT IS TRUE BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE KIND OF MEDICINE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT  (fe_03_00036-B-0065)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0066)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0067)
YEAH I GUESS THE IT'S IT'S ALL JUST BUSINESS FOR SOME PEOPLE  (fe_03_00036-B-0071)
RIGHT AND AND SEE THE THING IS IT'S  (fe_03_00036-B-0072)
UH THE SCIENCE IT'S A STRANGE SCIENCE RIGHT BECAUSE I MEAN  (fe_03_00036-B-0073)
MEDICINE IS NOT SO DEVELOPED THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS WORK OKAY THE ONLY THING THEY KNOW IS THEY GO AND LIKE  (fe_03_00036-B-0074)
BASICALLY FIRST TEST THESE ON LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A NEW DRUG IS BASICALLY TESTED ON ANIMALS RIGHT AND THIS  (fe_03_00036-B-0075)
LET'S SEE WHAT IT DOES AND BASED ON THAT THEY AND BASED ON A LITTLE BIT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE INVOLVED THEY MAKE SOME PREDICTIONS THAT THIS WILL DO THIS THING ON HUMAN BEINGS AND THEN THEY TEST ON PEOPLE  (fe_03_00036-B-0076)
AND THAT'S IT AND THEN THEY GIVE IT TO LOTS OF PEOPLE AND ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF THE DATA POINTS FOR THEM IN SOME SENSE  (fe_03_00036-B-0077)
AND THEY GO THROUGH THIS DATA FROM HOSPITAL RECORDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND THEN THEY FIGURE OUT THE CORRELATIONS AND THAT'S ALL TH- THERE IS I MEAN THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT REALLY FINE SO SO SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS  (fe_03_00036-B-0078)
UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0079)
SOMEHOW PEOPLE THINK THAT A DOCTOR IS NOT SCIENTIFIC THEN SOME OF THESE HOLISTIC METHODS THAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE NOT REALLY LIKE GOOD A GOOD SCIENCE RIGHT THEY'RE THEY'RE  (fe_03_00036-B-0080)
THE WHOLE WESTERN MEDICINE SYSTEM RIGHT  (fe_03_00036-B-0082)
I I DOUBT THAT WHOLE THING AND DOUBT THAT WHOLE IDEA IS MORE SCIENTIFIC OR LESS SCIENTIFIC THAN THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_00036-B-0083)
UM  (fe_03_00036-B-0084)
I DON'T KNOW I  (fe_03_00036-B-0085)
DO THEY TELL US WHEN UH WHEN WE ARE DONE OR IS THIS UH WE CAN JUST KEEP TALKING UNTIL WE FEEL THAT WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE SUBJECT  (fe_03_00036-B-0087)
[LAUGHTER] WELL IT IS A STRANGE THING I MEAN I'M OKAY LET'S LET'S STICK TO THE TOPIC [LAUGHTER] SO  (fe_03_00036-B-0091)
