R:  Hi, I'm Joy.
L:  Hi, I'm Diana.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay, so ... [LAUGH]  Um, yeah, [inaudible] the seasons change, I guess, you do get sick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I actually am right now.
R:  You are?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's all right.  Hopefully I'll get over it soon.
R:  Oh no.
L:  I'm used to it.  I get sick, like, once a year.
R:  Oh.  So this is your one for the year --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- then you're finished.
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I di- --
L:  I hope I'm not lucky get sick again though.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What do you think it is?  Like a cold?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are -- are you like -- I don't know where you're calling from.  Do you have like, cold winters?
L:  Well, [MN] I'm in Ohio, so yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my gosh.  [LAUGH]  I'm in San Diego, so I'm like mm --
L:  Oh, see --
R:  -- it's onl- seventy five degrees outside [LAUGH] 
L:  So you don't even know what snow is.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, I know.  I used to -- I used to live on the east coast and it was pretty cold there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- during the summer but ...  I used to get a lot sicker there, but since I've been here it's been, kind of, in the seventies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all winter long.
L:  It would be nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Geez.
R:  But, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah I just get, I don't know, I don't really get sick too much. 
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  I try not -- try to stay safe.
L:  I don't -- I don't get sick too -- too much either, which is good.
R:  This is your one.  Do you work?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you're lucky.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I'm --
L:  Well, for now.
R:  [LAUGH]  'Cause I work and then if I were to -- if I were to get sick I can't even take a sick day right now, because I'm on probation for my job 'cause I just started.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I don't even have sick days.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well ...
L:  You couldn't even take off for the fun of it either, anyway.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Can't even take off for anything.  We don't get all the holidays off, we don't get anything.
L:  Geez.
R:  But that's okay.  [LAUGH]  It's okay, I don't --
L:  Well, that'll be up soon, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I don't know.  I don't get vacation for another ninety days after my probationary period's up.
L:  Oh, that ain't too bad though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll be okay.  [LAUGH]  Anyway, so I guess we're supposed to talk about sickness.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um.  So, okay, so do you have like, other sicknesses?  Do you have other --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like asthma or something like that?
L:  No, I [MN] -- I don't have anything like that.  Do you?
R: Allergies?
L:  I have allergies.  I have allergies really bad.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like the --
R:  Most people do get --
L:  Like, the end of summer and beginning of fall.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get 'em -- I get 'em usually in the spring because that's when all the pollen comes in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- from the flowers.  [SIGH]  And then I get really sneezy, and I'm allergic to dust so if I ever move or if I'm like, moving stuff or helping people load up, I don't know, boxes or anything like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll get very sneezy and [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.  See I have a problem with summer and stuff because I'm allergic to flowers.
R:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.  That doesn't help too much.
R:  Yeah.  No.  Dang.  But, yeah, but that's it though, right.  Just your -- your allergies and then you get your one sickness all year long?
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's lucky.  I don't get -- I -- I'm not so lucky.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and sometimes when I get sick it's not -- it's not too bad.  Half the time when I get sick it's -- it's the really bad one where, uh, my throat is killing me, I can't talk or anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  This one's not too bad.  I'm just all like, stuffed up and stuff, you know.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  You sound congested.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I was all afraid because I didn't know if that was your voice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  I don- -- I don't normally sound like this.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN].
L:  I know I must sound terrible.
R:  No.  Oh, well, you sound -- you sound pretty ill, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's -- that's kind of cool, though.  That's the topic of the day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  So, well ...
L:  Kinda -- kinda fits.
R:  So how long have you had -- how long have you been sick for?
L:  Well, my boyfriend had it first and he gave it to me and ...
R:  Great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um.  I probably got it like, Saturday, I believe.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you just started.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you're just getting bad and then you're going to get worse and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you'll get better.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  
R:  So, do you at- -- do you, I don't know, I don't usually go to the doctors for a cold.
L:  I -- I don't either.  I just -- I let it, you know, work itself out. 
R:  Yeah.  I'll take like, the over the counter stuff to ease it for a while.
L:  That's what I do, yeah.
R:  Or Nical[?] at night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  To knock myself out.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  That's all I do is -- is take the -- the over the counter medicine.  I won't go to the doctor for that.
R:  Right.
L:  You gotta go pay fifty dollars just for him to tell you that you have a cold.
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  The only thing that's worth it is if they give you, like, the antibodies that just kill it right away.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know.  Often times they just say, "Just let it play out".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Just drink some soup and ... " [LAUGH]
L:  Drink plenty of liquids, rest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH]  Okay --
R:  But that's okay.
L:  -- I wasn't doing that already.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, since your boyfriend gave it to you he should take care of you.
L:  Oh, yeah, right.  I wish.  
R:  He should.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, he works all the time so he's never home, so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [LAUGH] ...
L:  But he's --
R:  When he does come home.
L:  -- still sick too.  So we've both got it right now.
R:  Oh, that sucks.
L:  But he's getting better.
R:  My boyfriend is stubborn.  Stubborn.  He doesn't take anything for it and I'll come home and he'll have this huge fever and I'm like, "What is wrong with you?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, see, now --
R:  I have to tell him --
L:  -- our boyfriends are the opposite way.
R:  -- [several inaudible words].  Oh, no.
L:  He's a little pain in the butt, a whiny -- a whiny butt, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He'll sit there and whine 'til he gets pills or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I don't feel good".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, my one'll just sit there and be miserable on the couch.  I mean, "What are you doing?  Do you take medicine, you have a big fever?"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] "No."  All right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know, probably because he's been sick a lot.  He always gets sick.  But, I don't know.  I don't really get too sick.  Only -- usually the change of season is what'll bring it on, like if it's a real drastic change.
L:  Right.
R:  Or if I'll go visit my cousin in Virginia and then I'll come back, then I'll get sick when I come back 'cause I'm not used to their kind of ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have to get used to --
L:  See, I used to only get sick like, in November.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's -- because the seasons are getting pushed so far back.
R:  Oh.
L:  That this is basically November because we didn't even start getting snow until the beginning of the month.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we usually have snow like, the end of November.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, it's getting pushed back.
R:  Do you get a lot of snow?  You have a lot of snow?
L:  Not right now, no.  We -- we haven't really gotten too much snow yet.
R:  But I heard this is supposed to be like, one of the coldest winters ever.
L:  Well, that's -- 
R:  For like, snow places.
L:  -- what I always talk about is that it's getting pushed so far back that instead of summer being in like, July and August, winter's going to be in July and August and summer's gonna be in January.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Yeah, it's going to be totally the opposite --
R:  Yeah, everything's going to be like --
L:  -- way because we have -- we have, uh, winter so late.
R:  That sucks.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sucks.  Geez.
L:  That's the only time I ever get sick, is in winter.
R:  Oh.  I used to get that every winter.  I used to get -- because I had asthma really bad when I was younger.  And I used to get bronchial asthma and I'd have the bad cough and the asthma all at once.
L:  Ugh.
R:  And then it would just be [LAUGH] so bad I had to go get, like, +steroid inhalers and ...
L:  Geez.
R:  [LAUGH]  Like, gi- -- I don't know. 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And I gained a lot of weight because of my inhalers were steroids.  [LAUGH]  And so it was kind of bad, but --
L:  Oh, man, I don't think I can handle all that stuff all at once.
R:  Uh-huh.  I was -- I was pretty much bed ridden.  I think, yeah, when I was younger I got sick quite a bit and I remember like, hallucinating.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [MN].
R:  Like weird -- I'd see weird faces in the ceiling or something or ...
L:  Oh, see, that's how my mom gets when she gets sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She hallucinates, um, you know, thinks she's seeing things, you know.  It's funny but it's not.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you don't want to laugh but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of ridiculous that they see stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well.  I don't know.  If she -- if you get really bad you have to go to the doctor.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  If it just doesn't go away you have to, because I actually had one of my friends get so sick they had to be hospitalized for a week because they caught pneumonia.  You know, [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
L:  Ew.  See, I've never had that yet.
R:  Mhm.  And I won't -- I don't even want to take a flu shot 'cause those make me sick too.
L:  Taking flu shots?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See I won't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take shots at all anyway.  I'm scared of needles.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Right.  Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
L:  That's why I'll just -- I'll just let it ride out.
R:  [NOISE]  I know, yeah, see.  That's, yeah, I don't know.  I'd rather take my chances of getting a flu than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than do that.  Than do -- take a shot.  I don't like shots anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I hate 'em too.
R:  Needles suck.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But they gave us all those topics at the beginning and then I -- I don't even remember anything that they said.  [LAUGH]
L:  What, when they were saying what we had to talk about?
R:  Well, yeah.  They said like, "What do you think?  Do you?  What do you think?"  And I didn't hear -- I don't even remember what the question was.
L:  Oh, I know.  It -- it asked if, uh, if any of us get illnesses.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, oh geez.  I forget now.  I can't remember what the rest of 'em were.
R:  Something about visiting the doctor.
L:  Oh, yeah, about going to the doctor.
R:  Right.  Or something a week.  I don't remember anything, but yeah, I don't really go the doctor that much unless I have to.  [LAUGH]
L:  I forget what the other ones were.
R:  I don't either.  [LAUGH] [MN] --
L:  This is -- this is the first one I've ever done of these.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  I s- --
R:  That's okay.
L:  That's why I wasn't even e- expecting it, you know.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm sitting here and my computer keeps restarting on me.  I'm at work and it doesn't work and I'll be like, in the middle of a program and it keeps restarting on me so I -- it's okay, it's a welcome distraction.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But ... okay, well, I get sick most of the time in the summer, oh no, in the winter.  If I get sick in the summer it's usually very rare.  But ...
L:  Like, do you have allergies or anything?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Besides [MN] just the dust?
R:  I have, um, I had to take one of those allergy tests when I was younger where they prick you and they, like, in- -- I don't know, like they put the
