R:  Hi, my name's Chris.
L:  Hi, this is Jade.
R:  Um, personally I -- I prefer eating at home.  I find it a little bit more satisfying to -- just to know that you've been able to cook the meal yourself, to sit down and to take the time, and to just really enjoy it.
L:  Um, as for me, I -- it's both.  I like to eat out and eat at home.  I have three kids so sometimes I don't have time to -- to prepare the meal.  And so, if the time's limited, we go out.  If, during the weekends, we have more time and that's when I cook, um, prepare the meal and, uh, you know, spend more time with each other at the dinner table.
R:  I, um, I -- I -- I can see that.  I mean, I -- as a college student [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't have too much time but, uh -- and since the, uh, the living arrangements have kind of shifted from year to year.  I -- I just, I don't know, I don't -- I haven't cooked too much recently but I have the -- I have the urge to, uh, learn new recipes here and there.  So, I hope to --
L:  Yeah, well you -- you don't have any kids.  So you have a lot of time, to, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess, experiment with cooking.  I mean, I -- I don't like to cook.  I don't enjoy it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But sometimes you have to because, you know, the economy and, you know, financially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You just save money that way.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But sometimes you get so stressed out, you know, being busy you don't really have a lot of time for yourself.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And sometimes you just want to buy take out, you know.  Just go to a drive through, buy [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] or something, you know.  It's going to cost a little more but at least you get to [LIPSMACK] you don't have to clean up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's probably my -- that's what I hate the most [LAUGH] cleaning up, you know, after cooking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  Let's see, what else?  [PAUSE]  Mm.  Do you know how long this is supposed to take?
R:  I think it's, like, ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because this is my first one.  
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  So I don't really know.
R:  Same here.
L:  Is it supposed to hang up by itself?
R:  Uh, I have no idea actually.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know either.  Um, I guess we're s- supposed to keep talking.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They've asked us --
L:  Um.
R:  -- what else are -- what, like, our favorite meal was, also.  In addition to whether we prefer to --
L:  Oh, what are our favorite meals?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you want to go first?
R:  Sure.  Um, I don't know.  I -- I'm -- I -- I have simple tastes.  I -- I love, for lack of better terminology, I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I love a good roast beef with either roast potatoes or mashed potatoes and some gravy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I couldn't eat that enough.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  
R:  Uh, since I haven't exactly picked up how to cook a roast yet, uh, I usually have to wait for the holidays when some family member makes it, or my mom decides to, uh, take that time and I can, uh, get back and have potatoes and roast beef. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  A nice slow roast.  Excellent.
L:  Um.  I'm, uh, I'm Asian and so I -- we eat a lot of -- I'm Philippino, just to be more specific.  Um, we eat mostly Philippino.  That's what I usually cook.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But sometimes I cook American, like steak, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Simple things like that.  Um, when we go out we just buy like, you know, in and out, KFC, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  Sometimes Pizza Hut, because my kids like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So -- they don't really like my cooking sometimes because, you know, they're kids.  They like finger foods.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I guess, burgers and fries.  Things like that.  Um, sometimes I also stock up on frozen foods.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, when there's no time [LIPSMACK] you just wanna pop that in the oven.
R:  What are some, uh, some typical Philippino, uh, meals.
L:  Um, uh, I don't know what they would be called in English. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I say them in -- in my language I don't think you would understand.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Wh- wh- what are some of like the, uh, the main ingredients.
L:  I mean there's [inaudible] but I -- I -- you know, the rolls.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's, um [NOISE] ... pancet[?].  I don't know if you've heard of those?
R:  No.
L:  Of that one.  Um.  Let's me see there's mongo[?].  [NOISE] Um, I can't think of the names right now.
R:  What are some of the, uh, the main ingredients?  Uh, I'm just curious 'cause I --
L:  We usually eat our meals with rice. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And that fills us up, you know.  [NOISE]  It's, um, it -- it consists of just a lot of, um, vegetables.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Also meat.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] have you heard of senigon[?]?
R:  Have I heard of ...?
L:  Senigon?
R:  Um.  Sounds familiar but I --
L:  It's just sour broth.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mixed with vegetables and, um, whatever meat you like.  It could be either chicken or pork or beef.  [NOISE]  You know, um, there's a variety of ways of cooking, to cook Philippino meals.  I can't think of the other more popular ones that you might've heard.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] I guess because I haven't cooked in about a week.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been busy.  Um, [NOISE] uh, let me see.  Like for instance, [MN] for lunch today we had Pizza Hut.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know about you. [NOISE]
R:  What did -- what did I have for lunch?  [LAUGH]  I -- I don't think I actually had lunch today.  Now that I think about it.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think I just had breakfast.
L:  Too busy ea- -- to eat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well I was at work and haven't gotten much sleep in the past couple of days so...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wanted to take a nap but ...
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I'm -- I've just started -- I'm adventurous in terms of my, uh, my tastes.  I've just kinda started experimenting with different things.  Uh ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I picked up a, uh, a chicken recipe.  It's very, very simple actually.  It's just like chicken with pesto and mozzarella --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and fresh tomatoes.
L:  Yeah, I -- I love pasta too.  I just thought of that.  
R:  So, I just --
L:  And it's simple.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very simple. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what we have mostly in the apartment.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I also like, um, seafood, like lobster.  More expensive taste.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I've, uh -- my taste has definitely changed over the years.  I used to never really eat seafood but I've been eating a lot more of it recently.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't really eat lobster.  I -- I found out the hard way that I'm, kind of, allergic to it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.  I love it but I'm allergic to it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that's -- it's really unfortunate.
L:  I just though of, uh, sushi.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- I don't like sushi but there's one that's called California Roll.  I don't know if -- if it would be considered sushi.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's a type.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I just had that a couple of days ago, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I've picked up sushi a couple of years ago --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and have -- and I've just taken to it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've tried [inaudible].  I haven't actually tried, like, the actual, like, pieces of the, uh, like, the seafood.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I've just basically been eating the rolls.  Like I -- I've -- they have a, is it a Philly roll?  Which has like, uh, cream cheese and salmon and stuff that -- it's --
L:  Oh, I haven't tried that.
R:  -- it's really --
L:  I guess because I don't like sushi because it's raw.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't eat raw food.  And so ... that's why!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I sound pretty silly but ...
R:  No, I mean, hey, it's -- everybody's, uh, everyone has --
L:  Have different tastes.
R:  -- different tastes, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well [MN].  [LAUGH] I -- I -- I honestly don't think I'd -- a couple of years ago if somebody had said I'd be eating --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sushi I don't think I'd believe 'em but ... a friend of mine took me to a, uh, a sushi bar.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, I just kind of took to it and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] I've introduced it to a couple of people that I know that didn't think they'd like it either, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, it's -- it's always fun to spread your, uh, your new tastes beyond the horizons, so ...
L:  Yeah.  There's this place called, uh, it's a buffet restaurant, it's called Todai[?], in my area.  It's a -- it's a bit expensive.  It's, I think, eleven dollars for dinner.  But I guess it's okay, compared to the other sushi places.  [PAUSE] You know, I think it's been ten -- over ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Has it?
L:  I think so, because this one started I believe at two -- two oh one.  And, um, it's two thirteen now.  [LIPSMACK]  I'm on my computer right now so I can see the clock on the right hand side.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't really know.  This is my first one so --
R:  Yeah, same here, I --
L:  -- I'm pretty inexperienced.  
R:  I -- I --
L:  I don't know if it's supposed to shut down by itself or what.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I -- I just -- I got an email saying that it'll last, like, ten minutes.  And --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- that's that.  I don't know.  Um ...
L:  What are we supposed to do?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I guess [MN] uh ...
L:  Keep on talking.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess, I mean ...
L:  I don't really have anything else to say though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what else?  Um ...
R:  Oh.
