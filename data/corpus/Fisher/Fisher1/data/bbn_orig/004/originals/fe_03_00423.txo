L:  Yes.  Well, where is your family?
R:  Actually, my husband, ah, is with me, but, ah, my parents and all the +relations are in -- back in China now.  So --
L:  What part of China?
R:  Ah, should be eastern part.
L:  The eastern part?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like Shanghai?
R:  That's far away. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it -- it's just I thinking that the eastern part, um --
R:  Yeah, it's, mm, Jiangxi province.  Do you know that?
L:  Is that the -- the southeastern province?
R:  Yeah, should be.
L:  Okay.  I actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had, um, ah, a student -- a chemistry student -- a graduate student from Duke --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- University who was from China, from that area --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- who, ah -- who came and lived with me for while, while her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- husband was doing a post doc in [SIGH] Michigan, or something like that.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That's, ah, far away.  The family -- far away from you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's very far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so, you have your husband here.  Do you have any --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- children?
R:  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No -- no.
R:  Yeah.  I hope I will have, ah, some when I graduate. [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I'm still student, so I think children -- maybe not --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- yet.
L:  So -- so, how many -- how many people do you have in --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I guess -- I guess our opinion is what we think about the word family, or what we think --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of as family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  I think family is very important to, ah, people.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, looks like a big strong support.  I think especially that in Chinese tradition --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- family is really important, because each time you have some happy things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you share with the family.  And each time you ha- -- when you, mm, feel bad --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- there is always somebody who will support you or something.  That feeling is really good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, and -- and -- and -- and --
R:  But, I'm not sure how 'bout -- um, looks like American people, um, ah, is not, ah, too much -- put too much its times on family issues.  Right?
L:  I think -- I think it -- I think it varies.  I mean --
R:  Is also very important?
L:  It -- it -- to me it's very important.  
R:  Okay.
L:  But, I also think that it has to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, both my paren- -- my parents have been married for over fifty years.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  So, I think that that has something to do with it, because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you have strong --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- parental --
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  -- you know, guidance, I think that family is strong.  And yet I think if you have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a mixed family, where you have divorces, I think --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- that things can br- -- things can break down.
R:  Yeah.  Because from a lot of, ah -- like, American movies. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes you can say that children doesn't care about the family or something, but --
L:  Well --
R:  -- when they were young or some -- I think maybe after you h- have a family you will feel more strong -- stronger --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- about family.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that a lot of it has to do with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who is able to stay home.  I know that, you know, grandparents who --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are with children --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- often as caretakers --
R:  Yes. 
L:  -- have a much more stronger relationship -- 
R:  Mhm, yes.
L:  -- than if, um --
R:  Fam- -- ah, the parents. [LAUGH] 
L:   -- ah, if the parents work all the time.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Their -- their time in -- in building that relationship with their children is -- is interrupted.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, if -- if you're able to stay home with your children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in their formative years --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you're able -- you're able to increase that bond.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's very important.
L:  N- --
R:  Otherwise they just, ah -- looks like, ah, someone -- normal person to you, or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not, ah, so important.  Yeah, I think back in China -- I think, ah -- I just, ah, feel very good when the parents can be with me all the time.
L:  Now, have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they come to visit you in the United States?  
R:  Ah, no.  They didn't get a chance. [LAUGH]  Too busy.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I have a elder brother who is there in China, so.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Sometimes I +visit him.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.  For me I must -- only a student here, so I need to study. [LAUGH]  No time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um --
R:  So, you are working now?
L:  I -- I -- I am.  I -- I'm -- I've been [LAUGH] many, many years out of school.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L: [LAUGH] 
R:  From your --
L:  Not -- not.
R:  -- voice -- you looks young. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I -- I -- I -- I've -- actually my twentieth --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- reunion is coming up --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- for college.  So, I -- I've many years out of school.  I work for Oxford University Press.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, you -- you probably --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- have a used a dictionary, or a --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- perhaps a text --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- book that came from us, so.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But, um, so --
R:  So, where is it?
L:  Um, I'm in North Carolina.  We have --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- offices in --
R:  North Carolina.
L:  -- New York as well --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- as North Carolina though.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  That's a good place. [LAUGH] 
L:  North Carolina?  North Carolina's --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- a wonderful place.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's, ah, very beautiful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm trying to get my parents to --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- come and -- come down and move here permanently.  And -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- actually, my sister is -- my sister is --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- looking at coming down here eventually too, so --
R:  So -- so, you have a big family?
L:  I have two brothers and one sister.
R:  Oh, that's a lot. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not like in China now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Only one child. [LAUGH]  
L:  Well, you have a brother, you said.
R:  Yeah, but [MN] after me -- I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- was born, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  The policy -- it begun.
L:  Yeah.  So -- so -- but, yes.  Most of the people that I know who are from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- China --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's only one or two people in the family.
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's not a good thing, in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the long run, because even -- not have some, ah, very close +relatives [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- after many years.  Yes.
L:  Well -- well [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you -- but you --
R:  Except the parents. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true. You don't -- you don't have the extended family.  You don't have the aunts and uncles --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- and cousins that you would otherwise.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]  I think that's very lonely to a child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because only -- you are the only child in the family.  So, of course you can do whatever you want because the parents always, ah -- ah -- ah, spoil you, so. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, ah, I think, ah, to the child, it would always feel very alone -- lonely.  Yeah.
L:  Did you, um -- what have you done --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, ah -- [MN] I mean, how do your parents feel with you being so far from them?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I call them, I think, ah, sometimes twice a week.  And right now the phone call is pretty cheap, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  If you -- if you get it at the right time of the night, I guess it -- it can be --
R:  Ah, no.  I think I -- I -- I -- I bought very cheap, ah, phone card.  It's about --
L:  Oh, long distance?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's about, ah, four cents.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  [LAUGH] That the same --
L:  It's cheaper than -- than calling in the United States.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]  That's true.  
L:  Cheaper to call internationally.
R:  Yes -- yes.  So, I usually call them and talk about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, one hour each time, so.
L:  Oh, that --
R:  I think --
L:  -- must make them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feel very good.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's, ah, good to still --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have a connection. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you have, ah, people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in, um -- do you have relatives in the United States?
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, that's, ah, ver-[?] -- is not so close because of the one that brought us[?] so long ago.  So, we are not, ah, very connected so much.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  So -- 
L:  So, how did you -- but what about your husband?  Does -- is your husband Chinese as well?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]  
L:  And -- and did -- did he have family in the United States?  Or --
R:  Ah, no.
L:  Did you meet him over here, or did you meet him over there?
R:  Of course back in China. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Well, no --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know many people who -- I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I actually know many international students who --
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  -- end up meeting --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- over here, and --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and getting married.  Actually th- --
R:  But that -- that's rare, I think.
L:  Yeah?  Well, the thing that was so funny is that, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Actually, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ling[?] -- Ling is the person who, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- who -- who lived with me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was explaining that when they got married it -- it's all very government and paperwork.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And -- and -- and that, um -- oh, there was a movie a couple of years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about a Chinese woman --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who wanted to stay in the United States --
R:  Oh, okay.

L:  -- the big wedding with -- ah, with all the stuff.  And she was saying --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that there are places that specialize --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- where you rent the gown --
