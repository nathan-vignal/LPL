L:  Hi, I'm Lesley.
R:  Hi, I'm Sherry.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I sometimes, [MN] if I have a cold, I'll sometimes have some soup and some tea but if it's really bad I do go to the doctor.
R:  I actually don't go to the doctor.
L:  At all?
R:  I take -- no.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Do you take a lot of --
R:  I --
L:  -- vitamin C.?
R:  Yeah.  I take a lot of [MN] vitamins.  Um, I treat everything with herbs.
L:  Really?
R:  I -- yeah.  I -- I don't like going to the doctor at all.
L:  Oh, I j-
R:  Unless I absolutely have to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just -- I just go.  I find it -- it always, um -- it's comforting or whatever.  [LAUGH]  But I don't get sick that often.
R:  Right.
L:  Once in a while a sore throat or something like that.  
R:  Well, I'll take my kids to the doctor but I -- for myself, usually I won't.
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  I have a eight month old baby and a six year old.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, wow.  I have a fourteen year old.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'll take -- if they do get sick I'll take them, but ...
L:  Yeah, you have to -- you have to take the young ones because I did.  When my daughter was younger I always took her to the doctor.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  I'll definitely -- in fact, she's never been sick though.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Really?  That's just so fortunate.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  My son was sick all the time.  He was allergic to everything.  He was sick all the time, and my daughter had a fever once and that's all.
L:  What happens is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when they're sick when they're younger, um, they develop an immunity and then when they're older they don't get sick and if it's, just the opposite happens.  If they haven't been exposed to a lot of germs or don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get germs, um, in their teen years they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they, uh, develop, you know, a lot of allergies or they get colds.
R:  Yeah, I thought about that because now my son never gets sick.  We all have had the flu and he didn't get it all and so I'm -- I'm hoping that it's not the other way round with my daughter.  [LAUGH]  That --
L:  Yeah, that can be ... [LAUGH]
R:  -- she doesn't start.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It could [MN] -- it could be there, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they're in nursery school they pick up lots of germs.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I even -- I used to get it from them, too.
R:  Me -- well, yeah, I -- I go and volunteer at his school and so I'll get 'em too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I used to volunteer a lot and I got a lotta -- a lot of g- mysterious things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I even --
R:  Yeah, that [COUGH] --
L:  -- remember once, um, my daughter was, um, in fifth grade and I helped in a Halloween party and everybody was coughing, and I said to my husband, +joking around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "I must be a hypochondriac.  I feel like I'm getting sick".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, in three days I -- I picked up some bug that -- got like, you know, some kind of pneumonia bug.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah, bacter- -- and I was really sick but that's all.  Uh, that was like a few years ago but other than that, so far I've been pretty healthy.  This year's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cold -- a cold year.  A lot of people are sick.
R:  Yeah.  We've been really sick here.  I live in a really small community --
L:  Where are you?
R:  -- so when one -- I'm, um, in way, way north of Spokane, Washington.
L:  Oh, wow.  I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I'm as far as you can get until you're in Canada.  Canada's twelve miles away from me.
L:  Oh, it must be interesting out there?
R:  It -- it is.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  You have a lot of snow?
R:  We have so much snow that I had to dig my car out yesterday and just guess where it was.
L:  Oh.  We -- we had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had minimum here.
R:  Oh, man.  I --
L:  When -- when -- when you have snow in a city you're crippled, and that's when people do get sick as well.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know in Seattle, um, that's our big city here, and when it snows there just, uh, maybe an inch, that everybody goes crazy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  And us here, we're used to -- you'll be snowed into your house until somebody digs out your door.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  Here they come and they clean it up immediately.  Like you'll -- you'll have -- even if, um -- even the few times that we did -- we had some snow here, and like, I live in a really large complex and they, you know, make a path, so you can cross and do all that and ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Man.  
L:  [MN]
R:  We have, um -- I live in a community of about a hundred and fifty people.
L:  Oh, God.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's how big our town is.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, you only get ploughed out if somebody feels nice that day.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, here [MN] --
R:  So ...
L:  -- here you would be crippled.  You couldn't go anywhere.  You couldn't go to work.  You couldn't go to school or, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, it would be very hard.
R:  I have never been there.  I have a friend that -- that -- that's there and, in fact, he told me he's never, ever, seen snow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, this year there has been but it's [MN] very light.  Not like what you're used to because when --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My friend has a friend -- a friend upstate.  My daughter.  And she was telling us, you know, like it was really, you know, something like a outrageous amount of snow and we -- we had just like a little bit and we were looking out the window, "Hey, you know, we have snow".  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's funny.  You know, we --
L:  How long are we on here do you [several inaudible words]?
R:  I don't even know how this works.  This is the first time I've ever done it.
L:  Me, too.  Well, that -- I think, because we're the first ones maybe.  Because they --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- just called.  I don't know.  They just -- I filled out that application online and then he just called me today, somebody with my number.  Well, did you get --
R:  Yeah, me too --
L:  -- a PIN number?
R:  -- and I didn't even -- yeah.  And I didn't even know what it was for.  I forgot I filled the thing out.  [LAUGH]  So, I -- thanks.  Thanks.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I asked him -- I asked him because I didn't know if you had to actually make the call and then he said, "No, you receive it".  
R:  Yeah, that's what they told me but I -- I -- the lady that called me didn't speak English very well so I --
L:  Oh, no.  I had a really nice --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- man.  He was very -- you know, he's very thorough, you know, [MN] really, you know, very -- spoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very well and he explained -- because I said to him, "I did fill it out and I was under the impression that, you know, you have to make this call".  He said, "Oh no, you receive it".  But they didn't ...
R:  Well, th- -- yeah, this is neat.  
L:  [LAUGH] So how long do we stay on here?
R:  I have no idea.  [LAUGH]
L:  Me neither.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll ask --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the person who's mon- -- somebody's on there now, I think, monitoring this, aren't they?
R:  I -- I don't know.  I just -- they told me that it would be recorded. 
L:  But when do we --
R:  So I don't know.
L:  Do we stay on indefinitely?  I mean, you know ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I have no idea.
L:  I thought it was like a ten -- you know, like this ten minute call and, you know?
R:  Uh, I don't know.  Um, I don't even remember the --
L:  Very strange.
R:  -- website.  Are you there?
L:  Well -- yeah, I'm here.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, I'm s- --
L:  I -- I was look- -- I don't have it here, I have it in my off- -- my other room somewhere with the, you know, the information.  Well, maybe, they --
R:  Uh.  Well --
L:  -- tell us when we have to hang up.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I can't talk for ten minutes about illness.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah!  Well, we're both very healthy so maybe, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- if we were sick ...
R:  Maybe we don't qualify for this.
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we qualify to get paid.  We received a call, so I mean ...
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  I mean ...
R:  I mean, how -- this is pretty cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope they do this all the time.  [LAUGH]  It's a good way to get cheap long distance, only you don't know who you're going to call.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I -- oh, you know, I never thought of that.  That's right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Make random long distance phone calls.
L:  Yeah, I hope they don't bill me for these calls.
R:  No kidding.
L:  I mean, you know, really you [inaudible], uh, you know, you're expecting these calls. You can wind up getting a bill for it or something?
R:  I hope not.  [inaudible] -- 
L:  Well, we'll find out soon enough.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  This is so funny.
R:  Then we'll know not to talk so long.  [LAUGH]  I don't -- I don't know if we're supposed to end the call or ...
L:  I thought that there was somebody monitoring this [MN] or are they just recording it or ...?
R:  I think they -- well, the person that -- the lady that called me, she said that it would just be recorded and it would be automated.  That's all I know.
L:  Oh, 'cause I thought, when I read it, I thought -- I -- I -- I thought the person -- there's supposed to be like an operator would come on and ...
R:  Yeah, I didn't know we'd be talking to each other.  I thought that --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I --
R:  That --
L:  Well, let's talk a little about illness and then I guess we -- we just end it.  Because we could be on here, you know, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is very strange.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  Well, um.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, um, so you take a lot of vitamins?
R:  I do.  I take a lot of vitamins and herbs --
L:  Vitamin C.?  So do I.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I also take vitamin E. and also a multiple vitamin and B.
R:  I just recently started taking multivitamins actually.  
L:  Yeah, I take --
R:  Um.
L:  -- like B, -- you know, B. complex.  That's supposed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be really good, you know, to keep you healthy or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I'm trying to eat really healthy lately.  Um, trying to -- in the past I have gotten sick in the winter times, when I was younger, so I'm [LAUGH] I feel like I'm getting old so I -- [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you eat to keep healthy?  Like, what kind of food?
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm trying to cut out red meat, completely.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We don't eat red meat here.  My husband won't eat it at all, I mean.
R:  Yeah, I used to be a die hard vegetarian until I got pregnant with my son and I couldn't live without meat.  [LAUGH]  So now I'm, kind of, trying to go back to how I was before.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, [SIGH] I'm trying to eat a lot of fish for the amino acids and ...
L:  Yeah, I don't eat enough fish.  I eat chicken, though, but I don't eat enough fish.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- [SIGH]
L:  A lot of pasta.  Too much actually here.
R:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Not so brave [several inaudible words].
R:  In fact I was just t- talking to a friend about how I must eat spaghetti every night because --
L:  We --
R:  -- everytime they ask me it's ...
L:  Yeah, the kids eat that, really like that, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm sick of it actually.  My husband likes it too.
R:  [LAUGH]  I love my own spaghetti but I do get sick of it.  I don't like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anybody elses.  But I like mine.
L:  Oh, really.  Oh, no, we call out --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We call out for it a lot.  See here in the city you just call up and --
R:  Oh, that'd be --
L:  -- whatever you want just comes, you know, like.  I cook too, but --
R:  Oh, that'd be nice.
L:  Yeah, that is nice.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Here we -- if you can make it to the store, you're lucky.
L:  Oh.
R:  With all this snow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, basically when you can get to the store you better do major grocery shopping because [LAUGH] you might be --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- stuck in your house.
L:  I'm looking -- y the way, I'm looking on -- on my ID.  It's the University of Pennsylvania is sponsoring, uh ...
R:  Oh, right.  That sounds familiar now.
L:  Yeah, so, um.  I don't know.
R:  I'll have t- --
L:  And when you call that eight hundred number it's just a recording.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah.  Because I thought I can get, you know, get some more information live, but I didn't expect a call tonight.
R:  I didn't either.  I -- hopefully it'll be a lot and I can actually get checks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but I don't know.  Um, I --I -- I don't know if you -- if you stay on any [MN] longer you get -- you get more.  
R:  I wouldn't think so.
L:  That's what -- I don't think so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They said ten dollars a call.  Did they say --
R:  I -- that's what I read.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's what I read.
R:  Well, cool, hopefully we'll get calls all the time.
L:  Yeah, that'd be great.  
R:  Maybe we'll get each other again.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I would hope so.  [LAUGH]  This -- this worked out --
R:  All right.
L:  -- really well.  Well, look, I, um, I really enjoyed talking to you and hope this -- maybe we'll hook up again.  
R:  Yeah, hopefully, we'll --
L:  Thank you, Sheryl.
R:  Yeah, thank you.  Nice --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- meeting you.  
L:  Same here.  Bye.
R:  Bye bye.
