R:  Hi, I'm Leah.
L:  Hi, Leah, I'm Brian.  What's up?
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm -- I'm originally from Long Island, but I go to school at Penn.
L:  Oh, really?  I go to Tufts University in Boston, but I'm from Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
L:  How do you like Philadelphia?
R:  I love it here.  It's great.  How do you like Boston?
L:  Um, there's a lot more to do than in Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh kinda sucks.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's ki- -- it's -- I think it's like, four hours from here or so?
L:  What is that?  Oh, Pittsburgh?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I think it's like, four hours?
L:  Everybody thinks its like, right next door, but it's not really.
R:  Yeah, I -- I learned m- my lesson.  [LAUGH]  I was, like, thinking of going there and then -- for like, the weekend or something, and then I was like, "Oh, wait a minute.  It's kind of far".
L:  [LAUGH]  That's funny. 
R:  So ...
L:  No, it's not worth -- definitely not worth visiting.
R:  Mm.
L:  So how did you get signed up for this?
R:  Um, I just basically got an email and I was like, "Oh, this is good.  Get paid to talk".  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  
R: And how 'bout you?
L:  Um, I read about in on the internet or something, so I just sent in my name.
R:  Oh, okay.  What year --
L:  So, what are we supposed to do?
R:  We're supposed to talk about illness.
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't get it.
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a kind of a random topic.
L:  I know.
R:  Um.  Wait, what year are you in school?
L:  I'm a freshman.  How 'bout you?
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm a sophomore.
L:  That's cool.  What's your major?
R:  Um, marketing communications.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And how 'bout you?
L:  Um, I want to be a political science and Spanish double major.
R:  Oh, okay.  Very cool.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L: So, wait.  So what do you think of illness, Leah?
R:  Well, let me tell you.  [MN] Well, I haven't gotten sick this year so I'm knocking on word that I'm not going to get sick anymore.
L:  As for this year, it's like two weeks old.
R:  Well, usually, I get sick in December so I figured as long as I last until January I'm safe.
L:  I see.
R:  But, have you -- how did you -- did you get like the cold flu season?
L:  No, I didn't actually.  I'm used to the high school thing where, you know, any day you have like, a remote sniffles or cough or anything you skip.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's totally different in college.  Like, you have to be on your deathbed and have an excuse from the Dean to skip and everything, so ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's a hassle.
R:  Yeah, I know, that's about it! [LAUGH] 
L:  But I actually wanted to go to Penn.  I got waitlisted there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you apply to the college then?
L:  I did.  To University of Pennsylvania, yeah.
R:  Really?  Okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Where w- --
R:  Yeah, I -- hm?
L:  Where all did you -- and did you apply for college?
R:  Um, I just applied here and then to MIT.
L:  Oh, wow.  You must've been very confident in yourself.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, [LAUGH] I don't know, but ...
L:  That's good.
R:  Um.  [LIPSMACK]  So, yeah, it's actually -- I mean, it's in Boston too, so ...
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, I applied to twelve different schools.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where were you thinking of going?
L:  I wanted to go to Harvard, actually.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I didn't get in to any of the Ivy Leagues, so that's why I'm here.
R:  Oh, well.  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Did you -- I mean, do you like it there or ...?
L:  I enjoy it, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, there's -- there's lots to do, like I said.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you find the Penn is pretty hard?
R:  Um.  Is it like -- I'm in Warden so it's -- I think it's harder than like, the college classes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I mean, I can't imagine that it's like, overwhelmingly much harder than other colleges would be.
L:  Is it possible to take business as like, an -- an undergrad major there?
R:  Um.  Not if you're -- not in Warden.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So you need to be in Warden to get like, any kind of, like, major from there.  But you can -- like, economics isn't considered part of Warden, so if you're in the college you can get economics but you can't get, like, you know, finance or accounting or marketing or any of that.
L:  Okay.  Well, 'cause I thought, uh, Warden School was only for business.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's only business.
L:  I thought you were in marketing and communications.
R:  Right, I'm in Warden.
L:  Oh, so that is, like, a -- a s- -- a type of business.
R:  Oh, we're -- oh, yeah, sorry.  Um, okay, so, like, we have, like, concentrations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And basically it means that you take four classes in that subject so there's -- like, the primary would be, like, marketing.
L:  Right.
R:  But then they also have another one which is marketing and communications.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So you take four marketing classes and then you take four communications classes.
L:  So that's not too bad.  You can do, like, a bunch of 'em if you really wanted.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, like, I think most people kind of do two or maybe three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.  But it's cool because you can, like, take -- you can get, like, stuff outside of Warden.
L:  Right.
R:  But you would need to get that as kind of like -- like a duel degree.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, for, like, your primary, like, major whatever, it needs to be, like, business or, like, one of the joint programs, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So if you would've gone to MIT would you've been like a -- an engineer person?
R:  Um, probably not.  Like, they have a really good business school too.
L:  I never realised that.
R:  So ...  Yeah, actually a lot of people don't know and I didn't know either until I, like, saw, like, a random, like, listing and I was, like, "Wow, MIT has got, like, the ..."  I think it was about the time of, like, the second best business undergrad.
L:  Oh, wow.  Because you --
R:  So ...
L:  --talk to people who are going to MIT for, like, English and it's, like, why bother, you know?
R:  Yeah.  My brother goes to MIT and he was basically telling me that, like, if you're not in engineering you take that and engineering.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  But you can't just do, like business because ever- everybody, like, laughs at you and everything.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's really funny.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it is a little bit intimidating as well because I was. like, "Hmm".  [LAUGH]
L:  Because it's so useful to be an engineer and, like, a -- a poet or something, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  What did you do for your Christmas break?
R:  Um, just went home, hung out, watched movies.  How 'bout you?
L:  I went, uh, skiing in Colorado. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So that was fun.  And I went to visit my grandparents and my girlfriend, so I was only home for, like, a couple of days over break.  So it was fun.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  When did you guys start back?
R:  Um, on the thirteenth.
L:  Okay, yeah, I started back on the fifteenth.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But --
R:  And then were you finished with classes?  Early December or ...?
L:  Um, no, like, mid December.
R:  Okay.
L:  So I -- I guess you're a little bit luckier than we are.
R:  No, we're -- I was here 'til the twentieth of December.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That kind of stinks.
R:  Yeah, so ...  We had a -- I think it was, mm, it was pretty short.  But --
L:  Now, did you have exams before break?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you have 'em before or after?
L:  I had 'em before.  I heard that Harvard, though, takes their exams after break.
R:  Yeah
L:  So --
R:  I think Princeton does that as well.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That must be really nice because then if you get behind in anything then you ca- -- you have like, a whole month to catch up.
R:  That's true.  I don't know.  Like, I guess it has its goods and its bads because then you have to worry about it over break.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like, it's kind of nice because it'd be, like, "I'm done, like".
L:  That's true.
R:  And not have to think about anything.
L:  That's true.  Yeah, actually, I'm taking a kind of a business class this semester.  I just started it today.  It's, uh, entrepreneurial finance.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's pretty cool.  'Cause there's no, like, business program here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, that's about as close as you can get.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, that's really cool.  So, how do you, like, rate your major and your school and everything?
L:  Um, I like it so far.  I just recently decided on political science as a major because I've heard that the Econ Department here isn't very good, and I was considering that otherwise.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, Tufts is a pretty good school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like one thing I wish I could do more is that I'm really into debating.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And our debate team here is really, really bad, and we have no money.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, I mean, like your school probably sends people, you know, on planes and stuff but we have to, like -- we can only go if we can take, like, the subway to it or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's really lame in that regard.  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there's some other good stuff about it.
R:  Mhm.  And how do you like Spanish?
L:  Uh, it's okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I'm trying to finish in three years so I might not have a chance to do that because -- I mean, it's a lot of work to do two majors, you know, in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three years. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, we'll see.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Are you in any --
R:  [MN]
L:  Are you in any --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- clubs or sports teams or anything at Penn?
R:  Um, I'm, like, into theatre groups and stuff.  Um, I do a children's theatre group which is a lot fun.  Like, we do our play in, um, in local elementary schools.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So it's actually -- yeah, it's actually really, really cool.  Um, I'm in just, like, random, like, you know, clubs, like Warden Women and, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just random.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a funny name.
R:  Things[?] -- yeah, it's -- I mean, it's a place to get together and meet other people I guess, so ...
L:  That's cool.
R:  Are you in anything other than, like, attempted debate?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm in, uh -- I'm in the, uh, in like the chamber choir here.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Um.  I don't know.  I do a couple of different things.  Um, I volunteer, like, in an afterschool program in tutoring and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, uh, tonight I just signed up for the, uh, ping pong team.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So that'll be very exciting.
R:  That's fun.
L:  I'm sure they get, like, really hard core about it and everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I tried to sign up for the ultimate frisbee team earlier this year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're like, "All right, we have practice three times a week" and they have, like, a coach and they went to nationals and everything, and I was, like, "Holy crap!"
R:  That's really wild.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, like who really --
R:  It's intense.
L:  -- wants to get that into ultimate frisbee?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then if you go and tell people, like, you're the national champion from ultimate frisbee they'll laugh at you.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  It get -- it gets kind of competitive I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess so.  And it was, like, they had a guys team and a girls team.  It was really funny.
R:  That's great.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Hey, I guess to each his own.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Do you play any sports?
R:  Um.  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  No?  Me either.
R:  No, yeah, I'm definitely not the athletic type.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, me either.  I'm a baseball umpire.
R:  Oh, [MN] --
L:  So ...
R:  I -- that's so funny because I was talking today about how I used to umpire for Little League.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Like in high school.  Yeah.  Where, I was like --
L:  For baseball or softball?
R:  -- I was the -- it was for baseball.  It was for like, um, boys who are maybe, like, seven years old or so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I was explaining that I'm, like, the world's worst umpire.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  I used to feel really bad for the kids because I was
