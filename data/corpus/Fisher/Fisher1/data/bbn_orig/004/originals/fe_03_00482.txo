R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Janice.
R:  Hi, my name is Beverley.
L:  Hi, Beverley.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about illness.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um.  Have you been sick this winter at all?
R:  Um.  I -- a cold tried to get me and it -- it didn't make it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, unfortunately though, um, I gave it to my daughter and she did get sick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  How old's your daughter?
R:  Ten.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but she just had heart surgery so I'm, um --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- it's more drastic for her.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Does she have to take any special medi- -- you know, precautions because of that?
R:  Um.
L:  Th- the heart surgery?
R:  Just, um, she's -- she takes, um, a number of heart meds and she just had her mitral valve replaced, so she's taking, um, blood thinners.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  Was it a bad surgery?
R:  Well, i- um, no, not really.  Um, I mean, it -- it's open heart surgery but --
L:  Right.
R:  Um.  [MN]
L:  My husband has mitral valve prolapse, but, uh --
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  My husband does.  Yes.
R:  So is he going to have to have his [MN] ...?
L:  Uh, not at this time.  They just basically, you know, watch him and they, um, [LIPSMACK] they medicate him before he has any dental work or any, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Um.
L:  Anything like that.  But other than that, I mean, he really has no other symptomology from it.  He d- he didn't even know he had it, it was picked up, you know, in a doctor's office.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it is -- it's a very distinct sound.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, that they used to bring the, um, when she first got it she was one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and she got it from [COUGH] a blood infection.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  U- um, that went to the mitral valve.  And, uh, um -- but they used to bring the, you know, the interns around to listen to her.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, because it's so pronounced, huh?
R:  Yeah, especially when you're one.  I guess it's real easy to hear.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um.
L:  It's hard to have a sick infant.  My daughter wasn't well as an infant, and a sick baby is very tough to take, [LAUGH] I know.  Very hard to deal with.  Uh, she wasn't anywhere, you know, not horribly sick but she had, um, a reflux where she used to stop breathing and, um, so we had to have a lot of treatment for her as well.  And it was, uh, and it was a tough year.
R:  Oh, my goodness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she would stop breathing?
L:  She -- yeah, she used to stop, uh, stop breathing and they didn't know why in the beginning, you know, they weren't sure.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  The reason, um -- but everything used to back up from the esophagus 'cause there was a valve that wasn't working at the base of the esophagus.  And, um, [MN] generally a lot of times tha- -- which is what happened to her, they just outgrow it.  But it took eleven months for her to outgrow it and during that time whatever came up, especially as an infant, she didn't know how to clear it.  So she would choke and stop breathing. 
R:  Oh.
L:  She wore a monitor for eleven months.
R:  Oh, my good- -- well, my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- daughter had the -- had the reflux too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and eventually when she was -- she didn't outgrow it.  When she was three she had the surgery to correct it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, the --
L:  Oh, wow.  So she's had more than her share, huh?
R:  Yeah, well, she also ha- -- they wouldn't let her have the surgery until she was three because of the heart problem.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  And the only reason they let her have the surgery then was because she also had, um, a malrotated valve.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And her, um [LIPSMACK] -- they need to pin that down so that it doesn't try and rotate back on its own.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And then you lose, you know, large parts of your -- of your colon.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God.
R:  So the, um, yeah, she, um ...
L:  You've certainly had your share with her.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we've been in and out of hospitals.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ...
L:  Does she get sick more often because of these conditions?
R:  Um ...
L:  Like in the winters and things.  Is she more prone to colds and -- and things like that?
R:  I don't -- I don't think so.  I try and give her really, really good nutrition.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... in fact, after the surgery she had a heart arrhythmia and when she was in the I- -- in the intensive care -- when she was still there and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they couldn't, um -- they couldn't figure out why, and it was because they weren't giving her calcium.  Um.
L:  Wow.
R:  The- [MN] -- the -- and at home she gets, um -- I ma- I make sure she gets at least, um, at least thirteen hundred milligrams a day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a- as soon as they gave her --
L:  In food or -- or supplements?
R:  Um, through supplements.
L:  Okay.  'Cause I'm -- I'm big into supplements.  [LAUGH]
R:  You are?
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I -- there was a point where I was taking, uh, between thirty and forty supplements a day.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I- I've cut back a little bit.  You know, I'm not quite as a [LAUGH] fanatical as I was.  But my husband and I went through some periods where we, um -- we still believe in supplements, you know, tremendously, but we've cut back, only out of, probably, laziness [LAUGH] more than anything.  It's hard to take that many a day.
R:  Yeah, that-- well, she, uh, um -- she -- I give her Ensure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- three different kinds.  The nutritionist is like, "Why, you know, just give her one.  It's, uh, you know, one kind".  I'm like, "No, it doesn't work like that".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  She needs different ones for --
L:  Different medi- -- yeah, different minerals and -- and things, sure. 
R:  Um --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- for different things.  And, uh, the, uh, um, and it -- it's sort of like she's not to -- you know, it's not too much trouble to do it for her either.
L:  No, yeah, tha- that's the ea- --
R:  Yeah, I mean, th- [MN] the nutritionist is like -- th- that would seem like too much trouble and it's, like, it's not.  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's certainly not for your child.  [LAUGH]  My goodness, no.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I wouldn't think so.  [LAUGH]  I wouldn't think so.  We're a re- relatively healthy bunch especially, you know, knock wood this winter, we haven't, um, none of us have been sick.  Now, tomorrow we're all wake up with colds.
R:  Do you -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you get flu shots?
L:  No.
R:  Oh we get -- [MN] we do -- I do -- we do get flu shots.
L:  Oh, you do.
R: Yeah.
L:  See, we haven't any really -- I mean, we get, you know, occasionally a normal, you know, thing.  But I think for the last, even few -- two or three winters -- my son is seventeen and my daughter's fifteen now.  Um, [LIPSMACK] we haven't -- none of us have even had a cold.  And, I mean, we've really, uh, been very lucky.  You know, if we had a cold it was a couple of days, you know, and, uh, took our echinacea [NOISE] and, uh, that helps.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, um, that -- the other thing is my -- my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- daughter has Downs Syndrome and [MN], um, sometimes they get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- low on -- low on zinc so I make sure that she has --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- zinc too.  So I don't know if that helps.  I don't know if zinc is supposed to ward off the col- cold or just make it not as bad when you get it.
L:  Um, I think zinc is supposed to be for throats.
R:  Oh, it is for throats?
L:  More than colds.  Yes, I think it's a throat --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, thing, more than a -- a cold thing.  I think -- the only thing for a cold or anything like that is echinacea.  Which, you know, you really have to mega dose that as soon as you start to feel any symptoms.  And that, you know, we found helps a little bit.  But for the most part, you know, you get a cold you get a cold.  You know, as far as I can tell I don't see too much, uh, other than a antihistamine or something to really, uh, help it along, and do a little chicken soup doesn't hurt, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well she -- she can't, um, she can't, um, have a decongestant.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Um.
L:  The antihistamine?
R:  She can have the antihistamine but she takes -- but she -- and she -- and she takes one regularly because she has allergies.  The spring is the worst.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Boy, she keeps you busy it seems.
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it, um -- since her heart surgery she's come off a couple of her medicines and it hasn't, um -- it see- -- it -- it sort of like it seems so much easier.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How old is she now?
R:  Ten.
L:  Ten.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  And she's -- when does she come off the medi- [MN] medications?
R:  Well, um, she came off one in, um, December and one in January.
L:  Okay.
R:  She, u- um, she still has like, five meds -- five different meds and --
L:  My goodness.
R:  -- multiple -- multiple doses a day but it's for, um, t- -- they cranked back her every eight hour med to every twelve.
L:  Oh, that helps.
R:  It just [MN].  Oh, it -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It's like a world of difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can sleep now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and you know people don't realize how -- how that sounds.  Like it's only four hours but that makes a big difference.
R:  It does.  
L:  It certainly does.
R:  It's sort of like because she's got a G. tube, a gastric tube.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I give -- I can give her her meds when she's asleep, so I did try and give it to her every eight hours --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause the cardiologist told me it was her im- most important med.
L:  Right.
R:  Does your husband have to take any heart meds?
L:  No.  He di- --
R:  No blood pressure medicine or anything?
L:  No.  Not a thing.
R:  His -- his prolapse really must not be too bad then.
L:  Yeah, uh, you know -- he -- he wasn't even aware.  I mean it was picked up, you know, in a routine exam and, um, then he had the echo, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which -- which, you know, diagnosed it c- you know, completely, but I mean, other than, you know, to be premedicated for dental work he really has no symptomology.  He exercises.  I mean he's completely, you know, well, as far as anything else is concerned.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  That's e- -- that's wonderful.  He -- so he doesn't have heart arrhythmia or anything?
L:  No.  No.  He just has, you know, the mitral valve.
R:  Well, that's, um -- there's -- there's lots of people walking round with little holes in their hearts that they don't know.
L:  Yeah, they don't even know.  Mm.
R:  Um ...
L:  No.
R:  They're, um -- but [MN] you know, so I guess I know a little -- a little -- I know more about the medical
