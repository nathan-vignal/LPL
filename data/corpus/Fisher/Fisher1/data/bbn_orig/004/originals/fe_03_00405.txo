L:  Hi.  My name's Scott.
R:  Hi.  My name's Vanessa.
L:  Hi, Vanessa.  So, um, I guess -- how -- how long are we supposed to talk about the particular topic?
R:  I think we talk for ten minutes, and I've heard from other people that they come on after the ten minutes and then they tell us, ah, that you have, like, thirty seconds to wrap it up.
L:  Oh, okay -- okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, out topic then is, ah, computers in -- in education --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and if improve or harm education?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]  That's what I heard.
L:  Interesting.  Well, I actually work, ah -- I actually work at University of Pennsylvania, in the Management and Technology Program.
R:  Oh well, then that's perfect for you.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  And I'm actually a teacher, so.
L:  Oh, are you really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  What do you -- what do you teach?
R:  The second grade.  
L:  You teach second grade?
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, do you use computers at all?
R:  Yeah, actually.
L:  In your cl- -- in your classroom?
R:  Uh-huh.  We -- 
L:  In -- in -- in what way?
R:  Um, we use, like -- it's -- well, we call it an Elmo[?].  I don't know what else it's called, but you know, you hook it to the computer and it projects onto a screen whatever's on --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- your PC.
L:   Okay.
R:  So --
L:  It's called an Elmo?
R:  Yeah, that's what we call -- I'm -- I'm -- that's what kind we have, we call it the Elmo, so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] all right.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, we use that to, like, get websites off the computer that we can use with the kids, and so we can do stuff, you know, on the big screen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for then to see it.
L:  Right.  And do they -- do the -- so, do the kids use the computer at all?  Or, do you run the whole --
R:  W- -- um.
L:  -- thing?
R:  When -- stuff like that, I will just do it because I'm afraid of what they'll tap into.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  You know, God forbid they type in the wrong letter or the wrong space somewhere and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who knows what will pop up. 
L:  Yeah, sure.  No, that's true.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  For the most part, it's just me doing those things. [MN] 
L:  Do they -- do they s- -- do you think they use computers at home, and -- and feel comfortable using a computer at home?
R:  Um, I come from a very rural school, so I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- don't think a lot --
L:  Where -- where are you?
R:  Um.
L:  Where are you now?
R:  From Maryland[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, they, ah -- not -- a lot of the kids at my school don't have a lot computers at home.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I mean, they to it really fast.  So, I think it's something really easy for them to learn.  And once you show 'em how to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do it that's it -- that's all they need.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause, you know, working on the computers is sort of enough for them to get doing stuff.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I guess the -- I -- I'm trying to think how it could harm education.
R:  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  I mean -- well, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  The only thing is that -- that I would think of would be that, um, using the Internet for research.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, my -- my girlfriend, she teaches as well.  And she teaches, ah -- [LIPSMACK] she teaches high school biology.
R:  Mm.
L:  And she's amazed at how much information they get off of the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So much so, that she now is thinking about actually limiting the amount of citations they actually use from the Internet.
R:  Yeah.  Plus, you don't know if they're --
L:  I mean, because they don't --
R:  -- coming from a reputable --
L:  Well, you know, exactly.  You don't know if they're -- if the information is -- yeah, you're right, is -- is accurate, if it's good information, and where it's coming from.  Um, not to mention the fact that, you know, people need to be able to go to the library and look some- -- you know, and look up research and find research --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, out of a -- out of a book, or out of a journal.  So, I mean, I'm thinking -- trying to think of where using a computer might, you know -- might be a detriment to education, and that really is the one[?] thing that I could --
R:  Yeah, [MN] --
L:  That I could actually think of.
R:  That, and -- and being able to get into sites that you shouldn't [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- would be the big problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I know --
L:  Has that --
R:  -- at our school we have a computer lab, and they had to -- to make sure that kids were only going -- typing in exactly what -- like, in fourth and fifth grade, the older grades.
L:  Sure. 
R:  'Cause, you see[?] --
L:  Sure. 
R:  Some of them were surfing other [LAUGH] things, even at --
L:  Do they any --
R:  -- that age.
L:  Do they have any kind of filters --
R:  Not that --
L:  -- or anything --
R:  -- I'm aware of.
L:  -- on those computers?
R:  I mean, I've -- I'm on the Internet at school and I've never, you know, encountered anything where I couldn't get to a site or --
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  But then again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I haven't gone to any, like, really horrible things, so.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, really.
R:  Maybe I need to try one of those on time.  But, [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I know that, ah, ah, where Melinda teaches that they have a, you know -- they have a -- they do have a filter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for -- for, you know a lot -- you know, a lot of different kinds of websites.  But, ah, you know, at Penn that's certainly not the case.  But, ah, they definitely -- they definitely do that where she works.
R:  Yeah.  They --
L:  You know, and our students -- I mean, that's all they ever do is -- I mean, everything in on the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We even now have a -- have a system, which I've just started using recently, called Web Cafe.  And Web Cafe is, um -- it's almost like a -- offline -- or not really offline.  But, it's a place where, ah, you know, you just -- you can store all of your papers.  I mean, we keep everything.
R:  Oh.
L:  The syllabus, the, you know, all the papers that students turn in.  They don't -- if they don't want to they don't have to turn in a hard copy to the -- to the professor.  They can just drop it in this little -- you know, they go online, copy it --
R:  Oh, they just put it in the folder --
L:  -- from their -- from their computer --
R:  -- or something?
L:  -- and just paste it into a folder.  Yeah.
R:  Oh my God.  I'd never had that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in either of my [LAUGH] --
L:  It's -- I know.  Well I -- it's -- it's, ah, relatively new, um, on campus.  And it is amazing how functional it is, because not only can you put, um, you know, all of the documents that you need for the class syllabus, you can always -- you can constantly update stuff and it'll send students notices when things are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- updated or changed.  There's also, ah, an instructor folder and nobody can g- -- the only people that can get into the instructor folder are the people that actually set it up.  So, the instructors themselves are the only people that have access.  So, you can put quizzes, tests, um, all of your grades and everything online and, um, you know, you can keep everything there.  And you can access it anywhere.  It doesn't matter -- wherever there's an Internet connection you can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- access the Web Cafe.
R:  See, that's the gr-  -- that's the good thing it does, you know, [LAUGH] for --
L:  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.
R:  For education.
L:  It definitely -- I mean, I think that it's -- it's not like it's going away.
R:  No, I think you have to deal --
L:  And --
R:  -- with the bad because it's inevitable.  I mean, I have to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's just the way things are going.
L:  Right.
R:  It's only going to get --
L:  How --
R:  -- more and more and more. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, sure -- sure.  And students are -- and kids are gonna become more -- more fluent --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and more, ah, computer savvy, which they -- you know, I mean, they are already.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's amazing what a generational difference.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I mean, it's -- it's almost fel- -- ah, it's like computers, you know, became popular and everybody kn- -- learned about them.  But, right before that, there's that whole group of people that just have no clue.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean --
L:  You know?
R:  I have a nephew who was two and he could turn -- you know, go in to click start, shut down.  You know, he could do all that.  He couldn't even read, but he knew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, you know, of the way everything's laid out so user friendly.  And his grandfather couldn't do it, you know. [LAUGH]   Like, he'd --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- have to him to shut down the computer, you know -- two years old.
L:  Well, I do a -- I -- I volunteer teach computer training to adults, and, um, it's here -- here in center city Philadelphia and it's people who --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a lot of, you know, low income older adults who really are trying to gain some computer skills just so they can get a job pretty much anywhere.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, um, it's amazing to -- the biggest hurdle of -- of anything -- it's not sitting down and, you know, typing and -- and, you know, turning a computer on, it's using the mouse.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  There's this complete disconnect between holding the mouse, you know, in your hand and seeing it move on the screen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they can not -- they can't, ah -- it's -- it's such a hard jump for them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for some reason.  I can't quite figure it out when we --
R:  You know, it's kind of like the older you get the more -- I don't know, it seems like the more child you become, you know, as far as --
L:  Perh- -- yeah, like it's -- it's --
R:  And if you put --
L:  There's definitely --
R:  -- a little kid on a computer they can't understand, you know, that where the arrow is pointing is where I'm moving the mouse.  It's kind of the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- same. [LAUGH]  Guess when you get -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- older --
L:  Yeah. So, it's -- it's, ah -- you know, and it's interesting because now with kids, there isn't a single kid that I could think of who doesn't really feel comfortable sitting in front of a computer. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they learned it -- they learned it somewhere.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they'll --
L:  You know, they learned it from --
R:  -- just try it.  They don't have the fear.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they're not afraid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to break things and to mess it up. [LAUGH]  You know?
L:  Ri- right.  Where with adult learners sitting down and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never having used a computer before, it's -- it's a -- it's incredibly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- intimidating to them.
R:  You're so worried about doing the right thing.  You don't want to mess it up or break it, or --
L:  They're -- they think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they're gonna break the computer.
R:  Yeah.  Click on the wrong thing.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  So, how long you been in teaching?
R:  Um, this is my third year.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  And have you always been teaching at -- at that school?  That same school?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a -- a -- rural school in Maryland, you said?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  Yep.  So --
L:  And that's where you're -- are you from that area?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay -- okay.
R:  Well, a little farther away from it. [LAUGH]  Not quite. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But in the area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at least?
R:  My little city is considered a big city to them, so.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of one of those things.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So we don't have very many parents involved in technology. [LAUGH] 
L:  No?
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Very --
R:  No.
L:  -- interesting.  Well, I think we've spoken for at least ten minutes, haven't we?
R:  I think it's, ah -- okay.  Thought I heard something. [LAUGH]  I think it's supposed to come on and tell us.
L:  And tell us?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, at least -- 'cause I -- I had done -- I've only done one other one of these before.
L:  Oh, you have done one other?
R:  Yeah, but it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- was really bad, so [LAUGH] I don't -- 'cause I just --
L:  What was your -- what was your experience?
R:  Um, we were talking about marriage or family values, I guess.  And we only talked --
L: Oh, goodness.
R:  -- for like a minute and then he just said, "Okay, you know, see you later" and I said, "Okay, bye".  And then I hung up and I thought, "Well, that's odd" 'cause I know we're supposed to do it for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And then I talked to a lady I work with at school who actually is the wife of someone indirectly involved with the study, some- --
