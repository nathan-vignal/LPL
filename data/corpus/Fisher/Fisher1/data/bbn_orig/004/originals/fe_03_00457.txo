R:  Hi, I'm Annie.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah Rose.
R:  Um, uh, [MN] well, I'm in, uh, Austin, Texas.  And you?
L:  I'm in Orlando, Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  So -- so, uh, we both probably enjoy a lot of days during the year where it's nice outside to do outdoor activities.
L:  A lot of the day.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, um, I'll -- I'll go ahead and start.  Um, today since I'm, um, block captain on our -- in our -- I'm one of the block captains in our neighborhood association and, um, it's -- it's dues collection time and also to, uh, let all the, um, the neighbors know that there is going to be a, um, a meeting and al- -- and also a -- a representative from the Police Department to talk about the neighborhood crime watch.  Um, and just to update all the phone numbers and everything.  So, I took my baby out with me and we went knocking on doors this afternoon because we had -- I think we probably hit seventy today.
L:  Oh dear, how old is the baby?
R:  Oh, she's [MN] she'll be one in about two weeks.
L:  Ah, that's a good age.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Well, we haven't been able to go out much here today.  It's very cold.
R:  Oh.
L:  In fact I talked to someone from home, I'm from Kentucky, and it was actually colder here last night than it was there.
R:  No kidding.  That's more -- [MN]
L:  No kidding.
R:  That's more sunny -- [several inaudible words]
L:  If you think Florida's always sunny, it's not.  
R:  Uh --
L:  I've lived here a year and a half now and this is the first really cold, cold spell.  It was down to twenty nine here last night.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And they were worrying about the citrus crop.
R:  [MN]
L:  But it seems like it's kind of a good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- time for the citrus crop because it's at a stage where it should make it sweeter if it gets chilled.
R:  Oh, okay.  So a couple -- a couple of cold days then help the crop?
L:  Yeahs.
R:  Okay.
L:  A couple of cold days won't hurt.
R:  All right.
L:  And what do you do outside this -- [MN] with the block thing?  Is it --
R:  Well --
L:  -- mostly like a neighborhood watch?
R:  That's -- that's what -- it was -- it was, oh, [MN] a once a year kind of a thing and I -- I've been waiting for a nice weekend to do it and, um, t- [MN] -- and today was the -- was the first half of that.  I didn't quite [NOISE] finish because, um, because some of the neighbors d- [MN] like to -- like to chat and, um, and it took a little bit longer than I thought.  But I'm going to see if I can, uh, wrap it up between tomorrow and [NOISE] -- and maybe part of next weekend.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, sometimes it's a good thing to get out and chat with neighbors and meet them.
R:  Absolutely, in fact --
L:  They're [inaudible] Now that helps.  
R:  In fact the one that -- that I, uh, spent the most of the time with was, uh, someone who'd just moved in next door.  And I had waved to -- to them a couple of times but I never actually meet 'em until today.  And, uh, they own a, um, they're -- they're from, originally from New York and I grew up in Connecticut, um, so -- so I detected their accent but, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but they own -- they own a -- a -- an Italian restaurant here in, um, well, [MN] you know, in town where we live.  So that was, um, that was pretty cool.
L:  Oh, that is cool.
R:  I tell you, I would [SIGH] much rather go around and meet the neighbors than do what I'll be doing in about, um, uh, sometime in March probably.  And that's when the yard work starts.  And that's just a --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- every weekend thing.  Every weekend the yard -- the grass has to be cut and, uh ...
L:  I love yard work.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Actually one of the things that I miss about living in an apartment, in my apartment in Kentucky I had a patio so I was able to grow things --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- out there.  Here, because it's so hot, the senior apartments don't have patios.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so the hardest thing I had to get used to was not growing anything outside.  I finally have some things started inside.  [NOISE]  So that helps.
R:  [MN] okay.
L:  What kind -- do you like hot weather or cold weather the best?
R:  Um, I -- I've had -- I spent half my life in, um, in the nor- northern states and -- and, yeah, I've -- I've had enough of ice and snow and cold.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I -- I can put up with a -- with a few months of really, really hot beastly weather.  Um, [NOISE] um, um, and -- a- a- and ac- -- and actually I don't go out anymore than I have to in the, um -- when it's really hot out, when it's a hundred out.  [NOISE]
L:  I don't either because I have a heart condition but I really like being able to go out and swim more.  My kids have a pool and so I spend a lot of time at the pool in the summer.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  And I hope you remember your SPF thirty. 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, yes.  In fact I had a really good lesson with that.  My daughter-in-law is going to college so I sat out and watched all of the children, including the neighborhood ones for, like, six hours one day and it was cloudy.  So I didn't think I needed sunscreen.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I got a really good sunburn, a bad one.  So I learned my lesson.  Yes, I definitely am wearing sunscreen.
R:  Well, that's good.  It's too bad that, um, that those kind of, um, lessons have to be the hard learned ones, but, um --
L:  Yes, even those of us who are older sometimes have to learn through to experience.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you ju- [MN] hope and pray your kids don't have to le- learn things the hard way and you --
L:  Well you know --
R:  -- can teach 'em but ...
L:  -- You try but you can't always save your children [LAUGH] from things.  Sometimes moms --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to stay in back and let them learn on their own.  And that's really hard to do.
R:  I -- I hear you.  But it's -- how -- [MN] it's the -- [MN] -- a- actually I'm -- I'm thinking of ones that you don't figure out yourself until your forty, and it's just like I don't want my daughter to have to go through this, you know, for the next, um, twenty five years.  I want her to know now what I -- what I've taken this long to figure out.
L:  That's right.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  And there are a lot of those things you can do.
R:  Mm.
L:  Let's see, what else do I like to do outside.  I love to walk.
R:  Oh, especially when, like, when it starts to cool down, like in the evening.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Like in summer and stuff.
L:  And even though I'm, like, in the middle of the downtown area there are one, two three -- three lakes in our immediate vicinity.
R:  Oh.
L:  So you can walk to, like, Lake Cherokee in the morning and it's like being out in the country in the middle of the city because there are all kinds of ducks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and blue herons.
R:  Wow.
L:  And a lot of wild life.
R:  That -- that's wonderful.
L:  I mean, And so --
R:  That's a paradise.
L:  -- that's really fun.  You can get away.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just far enough away.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, how- -- how about, um, uh, Disney World?  How close are you to that?
L:  We're about an hour from Disney World.
R:  Okay.
L:  We went to Fort Wilderness about two weeks ago and had lunch and looked at the animals and all that good stuff.  And then a friend of my son and daughter in law's worked for Disney so we were able to get passes to go to the Animal Kingdom.
R:  I'm telling you, [NOISE] it's who you know in this life.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Connections.  [LAUGH]  Networking.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  It just makes thing a whole lot easier, doesn't it?
L:  Oh, it really does.  It's nice and I've been really fortunate because my son and daughter in law's friends have kind of adopted me.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I get invited for all the holidays.
R:  How nice.
L:  And I don't have to cook anymore for the holidays.
R:  [LAUGH]  You don't miss doing that turkey once a year?
L:  Yes, actually I do miss it.  And ... -- but, you know, it's kind of nice being treated like a queen.
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow.[MN]
L:  I'm really fortunate.  I've got a great daughter in law.
R:  Oh, what a great thing to say.
L:  Well, actually I have three great daughter in laws.  Just one of them lives here though.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I'm really fortunate because they're really more like daughters than daughter in laws.
R:  It's really refreshing to hear that.  But --
L:  It's been nice.
R:  But I -- But I'm sure your half of the deal.  I'm sure that -- that, um, you -- you wouldn't have a great relationship with them if you weren't a wonderful person too.
L:  Well, I kind of stand back and give advice or -- that if I'm asked [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and that helps a lot.
R:  I think it [MN] --
L:  And then I had lived with them a year while I waited to get my apartment and --
R:  What -- Oh, is it like a -- is there like a waiting list?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And since my daughter in law, my youngest daughter in law --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has been is in college and I'm a retired teacher, I got to be her tutor.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And so we -- you know, we really have had a lot of fun --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because we can talk about everything.  If my son knew some of the things we talked about!.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's kind of nice.
R:  Well, that's -- that's great.  Well, I -- I -- you know, while I was sitting here I was waiting quite a while for them to, um, get another caller and I was wondering whether I was going to get some poor
