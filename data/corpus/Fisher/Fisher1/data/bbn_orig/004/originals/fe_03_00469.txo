L:  My name's Regina Hyatt.
R:  Hi, my name is Crystal.  And I guess we just talk about the topic?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I like to -- I like to eat at home.  I like stuff that's home made and 
R:  I do as well.  I like to cook a lot.  I'm from, um, Scots and Italian parentage and the cooking is the b- -- and -- and -- and meals are the big social event.  So we all get caught up.  So 
L:  Really?
R:  Home -- home cooked food brings back a lot of good memories and gives me a chance to unwind.
L:  I can cook but I can't do like, noodles.  You know, home made noodles.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Gravy, that [LAUGH] type of stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband does my pie shells and things like that but 
R:  [LAUGH]  I can't cook pie shells to save my life.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've tried.  I've heard the trick is to put a -- a dash of vinegar in and it makes them light and fluffy.  But I haven't even tried that.
L:  I don't even dare.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't either.
L:  I [LAUGH].  Oh, golly.  Um, I think one of the main things that is eaten the most around here is chili and meat loaf.  My husband likes those real well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I'm not a big meat loaf eater.  I eat it when it's first made.
R:  Mhm.
L:  After that, then he eats it in his bucket at -- for lunch or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever, until it's gone.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and that's kind of -- kind of what happens around here.  I'm like you.  I like it hot out of the oven and after that I'm done with it.
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Everybody else ca- --
L:  But now, y- you can fix me a salad and I can eat 'em seven days a week.
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know.
R:  I'm the same way.  I've just started eating a lot more fish, so I'm cooking a lot more fish here at home.  So I'm doing a lot of, like, salmon croquettes or salmon patties and -- and things like that.  The problem is I'm in -- I'm in central Texas and that means that there's -- there's a lot of fish from the -- from the Gulf that's flown in.
L:  Right.
R:  But stuff, like salmon. 
L:  Mm.
R:  It's -- it's here but it's just not as good as it was when I lived up north.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I bet.  I'm from Indiana so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- we don't get, you know, a whole lot of fresh. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ours is boxed and precooked and, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then if we want like the salmon -- course now we can get like, the canned salmon. 
R:  Yeah, and that's --
L:  But ...
R:  -- what I use to do the croquettes.
L:  Um, my husband will eat it but he -- you know, he likes to fish in the nice weather and then have his catfish and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, things like that.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, I'm not --
R:  Like, I -- I spent my teen years in Cincinnati so I know what you're talking about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  One thing I do miss, we were up there in October, and the one thing that I really miss down here is all the squash and -- all the falls produce that comes in.
L:  Mm, yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, when I -- when I was up there in October visiting my parents with my husband and little girl, we, uh, we went out to the farmers markets and I was cooking dinner every night, and it was usually some kind of squash and, you know, a chicken or some beef or something.  But, I was making the most of my time with the veggies up there.
L:  Right.  I love it when they start coming on the, you know, green tomatoes.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We like them fried.  The zucchini we liked fried.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Or the --
L:  And then, course spring's not too far away and my husband likes to go mushroom hunting, and that's the only way he'll eat mushrooms.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  
R:  I've n- --
L:  He won't eat 'em out of a can or --
R:  I have never gone mushroom hunting.
L:  [MN]
R:  Even though we lived up there.  I n -- had never gone.
L:  Well, I had never had 'em until after I married him and that was eighteen years ago, because I was raised up in Northern Indiana.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you didn't hear of that up there.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  You know.  And, uh, they're not bad, believe me. 
R:  Good.
L:  They are really good.  Fresh and cleaned and soaked in salt water overnight.  And then fried, oh! [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  But we just can't get enough of 'em, you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- know what I'm saying.  [LAUGH]  That's one of those things that [COUGH] you want more and you don't have 'em.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  No, down here they use a lot of, uh, in Texas, they use a lot of tomatoes, and they're gr- kind of a greenish tomato and then, of course, they do sell green tomatoes.  And my husband was born and raised in Houston and, um, he had --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- never had fried green tomatoes or anything like that.  
L:  Oh my.
R:  Until -- until I made 'em for him.  And -- [LAUGH]  And I kept telling him, this is a religion, this is a food.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  These are a religion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, so now I get requests every once in a while to make stuff like and, uh 
L:  Right.  We do a --
R:  And, you know, I do chili but it's not like the chili down here.  The chili down here will set your socks on fire.  But the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- chili I'm used to it's, you know, something to stay in your belly during the cold months and that's it.
L:  Right.  Uh, [MN] you know, if they wanted it any hotter than what I make it they can add the spices and stuff after it's made.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  In their bowl, not mine.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  We do a lot of canning, too.  I love home done tomato juice with [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know that's -- and I can drink it by the gallon.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's good stuff.
L:  Yes.
R:  When I was growing up -- I have family in the Ozark Mountains.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, the Scots all, kind of, settled in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri, and they did all their own canning and my aunt used to always send us down to go get, [SIGH] you know, "Crystal, go down and get some beets" or, "Go down and get some tomatoes" or, "Go "  And -- and I had to go -- there's a cellar with an outside door and we had to go down into the -- the root cellar which is -- it looked kinda like a can[?].  It was like a huge, uh, whole in the ground set in the side of a hill and, um, there was like, a little hill that was the cellar and, uh  
L:  Mm.
R:  So we'd go in there with the flashlight and try to find whatever it was we were asked to get.  
L:  Oh my.
R:  But, uh, I miss -- I kind of miss the canned beans. 
L:  Oh, the green beans.
R:  The taste of -- the taste of home canned green beans.  There's nothing like it.  [LAUGH]  It's -- it's really good, and you know --
L:  Now, see, my mother, when we were kids, we always had a garden every year but she never canned the green beans.  She always, um, blanched 'em, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- snapped 'em, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cleaned 'em.  Blanched 'em and then froze 'em.
R:  Now, I've -- I know that there are a lot of people that did that but I think, you know, they just kind of got to where they canned everything and kept it out there because in their freezer they could keep meat.  They'd butcher --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a cow, you know.
L:  Right.  See --
R:  They -- and my aunt actually kept a pig -- for, uh, several years she kept pigs.  Um.
L:  See, I didn't -- I wasn't raised that way.
R: [NOISE]
L:  You know, Mom and Dad always went to the store.  They bought the meat.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, the vegetables and things of that nature --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- is what we -- can -- or, well the tomatoes were canned and, you know, stuff like that.  But the beans and the corn, things like that, went in the freezer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And there's nothing like a fresh pot of green beans with potatoes and a little bit of bacon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nope, you're right. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I just started -- I just started cooking that again down here.  Um, I hadn't been making it for years and years but my, um, my little girl, you know, I'm trying to get her to eat properly and everything and -- and so I'm doing a lot more home style cooking for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for her.  And my husband's starting to finally taste the foods that I grew up with.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think he likes it.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, my husband and I go out usually on Friday after he gets paid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because we got out, we pay the bills.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And I feel like he deserves at least to go out once a week, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]  He's worked all week and, uh, [NOISE] I -- I just feel like he -- you know, it's a treat to him.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I picked up -- my husband's off work today 'cause he works for a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a corporation that's owned by --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  the state and so he has today off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so I went out -- when I was out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing my errands this morning --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- I picked up sushi.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh my.  
R:  You know we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had California rolls for lunch. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Which is kind of a -- a nice treat but it's the same thing. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's like, this is something a little different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than, "Let's get your potatoes and meat and bread [inaudible] for the week".  
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [NOISE].
R:  So.
L:  Right.  And as you can tell I have dogs.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband just got home from work.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and they know who it is.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  They do.
L:  But they still have to bark like they don't know who's coming in the door.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  But the, uh, anyways 
L:  Now, do you know how long we're supposed to talk for these conversations?
R:  I really don't know.  I thought it said ten minutes and I didn't look at the clock, so   [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't either.  Um, uh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I have a doctor's appointment this evening and I couldn't remember, and I thought, well, I don't know if they'll just cut us off or if we have to -- you know, they really didn't say.  
R:  No, they didn't, they didn't.
L:  It just said that we would get, you know, ten dollars for each phone conversation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which, you know, my husband just went back to work.  He had to have surgery back in November, so pay checks have been slim and none for the last --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- couple of months.  You know.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  So, that's   And I -- I enjoy doing the surveys over the computer and some of 'em I get mailed to me, you know.
R:  That's neat.
L:  Different companies that, you know, have sent stuff through the mail and stuff like that, so 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it gives me something to do.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  Nothing wrong with that.  But 
L:  So you -- 
R:  Well, I imagine --
L:  -- only have the one little girl then?
R:  Yeah, we do.  We only have one little girl.  We, um, [LIPSMACK] we got married and six weeks later found out I was pregnant, so  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I apparently got m- -- got pregnant on our honeymoon.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which made it -- made it very interesting because I had just moved -- we'd just moved from, uh, where we went to college in Pennsylvania down to Texas, which is Don's home state.  And then I was already trying to make that adjustment, and then making the adjustment to being a married woman, and then making an adjustment to being a mommy.  [LAUGH]
L:  To be a mommy.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, really. 
R:  It was q- quite a --
L:  How long have you been married?
R:  Uh, we got married in two thousand.
L:  Oh.
R:  We've been married -- yeah, so almost three --
L:  So, she's little.
R:  Yeah, she's just -- she's going to be two, um, in a couple of weeks here.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  So  [LAUGH]  We're, uh, we're having a good time except that she's just learned how to tell us "no" and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and, you know, she's --
L:  It's fun!
R:  -- just fussy.  She gets fussy at mealtime, especially, for some reason.  She can't seem to sit still and, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I feel like I have to do everything but stand on my head to get food in her, so 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like today she had --
L:  But, you know, they go through that.
R:  Yeah, I know, and I figure, you know, she misses the occasional meal she's certainly not going to starve to death.  She's getting, uh, raisins or grapes or some kind of fruit and some juice --
L:  And she'll let you know --
R: -- in between.
L:  -- if she's hungry.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  There may be a few days that she don't eat hardly anything but that's -- that's par for the course.  That's part of growing up.
R:  Yeah.  But 
L:  I sit and -- Friday night we'd went out to, uh
