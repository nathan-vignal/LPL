L:  Okay.  Wh- -- what do you like to eat, at home or restaurant?  [NOISE]
R:  I like to eat at home.
L:  Well ...
R:  I would like to eat more often outside.
L:  [LAUGH]  I know what you mean.  I would too, but I can't afford it.
R:  Um, uh, for me it's not a matter of money, it's a matter of quality.
L:  Yeah.  I understand that.  Uh, I'd just rather eat sometimes at home.  I can fix my own food, you know.  And stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, gosh, what else did he say [NOISE] we're supposed to do?  I can't remember.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, what we're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  supposed to do.  I think to talk about food now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  What kind of food do you like?  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I like to eat a lot of variety o- -ties of -- of fruit and vegetable and meat and fish.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I very, mm, I really try to keep a diet, you know, correct diet but, uh, you know, the society and the [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do not go this way and I found myself eating, uh, sometimes, a way that I would like not to eat.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we -- we get -- we get in -- in -- in the -- this eating habit, uh, we -- it's [MN] with not healthy.
L:  Yes.
R:  We don't take the time, you know.  We eat to --
L:  Yes, I understand that.
R:  You know we are on the earth, you know, to work, to have some fun.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  To save some money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But also to take time to eat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To take time for a bath.  To take time --
L:  Yes.
R:  for -- for -- to take care of yourself.
L:  Yes, I understand that.
R:  And it --
L:  I really do.
R:  Yeah, and it's a shame that, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I talk to people, very often people said, "Oh no, we don't have time for dinner together.  We don't have time for breakfast together".  We --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's a shame because, you know, sharing food at the table, and -- and for one hour or two, is a wonderful time.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  It's very intimacy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's de- distressful.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's not hard to fix a good meal, you know.
L:  No, it's not.
R:  It's -- it's not hard.
L:  No it's not.  I got five people in my family.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  And so I -- I fix their meal everyday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If my husband's not here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then me and my kids will sit down and eat together.
R:  Yes.  Absolutely, you know.  And it's -- it's fun because the children set the table and -- but, you know, we have to educate the children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as -- as a party, not as a -- a duty.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, as a party and -- and we -- you can't just said, "Oh, I don't like.  I don't like that".  How many things you don't like?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you c- -- it's okay not -- y- you know, maybe you don't like two or three vegetables --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but eight or ten you like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, I try everything once and if I don't like it, you know, I don't -- I won't eat it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I pretty well eat all my vegetables and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]  Because it's good for you.
R:  Yes.  At least, you know, I try to teach the children that sometimes we eat for fun.  Sometimes we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eat because we have to eat.
L:  Yeah.  Because if you don't eat you will die.
R:  Yes, and also, you know, if you don't eat peas -- you don't like peas, but, uh, the peas do not make you sick.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you don't like carrots, and you don't like cereal [MN] you know, that's not good.  We have to -- I told my children, "Eat first what you don't like so much, and after you eat last what you like".
L:  Yeah.  That's it.  I --
R:  And to teach --
L:  -- agree with you one hun- --
R:  -- also, yes.  The -- the -- the [inaudible], you know, the -- the vitamin part and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nutrition part and it stop very early in age and I -- I very careful about that and --
L:  Yes.
R:  And when I go out, or when people invite me, and always I get compliment because my children eat a lot of things and they know how to eat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they talk and say, "They are like little adults".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's wonderful, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's wonderful.
L:  I praise you on that, raising your kids right.
R:  Mm.  Thank you.
L:  I praise you because I've got three of my own.
R:  Mm.
L:  And she's -- one eighteen, one fourteen and one twelve.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And so I've pretty well, you know, I'll let the kids, you know, if they -- if they -- if they don't like it they can spit it out.
R:  Mm.
L:  But at least they try.
R:  Yes.
L:  They try it.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, when [NOISE] and everything.  And they eat cereal a lot and stuff like that.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's real stuff real good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you need to eat it because if you don't your body ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm --
R:  That's --
L:  -- going into process that sa- -- that right now, going to exercises and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Trying to build up my body.
R:  Yes.  We -- we have to teach also that, you know, dead food is for dying people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we eat too much dead food.  We should eat more food with life, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The food we eat -- cereal is very -- it's a dead food.  That's okay to eat cereal but not like, uh, your basic meal everyday.
L:  Yeah.  I un- -- I understand that, you know.
R:  It's a shame that even, you know, in -- on TV and they push us to buy food already prepared.
L:  Oh, that's all you see on TV.  And what you see on TV's the wrong things they showing.
R:  Yes.
L:  And [NOISE] they make you go out and buy it. 
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, I eat yogurt and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, sometime I'm very angry with the FDA.  If I have money and power I will sue the FDA.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they know what is good and what is not good.
L:  That's -- that's right.  
R:  But it -- it --
L:  That's -- I agree with you whatsoever.
R:  Yes, and it's so, uh, big a business today, you know.  Nobody cares exactly -- nobody care too much about the other.  Like, it's a business sins.
L:  I know it.  I know that.  I tell -- that's all you -- that's the reason I hate turning on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And all they show is that junk food.
R:  Yes.  Did you note sometimes when you go to grocery store, at the cashier, you know, when you go to pay your -- your food.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They don't know the name of a -- of the vegetable.  Have you noticed that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They say, "Oh, what is that?"  I --
L:  I know!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  So many times people ask me, "What is it?"  I say, "Endives".  "Oh, what is that?"  "Beet".  "What is that?"  "Leek".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They don't know.
L:  Yeah -- I under- -- I know.  I know.  You know.
R:  They -- they know carrots, salad and pepper.  That's it.  That they know.  That's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, potatoes. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, that's it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But something else more fancy they don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, not even fancy, you know, it just food.
L:  It just food but they don't know what we're eating.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  [inaudible] "What are you going to eat?"  I said, "What is this?"  It looks like a -- a lettuce and stuff like that, it's real good for you.  I -- I think they all they eat -- they think to eat is candy and stuff like that.  That's all you -- when you go check out that's where it's right there.
R:  Mhm, yeah, yes.
L:  Candy.  And my kids, you know, I can't let -- they're kids.  "Momma, can I have this?"  I don't deprive them of candy.  I give 'em candy but they don't eat it all the time.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Because candy's not good for you.
R:  Yes, and candy, it's okay for sometimes, but not everyday.
L:  Yeah, and that's what -- mostly if you s- go out and look in this world today, that's what people lives on, is restaurants.
R:  Mhm.  Yes, you know, the eating habit today it's like -- it's like, um, uh, some things, uh, like an entertainment and is not always entertainment.
L:  No.
R:  You know, you don't eat because -- it's like you play Nintendo because you like to play Nintendo.  To eat, it's -- it's a-- a -- a -- you know, it should be somethings between having fun and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and also get -- getting the nutrition.
L: Yeah.
R:  And is not like some things you do because -- in front of TV because you have to do somethings.  It's something's very important.
L:  Yes, it is.  Because if you don't get no more nourishment in your body your body's gonna go down.
R:  Mm.  And all sorts of value, like, you know, couples need to get together everyday --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- you know, in the bedroom for -- to talk sometimes.  You know, to talk about the day.  And I think that eating time is to get the family together and share.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Share what's happened during the day.  Especially at school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and talk, you know.  To get to know your children and --
L:  Yes.
R:  We have every day at least one hour for dinner, at least, every day and forty five minutes, at least, for breakfast.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know that is unusual but in France it's what we have.  At least two hours for dinner everyday.  We are at the table all together.  We eat and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we talk. 
L:  I understand that.
R:  And we talk and we talk and we talk.  You know, we have so much to say.  Because if yo don't talk to your kids somebody else will do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And believe me, it won't be the good thing.
L:  Yeah, it won't be nothing because they'll get 'em into something, bad trouble.
R:  Yes.
L:  I tr- -- I spend time with my kids everyday and I praise you for doing the same thing.  You know, a lot of peoples don't do that.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  And I praise you for doing that.
R:  Oh, thank you.  I praise you too.
L:  Well ...
R:  That's wonderful to hear because it's not very often.
L:  Yeah, because you don't hardly see no -- many people out today.  They'll just drop their kids off and say, "Well, you do what you gotta do and Mom and Daddy will be gone for a while".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not me.
R:  Yeah.  No.
L:  I take my kids right with me.
R:  Yes.  You know, children need a lot of attention and needs family time.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's amazing.  We go, you know, we have -- we have a tendency to -- to -- to try to get this family time but today the family time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- should be in the house.  But the family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- time is out of the house.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  That the Mom drive the kids to the sport, and she wait one hour or one hour and thirty minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And talks to the other mom about stupidity.  You know, superficiality, and they come home.  They stop in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the -- in their way to McDonalds.
L:  Uh, yeah, huh huh.  I --
R:  That -- that's not family time.
