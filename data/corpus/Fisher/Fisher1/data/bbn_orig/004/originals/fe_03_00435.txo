R:  Hi, I'm Kim from Florida.
L:  Hi, I'm Greg from San Francisco.
R:  Uh, and we're just -- I -- this is my first call.  We're just supposed to start talking about the topic?
L:  I guess.  This is my first call, too.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So  I don't know, it's supposed to do with corporate scandals in America?
R:  Yes, I guess on how it's affecting our lives and whether it's causing the recession and, uh, um -- I don't think it's had that much effect on my life, like directly, um, right now.  We -- [COUGH] we have some money in 401Ks but, um, we don't have a lot in stocks right now.  Um, what about you?
L:  Uh, pretty much the same thing.  I -- I don't think it really affects me directly, but I -- I'm one of those people that, kind of, indirectly thinks that this government is responsible for all this anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I -- I -- I agree with that too.  I think that, um, I -- I -- I wouldn't say I'm a democrat but I'm definitely, um I think that the Bush administration is so pro-business that, um, I mean, if this hadn't happened I think they would have loosened the reins even more and we could've really ended up with a much bigger problem.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, I'd have to say that too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I think that, uh, I think the problem is that if our government is being run by these corporate guys, and their money is what's funding these politicians and, in turn, they get laws that make corporate rules, like accounting and things like that, more lax.  And they get away with more things.  And when they do an investigation it's not really an investigation, it's more, "Oh, what -- what else can I get away with?" 
R:  Oh, exactly.  I -- I agree exactly.  My whole thing is -- has always been that unless there is complete public financing of campaigns this -- none of this will ever end because, I mean, th- they're beholden to special interests in who pays for their campaigns and, um, I mean, it's just inevitable.  If you want to stay in -- a politician you have to take their money.
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  So, um, I -- I -- that's always been one of my pet peeves a- although, you know, they always couch it in terms of you're anti free speech if you are for, you know, government funding of campaigns.  There's no reason they can't last, like maybe a month or two, and not these thirty second, you know, attack as in sound [inaudible] but have to, you know, take an hour and really explain their policies and not take any money from special interests.
L:  Oh, definitely.  And I don't really think there is, you know, that many anyways.  A lot of them are -- are pretty well all businessmen or, as in the president's case, he basically was handed his fortune by his dad, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I don't -- I don't really see how corporate financing really helps them anyway.  It just makes them richer.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  For whatever reason that's, you know, [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I almost feel like special interests picked Bush.  B- you know what I mean, rather than the other -- Bush decided to run and -- and then he went and got the money.  I think the money came to him.  [MN] --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Because they knew what he, um, you know, that he would support.  I -- I just think he's just, I'm not even sure how -- I mean, I think I -- he feels things strongly, but I'm not sure how bright he is as far as, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know, that, you know, I mean, how deep I guess I would say.  
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um ...
L:  I'm just curious.  How -- how does this call thing supposed to work, do you now?
R:  I'm not sure.  I think -- I think they're just studying like, the way we speak.  I think it's like, a linguistic --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- um, exercise.  So, I mean, I think they just pick a topic for us to talk about and then study our speech patterns and, I don't -- I -- that's the gist that I got out of it, um, and I don't know how -- I -- do you know how long it's supposed to last?
L:  That's what I'm not sure about it either.  I'm not sure if they're supposed to end it, like all of a sudden or --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure either.
L:  -- press a button on the phone or something or --
R:  Are you --
L:  -- how long to go for.
R:  Um, are you from San Francisco?
L:  Born and raised in San Francisco, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I'm not there right now, per se, but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I am.
R:  I'm -- I'm from Ohio but I live in Florida now.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm from up by Cleveland and so, I don't know if -- I'm sure there's a lot of dialects and a lot of times you can tell.  I mean, I've spoken on the phone before and, um, someone must have detected an accent because I remember them saying, "Go back to Ohio!"  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  They were mad at me and it was -- I think I -- w- when I was volunteering for a tenant's, um, union where you help tenants out and [LAUGH]. 
L:  I didn't know people from Ohio had accents.
R:  I didn't think I did either, but, uh ...
L:  I've never noticed one.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The only times I've noticed an accent is if someone's either from Boston, New York or somewhere in the south, like Tennessee or Georgia, or something.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  But other than that, I don't really, like, hear any accents from anywhere else in the country.
R:  I know, I d- I don't know if my ears just not attuned or, um, but I didn't think I had an accent until he said that and I'm like, "Wow!  That's really strange".  Um.
L:  But then again, maybe people on the east coast think that everyone else has an accent, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that could be.  I can't remember, yeah, I don't know where he was from.  I don't remember detecting that big a accent with him.  Um ...
L:  That's interesting [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But, uh ...  How many -- so, we'll -- we'll do like, two to four of these calls, or ...?
L:  I think they said the maximum you get is, like, uh, was it ten calls, I think?
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- that's fine with me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  I- i- it's kind of interesting.  Um, but --
L:  And they pay us for it, so 
R:  -- are you -- would you consider yourself a democrat or independent or ...?
L:  I'd -- I'd say independent more in favor of democrats than republican for sure.
R:  Yeah, I consider myself independent more but, like, I would say, socially I'm more, um, [LIPSMACK] liberal.  In [MN] -- um, I don't know I g- I -- and I used to be much more liberal.  I'm forty one and -- and as I age I think I get a little more conservative but on, like, core issues I don't, but I -- I guess on, um, I don't know, welfare and things like that, I -- my views are evolving a little bit.  Or are like, I mean, some people might say the opposite, that they're regressing but I consider them evolving, like I'm --
L:  Oh, I think as -- as we get older it starts to apply more.
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  So it affects you more, so, yeah, of course, I can see how that would come into play.  But I'm only twenty five, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I probably don't see it the same way you do, at this point, but eventually I probably will.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, --
L:  Especially if things don't improve.
R:  -- I always found like, um, but I think it's the same, because I think there's, you know, probably ten times more corporate welfare than there is, like, regular, you know, welfare.  I guess, I -- I've just found in me personally, is that, like, I used to always help people out financially and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I -- that seemed, like, down on their luck, and I would either never get paid back and -- and I think I've finally come to the point where I realise that you don't help people by doing that.  You know what I mean.  You're just like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- prolonging a problem and it took me a while.  And I almost think the same with welfare, that you ha- you can, you know, try to teach them or, um, but when you just keep throwing money at something i- i- you're just prolonging it.
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  So.
L:  But I -- I agree.  I think corporate welfare is more substantial than it is for individuals.  Just because, I mean, you can even look at the bankruptcy thing, companies getting bailed out by the government just because they --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they screwed up.  If it was you or I that screwed up, "Ah, too bad".  You know, and it's like, yeah, you file for bankruptcy and you're screwed for years.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and with them it's nothing.  In fact, we bought our house, um, [LIPSMACK] through the -- I don't -- you might be too young to remember, it was RTC when the savings and loan, uh, -- I think it ended up being like half a trillion dollars which, at the time was a lot of money, and it was bailing out the savings and loan which is the same thing.  They took -- they took off the, um, regulatory, you know, they deregulated and, um, didn't have a lot of oversight and -- and one of the Bush's sons was one of the, um -- [LIPSMACK] he -- h- a bank he was involved with went under too, but anyway they had -- they like, made so many poor loans that they were, like, there was so much real estate all over the country that they had to get rid of, and so we ended up getting a house through that and --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah, w- i- for a very good price, um.  But, yeah, because they -- the government had to bail 'em out.  Just take over everything.
L:  Geez.
R:  [MN] There are -- are probably hundreds of savings and loans that they had to do this to, but in, you know, the -- the problem is, like, we got a house but most everything was, um, a lot of times, like, you know, the big businesses would turn around and get this stuff, probably, you know, configured in a different way.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it might have been one corporation that did this and then they turned around and, you know, made out because they got property for so cheap, but ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, sorry to change the subject, but I'm reading the email right now and it says, "You may participate in up to three calls".  So I guess they call you a few times and as soon as you've completed three calls then that's it.
R:  Okay.  Now, so do we go -- does it say how long you talk or ...?
L:  No, it doesn't.  It just says, "If you don't want to participate in the topic then you hang up and they'll call you back in forty eight hours".  But that's all it says in regards to hanging up --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and ending calls.  It doesn't say anything else.
R:  I can just see us talking for, like, half hour, forty five minutes and not realising that you can hang up at any time.  I -- yeah, I didn't
