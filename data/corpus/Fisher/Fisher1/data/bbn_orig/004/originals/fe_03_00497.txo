L:  Hi, I'm Donna.
R:  Hi, Donna.  I'm, Thelma.
L:  Hi Thelma.  Do you believe that the weather infl- -- or, you know, the seasons influence?
R:  Oh, heavens, yes.  In several different ways, don't you?
L:  Oh my God, yeah.  You know, I -- I moved up from Florida --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a year and a half ago to Ohio.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, it's the reverse.  When I moved to Florida I went like, nine months without a sinus problem and then I come back up here and it was like, nine months and now it's all starting over again.  And it's just amazing how, this is going to sound stupid, how much earlier it gets dark up here than it does in Florida and how depressing that it is.
R:  Well, especially this year.  But in -- in fact, more than sinus is arthritis is bad.  Uh, people with breathing, you know, problems.  It affects quite -- quite rapidly too this year.
L:  I know.  You know, I -- I try to fight, you know, it -- the -- with the wind chill it was one degree here today and I'm not used to this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  And so whenever I get the first inkling that I'm getting sick I pop a bunch of echinacea.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, does it work?
L:  Oh, it really and truly does.  Uh, my boss told me about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I've  got it and, you know, it says to take it every day.  Well, I don't do that.  I mean, I take my -- I'm a cancer survivor so I -- you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I take my vitamins like I should and everything.  But at the first sign that I'm getting a sore throat or anything like that, I take like, three echinacea and it really does work.
R:  See, I -- I've been raised right here.  I'm in Pennsylvania, Erie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've had sinus and allergy problems all my life.  But this year I've got arthritis, so ...
L:  Oh, what a --
R:  Now, does this weather upset the, um, even though you- you've survived the cancer?
L:  I -- I'm sorry --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't get that.  Does the weather what?
R:  Um, does that, uh, even though you have survived cancer, does that affect?
L:  Yeah.  Um, I mean, I've changed my whole attitude and everything, you know, since the cancer.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, I -- I think [SIGH] the weather affects me more because I -- I think after a cancer diagnosis you look at life differently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, there's so many things I want to be doing.  I don't want to be cooped up in an apartment.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's even worse because like, tomorrow's my twenty first wedding anniversary so, I mean, I knew I was making myself sick because my husband's in Florida and I'm here.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  
L:  And I went down and spent the twentieth with him last year.  But this year I said, "You know I just hate to use a week's vacation in January".
R:  Yet, what better time with this weather?
L:  Well, yeah, but then it makes the rest of the year, when you only have one week, seem to go forever.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, know what I mean?  So, it's like [SIGH] this weather, it's just -- it's -- I -- I know that part of it is mental.
R:  Well, I don't -- I really believe this winter weather has been, uh, the worst we've had in a long time.  
L:  Well, you know, that's -- last year I kept s- -- you know, and be- -- I've been south for twelve years and when I -- I kept telling my daughter, "I can take the cold, I can't take the snow".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, 'cause I -- I didn't want to drive in it.  Well, I was lucky, I found an apartment three -- less than four miles from where I work, so I don't have to drive on the snow.  So now I think [LAUGH] I've mastered that.  Now, I -- you know, and they keep the roads clean, now I think that the weather is making me just feel depressed and sick and ...  You know, 'cause you go to work, you go to the grocery store, you come home and you stay inside, you don't do anything else.
R:  Well, you know, that is true.  The weather does have an emotional strain on us, I think.
L:  Oh.  I believe that a hundred and ten percent because I've never been, well, I mean, down south you don't have the cold but ...
R:  No. 
L:  Uh, I've been sicker and I feel worse and it's just I'm gener- generally depressed and the more depressed I get then the worse I feel.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I -- I've noticed though that this winter the weather has been severely cold.  Uh, the snow I can handle.  I think it's pretty when it first comes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, this coldness.  
L:  Well --
R:  It -- it -- it's like a bitter cold.  It goes right to your bones.
L:  Yeah, and I know I shouldn't smoke, but I do.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  And we have to go outside to smoke.
R:  Oh.
L:  Do you know how cold it was today?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-huh.  How far --
L:  I -- that might be part of the reason I'm sick.
R:  [LAUGH]  Where in Ohio do you live?  Um ...
L:  Euclid.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I'm not that far from you.
R:  No.  So, yeah, your weather is basically like ours.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like I said, I -- when I lived up here before I lived right in the middle of the snow belt and, you know -- and I had to drive twenty miles to work and -- well, you talk about get -- being sick.  I mean, I took a lot of sick days because just the idea of going out into the weather.  It would make --
R:  It would affect you.
L:  -- me s- -- would make me sick.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yes, it would.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  But, you know, and they're -- they're saying snow again this weekend, and that makes me think, "Oh, my God, I'll have a cold" and, you know, it's just -- it's ridiculous.  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's funny because rain is also depressing.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think I'd rather that I have it snow because to me, when you're inside looking out, it's so pretty.
L:  That's true.
R:  It's so white and clean and l- like purifies the air.  [MN]
L:  Well, you know, I think part of the reason I make myself sick is -- and I did it more so last year, I'm on a second -- you know, one of the things, I had to find a safe place before my husband would let me stay.  He comes up for, like, five months out of the year.  And, uh, I had to find a place that was safe and everything so I face a parking lot and I can see, you know, the Babbitt Road which takes me up to work.  And I'll wake up five or six times during the night to look out when they're predicting snow.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, that, you know -- and then, I think, you know, if you don't get your rest you're gonna be sick and feel bad and everything and -- and that doesn't help anything.
R:  No, it doesn't.  I -- I don't work.  Uh, my husband's on disability.  He just had a -- a heart thing and so ...
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, no, no.  He needed it and he got it and that's good.  But [MN] I look -- when they, like you said, they predict snow.  And I'm thinking, "Oh, the sidewalk has to be shoveled. The truck has to be brushed off.  How much snow are we getting?", [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, and, I mean, that -- I -- I really believe that depression and illness go hand in hand.  And, I mean, I'm on an antidepressant [LAUGH] [SIGH].  I mean who figures, cancer, my husband's an alcoholic and I'm on an antidepressant, and I mean, who'd ever figure!
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  But -- but, you know, [MN] sometimes that even doesn't help.  I mean, I get depressed, and when I get depressed I get sick, and then I get more depressed 'cause I'm sick.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, that's funny because they -- they're thinking about putting my husband on one.  He hasn't worked in phew, what, five, six, seven years now, because of his heart.  And m- he -- in fact, he -- he got the heart, uh, it's the mitral valve and some other stuff done, replaced.  And he thought he'd be feeling so much better.  And he's not, and he's not, I mean, [SIGH] I guess that was part of the problem, but he still has other problems and they're trying to figure out what.  So, he's depressed.
L:  Oh.  [MN]  The antidepressants -- they gave them to me because I can't s- -- I couldn't sleep.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean --
R:  No, he can't either.
L:  Okay.  For God's sakes, tell him it's wonderful.  I mean, I -- oh, actually, I got to go take one.  I -- I sometimes -- this is my first call because I just signed up with it.
R:  Mine too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, well, you know, I -- at eight o'clock I'm supposed to take my pills so that I can go to sleep around eleven.  And, um, they -- they gave me, you know, they started me off on like, a twenty five milligram -- or fifty, and I'm now up to a hundred.  But it's been like seven years and --
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, they said that, uh, it's not habit forming.  And it makes -- it makes a major difference.  Like as when I -- I get sick but that's just, you know, tiredness and everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But these help a lot.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Tell him.
R:  Yeah, it's up to the heart doctor whether or not he can take 'em.
L:  Oh, well I would -- I would tell him definitely.  Definitely.
R:  And I've -- I've noticed the difference with weather in him, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you know, it -- it -- I know rain depresses me.  I don't know why but rain does.  But [MN] when it snows I think it's beautiful, as long as I don't have to go out.
L:  Well, that's what it -- I always say, you know, "Let it snow?" i- it's -- and my parking lot, um, they plough it in the morning but, I mean, [MN] when I wake up and I look out at night and there's snow on it, it's wonderful.  But it's -- it's [MN] --
R:  Yeah, isn't it beautiful?
L:  Well, you know, w- um, I think, last year here it only snowed like, twice.  I mean, enough to -- to be on the ground. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I mean, 'cause where -- where I am, I don't know why I don't get it.  My -- my daughter's twenty five miles away with my two granddaughters and her husband and, um, [LIPSMACK] they'll get two feet and I'll be lucky if I have a sprinkling.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I, you know, that was one of the things, you know.  [MN]  I wanted to be close to work and everything, because of the snow, and I know that I do have a tendency to get sick easy.  Um, you know, sinuses, earaches, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- sore throat, the whole works.
R:  Wow.
L:  An- and then that's why, like I said, when I went south I would
