R:  Hi.  My name is Michelle.
L:  Hi.  I'm Susan.
R:  Hi, Susan.
L:  Hello.  Okay, so, family.  What does family mean to us?
R:  Ah, I don't know about you, but, um, my family is not -- not the typical family of the nineteen fifties, where you had Mom, Dad and the kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, life is very different for me.  Ah, I have a family bush, as opposed to a family tree.
L:  [LAUGH] How so?
R:  Um, Mom and Dad divorced, kids living in separate states, step --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- parents, remarriages, um, deaths in the family.  It really altered the fa- -- the traditional family structure.
L:  Okay.  I -- I --
R:  How 'bout --
L:  -- actually am the on- -- one of the people I know that still has the fifties.  My parents are still together.  They're about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary.  Um, you know, so we had the two and half kids.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I have a brother and a sister, and me.  And it -- it has always been very strange in that it's together, and everybody else I know it's very different for. 
R:  Well, see that's where you and I are -- are different. My father's with my stepmother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My own mother, ah, died when I was six months of age.
L:  Okay.
R:  And my father eventually remarried when I was six years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then introduced the stepfamily.  So, I have br- -- my natural brothers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have stepsisters --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which brings another parent into the situation because they have their father.
L:  Okay.
R:  So it's, you know, Dad, deceased Mom, stepmother and then stepmother's ex husband.
L:  Wow. [NOISE]  You have --
R:  So, it -- it made for very interesting family dynamics.
L:  Definitely.  You -- you have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the big immediate family, while I have the big extended family.  My father was one of ten --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and so I have -- I have two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, one brother --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one sister.  I have twenty five cousins. So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have a very, very large family that way.
R:  Mm.  I'm similar.  My father had seven siblings.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And there are -- there are tens of -- tonnes of cousins.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in that way it's still very traditional.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  It's just, you know, my dad seemed to have br- broke the mould because my mother died.
L:  Okay.  That's interesting families.  I -- I've --
R:  Hm.
L:  I've always -- I've had a lot of people comment to me that -- that they -- they actually find it odd that -- that my parents are still together -- we still kind of have that nuc- nuclear family going.
R:  Mhm.  Well, my stepparents have been together, um -- well, my stepmother and father have been together for tw- twenty plus years now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so essentially -- I mean, they're doing fine.  They've stayed married. [NOISE]  They did not have any children together.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so that -- that -- that made things kind of awkward in -- in that it was always yours and my kids. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was -- there was never an our child.
L:  Okay.  Do you --
R:  Um --
L:  Do you think that -- that helped between the siblings, or was different?  I -- I've heard different -- I mean, I haven't an opinion it.  I've heard people say different things about that.
R:  Well, for me, I always wanted a little brother or sister.  I was the youngest.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I always wanted somebody else younger than -- then myself.  And when I asked they said no, and that was the end of the su- -- end of the topic.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um, m- my siblings were all older -- um, middle school, high school and older.
L:  Okay.
R:  They had -- they adjusted much better than I did.
L:  Okay.
R:  And -- and I see that even in my own daughter's, ah, circle of friends these days.
L:  Mm.
R:  A lot of single families households --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- where there isn't even a stepmom or a stepdad.  A lot of times the parents are divorced.  Sometimes mom has a boyfriend, sometimes she doesn't.  And -- and they're -- they're -- they're living by themselves.
L:  Mm -- mm.  That -- that's interesting.  Um, reminds -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me, my -- even though, like, my parents is -- once they -- um, my brother had been married and divorced once --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he has one son.  My sister has been married and divorced three times, and she has one son from her -- her second marriage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and she has a boyfriend who has two children.  And then her ex husband, who she had the son with, has another son from a -- a previous relationship.  And it -- it's interesting that my sister is actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- closer to her ex stepson, if that makes sense --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than -- than her ex husband is.  You know, like they -- they actually got in contact again with one another and are able to spend time with one another --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- again.  So, here comes[?] extended family out that way.
R:  Yeah. It does get peculiar.  My, um -- my -- when my oldest stepsister got married --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, as I said, she's -- she's my stepmother's daughter.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, her father went and remarried and had three additional children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, here we are in southern Texas trying to explain that this is my sister -- this is my sister, and this is my sister's sister.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But she's not my sister.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And getting stunned, glazed looks by the very religious Bible Belt family we were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to explain this all to.
L:  I'm from Georgia, so I -- I understand. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I just think it -- I don't know how Middle America lives --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- but I know on the east coast, in my circle of friends, there seems to be more fragmented families than there are whole families.
L:  Definitely -- definitely agree with that.  Hm.  Interesting.  Um, I don't know.  I'm drawing a blank on all this. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I mean, are -- are you close with family?  Do you see your nieces and nephews, even though there have been sep- --
L:  Um --
R:  -- some -- some changes?
L:  Ye- yes.  And geography has a lot to do with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All of us, for the most part, live in and around Atlanta.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but my brother's son is still in Kentucky.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And because of that I don't see him very often.  My ex sister in law, I just found out, is getting remarried and basically kind of starting anew and -- and -- ah, when they first got divorced, like, she made a whole lot of effort to bring my nephew down and visit, you know, his grandparent, and visit my family.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now that seems to be trailing off a little --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- bit.  And, um -- but, otherwise yeah, I kind of see my family most -- most of my family at least once a month, just because they're close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm potentially getting a job soon that will have put me to some place else in the country, and I have a feeling that'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- change things.
R:  That's gonna be difficult.  Ah, I was close with my younger stepsister --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she up and moved to Florida about six years ago.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it went from seeing her every holidays -- seeing the niece and the nephew, the brother in law.  You know, and going over on an occasional Saturday and having a spaghetti dinner. [NOISE] All that [NOISE] suddenly got pulled away [NOISE] and I found that very distressing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know, that support system that we had -- whether she was hiding Christmas presents at my place, or we just went and had a cup of coffee together -- the sanity that we shared.  I miss that.  I lost --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that piece of family.
L:  Yeah.  I can see that.  My -- my sister and I are very, very close.  We're very different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Me -- me and my brother and sister, I'd say, if -- if you took the same person and split them three different ways you'd have us.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause at the core we're very much the same, but you know, our lives are just very, very different, and our views are very different on certain things.  
R:  [MN]
L:  But, ah, her and I are very close, and that would -- that would hurt a lot if --
R:  [MN]
L: -- you know, I lost whatever with her on a normal --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- basis.
R:  Yeah.  Well, see, that's what I'm concerned -- I'm hearing it -- hearing that might happen to you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that -- that distance really -- I mean, I'm --
L:  I've done it before
R:  -- any --
L:  I've been away before.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And she's in Florida.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, that's -- that's an eighteen -- twenty hour automobile drive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or at least a couple of hours on an airplane.  It's expense.  And, um, it does -- you do lose some of the closeness that was there.
L:  Mhm.  Hm.  Ah, hopefully that won't happen.  I may be going closer rather than further, so maybe --
R:  That would be a good thing.
L:  -- that will -- that will be a very good thing.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Going back to something you said earlier, it's kind of interesting that you're the youngest and wanted a si- -- a younger sibling.  I'm the youngest and never wanted a y- -- a younger sibling. I was always completely fine that I was youngest.  And, um, ah, my sister's eight years older, and my brother's six years old than I am.  So, I kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had the -- the two lives of being a younger sibling, and kind of being an only child at the same time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause by the time I was in late middle school to high school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Both my brother and sister had completely moved out. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I kind of had both of those lives together.  And just was an interesting childhood --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where I was able to bond with my brother and sister, and bond with my parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in very different ways.
R:  Yeah.  It's just that my closest -- closest sibling is six years older than I am.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then I have two that are ten years older than --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I am.  And then one that's fourteen years older than I am.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it gets to be a real gap.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  It -- my -- I was entering kindergarten and my oldest sister was working out in the real world.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she was legally able to drink alcohol and vote.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, we didn't have a whole lot in common.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  No.  I could see that.
R:  And -- and that's some of the reason why I wanted somebody else around the house.  I wanted somebody to play with.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I guess my brother and sister were close enough.  They picked on me a whole lot, but, like, looking back and -- and my sister'll make comments every now and then of -- I think she kind of saw me as -- as, like, her pre daughter. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  That she could kind of practice and -- and -- and, you know, with her -- with her son right now, she'll make comments.  I'll be, like, "Well, how are you going to deal with him about X situation?"  She'll be, like, "Well, this is what I did with you, and that seems to have worked out okay".  Yeah.  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had another set of parents, besides you, at the same time.
R:  Mm.
L:  Need to work it out.
R:  It is interesting though -- but, you know, you get --
