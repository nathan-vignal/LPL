L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Yes?
L:  Hi.  It's Anthony.
R:  I'm Prahma Hanad[?].
L:  Hunh?
R:  My name is Prahma.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] [PAUSE]  So, is we talking about family?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  We're supposed to be speaking about family.
R:  Right -- right.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  To me, I guess a family means --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah, ah, two people working together.  Ah, and possibly, ah, married couples, children, people who, you know, work in harmony -- understand each other.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I -- meaning family's close.  I mean, I'm come from a very close knit family.  Family means pretty much everything to us.
R:  Mm.
L:  Looking after each other, taking care of each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Looking out for one another, helping each other out.
R:  Mhm.  Um, yeah, family also means to me, ah, people helping each other out in sickness -- you know, if the child gets sick, parent takes care of the one get sick -- the child, or brothers or sisters, even, you know, including the extended family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that take care of each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  I'm looking to that.  I mean, family's very close.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  And family's somebody you can open up to.  You may not want to tell things to other people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you can disclose stuff to family.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mm.  But, um -- [PAUSE]  Ah, families, ah, can live far away, but still be close to each other and help each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.  It's important to have good family -- close family.
R:  Mhm -- mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  And, ah, what would you say is the key to building a close -- close family?  If you had one, I mean.
L:  Do what now[?]?
R:  Like, if somebody was starting a new family what would be the key to success, to build a close knit family?
L:  Well, I think for one thing is have, ah, a good and close family inside the home --you know, mother, father and children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you -- that's your foundation right there, being close there.  And then extending to the grandparents and brothers and sisters of your family.
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE]  Mm.  And family also means to me, um, in laws.  Um, the -- the other side of the family that comes into your family because of marriage.  Um, that should also be taken into consideration.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, if the girl gets married and she has in laws, then those are also family she should be taking care of. 
L:  Mhm.  Definitely. [PAUSE]  Yeah, family's important.  You know, it's -- it's the strongest link, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in life, you know. [PAUSE] 
R:  And, um -- [PAUSE]  Ah, one should do whatever they can to not break families, even if that means sacrifice.
L:  Yeah, definitely, um --
R:  Yes, um --
L:  It's important, you know, to have good communications in -- an -- throughout the family also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You communicate if you say to everybody, "Well, I'm" -- be very understanding.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, do what -- do whatever you can to help each other out.  You know, either -- either financially or morally.  You know, things of that nature.
R:  Mhm -- mhm.  Ah, which means even if sometimes you have to tolerate, ah, kids going in a different direction than what you would want them to.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I -- I come from a very close knit family.  I mean, you know, ah, we're Italian family, so just, you know -- just nice that our family's close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're Catholic and very close that way also.
R:  Mhm -- mhm.  Yeah.  I come from an Indian family, and we, um -- we are a very close knit family.  Um, in our families even the son and the daughter in law would stay with the parents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'til there was a necessary need to move away.  And that way you get the support of -- you know, parents could support the children, taking care of their grandchildren.  And the kids could support the parents by taking --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- care of them if they were ill.  So, um, you know, I think America needs to go back to that kind of family situation. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So  -- and I think it pretty much is gonna be forced to do that now with the economic trends.  The way things are going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it won't be easy for elderly to live by themselves.  Or, would get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- too expensive to live by themselves.
L:  Yeah.  And I believe that's --
R:  Yeah.  So, children will have to pretty much bring parents into their homes.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  You know -- you know, my family -- you know, ah, when you get older, the young ones start taking over and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- turn around and take care of you.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I have an eighty one year old mother in law live with me, so -- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  So, um -- [NOISE] so, we're a very close knit family too.  And, ah, that's what we believe in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have, um, elderly people in your home too?
L:  Well, it's just me and my wife now.  My daughters m- moved out.  Um, but I live -- me -- I live right next door to my mother.  My father just passed away --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this past August.  So --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- th- that time was real good to have family close by.
R:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE] 
L:  Still my mother and my sisters and I -- we all live right next door to each other.
R:  Uh-huh.   Yeah.  I think that's very important --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to have your family around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To take care of each other. [PAUSE]  Well, I'm not sure.  Is this supposed to be, like -- we're supposed to talk for ten minutes, or ...?
L:  Ah, I believe it's just that you discuss 'til -- you can discuss family and then wh- -- once you're done just hang up, it says.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you know, once you're off the subject -- topic, just go ahead and hang up.
R:  Right -- right.  Yeah.  I mean, that's about it for family, as far as my views are.  And, um -- and I know I don't live necessarily very close to family in India -- a lot of it is.  But, I still feel close to them and -- and, you know, when I have needed them they have flown all the way here to help me out.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And, um, for day to day needs, because my family's not very close by, um, I depend on my neighbors --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- who are very nice too.  And, um, that -- which is kind -- kind of also important.  I mean, I think neighbors sort of become your extended family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, you know --
L:  Yeah.  I have friends I grew up with that we're still close, and our family and their family's got very close together also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, our pretty -- pretty much extends out to everyone.
R:  Right -- right.  So, yeah, we have neighbors that, you know -- that their in laws and my in laws -- and they all get together and, um -- and it's a nice feeling to know that there's somebody to help you out if -- you know, whenever you're in need.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I even have American neighbors that I'm close to.  You know, when my kids see gr- -- their grandparents, their kids see my mother in law.  And [MN] that's nice to have that.
L:  Well, that's good. [PAUSE] 
R:  Well, very nice talking to you, sir.
L:  Okay.  Nice talking to you also.
R:  Yep -- same.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Thank you.  Bye.
L:  Bye bye.
R:  [NOISE]
