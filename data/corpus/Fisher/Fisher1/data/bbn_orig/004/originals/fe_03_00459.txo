L:  Hi, this is Mark.
R:  Uh, this is Lee.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Uh, so do you look cold weather or warm weather activities?
L:  Well, I come from Minnesota so I pr- -- I prefer, uh, cold weather.  I -- there's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- much more cold weather activities to do here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  I enjoy cross country skiing, downhill skiing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, hiking in the snow.  But we don't have very much snow here right now.
R:  I see.  So are you a skilled, uh, +skier?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's nice.  You know, uh, my favorite activities is tennis.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But right now it's in the winter so I cannot play tennis outdoor.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So do you play indoor tennis then?
R:  Uh, sometimes.  But, you know, uh, the court is expensive so I can't afford to play, uh, so often.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So the outdoor courts are usually much more, uh, inexpensive than an indoor court?
R:  Oh, it's free.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, free, okay.  
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, I also like travelling like, uh, during the spring -- uh, winter brea- break, I went to Miami and, uh, I enjoy the weather there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  It's very nice there.  When I do travel I like to do hiking.  Um, uh, I've been to, like, the rainforest in, uh, um, like hiking through the -- the rainforest canopies.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, so I do hiking and then rock climbing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And mountain biking.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  [LAUGH]  I hope I can have, um, some more outdoor activities like, um, in the colder weather but I also like, uh, some inside activities like, um, working out in the gym, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just working out with the machine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, any swimming?
R:  Um, I'm not a good swimmer but I can swim like, um, five, uh, I don't know, five rounds.
L:  Okay.
R:  In the swimming pool.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, I took swimming lessons as a kid but I haven't been swimming in quite some time so I don't know how I would do.
R:  Uh, do you fish -- fishing?
L: Uh, fish?  Um, I -- we do ice fishing here in Minnesota.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where we drill a -- a hole in the ice and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- fish through the ice.  Um, other than that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just, uh, on the river over a bridge I've -- I've done fishing.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  I -- you know I never heard ice fishing!
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh. 
L:  We have some unusual sports here and outdoor activities in Minnesota.  Another thing that I also like to do is snowmobiling.  And so some people take their snowmobile out to go i- ice fishing.
R:  Wow.  Um, so are you used to cold weather?
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm very much used to cold weather.  I've lived, uh, i- in the northern part of the Minnesota for all my life, so I'm used to the cold.
R:  Wow.  I see.  Actually I, um, right now I'm in Pennsylvania but I came from Texas so that's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- why I like, um, you know, warm weather very ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, in Texas what kind of sports do they or -- do they do down there?
R:  Uh, let me see.
L:  Outdoor activities?
R:  Actually, I don't -- I don't think, uh, they have, um, you know, some typical sports for people in Texas like, uh, the -- when I was in there because, um, I used to do like, jogging outside.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And enjoy the sun.
L:  Yep.  Jogging.  When I was in Austin, Texas, it seemed like there were a lot of people out jogging. 
R:  Right.
L:  We have a lot of -- we have a lot of lakes here so in the summer there's people jogging around the lakes quite a bit.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, also many people, um, went, uh, go fishing.
L:  Mm.  Okay.  
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One of the things that I'd like to do, thinking of jogging, is, um, one, uh, sport that we have is roller blade.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever been on a roller blade skate?
R:  Oh, I hope I could.  Is that ...?  [LAUGH]  You know, it's very dangerous I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It -- it is.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, you can wipe out pretty easily so people wear pads on -- on their shoulders and on their knees.  But I'd like to try roller blading some time soon.
R:  Wow, you know, when the kids do that, um, they really look very cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So you think it's just for kids, huh?
R:  Uh, no, like, some college students.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, uh, graduates can also do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm older.  I'm -- I'm thirty five.  So I think I -- I -- I still can maybe try it.  I, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ice skate, so I used to play hockey  so I -- I think it's kind --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of like ice skating, so I'm going to try it out.
R:  Oh, that's very nice.  [LAUGH]  So, um, do you know wshu?
L:  Uh, snow shoe?
R:  Uh.  We call it wshu.
L:  Oh, shoe?
R:  Uh, like, uh, um, do you know Jackie Chan?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, uh, in his, uh -- in his movie there are always wshu.  Like, uh, I don't know how to say it.  It's called, uh, Chinese kung-fu.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  I see here, uh, in my school like, uh, there are many activities and, uh, they play tai chi.  Do you know tai chi?
L:  Tai chi, yes I've heard of that.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That first one I hadn't heard of.  How do you spell it? Oh -- oh shu?
R:  Oh, it's W.S.H.U.
L:  Wsh- wshu.
R:  Wshu.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  It's like uh, um, you know, in the movies they can hit the other people like, by their -- their, you know the -- just stretch their body.  Use their arms and legs, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Um, I've seen some, um, people exercise in the park.  Is that what that's called as well?  When they're out, stretching in a park?
R:  Oh.  
L:  I've seen that before.  Out early.
R:  They have, you know, there are many kinds of wshu, so I don't know which one do you mean.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, uh, I -- I saw many American people like -- they like to, um, play tai chi and, uh, they -- they thought it's very good to -- to their health.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And actually it is.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Interesting.
R:  And I -- I used to, um, to play tai chi when I was in, like let me see, in college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, I play with a team.  But actually if you want to grasp, uh, the spirit of tai chi, it's very difficult.  If you just want to, you know, play the form of it, it's -- it's pretty simple.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, interesting.  I'll have to look it up on the internet to see what I can find about it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, so, let me see, what else about other activities?  Uh, do you like to, um, travel on a plane?
L:  Uh, yes.  I do quite a bit of travelling.  Um, I travel to South America, Central America. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's where I did the outdoor hiking in the rainforest.  So I do enjoy that.  I also [COUGH] -- when I travel I like to go horseback riding.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So, I, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have some friends that have horses, so whenever I can find where they have horseback riding when I travel, I try and do that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that sounds very, um, a lot of fun.  Actually, um, let me see.  I -- I used to travel by plane a lot but, you know, after nine eleven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I fear in the -- I was afraid to take a plane.
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah. 
R:  And then I do most of the travel, like, by car or by train.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- but, uh, it's, you know --
L:  So you got to see the country?
R:  -- you spend a lot of time on the road. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's good to see the country.  How people live in other places.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh --
L:  Um, another thing I was going to mention here, that is very unusual that we do in Minnesota, is, um, sled dogs.  Uh, we go, uh, with a team of dogs out in the snow.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, with a sled, so ... um, that's another thing.  In most of the horseback riding places off- -- also offer sled dogs here.  So ...
R:  I see.  
L:  [MN]
R:  So are the dogs, um, the same dogs as, um, they are like in -- on the east coast?
L:  Um, they're Siberian Huskies or eskimo dogs.
R:  Oh.  So they are some --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- special kind of dog that -- that can live in the cold weather?
L:  Yep, they're used to the cold weather and the snow and they -- and they are able to pull sleds.  So ...
R:  Oh, I see.  [LAUGH]  Um, so, like do you play table tennis?
L:  I used to as -- when I was younger.  I haven't for quite some time.  Um.  One of the things that I have played recently, that I used to play when I was younger, is volleyball.  Uh --
R:  Volleyball?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh.
L:  With the  -- with the net and the --
R:  That's a good sport.
L:  Yeah, it's very, um, very fun when you -- you can have s- a place to play in the sand.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But when you play on the grass it's not quite as good 'cause it's so hard when you fall and land.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, it's nice to play in the sand.
R:  Yeah.  So, uh, do you like, uh, g- going to the beach?  Like in the summer?
L:  Um, yep.  But we don't have too many beaches around here.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, we have the lakes so people go down to the lake and -- and, uh, either jog or, um, another thing that they do here, I haven't done it, is, um, with a sailboard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the lake.  So I suppose in Florida they have quite a bit of that?
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And then when --
R:  I -- I think that's an exciting sports.  Like you sail, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- on the sea.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  One thing that I would like to try that I saw when I was in Brazil
