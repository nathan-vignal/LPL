R:  Hi.  My name is Dennis Oliver[?], and I'm calling from Phoenix, Arizona.
L:  Hi.  My name is Christina Burman[?], and, ah, I'm in Ithaca, New York.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess we're supposed to be talking about what family means to us.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess to me it probably means, um, [LIPSMACK] -- probably means immediate family, just, ah -- just father and mother and -- and siblings.  And it involves a -- a feeling of closeness.  And it involves a -- a lot of sharing of various things.
L:  Hm.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I think -- I think I'd include extended --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- actually, and potentially, um, close friends.  
R:  Well, no -- that actually -- that's a good point.  Um, in terms of -- of related family, ah, I -- I would have included extended family at one time, but I've -- I wouldn't now.  Um, when I was a kid [MN], extended family was really an important thing.  But, somehow that sort of dissipated over time.  Now, I -- I don't really know why.  I would certainly --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- include friends [MN].  Certainly several of my friends are as close as anyone in the family, related or not.
L:  Mm.  Well, um, I think it might have something to do with, ah, how close +proximity in -- in --
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  -- geographically you are with people, and how often you see them.  
R:  Yeah.  I think you're definitely right about that.  I -- and, um, that is really the case with me.  Um, when I was a -- a -- a kid, ah -- ah, some of the family was there in the same small town.  And then many of the other close members of -- of the family were within just maybe a half an hour's drive, so --
L:  Mm. Yeah.
R:  Oh, and -- and -- and also, um, I'm of that age where when I was a kid TV was just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- coming to the fore.  And so, it [MN] -- things -- things like, ah, going and spending an aft- afternoon just visiting, as we said -- talking and eating and all of that w- was what people did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, ah, later as TV became more popular and -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] other th- -- and people began to move away more, um, we stopped visiting.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then, ah, family for me [MN] -- those ones I w- were -- I was referring to are back in Illinois, and I haven't lived in Illinois for probably forty years.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Ah, in -- in my case, ah, I was born in and grew up in Ithaca.  And my, ah, mother's family was from New York City, but my father's family's from Maryland and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Virginia -- the Appalachia area.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And I'm --
R:  Strong --
L:  To be --
R:  -- family values there.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, so to tell the truth, I -- I didn't see them too much, but I got a lot stories from --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- my father.  And I used to go down in the summers and work on the farm a little.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I wonder if -- if family story telling is popular now.
L:  I don't know.  Um --
R:  I -- I -- I don't know either.  Um, [MN] well, I -- I -- I don't have children so I don't have anyone to pass those stories onto.  I have a niece that [MN] seems sometimes to be interested, and sometimes to be really just bored out of her skull.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I tell what things were like when her dad was small, or [MN] tell stories about her grandparents or -- or [MN] another generation removed from there.  But, um that was pretty common when I was a kid.
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- and -- and I -- and I think it's because, ah, maybe the culture of my part of Illinois was act- actually something like Appalachia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I come from the southern part of Illinois.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not any- anything at all like Chicago.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And in fact that's who we called Chicago -- "The City".
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  And, um, it was always kind of an interesting state.  It's a long state and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- Chicago was up -- up in the northern third.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And most of the good sized cities and -- and nearly all of the industry is in the top third of the state.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, as you go south, ah, you get into less industrialized areas and, ah, sm- small farming regions.  And, ah, also the -- the southern third was settled by people from the south.
L:  Mm.
R:  Mainly Kentucky and Tennessee and -- and Virginia and so on.  So, it's -- it's -- it's southern culturally.  And because it's small towns and farming communities and so on it, um -- it retained a lot of that -- that southern feeling and -- and I suppose still does to this day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Interesting, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Rather, actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, how old is your niece?
R:  Ah, she's -- oh, I guess about twenty two now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, of course I still think of her as three.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, [LAUGH] that's been a long time ago.  She, um, is married now --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and passed the bar in Illinois, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is an attorney.  And --
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  Had her first trial case about -- oh, I guess about six weeks ago, and won.  And --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, wow indeed.  So, I'm -- I'm pretty proud of her.  She's -- her -- her life and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where her life will take is quite different from what's happened to me.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm a teacher.
L:  What do you teach?
R:  Teach ESL.
L:  Oh.
R:  English as a second language.
L:  Cool. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, it is cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Web programmer.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm impressed, you know.
L:  It's dull. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah I -- I -- I can understand that to a certain degree.  I -- I -- I have a website and I manage another website --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm very interested in all of that.  But, I'm -- I'm just old enough that anything with computers is still kind of magic to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, it doesn't mater that I've -- I've been doing things with computers for twenty years.  It --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's still kind of magic.  I [MN] -- none of your generation -- where it's just a tool and it's just something that, you know, everybody knows about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- there's -- there's still that element of the mysterious about 'em for me.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'm -- I'm impressed.  If I were -- if I were maybe twenty years younger, I -- I -- that's -- I'd -- I'd definitely get involved in some aspect of that.
L:  Well, um, I don't know.  It -- it's an okay field.  Um, I'm, um, very proud of my brother actually.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, because, um -- um, I started -- I kind of fell into web programming because --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- um, I actually did my undergraduate degree in linguistics, and when I got --
R:  My word.
L:  -- out, no one wanted it. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Ah, well, boy do I understand that.
L:  So, I kind of fell into programming because I had a lot of computer experience.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- my brother, um, was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a student at Cornell University.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And --
R:  I'm impressed right there.
L:  -- he -- he has surpassed me in computer knowledge and --
R:  Incredible.
L:  -- I am very, very proud of him for that.
R:  Yeah, that's great.  Is he younger or older?
L:  Younger.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I -- I tell ya it's just the most amazing thing that [MN] computers have become commonplace in just a very short time really. 
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- and especially the Web.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I can remember -- I don't know if you can --but, I can remember when the Web was brand new.
L:  Yeah, I do remember. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And -- and I mean, everybody knows about it now.  I mean, it's just -- just commonplace.  And -- and to -- to people the age of -- of my niece, for example --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, she's always known computers.  So, [MN] it's like an iron or a skillet, or some just basic tool to her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Interesting.  Well, that -- that's just marvelous about your brother.
L:  Yeah.  Um, ah, my sister, um -- she's a -- a grad student at Cornell University --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in animal behaviour.
R:  Whoa, that's quite a combination for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the three of you. [MN]
L:  I'm the dull one.
R:  Yeah?  Oh, you don't sound dull to me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, my -- my brother, my niece's father --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, is -- is actually the brightest of the three of us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he never did really get involved in the academic thing.  Um, in fact he had a rough time getting involved in anything for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, about the first twenty -- twenty two years of his life.  Then, ah, he -- he sort of fell into -- it's amazing how many of us fall into things --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He sort of fell into selling insurance.  And he -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he likes people, and he likes to be on the go, and he likes to be travelling all the time.  And that was just sort of a natural thing for him.  So, he's done very well for himself financially.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he -- he has his own company, and has had for quite some time.  And, [LIPSMACK] um, it's quite different from being a teacher of ESL.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, he's the baby.  I'm the eldest.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in the middle is my sister, who has a doctorate in psychology and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Also quite -- quite different, the three of us are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but she has an interesting gift.  Her gift is -- she specializes in research methods and statistics.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't know about you, but I can't think of anything more deadly dull than statistics.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, she has the gift of -- of making it interesting and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- making it real for her students.  And I -- I -- I think that -- I'm -- I'm very proud of her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for all of that.  And she also manages a rat lab.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A -- an animal behaviour lab.  So, I -- I would say between the two of -- of us we have quite an interesting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- immediate family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, someone that I -- I consider to part of my family, although b- --
