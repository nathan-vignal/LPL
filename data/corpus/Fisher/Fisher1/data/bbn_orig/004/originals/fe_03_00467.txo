R:  Hello, my name is Malcolm.
L:  Hi, Malcolm.  This is Alison.  How are you?
R:  I'm well, Miss Alison.  I'm fine, thank you.
L:  Um, so which do you like better?  Eating in a restaurant or eating at home?  [NOISE]
R:  Well, uh, I'm a vegetarian so, uh, I like eating at home since I --I -- I want to know what's -- what's going in -- into the preparation of the food.
L:  Yeah, it's probably difficult for you to, um, you know, going out you don't know everything that they're putting in it.  And it's probably just easier for you to buy your own food.
R:  Exactly.  And you?
L:  Um, I'd say that I like both.  Because on one hand I like to be able to cook and experiment with different things, but then sometimes I just like, you know, see what other people have that they're making.  Um, what's your favorite thing that you like to cook?
R:  Uh, [LAUGH] I'm also a bachelor so I don't, uh, I don't go out the way in preparing food.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, so, uh, anything -- oh, I eat, uh, mainly I eat vegetables, salads, uh, or store -- store prepared.  I mean store packaged.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, salads and -- and, uh, i- items like that.
L:  Yeah, that's how -- that's how I eat most of the time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just due to time constraints then, you know, trying to, uh, you know, you don't have that much time but, um, [LIPSMACK] the -- the extent of my cooking is probably toast, pasta.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Things like that, that are easy.  But, um, I --
R:  What did you say?  Toast?
L:  Toast, pasta, um --
R:  [LAUGH]  Ok- --
L:  But, uh, I -- d- I --I really like watching things like the food network on TV and trying to, you know, try and make what they're making on there.  Although it doesn't always work out that way.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's a -- that's a good idea there to, uh, [LIPSMACK] watch and observe, uh, from -- what did you say?  A food network, what it's called?
L:  The food network, yes.
R:  The food network.  Oh, fascinating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah -- ah, that's -- uh, that is, uh, so you've, uh, you -- have you tried many, uh, dishes [NOISE] have -- have you tried?
L:  I -- I've tried making some of the stuff that they have on there.  Um, some of the -- the salmon recipes.  I'm -- I'm really big -- I really like fish, so that's, uh, that's one of my favorites.  Um, are there any other -- are there any good restaurants in Philadelphia that you like?
R:  Well, actually, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.  
L:  Oh, you are, okay.  I thought this was from -- [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  So they -- they -- 
L:  Um.
R:  They're wiring us -- connecting us across country, huh?
L:  Yeah, I didn't know that.  
R:  Uh, uh --
L:  I thought that was all -- they're all from Philadelphia but, um ...
R:  Um ...
L:  That's -- that's very nice.  I didn't know that at all.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so, uh, uh, were you were about to ask which kind of -- what type of restaurants or ...?
L:  Mhm.  What are your favorites if you're going out?
R:  Uh, s- we have a place called, uh Golden Chorale.  I don't know if you have Golden Chorale up there?  
L:  No.
R:  It's a Ry- Ryans[?].  They're buffet style, uh, menus.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh, all you can eat, uh, practically is, are what they are -- basically, is what they are.  Uh, a large -- large salad bar, which is wh- of course, my favorite. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A- and, uh, they -- they al- -- they also serve fish as well.  Especially, uh, Ryans and at The Golden Chorale.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So do -- do you have like, a buffet style restaurant up there?  Uh ...
L:  Yeah, there are a bunch of 'em.  Actually I love buffet styles because then you can take, you know, a little of everything and you get to try all kinds of different things.
R:  What about a Quincy's?  Do you have a Quincy's up there in, uh, Philadelphia?
L:  A Quinc- -- no.  
R:  No?
L:  What kind of restaurant is that?  
R:  Oh, that's also a -- that's in Alabama.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I went to Alabama one time and found a Quincy's, which is also all you can eat buffet style type restaurant.
L:  We have, um, I'm trying to think.  We have here one, it's called, I think, Olds Country Buffet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  We have --
L:  And then there's also one called The Sizzler.
R:  Okay.  We -- we've [MN] we've had Old Country Buffet and, uh, Sizzlers but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they both closed down here in -- in the -- the Atlanta market, they've -- they've gone out of business here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  But they're big up there, huh?  You -- you --
L:  Yeah, there -- there are a bunch of them around here.  There are also a lot of, um, Chinese restaurants that have all you can eat buffets on them.
R:  Y- and you -- again you say you like salmon.  Now, [MN] wh- -- you -- you -- you like, uh, smoked salmon.  I've had that.
L:  Yes.
R:  Before I -- before I became a vegetarian I used to live in the Fairbanks, Alaska, and we used to always have smoked salmon, which is excellent.  I mean, excellent.
L:  [MN]  Right.  The fish up there, like, I, um, I went to Canada last summer and the fish up north is so much better than it is here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yes indeed.  And I --
L:  When did -- how -- oh, sorry to interrupt.  How long ago did you, um, become a vegetarian?
R:  Uh, fifteen years.
L:  Fifteen years?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yes.  I was --
L:  Do you find it difficult?
R:  No, I -- I found it -- actually [MN] first starting, uh, it was hard for me to give up, uh, fried chicken.  Fried chicken, of course, is a staple here in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the south.  And then, uh, once I get -- w- once I was able to give up fried chicken there, it was smooth sailing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  C- was it hard when you first started doing it?  Like, did you -- [MN] did you stick to your diet right away or did you have --
R:  Yeah, I beco- I was -- I was leaning in that direction and I said, "Well I need some incentive on --on giving up, uh, different types of meat".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So the first -- the first immediate thing w- to give up was pork.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and then, uh, and the next easy thing w- to give up was beef.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a- again it -- it didn't take long.  I -- I had the mindset to.  I wanted to do this.  I want to go ahead and accomplish this.  So it didn't take me any time to -- to -- to give up two -- those two [MN] meat, uh, meat products. 
L:  Oh, wow, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Then when I -- when I -- chicken wa- -- again, was the last thing and the hardest thing and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, uh, I came across some bad chicken wings.  And that was --
L:  Really?
R:  -- just -- that was just the moti- --
L:  That was the end it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yes.  So it made me sick and I -- I been, uh, meat free for fifteen years.
L:  Wow, that's amazing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  It's a long time.
R:  It's a lot -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, I was going to say, that's a long time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I -- you ever consider it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I th- I don't know.  It -- it would be very tough for me I think.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well --
L:  I love, uh, I'm a big chicken eater.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, whether it's, you know, just plain, like, roasted chicken, as you said, or fried chicken or even in, like, salads, I'll have a chicken caesar salad.  
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, that's -- I know that -- let me ask you.  I know that, um, some vegetarians, uh, won't eat products like eggs or milk or other.  
R:  Right.
L:  Do you [MN] -- do you eat those or no?
R:  No, I -- I -- I don't eat eggs.  I've never liked eggs even before coming a vegetarian.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- and then, uh -- so that was easy to give up.  [MN]  But, uh, uh, cheese, I -- I don't eat as well.  Uh, meat is, uh, uh, not meat but, uh, milk --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, the only thing -- the only milk product I -- and, uh, I -- I've call it a weakness, is ice cream.  I love Briars and, uh, Haagen Dazs ice cream.
L:  So do -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what's your favorite flavor?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, butter -- the butter pecan.
L:  That's exactly, okay, that's e- exactly what I was going to say.  I love butter pecan ice cream.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  That's absolutely my weakness.  I love that one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  They're -- they're very big.  Uh, they're -- 'cause Briars and -- and, uh, Briars and what did I say, Haagen Dazs.
L:  Haagen Dazs. 
R:  I like the gourmet -- I call them the gourmet ice cream of the -- of the, uh, whole ice cream realm, there.
L:  They are.  They are far better than the other brands.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Now, do you have, uh, we -- there used to be a [inaudible] called Fusenglod[?].  Do you have -- do you hear of -- you ever heard of that -- that, uh, that -- the -- the --
L:  No, we don't have one here.  What is it?
R:  No?  Uh, that's also like a Haagen Dazs ice cream.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  But Briars and, uh, Briars and Haagen Dazs are real big here in Atlanta.
L:  Mhm.  Do you have the --
R:  And butter --
L:  Do you have the other ones like, um, Baskin Robbins, or Carvel?
R:  Right.  We -- now what -- what is that last one?  You said Carvel?
L:  Carvel?
R:  Mm -- uh, we used to have that but -- but you talking about stores or -- or actual ice cream products?
L:  Ice cream parlors.
R:  All right, okay.  We -- we do have those, uh, ice cream parlors.  Yeah, Hog- um, Baskins Robbins.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Well, actually, you know what, Baskins Robbins has gone out of business here in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes and, uh, and the other one, Carvel, I think they went out of business -- well there might be a -- a few select neighborhoods or communities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that Carvel is located in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, uh, other than that, uh, the -- Bas- Baskins Robbins went out of business about five -- three or four years ago.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then Carvel were -- were not very big here.  We have Gorens[?] ice cream.  How 'bout that, uh, in Philadelphia?
L:  No, we don't have that.  
R:  You haven't?
L:  Do you have, um, Dairy Queen?
R:  [MN]  No.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Okay.
R:  They're Dai- -- Dairy Queen is still, s- uh, big and strong here --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in this area -- in the city of Atlanta, [MN] because I -- you know, it's funny because I -- I never thought -- I thought that Dairy Queen would be the first to go out of business but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, it surprised me by -- by being so tough and hanging on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for so long.  Mm.
L:  A lot of the Dairy Queens actually appear -- go out at -- like they close for the winter and then re-open just for the summer.
R:  Are you serious?  They go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  they -- uh, that's fascinating.  I never knew that.  Uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, but they'll --
L:  They -- they -- they use to be year -- open year round and then recently, I guess the past five years or so, they started doing that.  I guess they weren't getting too many customers in the winter.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That -- and that -- that is understandable.  That's understand- -- that is understandable.  But, uh, yeah, so, uh, I'm -- love going to the ice cream, Briars and Haagen Dazs.  Vegetarian for fifteen years.  Uh.  I eat a lot of prepared food, uh, again from
