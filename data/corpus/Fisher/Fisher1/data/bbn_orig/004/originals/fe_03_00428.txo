R:  Hi. My name's Claire[?].
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, how are you? [NOISE]
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  I'm good. [NOISE] 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Where are you at? [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Connecticut.
L:  [NOISE] Where again?
R:  Connecticut.
L:  Connecticut?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yep.  Niantic[?], Connecticut.
L:  [NOISE] I am in Pittsburgh. [NOISE]
R:  Pittsburgh?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, do we have answer the question?
L:  I guess.
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  So, you wanna go first? [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  All right.
R:  Well, family to me, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let's see.  I'm adopted, from Korea.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  [inaudible -- not English].
R:  Um, yeah.  At three months old.
L:  No -- no.  I said, ah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do you speak Korean? [NOISE] 
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]  All right. [NOISE] 
R:  Do you?
L:  [NOISE] No, not really. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, I'm from --
R:  Um --
L:  -- from Malaysia --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- though. [NOISE]
R:  You are?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I was three months old.  And I live with my adopted family, and I have two brothers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they're, um, twenty one and twenty three.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I live with my mom.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yep.
L:  [NOISE] How old are you?
R:  I'm -- I'm nineteen.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]  How'd you find out about this?  I'm just curious.
R:  Um -- um, a professor of mine sent me an email.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  And there was a forward.  And I think she sent it to a bunch of other people too.  I don't even really know what this is.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not really sure.  But I know that you -- you're supposed to talk for ten minutes, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's recorded, and you get paid ten dollars, I think. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Yeah, that's what I -- that's what I think it is.  I mean [SIGH] --
R:  So --
L:  So --
R:  How did you get into it then?
L:  [NOISE] What's that?
R:  How did you get into it?
L:  Ah, I was in a forum and, ah, some guys were talking about it, so I checked it out and I just signed up for it. [NOISE]  Thought, "What the heck".  Um, man --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this thing is, ah [NOISE] -- I can barely hear you.  Can you hear me all right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  [COUGH] But I'm on a cell phone, so maybe that's why.
L:  Oh, all right. [NOISE]  Well, ah, family to me means, ah, people that I [NOISE] care a lot about.  And, ah, [NOISE] doesn't necessarily have to be a, [NOISE] you know -- [NOISE] doesn't --
R:  Biological?
L:  Doesn't necessarily have to -- biological.  That's what I'm trying to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- say, yeah. [NOISE]  'Cause, ah, I'm here and my family's is Malaysia.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for the last, ah, four years I've been here and I sort of have a couple of adopted families.  [NOISE]  Not really adopted, but, you know, they sort of took me in and we -- you know, we're good friends.  And, ah --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  So, sort of like, ah, at Christmas I go to their place -- Thanksgiving, everything, you know? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it doesn't necessarily have the biological.  But, ah --
R:  Ah, that's real cool.
L:  -- as long as -- as long as [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  -- you know, you care --
R:  -- family means to me --
L:  -- a lot each other, and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- things like that.  So -- hm.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I think family -- well, that's the thing; it doesn't have to be biological.  Um, like, 'cause I'm adopted and I don't even think of myself as not being my mom's daughter. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] And we're very close.  And, um, we actually got, um, tattoos.  We got matching tattoos -- couple of years ago, so that we'd have something that looked alike, because we don't look alike.  I mean, she's Irish and I'm Korean.  So --
L:  She's what?
R:  She's Irish.  You know?  She's very pale skinned --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- Irish.  Okay.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  And you're -- 
R:  So --
L:  -- Korean, yeah? 
R:  Mhm.  So, we went and got the tattoos and it's very cool.  We're very close.
L:  What about, ah --
R:  Ah --
L:  Do you have a stepdad?
R:  No.  Um, my -- well, my parents divorced when I was younger.  And he was in Starrington[?], and he's a horse trainer.  And my mom never remarried.  And he remarried.  He has, um, a wife.  But I don't really talk to him, so I don't talk to her either. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, my --
R:  So --
L:  -- dad died when I was about five.  So, ah, I have a mom and, ah, three older brothers.  So, I'm the youngest.  So, we do --
R:  How old are you?
L:  -- we sort of have a -- a lot in common.
R:  Yeah.  How old are you?
L:  I am twenty three now.
R:  Twenty three?  Wait.  I thought that you were gonna be, um, the person that, like, is doing the study and -- I --
L:  Who me?
R:  -- don't know.  Yeah, I thought that.  You're just -- you're doing the same thing I am, right? 
L:  No -- no.  I think the, ah, the -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- way they do this is, ah, they just put two strangers together and then, um, they record it.
R:  I know -- I know.  What's the -- I really don't know what the study is for.  It's linguistics --
L:  I don't know either.
R:  -- study, right?  Maybe it's just, um, how we talk and -- I don't know.  I don't really know what it is.
L:  Yeah.  But, I would hate to the person who sits there and, ah, listen to --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  -- listen to two hours of recording a day.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Of, like, people they don't know.  That's okay though.  I just [NOISE] -- that's pretty cool.  Um, [COUGH] so, did you go to school?  Did you go to, um, college?
L:  Yeah.  I just graduated from college.  That's why I'm here actually.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, since I graduated I, you know, came down to Pittsburgh and, um, [LIPSMACK] found a job.  So, sort of, ah, settling down a little bit here in Pittsburgh.  So, I --
R:  Um --
L:  -- don't know when I gonna go home, but, ah, probably will eventually. 
R:  What'd you go to school for?
L:  I went to school for computer science.
R:  [MN]
L:  What about you?
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, you're nineteen.  Are you in college now?
R:  Yeah.  I'm in my first year.  Um, I'm on break right now, but, um, my major is English.
L:  English?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  [COUGH] And I go to school in New York.
L:  New York?
R:  Go to [inaudible].  Yeah.
L:  So, you're in New York now?
R:  No.  Right now I'm in Connecticut, because I'm on break for Christmas, and I go back next weekend.  But -- 
L:  Oh, you guys --
R:  -- yeah, I --
L:  -- have a long --
R:  -- live in the -- 
L:  -- break.
R:  Yeah.  It was from December twenty first until January twenty six, I think[?].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE]. 
L:  Yeah.  Schools around here started January six or so -- like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a couple of universities --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in Pittsburgh. [NOISE]  Hm.
R:  Um, but, um, yeah I like it in New York.  But, it's really different than Connecticut. [COUGH] 
L:  I see.  You know a lot of people there?
R:  No. [SIGH]  I didn't know anyone when I first went, but you know, now I know a couple of people.  And I live in the dorm, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, living in a dorm, you know, you get to know a lot more than people than just living outside.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  I actually lived in a dorm where I had four, um, roommates.
L:  What's that?
R:  I lived in a dorm at first and I had four roommates.  And then --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I didn't like that because I just couldn't --
L:  Yeah.  That's too many.
R:  -- do, ah -- there was too many people.  So, now I live in a single, but it's still a dorm, and there's still people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [NOISE] --
L:  That's too many.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Four, jeeze.
R:  Yeah.  We lived in a suite.
L:  I, ah --
R:  We had a -- own kitchen, but --
L:  What's that?
R:  I mean, we had a -- like, a kitchen and we had our own bathroom.  Like, where I am now, it's a community kitchen.  You know, like, ever- everyone shares it.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I like having my own room.  Being able to go to --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  It's much better.
L:  I was in RA[?] for four years -- ah, three years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- in college, so I had my own room the whole time.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.  I had a roommate for a little bit, and I can't stand it.
R:  Yeah, I mean, even if it's a nice person, it's just you're with them all the time and you just -- I -- and the type of person that I am, I need my space and I didn't realise that 'til I got to college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, when I'm home I just constantly away from my family, [LAUGH] in my room.
L:  So, you have your own room back home then, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's what I'm used to.
L:  Mhm.  You ever, um, been to anywhere else besides Connecticut and New York?  I mean, besides, ah -- somewhere outside United States?
R:  No.  That's all I think about though.  All I wanna do is travel and see the world.
L:  Wouldn't you -- wouldn't you wanna go to Korea?
R:  I would, yeah.  Um, yeah.  Even, um, my adopted mother asks if I wanna to go see my birth mother.
L:  Do you know your birth mother?
R:  No.
L:  You don't?
R:  No.  Um, I don't even really know how to contact her, so --
L:  Oh.  Hm.
R:  But I don't even really think about it that much.  You know, like I said, like, my mom here is my mom. 
L:  Yeah, I understand -- I understand.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I just thought, um, you know -- might be a little curious.
R:  Oh yeah, I am sometimes.  But, I don't know -- it's usually my mom who brings it up.  I don't even think about it. [COUGH]
L:  Hm. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  So --
L:  Well, ah, I don't know.  I, ah -- right now I'm here, just working all the time and, ah -- [LIPSMACK] it kind of sucks though, 'cause, ah, I -- all my family and friends are back home.  So, even though you have good friends here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I know I had a really, um, rough transition.  I didn't like college at first.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I like --
L:  Were you --
R:  -- now, but --
L:  -- homesick a lot?
R:  -- I didn't like college.  I didn't realise that it was gonna be so different and so lonely.  Because, if you don't know anyone, and [MN] -- I mean, New York City is crazy, and I kind of like more mellow things.  I like --
