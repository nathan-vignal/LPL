L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yes, hi.
L:  [NOISE] How ya doing?
R:  I'm fine.  How you do?
L:  My name's Vinesh Patel[?]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  My name's Vinesh Patel.
R:  Oh.  Delilah.
L:  All right.
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about education and computers, huh?
L:  Yeah, I guess they help.  Anyhow, I -- I would think it helps. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I --
L:  In every -- in every aspect of it. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh yeah?  Such as?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean, [NOISE] like, I'm -- I'm a computer science major in university --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and every day I use a computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, [NOISE] without computers [NOISE] -- I -- I mean, like -- even, like, with students with the emails and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can email teachers and quickly speak to teachers and ask questions, and they get the feedback really quick. [NOISE]  And if not the teacher, the -- the teaching assistant can help them. [NOISE]  And they get more help that way, which is a lot faster than any, like, traditional [inaudible]. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I can't hear you very well.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, sorry. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  That -- that a little better?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hold on.  Let me [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's better.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  You were fading in and out there for a second.  Y-
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah, that's all right.  No, I -- I agree that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that computers can help.  I think they neither --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, harm nor really -- I think they just facilitate really.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  And like things --
L:  Right.  'Cause like [NOISE] -- what? [NOISE]
R:  They make things easier -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  They can't replace a certain type of instruction, you know, like in a college setting.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but, they can, you know, um, add to it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- supplement it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- in a efficient way.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I think also li- li- -- at -- at a young age when the kids use computers [NOISE] for, like, school wise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it ends up teaching them a lot more than, like -- like -- like, now at this age, I only learn- -- I only started using computers when I was, like, probably [NOISE] in high school. [NOISE]  Kids like my little niece and nephews, they use computers, [NOISE] like, in elementary.  It's like that -- so they know the ins and the outs of computers and [NOISE] they're a lot more -- they're, like, a lot more used to it.  So, like, they -- they -- they benefit a lot more from it -- ah, learning at a early age the computers.
R:  Right, yeah.  I see the same things -- my niece and nephews -- I think they were born 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a mouse in their hands, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  You're right.
R:  When I -- when they -- when I first bought an iBook at home, they looked at it, then they go, "Auntie, you don't have a mouse" [LAUGH] 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it's a track pad.  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  And they're like, "Where's your mouse?"  I'm like, "I don't need one". [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But, don't you think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're less curious about other things, like books for instance?
L:  Uh -- [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yes.  I was saying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't you think that they're less curious of other things, like books.  They tend --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to read --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- less.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  'Cause they expect --
L:  I think -- I think it goes both -- both ways.  It could be, like, some kids read a lot more, but then, like, kids -- some kids -- the kids who are used to computers, they might not read as well -- read as much, but they might get more information off the web, such --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as news and stuff like that, which they wouldn't get, ah, living[?] at home by themselves --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing nothing.  
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do they really know how to get information though, or are -- are they just to just, you know, getting stuff by clicking on a mouse?  Isn't that kind of --
L:  Yeah.  A- again that goes --
R:  -- too easy?
L:  -- back to, I guess, how they're taught to use a computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What they use it for.  Yeah.  I mean, that's true.
R:  It's too easy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [LAUGH] And you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- know, there are more and more students cheating also because they find so much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- information available online.
L:  That is true.
R:  You can actually, you know, buy papers for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all kinds of classes and so on.  
L:  Oh, right.
L:  So, in that sense, I guess it would harm education.
L:  [NOISE] It does harm -- yeah, I guess it he- harms that way.  But, [NOISE] I think in the long run it's got to be -- it's got to be a lot more beneficial than harmful. [NOISE]  But, yeah, there's always the pros and cons of each side [NOISE] -- each --
R:  Mhm.  What about, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what do you think of, ah, digital divide?
L:  Which kind -- what kind of devices? 
R:  No, the digital -- digital divide.  You know, the fact that if you have access to a computer you have access of a lot more things than if you --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- don't have access to a computer.
L:  Right.  The kids -- I mean, I'm sure the kids who -- who lack in computer -- I mean, lack the access to computers -- like, for a while, when, um, [NOISE] at my house, [NOISE] we didn't a com- -- the Internet was messed up.  And that -- that time alone, maybe it was three or four days, the kids -- like, all the kids in the house were -- it's really, like, hurting that they couldn't get to the websites they needed.  And, like, a lot of the homework and the stuff that we need are on the websites now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Instead of delivered.  'Cause I -- I -- I mean, I'm from the University -- University of Texas at Austin.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's a really big university, with classes like two or three hundred people.  So, they don't always, like, pass out papers or anything like that.  They tell us to go to websites, and say, "Hey, we're gonna save some money on, like, paper and, you know, whatever".  But, it's easier to tell the students, "Go to websites".  And the second you don't have that access, lose a lot -- a lot -- lot of time -- ah, potential time to do homework. [NOISE] 
R:  Actually at big universities like, ah, UT, don't you have -- don't all incoming --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- freshmen have to have a computer?
L:  [NOISE] No they don't.
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought so.  
L:  Yeah.  They don't --
R:  Well, I guess I --
L:  -- don't have that going on --
R:  -- was mistaken.
L:  -- right now. [NOISE] I think --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- some of the honors programs have that, but the general students don't.
R:  Hm.  Oh, okay. I guess I was wrong.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I think that might be at something -- like, at most universities -- higher level universities, they just make every student -- incoming freshman buy a computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- I mean, I think some -- some -- our engineering, ah, school makes sure the kids get, ah, what's it -- um, they buy laptops, even, like, the graduate school here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The [inaudible] graduate school.  They all have laptops when they come around.  They had to buy 'em.
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE] So ...
R:  Yeah.  So, more money for more education. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- I mean, education's getting a lot more expensive.  It seemed like -- steady climb.  When I first got to university I think my monthly -- my semester fees were, like, eighteen hundred for, like, twelve to thirt- fourteen hours.  Now it's, like, twenty one -- twenty two hundred. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  It's a lot more now.
R:  Wow.  That's kind of -- of unfair to people who can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- afford it though, huh?
L:  Yeah.  It's true 'cause I mean, like -- but also, I mean, I don't think -- there's no one who can't go to university 'cause the uni- -- our government pays -- like, will give you loans to, enough for you to live, ah -- live like [NOISE] -- enough for your books, tuition and some living costs.  They always give loans, if not grants or anything.  They'll always give loans to everybody.
R:  Right.  But, you know --
L:  So --
R:  -- the -- the loans -- I mean, financially is it conditional, you know, upon a bunch of factors.  N- not everybody can get financial aid.  And then it put also more pressure on you once you graduate to actually get a job, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Of course.
R:  -- within six months.  So, I'm -- you know, don't you think maybe some people are more reluctant to go to college because they don't want to be, you know, in debt by the time they graduate?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm sure some people find it, like, a [inaudible] hill to climb to get the money, and then having, like -- once you gain the money, how are you gonna pay it back, and just a whole opt- -- if you don't have the option of getting some somewhere, then finding the money is hard. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm sure it deters people from school, but that's something, like -- at any time, you gotta risk something before you gain something.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, risking some mon- -- like the chances of having to pay something back and they get an education out of it, or you can earn money -- higher -- higher paid, I think that all -- [NOISE] most people that who -- who are willing to take a chance will go for it.
R:  Yeah.  I guess so.  
L:  So --
R:  I guess so.  Well, you know, the other thing I was thinking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the use of computers in education is that it makes -- since, you know, you interact less and less with people --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and more and more through, you know, the computer.  It makes education less, ah, you know, individual -- less personalized.  Isn't that, ah, a negative effect?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- I -- as of right now, where I'm at, at university you see less student teacher interaction, so that alone [NOISE] hurts.  I mean, introduction of computers, like the websites that [several inaudible words].  Of course we don't get the, ah, [NOISE] -- the -- I mean, it's a lot different [NOISE] when teacher tells you [inaudible] in your face, [NOISE] and she'll -- helps you do it, while ot- -- now where it's set, the slides and stuff like that are all on the website.  You don't get the whole -- the effect of -- yeah, I'm sure you get a lot more from, you know, teacher itself.
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  One on one interaction.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you might as well stay home and just study online.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  You -- I mean, you lo- -- I mean, you can probably get through the class, but you don't get as much out of it. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's interesting because, see, you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a student, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I'm a professor. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] And --
L:  [NOISE] You're [inaudible] the other aspects.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exactly. [LAUGH]  And -- and I can see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, in large class- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- large classes, but the largest I teach have fifty students in them.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  But, the largest --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, the class --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the more stude- the more I use the computer --
L:  Right. [NOISE]  
R:  You know, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a website, and a discussion forum online, and --
L:  Ah, [NOISE] exactly.
R:  -- I encourage --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- students, you know, to get a hold of me through email.  And at first[?], you know, a lot more things online they can access -- class notes --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- and papers and all kinds of stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  But I feel I get to know the students a lot less, and the rapport between me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the student is not as good --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- as in, you know, smaller classes where I've got less than thirty students and I get to know the names, you know, within a couple of weeks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I feel like I care about them, you know, and they're not just a social security number on a piece of paper.
L:  Right.  I understand 'cause, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I -- when I first got here at the university like I took all the classes that were, like, the freshman core classes. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there was, like, two -- three hundred people in each class.  But, now that I'm taking my -- I've been doing CS classes, [NOISE] there's not more than, like, maybe twenty or thirty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] and sometimes, say, twelve. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And of course there's a m- -- there's a -- like, these teachers -- maybe they know your name, they know everything -- how you progressed through the class. [NOISE]  And so you get -- you get a better understanding -- a better feel of the class al- also.
R:  Right.
L:  You're not left out in the open.  In just out in the open you're just kind of, like, hanging out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  W- --
