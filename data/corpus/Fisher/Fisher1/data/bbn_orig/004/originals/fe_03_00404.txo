R:  Hi.  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Ah, this is, ah, Chrisu[?].
L:  Yes, ah, my name's Kevin.
R:  Ah, hi.  How are you?
L:  Very good.
R:  Ah, so we are supposed to talk about education?
L:  Yeah.  Computers -- whether they make [SIGH] -- whether they're good for education or bad, I guess.
R:  Um, why bad?
L:  What's that?
R:  Ah, why specifically bad?
L:  Well, I don't know.  That what I'm saying, ah, I think the thing is, ah, do they help or hinder education?
R:  Um, I guess if they are used as just a distraction I would say, yeah, they -- they are a problem for education.  But, ah, there is one issue in that I think they prevent people from actually reading more books.  That's one of the things that I -- I notice.
L:  Ah, and I would agree.  They do tend to be a distracter from more mainstream type things.  Um, and, you know, as far as -- I mean, I don't know how far they want to go on the computer topic.  However, I would say that if you're looking at the computer, using the Internet for research, ah, for something, you don't really know the validity of a website, um, because there isn't anything that -- where anyone has to check or double check the information put on a website.  Whereas if you were to get information from a -- a book, you know, the editor of the book or whoever has double checked the information.
R:  Um, yeah.  I mean, but depending on the kind of information you were looking for, there are sources of information that, ah, are more or less official on -- on the Internet.  So, you -- depending on whether the person prefer looking for information on, um, medicine for example.  You have number of sites that are, um, maintained by organizations that are professional organizations, so you go look for information there.  I -- I think it's the same with books.  I mean, you go to the library.  Depending on what you're looking for you might not find a source that would be, ah, believable in many respects.  Um, I guess that -- that risk also exists in -- with this.  Ah, the point is that on the Internet you have way more information than we can -- handling a lot of information that, ah, is not identified as having a specific source.  So, that -- that's -- I guess that's -- complicates --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  It complicates when there is no providence for it. Ah, the other thing with computers that are helpful in one respect, ah, say, in completing a paper.  Your computers obviously help you, ah, to correct spelling and grammer, ah, problems.  However, that ha- -- that's a double edged sword in that, ah, having that -- that computer do the spelling -- check the spelling and check some of the grammer for you -- people, it seems now have a lot harder time doing that themselves.  Nobody seems to know, gee how's that really spelt.
R:  Um, I -- yeah I don't really know.  I mean, I don't know about any specific issues where it should -- that people might mention.  I -- I -- I think even for people who are not like -- don't even know how to use a spell checker, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on a computer.  I think they -- they show the same kind of problems with respect to spell- -- especially in English, in which there are so many problems with vowels for example and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- way they are spelt.  I -- I guess -- I -- I -- I -- I wouldn't give up on the idea that we have something automatic because it's actu- -- in the end, it's actually boring to check for spelling on the text or anything like this.  Um, and I guess some people just don't -- don't care about such issues.  I mean, if they know it they -- they do, but if they don't they just don't -- don't pay so much attention to this.
L:  [MN] And you may have a very point.  It may not be the fault of the -- the technology.  It may be [LAUGH] the fault --
R:  I --
L:  -- of the desire of the people involved.  The desire to do it correctly or -- or the desire just to [SIGH] not care about it, you know.
R:  Um, yeah.  I -- I guess I mean, like there's people -- people who deal with publications for example.  Many times people who write papers, for example, they just, ah, don't even care so much about this 'cause they say, "Oh, there is going to be someone who's gonna be the, ah -- gonna be the copy editing, and they're gonna find, ah, problems like this.  So, it's not something that I should worry about".  And they actually catch a lot of these things in the end.   
L:  Yeah, that's probably true.  Ah, [MN] you know, I don't know, ah, a lot of other issues that are regarding to computers -- regarding computers in education, other than, ah, you know how -- how they're -- I guess they could be used more in, ah, some sort of research, um ... ah -- you know, used as data compilers.  But, ah, I don't really know anything about that.  Um, have you had any experience with, ah, computers in education?
R:  Oh well, I mean, basically I -- I -- I -- people don't -- especially if you are college education, it's impossible to d- do anything without the computer nowadays.  Especially because many of the things have been over the -- the Internet.  So, you exchange a lot of information with students, and materials, and it's just impossible not to rely on the computer.  Um, and I think people are moving more and more in this direction.  So, for example many classes are taught nowadays with, ah, all the material being made available on the Internet.  Ah, so it's not usually the case that we'd bring printouts to classes anymore because many things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are just made available to the students and they just go and check.  So, they don't -- for example, homework.  Many people are actually moving in the direction of having assignments made available on the web.  They don't grade them.  The students just --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- have to do them and then they go and check the -- the -- the answers for the assignments, if the -- if it is just homework.  Ah, but I mean, it's just gonna be a matter of time before people actually, um, just accept the idea that we shouldn't be, ah, checking on what students are doing all the time.  The people should give them more responsibility in that, well, they want to learn.  And if they want to do that it's -- it doesn't make much sense to be checking on whether they are doing their work or not.
L:  All right.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Either if -- if they want to learn they'll work towards it, and if they don't want to learn then they won't -- then they won't learn it.
R:  Well, I mean, there are going to be -- there are -- there are, ah, thresholds, right?  They have to -- to pass certain, ah, ah -- they have to satisfy certain requirements.  So, it doesn't mean that because they don't need to be graded on their assignment they are not going to be graded at all.  So, in the end they have to take an exam, they have to write the final paper.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Ah, things that -- I mean, at some point throughout the course, a whole semester course, they are going to be tested on how much they have learned.  And, ah, that's when we actually know whether the students are actually doing their work on a regular basis or not.
L:  And that makes more sense.  
R: Yeah.
L:  Ah, obviously at some point, you know, ah, the school isn't as responsible maybe as the -- or the college, university isn't as responsible as the student is about, ah, attempting to learn the --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- information.  I -- you know, this whole conversation comes back around to, ah, the computers again.  Once again, it's -- I -- I think that computers can be very useful for education if they are -- you know, if they're exploited properly and not -- not abused.  I mean, obviously any type of research, you know, like I said earlier -- you know, there are websites that don't have the right, ah, providence and may be putting out bad info.  But, like you pointed out, there are -- there are books that have the same problem.  You can print just about anything.  So, it comes down to, you know, verifying your sources one way or another.
R:  Yes.  Um, I mean, but now with respect to the -- the computers -- that's just using the computers in general.  I mean, there are things nowadays that we can't even do without the computer in terms of, like, education.  They are not used just as support.
L:  Right.
R:  They are actually, ah, the main tool to -- to do a lot of things in many -- in many fields.  So, people are actually moving in the direction of not being able to do their work efficiently without the computer at all.  I mean, if you're talking about people who, like, are writers or, like, philosophers, ah, historians -- people who actually rely on print material a lot.  It may not be such an issue, because in the end they're gonna use computers for maybe, ah, word processing in many respects.  But, in other fields in which we should -- need to do experimental work, like lab work --
L:  Right.
R:  It's just impossible for people to do much without the computer.
L:  Mm, because they can -- they can process the data that a human being just can't -- can't do.
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean, actu- actually the data collection itself, ah, is -- many things are now made through computers, so it's not --
