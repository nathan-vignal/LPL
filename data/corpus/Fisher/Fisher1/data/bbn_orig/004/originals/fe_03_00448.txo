R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, Linda.  I'm Pat.
R:  Hi, Pat.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  What part of the country are you in?
R:  New York.
L:  New York.  
R:  Rochester.
L:  You're -- I'm in, um, Atlanta.
R:  Oh.  You've gotten way nicer weather than I have.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was going to say that.  We're looking at about, uh, in fact, it- it's odd, right now it's -- it's an extremely low temperature, like twenty three degrees.
R:  During the day?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, just for the past couple of days.
R:  That's not bad.  I -- I think, uh, my cousin lives in Atlanta and I was surprised to find out that, um, Christmas Day or New Year's Day was so cold.  I don't remember which one but it was like, I thought it was ninety there all the time.
L:  No, no, no.  We have [COUGH] very fluctuating temperatures which is unfortunate for me b- -- to live here.  I'm thinking of moving, actually.  Um, because we have summer -- we have all four seasons.  
R:  You do end up with winter then?
L:  Oh, yeah, we have winter.  We don't have the snow and ice.
R:  But you still get the cold?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The bad part.  And it's -- it's -- we have unusually cold temperatures in the last, I guess, two or three days.  Um, last night was in the teens.  
R:  God, that's about what we have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm surprised.
L:  Yeah, we have to go to a lot of, um, I guess, trouble [LAUGH] when that happens.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Um --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- like leaving the water running all night so the pipes don't freeze.
R:  Oh, yeah, because you're not set up to deal with that --
L:  No, not at all.
R:  -- kind.  Oh.
L:  You see we have -- it's not unusual to be ninety in the summer and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- fifteen to twenty in the winter, so I -- it seems to me they would have built our homes better.
R:  You're right.  It's --
L:  Or be a little bit more --
R:  -- because of the fluctuation, right.
L:  -- a little -- yeah.  Are you in a house or an apartment?
R:  We're in a house and we've been buried with snow the past couple of weeks.
L:  See, and people down here, especially the kids, would love it.
R:  But we had seventy degree weather and sixty degree weather just a few we- -- uh, it would snow for a few days and be really cold, then everything would melt.  Then it would snow again but now these past couple of weeks, it's just been freezing and snowing.
L:  Well, the -- the topic they just gave us, um, I think was, do you prefer, um --
R:  Indoor or outdoor activities.
L:  Yeah, and -- or summer or winter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's funny because, you know, we see on TV all these kids get for Christmas, Santa Claus brings them little snowboards or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  Sleighs and that kind of -- and we don't have that.  And it's funny because when we have snow here, it's such a big deal.
R:  The kids get all happy --
L:  They go out, yeah --
R:  -- don't they?
L:  Oh gosh.  Sch- school's closed.  You know everything closes.
R:  Ah.
L:  And the kids go out and -- and -- and it's funny to watch them.  They will find anything they can --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to slide down the street or -- or a bank in the grass, or whatever, on this snow.  And the big thing is, uh, trash can lids.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's like the rubber kind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they don't have that handle on the top or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  And I mean, they go really fast.
R:  Wow!
L:  But you just don't see it and -- and it's such a big deal because the weather people get all bent out of shape.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they assume that we're having some sort of a catastrophe.  
R:  Right.
L:  And then it doesn't happen, you know.  Or if it does --
R: It's a kind of a -- a welcome difference once in a while.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- [MN] I don't know, the kids down here would love to be where you are.  I'm sure.
R:  Oh, see I -- I just -- even when I was a little kid I didn't want to go outside in the winter.
L:  I don't like winter either. 
R:  I don't.  Absolutely do not.  I don't do anything outside in the winter.
L:  I don't either and I'm a gardener.  I have --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a, um, nice big yard and --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  So everything's outside in the summer and I hide inside --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the winter.
L:  We're like bears.
R:  Yeah.  Hi- hi- --
L:  We hi- --
R:  Yeah, hibernating --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yes, exactly.
L:  We hibernate in the winter.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think, though it -- [SIGH] I'm thinking of moving.  In fact, I am a real estate agent and I've got my house on the market and I'm s- -- I was seriously considering moving south so that I could have my outdoor time.
R:  All year round?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or -- or at least, you know, most of the year.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, my sister just moved to Sarasota and her kids said they never want to see snow again, [LAUGH] and she --
R:  Oh, it is --
L:  -- doesn't want to come home for the holidays because of the sn- [MN] -- "Uh, we don't want to see that snow".  She loves it.
L:  Well, when, uh, the topic was mentioned and it said indoor or outdoor, uh, winter or summer.  I -- I don't even know what sports or outdoor activities you can do in --
R:  In the winter.
L:  -- in the winter other than playing -- making a snowman.
R:  Skiing.
L:  Do you?
R:  People -- we've got ski resorts around the area and, um, [MN] some people snowboard, sledding, ice skating.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I --you won't find me doing any of those.  Hockey.
L:  You see, our -- our ice skating here is indoors.
R:  Right.  We have indoors and outdoors, but even the indoor rinks are freezing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  I have no desire to be cold.
R:  Right.  Me either.  [LAUGH]
L:  No and -- but I will stay out in the summer.  Uh, spring and fall and summer, you will find me, every minute I have available outdoors, a dirty, nasty, sweaty mess.
R:  Me too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I would g- -- I was out there before the [inaudible].  I was out there by eight in the morning and I didn't want to come in.  It was dark and I'm still sitting outside trying to do things. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Paint little rocks for my garden --
L:  Oh, yeah.  See I didn't realise you could even --
R:  and -- and stuff.
L:  -- you have that kind of weather up there.  I didn't know that.
R:  Well, we ended up with warm weather all the way through to, like, the end of October.  So, I was still watering flowers two months after I thought they should've been gone.
L:  Mhm.  Me too.  
R:  But it was nice.
L:  We had an unusual season here.  I also do, um, uh, tomatoes and that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah, see I haven't done any vegetables.  I'm not real good with 
L:  It's so easy.
R:  Like I -- m- -- we always had vegetable gardens when we were kids.  My grandparents, my parents, but I'm just like, I don't know, I'm just not a real big vegetable eater either so 
L:  Oh, okay.  I wasn't either and -- and it was like, I'm going to buy this little baby tomato plant because, you know, outdoors i- i- it would give me another reason to go out every day to check on it --
R:  Just to go --
L:  -- to see if it grew --
R:  -- yeah, to go check on 
L:  -- quarter of an inch.  And I put it in the ground and, um, then I figured out that you have to have those, like a cage thingy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so it doesn't just grow up and fall on the ground.
R:  Oh, yeah, like a trellis.
L:  So I figured out to do that.  And I was more into just seeing what would happen, uh --
R:  Just --
L:  -- springtime, you know, and then as it gets hotter and hotter and hotter to see if it would grow faster or what happened.  And it did.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it took off pretty well in the spring, but by summer I had so many tomatoes I was giving them away and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had no clue what I was doing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I acted like I did.  But I didn't know what I was doing.
R:  And it worked out.
L:  I didn't even know when to pick the tomato.
R:  See, I don't know any of that either.
L:  Well --
R:  The flowers really, I mean, this year was the first year I had the time to be out there.  I -- whether -- even if I was outside it was at someone else's house, um, doing something else.  But this is the first summer where I was out from morning 'til night planting my own flowers and planting, you know, bushes and stuff like that.  But the vegetable garden scared me [LAUGH] you know, it was like --
L:  It's easier than flowers.
R:  I probably should try it when it warms up this year.
L:  I was surprised.  I thought it was going to take, you know, a degree in a- plants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- it's so much --
R:  You had to know what was going on.
L:  -- easier.  Well, you just stick it in the ground and give it water and that's all you do.  I mean, what else.  You know, there's no pruning or any of that to it.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- and then when they're done, um, at the end of the season you just pull 'em up and put 'em in the compost pile.  And they're, you know, and you've got a place, um, to dig up for next year which is easier because you've already made the -- the dirt good, so all you have to do is add stuff to the dirt.  But you just really put it in the ground and eat the tomatoes.  That's basically what happens.
R:  I have to try that this summer.
L:  It's -- it was such a sense of -- of, uh, pride.
R:  I know.  It makes you feel good.  You can go --
L:  You say, "Oh my gosh.  God and I did this together and it worked".  You know, and here's this red plump tomato so   I didn't use to eat them and then I started, sort of, putting -- I thought, "Well, since I've got them, I can put -- put them on my salad".
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And it was just in g- -- take my mother or a neighbour.  "Would you like a couple of tomatoes?"  You know.  "Oh, yeah".  And -- and they think you know what you're doing.
R:  Well I got to try that.  I definitely have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to try it.
L:  It's good.  And it gets you, um, outdoors.  You know, it's another thing --
R:  Keeps you out there.
L:  -- to do outside, since we like that anyway.  I just don't -- I don't know, winter to me is [COUGH] something to tolerate.
R:  That's it.  That's all I'm doing is t- tol- -- actually I have a muscle disorder and I'm in a lot of pain during the winter.
L:  Mm.
R:  So now my sister's working on me.  She's only been out there, like, six months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's working on me to go too.
L:  I was going to say, if you're already --
R:  "Oh, it's warm all year".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well go visit.  You could go down and visit the warm weather.
R:  Oh, yeah, everybody's been there.  My whole family.  My parents are there again for two more months and I haven't gone yet.  I am going to go.  I --
L:  I would love to live in Florida.  I lived in --
R:  Oh, so would I.
L:  -- Florida one time and it was round near warm weather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I loved it.  I lived -- I lived in, um, [MN] less than a year but in Melbourne, which is just south of, um, the Cape.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, where the -- where the shuttles and all that go off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH]  And the only thing I did not like about it -- I mean, I like the year round but I did not like their bugs. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they have these huge bugs and -- and a different kind of bugs that I was used to in Georgia.
R:  Right.
L:  But other than that, and I guess that's kind of minor but, you know --
R:  Yeah, compared to all the other things [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it -- it really bothered me, those humongous bugs.  
R:  Huh.
L:  And -- and fleas were bad.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And mosquitoes were bad and any- anything that warm weather brings out was there.
R:  Did we have all those horrors here in the summer though?  [LAUGH] 
L:  But they have it there year round.  It's there --
R:  I mean, we have terrible mosquitoes, yeah.
L:  It's there twelve -- twelve months of the year.
R:  There, it's all the time.
L:  Mhm and I just uh-uh.  It was a constant battle with the fleas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and mosquitoes and that kind of thing.  And they didn't have, uh, the -- the flea treatments that we have now.  They hadn't, like, invented those things
