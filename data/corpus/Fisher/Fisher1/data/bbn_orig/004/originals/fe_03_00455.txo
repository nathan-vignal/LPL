L:  Hi, call partner.  My name is Kathy.
R:  Ah, hi, my name's Ris.
L:  [LAUGH] Ruth?
R:  Ris.
L:  Oh, hi.  How are ya?
R:  Fine.  How are you?
L:  Just fine. 
R:  So what kind of, uh, outdoor activities do you like, summer or winter?
L:  Summer activities.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the way with me.  [MN] I'm not much of a cold weather [LAUGH] person.
L:  I live in the cold weather and I hate it.  It's snowing outside now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Where are you at that it's snow -- that it's snowing?
L:  I'm in Wisconsin.  Where are you at?
R:  Oh, I'm in Wyoming.
L:  Oh, okay.  I was in Wyoming once.
R:  Ah.
L:  And it's very pretty up there.  It is very pretty up there.
R:  It's pretty but, boy, we need moisture.  I wish we'd get some of that snow.
L:  Oh no!  You don't want snow.  I hate cold.  I hate cold.
R:  Well, I don't like cold but we need the moisture --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I would -- I would put up with it just to get the moisture --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause we've been in such a drought that it's terrible.
L:  Yeah, well, I like -- I like summertime.  We go boating and -- and swimming.  We live right by a lake, about a quarter mile from the lake, so we do a lot of -- of barbecuing out there and it's a lot of fun.
R:  Oh, that's neat.  Now I do a lot of gardening --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the summer so I -- I do like to have some moisture [LAUGH] because --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you can't grow much if you don't have water.
L:  What is it that you grow?  Flowers or vegetables, both?
R:  Both.  
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  Yeah, I, uh, I belong to the master gardeners through the university here in ...
L:  Oh, really.
R:  So it's kind of fun to try new things and ...
L:  Nice.
R:  And, you know, just to -- to grow enough for my own use.  I don't grow for, you know, for a truck garden or anything, just --
L:  Right.
R:  Just to play in the dirt.
L:  Well, this year's going to be my first garden, um, vegetable garden.  And I'm gonna -- I'm going to grow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- vegetables to give away.  To can as gifts and give away.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I --I'm looking forward to that because I've never done that before.
R:  Oh, I think you'll like it 'cause -- 
L:  I think so too.  My girlfriend grows a garden, a big one, and I lo- -- I love going over there and seeing all -- watching all the stuff grow and, of course, I like eating it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  And she makes nice gifts, too, you know.  Like at Christmastime she wra- -- um, puts them in cans with little nice, um, tops.  You know, um, needlepoint tops and ...
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Very, very pretty.
R:  Yeah, it's fun to do that kind of stuff and ...
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- what is this study?  We're -- we just -- what are we doing?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess we're supposed to be talking about what we like and, uh, you know this is my first time at it so ...
L:  Mine too.
R:  Uh, I'm not really sure how long we're supposed to talk or what we're supposed to talk about other than, you know, this is the outside activities --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- thing that they --
L:  -- here, um, you know being it's wintertime, we just got our first snow, believe it or not.  We s- -- we normally, well, we had one snow in October and usually we have a good winter by now and, uh, which hurts our ski lodge here but, um, it just started to snow.  It's -- it's not enough to go skiing yet but, you know, in the wintertime, like my nephew here, he goes -- we do the snowmobile thing and the snowboarding, and he just got his first pair of trick skis and he's waiting for a big snow so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's like everybody else in town here.  There's no snow yet which means the, um, ski lodge doesn't have any business yet and for this little town that's not good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, w- we're kind of the same way.  We -- we started -- we have a winter carnival --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- here for the whole county.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they do, you know, ice fishing and then they --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- do a lot of stuff on the lake.  'Cause we're -- I'm about, oh, about five miles from the lake.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Do you like to ice fish also?
R:  No.  
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  I do as long as there's a little heater in there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, I [LAUGH] I, uh, I would spend a lot of my time in the -- s- Southern California so I'm not into any of --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the winter activities at all.
L:  Yeah, I'm originally from California, Monterey, so, yeah, snow's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not my big thing either.  
R:  Yeah, but, uh, I -- I do help with some of the other stuff with the Chamber of Commerce so, you know, we're hoping with -- it's cold enough for the ice to, you know, they can --
L:  To be frozen, right.
R:  -- do the ice fishing.
L:  Right.
R:  But we just don't have enough snow for, you know, snowmobiles and stuff like that this year.
L:  Yeah.  I have a girlfriend that goes out to Wyoming every year.  Um, they don't know anybody there.  Ah, her parents live in Pennsylvania and my girlfriend lives here in Wisconsin and they both travel, you know, her and her husband and her parents, travel by car and meet in --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Wyoming.  That's their --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- meeting spot.  Her parents just love Wyoming.  And they don't know a soul there.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well ...
L:  And they -- and they do this trip, uh, twice a year and they're --
R:  Well, it shouldn't --
L:  -- and they're gone for two weeks.
R:  Yeah.  It's a nice state and it's not heavily populated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, it's the least populated state.
L:  Are you anywhere near Cheyenne?
R:  Uh, no.  I'm in -- I'm right about in the middle of the state.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Cheyenne is right down on the border.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Near Colorado.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  That's where I went.
R:  Yeah.  No, I'm up in the middle of the state there.
L:  So you have a lot of mountains there, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love that.  Wyoming is -- is, I think, is the only state that really has territory that's not even been discovered yet.
R:  Um, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah, there's -- I mean, there's wilderness where people could actually go out there and just literally live off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- said land and not anybody know that they're out there.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  That's what I've heard.
R:  Well, and it -- it's that way around here.
L:  Nice.
R:  Where -- I'm twenty miles from the nearest town where you can do even grocery shopping.
L:  Wow!  Yeah, I --I'm about twenty miles from -- from the nearest grocery shopping to anything --
R:  You know --
L:  -- that's worth going to anyway.
R:  We have a couple little convenience stores that, uh --
L:  Yeah, we have -- we have, uh, two little stores that close at noon on Sunday and they're closed by six thirty at night e- every other -- you know, every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we go twenty miles, you know.  And -- and, of course, the big thrill is Walmart, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we have one of those.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I like these little towns.  I live close enough to Green Bay, it's only eighty miles, so if I want to drive an hour and a half I -- you know, I've got a bigger city.  But, you know, that's where my kids live but I love, um, living out in the -- where I live.
R:  Well, that's why I am here.  'Cause there's practically no traffic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know you can --
L:  Don't you just love that?
R:  You can drive twenty miles to town and maybe pass half a dozen vehicles.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Going in the opposite --
L:  It's the same thing.
R:  -- direction.
L:  Yeah.  It's just like out here.  I just -- I like that.  You know, I'm from a city originally and -- and coming out here to the country.  I just love it and there's so -- you know what, I'm -- when I'm in the city I get bored and since I've lived here for two years now, I haven't had a bored day.  It's so funny.  I never get bored.
R:  Well, I think you can, you know, when you're in a small town you can do a lot of things that you don't do in the city.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, like with me, I spend my time in the summertime, I'm out in the garden by six o'clock in the morning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and you can't do that in the city.
L:  No, you can't.
R:  Well you can, but it's not -- it's just not the --
L:  Yeah, you got everybody else --
R:  -- same.
L:  -- trampling through it.  Yeah, it's not the same.
R:  Right.
L:  And the noise.
R:  And the heavy traffic and everything and ...
L:  Yeah, my son came and stayed with me for a couple of months and, uh, um, he said, "Ma, I can't believe it.  I just feel like all I do here is sleep.  The nights must be longer here".  [LAUGH]  I said, "No, it's quieter".  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just quieter.  You bet.
L:  It's quieter.  I mean and --
R:  You know.
L:  -- uh, you know, going outside is really nice at night, you know.
R:  We don't hear sirens or --
L:  Yeah, no sirens.
R:  -- fire whistles that may be --
L:  We don't even have street lights on our -- on our road here.  We don't -- no street lights.  And it can pretty dark out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we have bears and -- and there's wolves here and a lot of bear.  A lot of bear.  A lot of deer.
R:  Yeah, we have a lot of -- well, of course, we have lots of antelope here.
L:  Right.  Oh yeah, that's right.  Neat.
R:  And, uh, and they like to come and eat the flowers out of the garden and ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my sister, um, who- who's -- we -- we have a house together here.  Uh, she has two goats.  I don't know why she wanted goats but she's got [LAUGH] these goats for the grandkids who like goats.
R:  Mm.
L:  And these goats get out of their pen sometimes and the first thing they do is eat all our flowers.  Every one of them.
R:  Y- oh yeah.
L:  All they do is eat food.
R:  Course they're good for eating the weeds and the grass too.
L:  Yeah, but they'll tear up everything --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- else around it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah!
L:  All they do is eat and chew and climb.  They're good for nothing, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Unless you like goat milk and then you can [inaudible].  
L:  Yeah, but I don't dri- -- 
R:  If they're females you can milk 'em.
L:  Yeah, I don't drink the goat milk.  We had a female that -- that was pregnant but she lost them --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and then, um -- that was g- -- she had them premature so it was kind of sad.  But they're going to breed her again.  Try again.  But, uh, ye- I like, um, and so it's [MN] -- and so do you normally have -- you normally have snow then where you're at?
R:  We get some snow.  We're high desert.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  Where we're at here.  We're more or less a plateau with, you know, we're -- we still have -- I look out my front window and I see mountains.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  But we're basically, uh, high desert.
L:  Right.  We don't have mountains here.  There's -- they call them hills.  I don't see any hills out here.  Uh, but we have a lot of trees and we're surroun- -- you know, we live out in the country so we're surrounded by -- by trees.
R:  Yeah, we have trees here but the -- we've been in a drought now for about five years.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And so we've lost a lot of --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the trees and a lot of people have lost their yards because --
L:  Too bad.
R:  You know, well there just isn't water to -- to keep --
L:  So you need the snow.
R:  -- them up.  So we need the moisture.
L:  Yeah, you do need the snow.  Yeah, if we don't have any -- a -- a good winter and I say this -- they said that this winter's going to be milder than last year and that won't be good for the farmers around here.  There's a lot of farmers.  And that won't be good for them.  Or the soil, I guess.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's -- you know, the -- the thing with the -- the rain or snow, it has so many minerals in it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you don't get from city water.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's, uh, you know, we really, really need it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But not much we can do about it but ...
L:  Yeah, there's not much you can do about it, that's for sure.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And
