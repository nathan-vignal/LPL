L:  My name is Julie.
R:  Hi, I'm Amber.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, and you?
R:  Ah, I'm cold.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's cold.
R:  I'm in Memphis, Tennessee, and we had snow and, you know, we never get snow.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this is like being -- this is like being like up north somewhere.
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm in Missouri, so, in Paris.
R:  Are -- are you guys getting snow?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Have -- have had for two days.
R:  Wow!  See ours is gone, the sun's come out and it's melted.  And now I'm waiting on summer.
L:  Oh, I wish summer would  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I definitely do not like this cold weather, let me tell you.  [COUGH]
R:  I guess we're in agreement then that we both like warm weather activities a lot better?
L:  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Definitely.  'Cause I like to be --
R:  Without a doubt.  [NOISE]
L:  I like to be outside where I can do my gardening and, you know, enjoy the sun.  [LAUGH]
R:  A- and I'm the same way.
L:  But I don't want -- I don't want it too hot.
R:  Anything in the water.
L:  Yeah, I like that too but I don't want it to be too hot.  I just want to it to be comfortable, nice, um, yeah I like the -- I like the water sports too, so [inaudible] used to live there.
R:  Do you ski?
L:  No.  I, um, --
R:  No.
L:  --  unfortunately got hurt doing that so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we can't do that.  [LAUGH]  But we have a big lake and we can go boating and we do that quite often.
R:  Do -- do you do the jet ski thing now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or do --
L:  I can do that.
R:  -- you just like fishing and swimming?
L:  [SIGH]  Mainly the fishing and the swimming.  We do more of that than we do anything else.  Because the lake is so, like, populated, [LAUGH] so --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where in Missouri are in you?
L:  Have you ever heard of Mark Twain Lake?
R:  Never.  [LAUGH]
L:  Serious.  It's wonderful.  [LAUGH]  It's wonderful.
R:  And where -- where -- what part of Missouri's that?
L:  It's right in central Missouri. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow!  So your -- your -- your guys climate is very similar to ours, I guess?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, we get a lot of [MN] -- now this year we haven't had --
R:  Winter weather.
L:  -- much.  Yeah, we haven't had very much.  But usually we get quite [LAUGH] so we've been lucky this year.  So 
R:  What other kind of activities do you like?  I'm -- I'm fond of tennis and golf.  Do you like either of those?
L:  Well, no, not really.  My kids keep me busy and, like, basketball and baseball.  We do a lot of that.  Um, just of lot of hiking.  We go out a lot and just walk through the woods and discover nature and that kind of thing -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because I have small children.
R:  You have -- how small are you children?
L:  Uh-huh, eight and five.
R:  Oh, they do keep you busy, don't they? 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, very much so.
R:  I live, um -- in Memphis, I live really close, I don't know if you know where the Botanic Gardens are?  Memphis Botanic Gardens?
L:  I've heard of them.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I've never seen 'em.
R:  We have ninety six acres in the middle of the city.  There's nothing but just green lush grass and trees and flowers.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  My favorite thing to do in the summertime is pack a picnic lunch and head out.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, we do that.
R:  It's my favorite thing.
L:  We go to the lake and they have, like, the ducks and stuff come in, and you can feed 'em and just picnic right there on the dock.  And that's wonderful.
R:  Wow!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  That's -- that's my main thing.  I love -- if I can get outside and feed the animals and, you know, that's more my thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  So more like walking and hiking?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's enough.
R:  I could do that.  I enjoy that.  It's not too strenuous on you.  You don't sweat too much.
L:  Well, too -- it's easier for my children to do things like that with them being so small.  You know --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- they're not really into the sports yet.  [LAUGH]  Other than my oldest one.  She likes basketball.  She's a basketball  she plays it everyday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you get out and play basketball with her?
L:  Yeah.  As much as possible.  Unfortunately, my son had a stroke when he was born and so that kind of limits me -- it ties me down. 
R: Yeah.
L:  But -- so I have to do activities outside that he can go with me.  [LAUGH]  So, it's kind of hard to do.
R:  I -- I can imagine.  But it sounds like you guys have fun.
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we're -- I guess if we can go to the park and feed the animals and -- that's things he can do and --
R:  And then everybody's happy.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  You guys have a lake -- do you have ever jump in, uh, l- like a kayak or anything like that and like row out to the middle?
L:  [MN]  I've never done that.  I've [inaudible] --
R:  Have you not?
L:  Uh-uh.  I would like to.
R:  I grew up on a lake and we had a kayak and I used to love to do that.  I'd get out in middle and wish somebody would come and get me because I'd be tired.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah  [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a lot of rowing to get out there.
L:  As much water as I've been around, I've done a little canoeing.  We used -- when I was little we used to go canoeing all the time.  But, now that the lake come in, there's just not any of those, you know, rivers that you can go down because it's all turned into the lake.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  We still go, um, to Spring River, Arkansas, Hardy.  I don't know exactly which one people would refer to it as.  We call it Spring River but it's really Hardy, Arkansas.  We go every, um, the holiday in September, is that Memorial Day or Labor Day?
L:  Mhm.  Memorial.
R:  [LAUGH]  Which- whichever one it is.  [LAUGH]  We go up there and -- and jump in the canoe and go rough -- I guess I call it rapids?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rapiding, or whatever the word is --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I'm looking for.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ride the rough rapids down and hope we don't turn over.
L:  [LAUGH]  They weren't that rough rivers when we were -- when I was little but that -- I don't know.  Like I said, most of the rivers that we used to play in, or canoe in, is all under lake now, so you either go to the lake or you don't.
R:  Or you don't get in the water.
L:  We don't have much water sports anymore, so 
R:  That's cool.
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah, that's kind of neat.  [LAUGH]  I can actually say I'm near something that's kind of, you know, popular.  A lot --
R:  And that --
L:  of [several inaudible words].
R:  And that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish I grew up on a lake and -- and now I'm in the middle of the city so it's --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- not anywhere near as accessible.
L:  Because you could -- we ran all over the ground that is under the lake.  And so when we watched them build it, and then when they let it fill up, you know, the rivers, the dam held it back and it filled up and everything, so it was kind of neat.  Because we knew the land that was under there.  So it was kind of neat.  It was kind of neat to watch.
R:  But I guess that was cool.  Did you guys like, um, did they let any volunteer --
L:  Um --
R:  -- people, like in the community, volunteer to help when they were doing it?
L:  Some.  Um, yeah, they had some, like on the construction and stuff that was in the community.  And they had different times that you could go down and watch.  Special things, you know, so it was kind of neat.  We took a lot of pictures.
R:  Wow!
L:  Spent a --
R:  That sounds like --
L:  -- lot of time --
R:  That sounds like quite an experience to watch the actual -- the earth change.  
L:  Yeah and --
R:  Even if it was man made it was still a big change.
L:  And now, when it -- like when it floods and stuff you think of how much it -- I mean, how much that land's changed.  It's just -- it's neat.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we do some caves -- cave touring quite often.  [inaudible].
R:  I enjoy that [inaudible], that's fun.
L:  Yeah, we go to -- last year we took a trip all over Missouri and dug caves.
R:  Mm.
L:  We've really seen some neat -- neat stuff that you didn't even know was there.  I mean, it looks like a big hill and then come find out there's all this wonderful stuff underground.  It was fabulous.
R:  We went to, um, Mammoth Springs, Kentucky, last year for -- over the summer and did that.  And the neatest thing I can remember is just wandering down to the -- to like, the very depths of one of the caves and looking up and seeing, um, I guess it's the stalactites had formed, what looked like Santa and his reindeer.
L:  Oh, that would have been cool.
R:  Yeah, it was the most amazing thing.  It was like, "Oh my gosh.  Look it's Santa".
L:  Oh [inaudible].
R:  And of course, then you have to hike right back up and it -- it wasn't so much fun.  [LAUGH]  No stairs.
L:  [inaudible].  My new husband just took me to Mammoth Springs.  This -- here back there in the summer.  That was the first time I had ever been there.  And I was -- I was amazed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is amazing.  It's -- it's absolutely --
L:  Everytime you go --
R:  -- beautiful.
L:  Everytime you go in an- -- in a different one.  I mean you discover something else that is so fabulous.
R:  You are so right about that.  And -- and it's just amazing because it -- it formed all on its own.
L:  You know, and a lot of people here in Missouri say, "Well, there is nothing here".  But there is if you just 
R:  Get out and look for it in nature.
L:  Right, you have to get out and look, you know, get around and look at it and [SIGH] but a lot of them don't, unfortunately.  I [several inaudible words].
R:  I'm sure it's like here.  People say all the time, "I hate Memphis.  I hate Memphis.  I hate Memphis".  And it's like, there's so much to do, you just have to go look for it.
L:  And, see, I would love to see Memphis.  I'd love to come and do -- travel.  In fact, we talked about doing that for our honeymoon and, unfortunately with my son, I can't.  But I would love to.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I've heard wonderful things about it but I've never been there.
R:  You know, if you come in April it's really not too hot here and it -- it's -- it's warm enough to be outside and enjoy the city.  So you can --
L:  Well --
R:  -- like, go on the walking tours.  Like a tour down Bell Street to the center of [several inaudible words].  Walk down by the river.  The zoo here's amazing.  They just opened up, um, a new Chinese panda exhibit.
L:  Mm, that's -- 
R:  It's an all day affair.  And the gardens -- I just love the gardens.  That's actually where I am now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In the cold out here.
L:  I bet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's freezing but it's still beautiful.
L:  [COUGH]  Well, if -- if you did not live in Tennessee what would be the one thing that you would see that you think is fabulous there?
R:  If I was coming to Memphis?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um.  I'm not going to use the whole Graceland thing because I -- touring Graceland wasn't that much fun.  It -- it -- it just didn't do a thing for me.
L:  Really?
R:  But, um, if you like music, Bell Street by all means.  And during the spring and the summer they have outside concerts all the time, so you can walk up and down Bell Street and hear music on every single corner, a different type of music.  They got blues, they got jazz.  Get some exercise and enjoy the outside.  [SIGH]  You got fresh squeezed lemonade at all the stands.  You have a cool refreshing drink while you're walking.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Absolutely wonderful.
L:  Wow!  Mm.
R:  You said earlier you like to garden.  What do -- do you like flowers or like shrubbery, greenery?
L:  Everything.  Everything.
R:  Really?
L:  Actually, I'm in the process of redoing my, uh, fountain.  I have a fountain in my yard, um, enlarging it so I can put fish in it.
R:  Oh, wow!  Yeah, that's great.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I bet that's taking a lot of energy?
L:  Yes.  A lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  What, you did it all on your own?
L:  Um, my
