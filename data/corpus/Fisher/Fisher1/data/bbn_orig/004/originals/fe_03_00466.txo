L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.  Hi.  My name is Chris.
L:  Hi, my name is -- excuse me?
R:  I'm Chris.
L:  Oh, hi, my name is Clement.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Nice to talk to you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  This is --
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  -- my first call so I -- it's kind of [inaudible].
L:  Yeah -- yeah, me too.  So it's ok- -- yeah, it's okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  We'll just get on with -- yeah, we'll -- we'll just get on with it.  Um.
R:  Okay.  So, friends.
L:  Yeah.  You want to start first.
R:  Uh.  Uh, sure.  Um, so I guess I've -- I'm more of a -- a few close friends type.  More so than a -- a lot of friends.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But -- uh-huh.
L:  That's cool.  That's cool 'cau- -- um, usually I have, um, a pretty good amount of friends and like, uh, well, it's probably been a couple of years since I've really had a lot of acquaintances.  So I guess it's kind a like inbetween, like in [MN] -- like I'm in the middle of it right now because I've slowly gone down in the number of friends because I've had too much, like, at work or something.  So I re- didn't have much time to make many friends or something because [MN] this past couple of years, so ...
R:  Oh.  So since you've started to work?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's been a lo- -- 
R:  I --
L:  -- been a long while.  I've been, um, kind a --
R:  Yeah, timing has a -- having the time has a lot to do with it I think.  And also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] when you start working you start moving around a little bit too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is the [several inaudible words].  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  That's -- that's true.  Well, [LAUGH] --
R:  So ...
L:  This is a kind of open ended topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, which is kind of weird but it's okay.  Um ...  This is your first time getting a call or ...?
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Hello?
R:  Actually I -- I signed up for this a couple of days ago and they've been calling me, um, every night, I guess, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I haven't been [MN].
L:  That's kind of -- that's kind of crazy.
R:  I've been getting calls at some awkward times, so ...  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's cool.  Um ...
R:  So what kind of things do you do with your friends?  Just -- just stay on the topic.  I'm not sure what we're [LAUGH] supposed to do.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, I don't know.  I just go out and, um ... hang out with them at, like, restaurants or, like, cafes, coffee shops, you know, stuff like that.
R:  Right, in the evening?
L:  It's just -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's really not much to do if, like, if -- if you don't want to, like, to waste too much money and stuff.  So, I just don't -- I just try to keep within my budget.  Just go to the coffee shops, hang out with my friends.
R:  Oh, I see.  Uh, where are -- where are you located by the way?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Uh, where are you located?
L:  Uh, Southern California.
R:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Yeah, I'm in California too.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Uh, I'm over at 'Frisco.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So where, um, so you live in San Francisco.  And what kind of stuff do you do then?
R:  What kind of, um, sorry?
L:  What kind of things do you do with your friends then?
R:  Uh, well, I mean, pretty much the standard.  It's the typical Friends like TV episode type thing.  You go out, hang out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There are coffee shops over the east side and, you know, go --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out to movies now and then.  Uh, um.  I -- I actually have a lot of activity based friends.  I -- I think that -- 
L:  Activity based friends?
R:  'Cause I moved out from the east coast.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I had to, kind of, start new.  I -- I knew a couple of people in San Francisco already, but since then I've been trying to build a circle of friends.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Uh, I do a lot of outdoors activities.  Uh, that we go, um, like Friday night and come back on Sunday night.  Go camping, hiking, that sort of thing[?].  [MN]
L:  Oh, wow.  That's pretty interesting.  
R:  [MN]
L:  That's pretty cool.  I really haven't changed my group of friends since, like, I was in high school, so there's not really that -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like it has -- I have had no change in my life for [LAUGH] a long time really, so it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kind of actually -- it's actually kind of, like, second nature to just have my group of friends and we're kind of like family now, so...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's a little --
R:  Those you should hold on to.
L:  Huh?  Yeah.
R:  Those you should hold on to.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In[?] a lot of Californians I think, [MN] I mean, a lot of people are stationary.  I mean, everyone loves California and nobody leaves.
L:  Yeah.  I don't want to leave.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, you have your friends since your -- you're all set to go, um.  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  You know, uh, so okay, what's special about [LAUGH] friends?
R:  So, okay, let's see.  [LIPSMACK]  Uh.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I, um, meeting and everybody, um, you know, uh, [LAUGH].  So do you still go to college and, like, is, uh, did you meet most of your friends in college or anything or ...?
R:  Um --
L:  Where do you meet your -- most of friends at?
R:  I --I -- I am still in school.  But I -- well I guess I -- I do make some friends. 
L:  Oh, which high school?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Uh, like, which s- -- like what grade level -- like what school level are you in right now?
R:  I'm in grad school.
L:  Oh, grad school?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.
R:  But actually how did you get, um, this -- this, uh, list?
L:  How did I get on this list?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I was in a forum and then someone told -- like someone just like po- po- posted a message about this and --
R:  Oh, I [inaudible].
L:  It was just kind of -- it was kind of different, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so I was just like going to try it out and see if like what -- like what this really is about.  I mean, like, if this is from a University of Pennsylvania, so I don't think it's a ... it  -- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would've -- it -- it would actually just be pretty much real or something, so I just wanted to try it out.
R:  Yeah.  That's nice.  Um, yeah.  So ...
L:  So you're going to grad school?
R:  Yeah, I haven't had -- yeah, I -- I do -- I did make a few friends, um, but, uh, it gets harder as you get older.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, your base of friends.  What you started with when you're younger.  It's -- it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- easier to make friends when you're younger I think.
L:  Yeah, it is actu- --
R:  Once you grow up and you get kind of, you know, you get your niche.  You carve your niche and you have things you like and things you dislike.  It's m- a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- lot more open ended.  So people you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- meet are, yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I kind of notice that.  Like when you're in [MN], like, when we're in college and like and you -- as you grow older or something people tend to t- like keep to themse- -- [MN] their own, like, previous --
R:  Circle of friends, yeah.
L:  friends than to ...  Yeah.
R:  It -- I think --
L:  Real hard.
R:  -- there is such a thing as overloading.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Having too many friends.  I think there is such a thing as overloading, where you're just so, um, caught up in, you know, just doing -- you just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- don't have enough time.  You just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can't extend [LAUGH] beyond what you have.
L:  Yeah, and then you start -- and then you start slowing down and then you start, like, I don't know -- it's -- it's -- it's actually kind of weird but, you know.  Actu- actually I don't think I have [MN] that many friends but [LAUGH] it's -- it's pretty -- it's still overloading, especially 'cause like -- because of work now it's a little hard to, um, keep tr- -- like, keep in touch with a lot of my old -- old friends too.
R:  Oh.  Have they --
L:  Sometimes I should --
R:  -- moved away or just time wise?
L:  Time wise 'cause, yeah, it's -- it's 'cause as like, we grow older or something we -- we just, like, have to divert our attention from schoolwork to work and then, like, because of work it's a lot like, less time with -- like, less social time.  It's more just time making money or something, so it's a little diff- -- it's, uh, very different actually.
R:  Yeah, and i- it's not just the -- the eight hours a day that work takes but you come home in the evening and a lot of times --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I just end up sitting home.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just too exhausted to m- do much.  So the entire --
L:  Yeah.  Actually -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, I feel that way.
R:  What were you going to say?  Yeah.
L:  Oh, no.  That's about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, so what else is there to talk about friends?  [MN]
R:  Um, let's see.  I don't know!  I just [several inaudible words].  Um, so where -- so do you hope to make more friends at this point?  Or do you have to find more time --
L:  Uh.  I don't know.
R:  -- to make friends.
L:  I think I'm pretty happy with, like, the group of friends that I have, you know.  I mean, like, um, it's not like I'm really extremely bored every day or, like, a loner or anything.  I mean I live with a couple of my friends so, you know, that's not really that too bad.  
R:  Oh, house mates.  That's a lot of [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  So it's not too -- it's not that ba- -- like, bad, right.  I mean, like, I feel pretty happy with my -- the amount of friends I have or something, so ...
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  May- maybe later on or some -- like, maybe later on, like, to get a change or something.  But not really like, uh, top priority for me.
R:  Yeah, you're happy --
L:  What about you?
R:  -- in your paddock[?].
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Uh, I'm pretty happy too.  I mean, a- as I said, I moved out here not too long ago, so I've kind of been, uh, building, um, you know, building my own --
L:  Oh, yeah, huh.
R:  -- circle and I -- I'm -- you meet [MN]  Um, yeah, I'm beginning to feel pretty happy with that.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's cool.
R:  I have people that I do s- you know, specific things with.  So, [LAUGH] people --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I go out to hike with.  People I go out to just sit in the coffee shops and, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think I've actually --
L:  That's like a routine?
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Kinda.
R:  -- actually, b- it would be quite -- it would be nicer -- I -- I kind of miss my older, like, high school friends too.  
L:  Do you still keep in touch with them?
R:  'Cause those people -- uh, I do.  But, um, you know, they c- come out to see me once in a while but it's -- it's not the same.  Once you move away I think you kind of, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Like [MN] 'cause, I mean --
R:  Even if you try to keep in touch through email and such --
L:  It's just not, yeah.
R:  -- it's just not the same.  So ...
L:  Yeah, especially 'cause if you used to spend, you know, like all your days with them and then, like, suddenly you move away and then you do -- you only see them like five times a year.  It's a little dif- [LAUGH]  It's just, um, it's so much harder --
R:  Yeah, and -- and there's just --
L:  -- to talk to them.
R:  -- so much you can catch up with over the phone and email.  So ...  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- you -- you do end up kind of moving on and building your own, you know -- building a new circle, uh ...
L:  Yeah, it just --
R:  But I do kind of miss just calling one person or, you know, calling -- having, uh, one s- specific set of people that I just call and, you know, that person will call somebody else and just -- we'll just go out to do all sorts
