L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Sherry.
L:  Hi, I'm Jenny
R:  Yeah.  Well, um ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I live in a cold climate here so ...
L:  Uh, us too, we're in Illinois.
R:  Yeah, and I'm in a area of Pennsylvania, so ...
L:  There you go.  [LAUGH]
R:  We have -- so, uh, every winter, there, I go through the winter allergy and then, usually the upper +respiratory thing and ...
L:  Yes.  Yes.  I have three kids in school so we go through the strep throat and the colds and the stomach flus.  We've had, like, three stomach flus already since school started in late August.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my word.  Yeah, I've been lucky this year.  Um, I got the flu shot and I haven't got the flu, but I'm just going through, uh, almost a, uh, sinus infection type thing for about the last year and ...
L:  Gotcha.  Yep.  Those are absolutely horrible.
R:  And it's like, you know, I've, you know, go to the doctor but just like they says it's like, you know, I gets -- even if we get a little bit of an antibiotic it just might clear up for a week or two and it's really back --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I don't gain too much.
L:  Yeah, because if you don't clear out your nose then it's just gonna keep happening no matter how many antibiotics you have.  'Cause it'll keep stuffing up and getting clogged, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- where they say you almost have to be on something a good month, or more, it might take to really push it out and then ...
L:  Yeah.  I've, um, a girlfriend's husband had a very, very terrible sinus infection and was on antibiotics for about six weeks before he was finally able to go out, and right when he was done [NOISE] he got another sinus infection.
R:  Oh, my word, yeah.
L:  But he didn't have it for two months while he was on the antibiotics.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and you just can't, you know, stay on something like that.
L:  No.
R:  So, basically, I just try to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I go, uh, you know, try to [SIGH] get out in the weather, my husband and I.  You know, we'll go out maybe ski once a week and -- but I have to -- I get those little foamy earplugs in the one ear --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that always seems [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, um, [LAUGH]  I remember my little earplug and, of course, m- in our g- um, before I never used to wear hats.  I, you know, um --
L:  You do --
R:  -- he said one time to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that helps prevent ... To --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to put a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hat on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I'm always dragging, you know, a hat along where I'm at.
L:  Exactly.  I always wear a hat now.  [NOISE] I -- I never used to when I was younger at all.  And that's very true because it does help.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, and like I say I -- anymore of a [SIGH] I mean used to -- anymore like any of the o- over the counter and the medicines and things.  They just, I don't know, they seem to bother me more than if I don't, I don't know.  Like, I'll -- I'll get something to dry it up and then that gets you a headache and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get something the other way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I've kind of -- I just don't really ...
L:  There's really -- yeah, there's nothing --
R:  -- use anything like that anymore.  Like, I'll heat something, them things in the microwave that are like a heat, oh, like it has little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pellets in it or oatmeal and kind of --
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, like, lean on that or ...
L:  Yeah, that -- those are -- I -- I'm actually [NOISE] on an allergy medication for nasal allergies, I have them all year round --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- depending.  It's just called Vitaray[?].  It helps but there are still a few times when I'm really sick --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it doesn't work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well about once a year I do get a allergy shot.  Like, usually around May.
L:  Yes.
R:  And that kind of gets me through to about September.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And then in between, I don't know if you've ever heard it, like, Nasal Calm.
L:  Yes.  But ...
R:  You spray it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in your --
L:  Mhm, the nasal spray.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and that really -- surprisingly, if I keep on that --
L:  Huh.
R:  And it's more natural.  It's not like -- it doesn't have anything, like you're taking them --
L:  Right.  It --
R:  -- things that make you a little sleepy, you know.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it doesn't exactly get rid of all it.  [NOISE]  It's still a little bit there.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Sarah's home, Dad's home, too.
R:  But like I say, you said with your children with the streps -- and I mean, as a child I -- I just continuously had that type of thing.
L:  Yeah, it's not fun.
R:  Streps and -- oh, I know what, you know, you're dealing with there.
L:  It's, uh -- my daughter is seven, almost, and I'm -- we both have type one diabetes.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, we have -- our immune system's a little bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- suppressed.  And I get -- I -- this year, thank goodness, I have not gotten strep once, not yet.  Last year I had it like, six times.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, so far so good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think that k- it's kinda like if you get something real bad for so many years in a row --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you get a little reprieve.  I think they say you build up, and then maybe a year or two -- two -- like, I -- like with my allergy that's ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know I've had years where I'd just be horrible and then all of a sudden you'll get a year, it's kind of --
L:  Not that bad.
R:  You build up a little immune and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then -- then, of course, then it [LAUGH] a year --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- later it starts all over again.
L:  I -- I -- I've been very -- I switched from -- we use paper towels everywhere when we wash our hands --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we just throw them out.  I just -- and I'm very careful about washing my hands. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's -- that's another thing.  I -- I've -- I mean, I've not that -- when I go anymore like to a public restrooms --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- I get the -- I come out, I get the paper towel first.  [LAUGH]  I turn the -- w- you know, after I wash my hands I shut --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- spickets[?] off with it [LAUGH] I open the door --
L:  With the door, yeah.
R:  -- and then I -- I reach in and give it a toss --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where hopefully it will land in a can, you know, I ...
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  That is so funny.  It -- you -- it's just disgusting.
R:  But they --
L:  I can't -- I can't even think of, you know, we always come home from the store, we wash our hands.  And it's like, you can -- it's not just -- it's not just, um, germs.  I mean, you can -- especially the grocery store.  I don't know if it's picking up all the stuff off the shelf and putting it in your cart, but your hands are dirty.
R:  Well, they say -- I mean, actually, you can get more from touching stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or shaking hands, I've heard more so, than if you actually like, sneeze on somebody, per se, you know.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Just more by shaking hands.  
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause I used to [MN] and at the church where we're going, you know, they'd have that little shake hands that they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a certain part of it and I started getting like, "Oh dear".  I was carrying this little sanitizer.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, afterwards and then my husband laughed, "Oh, they- they'll probably, you know, smell that" [LAUGH] [inaudible].  But then I read that's just kinda -- we use that stuff too much -- they say can be bad.  It makes your immune systems not like --
L:  Right, it doesn't make it -- keep it strong.  I understand.
R:  They say that children --
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  -- today are catching more things because we have, you know, the -- all the antibacterial soap.
L:  Yeah, the soap and stuff.  They don't really cause us --
R:  And the sponges and it says, really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that makes it that you don't get strong.  You're better if you --
L:  Right.  You don't build up an immunity to it.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Yep.  I've heard that too.  We -- we are -- I used to do the same, especially when they were babies.  But now that they're older we just wash our hands and try not -- you know, I have a three year old so she keeps -- she still puts her hand in her mouth and all that.  But she's -- she's getting better.  The other two, fortunately, are -- they don't touch their face.  That's my biggest -- I don't even -- don't touch your face.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  But like I say, basically, the -- getting through the cold season.  I mean, I used to have things on hand like your -- oh, your hot, cold medicine and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this thing and that.  But it's kind of -- I've -- I've [MN] -- in the last year I've kinda  --
L:  Right.
R:  -- laid off of it a little unless --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's absolutely --
L:  Yeah, necessary.
R:  -- you know, necessary or you'd get a prescription and you need it, because so much of it didn't really, I -- it just made it -- made me -- made you feel a little better.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right it didn't really --
R:  Made you sleepy and --
L:  -- [MN] yeah.  And I felt -- I always -- anything -- anything over the counter gave me -- made me either irritable or made me tired, so it wasn't worth it.  I didn't take -- I stopped taking almost -- you know, I don't take anything over the counter really.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It doesn't work.  [LAUGH]
R:  And what do you kind of then do?  Just kinda the ...
L:  The -- my prescription allergy medicine works and other than that if I'm really sick I kinda tough it out because I can't really -- since I take it on a daily basis I can't really take any other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- antihistamine.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... and it's like --
R:  And what are you taking, like, uh ...
L:  It's Clarynox[?]
R:  Claryn- -- oh, okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've heard of that.  Yeah, for -- in between, when I'd get the allergy shot and he'd say if you get a real bad day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'd have some of the old, uh, Allegra which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is a similar -- on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the same idea.  They don't make you, uh ...
L:  Yes, but see, I was on Allegra --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I suffered from one of the main side effects which was back pain.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I've never had -- I've had three kids, even huge pregnant, I never really had back problems.  And I'm just -- I kept going along and going along.  And I'm like, "Man, my back is killing me.  My back is killing me".  And then I talked to the doctor and he said, "Well, it could cause back pain" and it must've been that because I stopped taking it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and my back pain went away.  I mean --
R:  Well, that's strange.  Yeah, some of the --
L:  Right.  It's not --
R:  -- side effects.
L:  -- for everybody but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, see, I never was on it steady enough.  It was like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I would just get a day.  Maybe I'd be out in an area, like go at a fair where there'd be lots of pollen or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or like, we ride motorcycle where I'd -- where we'd be in some place where it's dust and real -- I'd get a real bad, uh, attack of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even with the allergy shot wouldn't help.  And I would just take it for that one day.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  I didn't stay on it like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as a day in and day out thing.  So I probably didn't experience that side effect.
L:  That's good.  [LAUGH]  Because it -- it -- it didn't feel nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But I, like I say, I just got the constant runny --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Runny head and ...
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Isn't that funny?  My husband also.  He's got --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's seasonal --
R:  My husband never did too much but he starting a little more like, you know, where -- sneezing and stuff but he don't really have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take anything.
L:  [NOISE] Take anything.  Mhm.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I know I get awful headaches from my allergy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the sinus pressure.  It kills me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a ra- -- a rare time I'll try, like, something that don't have a -- either just a plain old, like a Tylenol or an aspirin tablet that's coded that --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But like the stuff like, well, Sudafed, and some of that -- you know I've gotta -- the one time the doctor says I was, like, on borderline for blood pressure so don't -- so three, fou- -- three out of four of those things, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they say, like Sudafed and some of them things he named, he says just, you know, it wouldn't be, you know, good to --
L:  Because, yeah, because of your -- it might actually increase your bl- -- mhm.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Yeah, you want to be careful with that stuff.
R:  But, uh [PAUSE].  So, is
