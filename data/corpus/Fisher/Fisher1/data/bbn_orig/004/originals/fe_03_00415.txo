R:  Hi.  My name is Sheryl.
L:  Hi.  My name is Scooter.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice to meet you, Scooter.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  Where are you located?
R:  Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [MN]
L:  So this thing stretches out pretty far.  I'm in New Jersey. 
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow.
L:  I'm not -- I'm not that far from you at all.  All right, you go first.
R:  Okay.  Family means to me, ah, my husband, my eight year old son, spending time together, going on vacations together, um, just good quality time.
L:  To me, family is only good if it works.  It overrated and it's pushed on us.  Um, I've seen too many bad parents, miserable s- -- miserable siblings, cousins, extended family, and they're all forced together at the holidays [NOISE] simply because they think they need to.  When it works, it works really well.  When it doesn't work, then you, "Okay, it doesn't work" and I think you need to step away.  [PAUSE] So there!  
R:  So there.
L:  Right, now --
R:  Are we --
L:  Now -- 
R:  -- supposed to continue discussing this?
L:  Yeah.  I think -- how long are we supposed to talk for?  I think, like --
R:  I'm not -- I'm not sure.  But, you know, I agree with you though on -- on that. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If -- if it doesn't work, get out of the marriage.  I did divorce law for twelve years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's harder on the kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than -- than ad- adults seem to think it is.  Staying together for the sake of the family is -- is not --
L:  Well, not only that, but I mean, I see it wi- --for example, um, the -- the last, ah, relationship I had, her [SIGH] mother was, ah, a shrew.  And she just needed to -- to get away from her completely.  If I was king of the world -- I've told many people this -- my first, ah, two, ah, world decrees would be to banish Mother's Day and Father's Day.  Because, if you've been a good parent then you've earned their respect for the rest of your life and them coming back to see you.  And if you've been a miserable -- miserable parent then you shouldn't -- the -- the children shouldn't be guilted into, ah -- into seeing you by ads for those days by Hallmark. 
R:  Right.  It's a Hallmark ploy.
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, are -- are you a lawyer?
R:  No.  I'm a legal assistant.
L:  Oh, okay.  And are you retired now?
R:  Yeah.  I quit work about five years ago.
L:  Mm.  Stay at home mom?
R:  Yes.
L:  Good for you.
R:  Yes.
L:  Good for you.  My late wife was, um, [LIPSMACK] for a while and then we both had to work just because of the economy at the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as soon as she was able to, ah -- because my kids now are twenty one and seventeen, you know -- she passed away in ninety. 
R:  Oh.
L:  It's been thirteen years.  Um, but as soon as she could she stayed at home.
R:  Okay, yeah.  I like it.
L:  You know, rather than put the kids in day care and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You guys must be pretty cold there right now.
R:  Yeah, it's freezing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  What's your -- what temperature's outside?
R:  It's in, ah -- it's about twenty out, but we have no snow.
L:  Real- -- Well, we have sn- -- we have ice actually.
R:  Oh.  We don't even have that.  
L:  And, ah --
R:  We have nothing.
L:  We have snow covered by ice, and it's in the twenties here as well.
R:  Ha.
L:  And I don't know if you follow the news, but they just found, um, ah, concrete evidence -- a couple of places of violations by the Iraqis.
R:  Oh.  No, I haven't-- 
L:  So --
R:  -- had, ah, MSNBC on yet today.
L:  Al- -- no MSNBC.  Fox News.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  None of that MSNB commie stuff.
R:  Okay.
L:  I just watch Fox News.  But, the thing is -- is that it puts them in breach in a few places.  And I know gold shot up just a little while ago.
R:  Mm.
L:  And oil is -- is bound to go through the roof as well.
R:  Not to change the subject here, but, um, I -- I don't if we're supposed to keep talking about family, or --
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  -- if we -- if we plod along enough.  If something --
L:  Well, I -- I -- see, I don't -- that's a kind of a crazy topic because how much can you say?  Tell me about your last family reunion.
R:  Oh, I don't go to those.
L: [LAUGH] Me neither. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, family reunions, ah -- we -- on my Dad's side --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- of the family, they attempt to get some sort of reunion together every few -- few -- few years in Minnesota.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I really don't know any- anybody on my Dad's side of the family that well.  
L: [NOISE]
R:  Um, I have a famous cousin, sort of, on --
L:  Really?
R:  -- that side of the family.  Yeah.
L:  In -- in politics or entertainment?
R:  Entertainment.  He's --
L:  Tell me.
R:  He's an actor, and, ah, his name is Seann William Scott.  Ah --
L:  What's he in. Where have I seen him?
R:  Well, he -- he -- he's just getting started.  He's been in American Pie, and American Pie two, and -- and, ah, Last --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Destination, Road Trip -- in kind of the teen genre.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And he's got some new ones coming up.  One with The Rock and, ah, a new one coming out -- ah, [LIPSMACK] Bulletproof Monk.
L:  That -- actually that's on the Internet already.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um, it's -- it's -- it's, um -- there's -- there's this whole scene of, ah, pirated DVDs.  As a matter of fact, ah, the -- the -- The Gangs of New York --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- is on, ah, DVD rip, which means that it came from a DVD.  The Bond file, the new Potter film -- all that stuff's out there.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, now how well do you know him?  I mean, have you seen him at --
R:  I [SIGH] --
L:  -- weddings and stuff?
R:  I haven't seen him much since he moved to California.  Um, it's been, I'd say, four -- four years since I've seen him now.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  His grandfather and my grandmother were brother and sister.  And the last time I saw him was at his grandfather's funeral.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So -- but, we're pretty proud of him anyway.  My mom and dad are his godparents.
L:  Oh, sure.  Ah, I would be too. My -- and it's funny because my son -- my oldest son is a drama major.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, he's been working theater here.  He's been getting, um, paid work.  And a couple of years ago he did, ah, an entire summer in -- at a union theater in North Carolina.  And, ah, it was -- I mean, they've had major actors come through there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, w- -- one who lives locally -- remember The People's Court, the original one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Remember Doug Llewellyn?  
R:  Yep. [LAUGH] 
L:  His daughter --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- lives in that town, and she does shows, um, there as well.  And, ah, I'm hoping that he starts working his way, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- towards Broadway.  And my background -- when I was little I used to do commercials --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  So, yeah, it's funny that -- that -- that just even in the topics it's a small world.
R:  Right.  It certainly [LAUGH] --
L:  And what not.  All right, so tell me about the last wedding you went?  See, I don't deal with my family.
R:  Okay.  The last w- -- last family wedding?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gosh. [PAUSE]  I don't remember the last family wedding.  It would be on my mother's side.  We -- I have many cousins on that side, but we're all in our thirties and forties now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and nobody's getting married anymore.
L:  Yeah.  Y- you kind of have that lull.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Because you gotta wait for everybody to procreate --
R:  Right -- right.
L:  -- and for them to grow up --
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- and then --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- get their careers going -- or get somebody pregnant.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  and --
R:  Well, [NOISE] right now we're going through the graduation stage of all the --
L:  Now, you have the one son?
R:  I have one son, who's eight.  Yep.
L:  Okay.  And you gonna want more?
R:  No.
L:  Just the one?
R:  Just the one.  That was, ah -- that was the deal.  I'm an only child.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I don't know what I'd do with two.  I don't know how to -- to help two kids interact.
L:  They -- they just do.  I mean, it -- g- -- the distance between myse- -- I have two sisters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the distance between myself and my younger sister is ten years.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, by the time I was eight, she was actually married and out of the house.  So, for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- intents and purposes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was an only child.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  And [MN] my wife and I had talked about, um, only having one son.  But, we d- -- actually we ultimately wanted to have three.
R:  Okay.  And did you?
L:  We -- we'd come around -- no, we had two 'cause then she passed away.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, but I mean, they just -- they -- they get a- -- they interact the way they're gonna interact.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's --
R:  But, I -- I think you -- you need to -- you need [NOISE] to know [NOISE] what you can handle and what you can't handle.  And for me, one child was it.  I knew my limits.
L:  Uh-huh.    
R:  I have a good friend who has two kids, and rues the day she had the second one.  And I don't think that's healthy.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How come?
R:  Why don't I think it's --
L:  No -- no -- no.
R:  -- healthy?
L:  How come she is -- is --
R:  She only wanted one child, and her husband pushed for two.  And that [NOISE] was the most unhappy baby I've ever seen.
L:  Really?
R:  And I'm s- -- I think they -- they can feel it.  They can sense it.  Now that he's older, ah, you know, it seems to be fine.  But, at the time --
L:  [MN] Now you see, th- this kind of goes back to something you said about divorces.  I mean, the divorces are always tough on the kids.  What makes it even worse is the inability of -- of adults to accept their place as adults.
R:  Right.
L:  And, [NOISE] you know, she -- she carried this baby for nine months, and whether she really wanted to or not, you know, you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and you say, "Okay.  This is what I gotta deal with".
R:  Right.
L:  And you -- you do it with a smile on your face.
R:  Some people can, and some people can't.  This couple is divorced now.
L:  Yeah?  Maybe because fo the ed- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Does she have the kids?
R:  Ah, they actually worked out a very good arrangement.  They live within a mile of each other.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  
R:  And they do half time and half time.  And the kids seem to like it.  They can bike back and forth between the homes.
L:  Sure.  Now see, that works out the best, unless this guy or she gets a transfer or something like that.  How old are the kids?
R:  Ah, let's see.  One is -- one is thirteen, one is ten.
L:  All right.  So, they're kind of up there?
R:  Right.
L:  Then -- and -- and -- and they waited a while before they got divorced?
R:  Yeah.  I think they were married for maybe twelve -- twelve -- thirteen years before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they were divorced.  So --
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I was married almost seven, but I had known my wife since I was seventeen.
R:  Okay
L:  We were -- we were high school sweethearts.  So, I guess -- I mean, pretty much I -- I've known her half my life.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that's important.
L:  Um, but --
R:  I think you have to be a friend before you can be a lover.
L:  Yeah, [MN] sometimes.  I think it -- it -- it -- it can work in a variety of ways.  I mean, this woman that I -- I ended a relationship with -- we still consider each other soul mates.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we are -- we are very good friends.  She calls me all the time.  Um, [SIGH] but we're not getting married.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  It -- it works the way it works.  And I think it changes when you're older too.  I mean, I'm, like, forty seven.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  And --
R:  Your priorities change.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and the -- just the way you look at things.  I mean, believe me, I would be more than happy to, ah -- I'm a great fan of monogamy and -- and marri- --
