L:  Eric.
R:  Eric?  Hi, my name is Steve.
L:  How you doing, Steve?
R:  And what does family mean to you?
L:  What does family mean to me?  Uh, let's see.  Family is, uh, I think, getting together on holidays.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, having somebody to come home to everyday.  Uh, I go to college personally, so my family's not here all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, when I come home, you know, I have someone to come home to for Thanksgiving, Christmas, all the holidays.  And having someone that's there for you when you need 'em.  How about you?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, family can mean a lot of things to me.  I -- I have my family, my -- my parents, my brother and his family, and my grandfather on my mother's side and I also consider family, um, my very close friends.  I got together with a couple of friends over Thanksgiving the last couple of years, and I consider them my family as well.  Family is also chosen as well as what you're born into.  
L:  Yeah, I agree with you.  But, uh, you have to draw the line somewhere, I think, 'cause, uh, you know, my Mom always says, you know, "Oh, you c- bring a couple of friends over, if you want, for dinner".  That doesn't mean, you know, a lot of my friends, it means three or four close friends of mine.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, I think that the family does extend to some of your close friends but not to, uh, you know, the whole group of friends that you have.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how far away are -- are you from your family?
L:  I'm actually, uh, about a hour away.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, about a hour north and, uh, you know, I see them on, you know, the weekends, sometimes.  Sometimes -- always for the holidays though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh, anything important, like a special event or, uh, even for -- during the tragic nine eleven event, I came home f- with my family just to be around them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, you know, they're family and you have to be with them.
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  And also I wanted to seem too, of course.
R:  I guess I g- I live south of my parents.  They -- they used to live in my home town, two hours away, but they moved and they're now out of state and six hours away.  It's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a jaunt to get up there but I do it and I'm glad to, and I make sure that I'm with them holidays, Christmas.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Christmas for sure, and whenever I can get up there for a long weekend.
L:  If you can't get up there do you keep in touch with them by phone all the time?  Or do you call them once a week or ...?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, um, I should call them once a week and I was thinking of doing that tonight and I thought --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Oh my gosh, I -- I haven't called them to wish them Happy New Year and it's almost the end of the month and I should --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- do that".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I'm the same way.  Uh, I want to call some of my close friends right now, actually, but, uh, I don't want to tell them that, you know, I take this call for, uh, you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the [inaudible] study.  [LAUGH]  But, uh, I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I fear they can wait until t- twelve o'clock anyway, so ...
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  Wh- -- can you say where you're calling from?
L:  I'm actually calling from New Jersey.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Iowa.
L:  Iowa!
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow, I didn't know it stretched out to all the way over there.
R:  Yeah, I got this --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- call from, I would say, somebody I would consider a family member.  She told me about this and I signed up for it and thought that was -- that was really --
L:  Yeah, it sounded like a good idea, right?
R:  Yeah, it sounded like a good idea and that's what I did, and I consider her my -- my sister.
L:  Mhm.  One of those close friends, right?
R:  Right.  Exactly.  I  she told me about it and I thought that -- that is a great idea.  And I also think family can also mean some kind of lingo.  Um, if you talk to -- if you talk to one -- if -- if one gay person talks to another they can say, "Oh, mhm, he's family" so that's -- family can also be encoded, shall we say.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  And [LIPSMACK] I -- I met somebody at work and we were talking.  She was really nice and then she said -- she said, "So are you -- are you family?"  I go, "Uh-huh".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so, it can -- it can mean that too.  So ...
L:  Yeah, family also, uh, I don't know if it's what you're getting at, but, uh, like a group, you know.  Like a  -- like a family, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- Like a group of friends we call a family sometime.  [COUGH]  Not just your friends in general, but a group of friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, "They're -- oh yeah, they're my family" you now.  And then, obviously, you know, it's not your, like, your family -- your blood family but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, a family of friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I think that family definitely constitutes, you know, people that you call, uh, round the holidays or hang out with in the holidays.  People you're around all the time.  And it's -- uh, yeah, your close friends.  Like you said, I agree.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  For instance, in New Years I spent time with my friends, Joel and Kathleen.  They're a couple and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, uh, I consider them family.  I spend my extra time, my downtime, with them, going to movies, having din- dinner together a lot and -- and watching movies or talking about books.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We read a lot of books or -- I don't know if we read a lot of books as much as we buy them and talk about them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we love to read and [LIPSMACK] and I would also consider that family in the -- in the sense where we can get together and, you know, she'll make dinner for us and we're like, "Well, I want to do something".  "No, that's okay".  So, it also means something in the respect of you're doing this but, uh, but you don't -- you owe me the next time.  It isn't like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I consider that family.
L:  Just doing it out the goodness of, you know, pers- just for the person because you care for them and all of that.
R:  And I can call them and talk to them anytime about things and help me out with -- with matters.  Help -- helping me or, you know, drive me to the airport or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go to, uh, go places and -- and ...
L:  See [several inaudible words], it is interesting that I have two or three families actually, because I have my family at home, here.  You know, the family that I was -- I was born into.  Then I have my family at school.  Then I have my family of friends here at ho- at home.  I have my close friends.  And I'm [several inaudible words] really [inaudible] with all three, um, families, so it's, s- sort of, like the same, you know.  Like, I'm close to my friends at school but really I [inaudible] got my family of friends here at home.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ....
R:  I agree with you there.
L:  I -- I think -- I think you've got to have, you know, three or four families.  But [SIGH] so families not just con- you know, it's not just your one family that you're born into.  Theres, you know, friends, and you can have more than one I believe.
R:  Yes, that's -- that's very true and it's nice when they all can come together.  You can bring your friends home or have your friends come along if -- if real family is in town or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nearby.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've a really close friend and she has a little girl and I consider her my niece and I -- I -- I love her to -- I love 'em both.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can go to them anytime.  I can babysit.  I can -- I can play or do anything with -- with the two year old and I consider her family. 
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Both of them.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH]  I think that this topic is, uh, one of the toughest ones to talk about.  What do you think?  [LAUGH]  Family.
R:  Yeah, it certainly can be.  Especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you're -- when you're, I suppose, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- shall we say, forced to talk about it.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [MN]  I wasn't sure --
L:  Especially with another stranger.  It's tough to unders- you know, try to -- it doesn't -- you don't know how much you want to say, in fact, you know, in terms of getting too personal and all that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially talking about family.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause say for instance, I was talking to somebody who had no family, you know.  It wouldn't be much of a good choice of topic [LAUGH] for that.  Because ...
R:  Yeah, that can be tough.
L:  Yeah, it can be.
R:  E- especially, when I -- when I took this call I -- it was by a computer and -- and I wasn't sure if it said family or famine.  And I thought, "Famine.  Okay. --"
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh.  I don't think [LAUGH] I'm not sure if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what are you studying in school?
L:  I'm actually studying, uh, education.  French with education.  [SIGH]
R:  What type of education?
L:  Ah, French.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  The language.
R:  That's cool because I'm -- I'm out of school right now but I -- I -- I have -- I have -- I have college degrees, but I am t- I'm taking French right now.
L:  Okay.  Was that your major in college or not?
R:  Ah, no.  I'm actually, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm actually a  let's see, I was journalism, public relations and communication studies.  So I had BAs.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm taking French because I want to do graduate work in -- in vocal music and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a lot of schools are -- are saying we want two semesters of French, German and Italian, and French was the least -- I had experience with and that way [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I -- I could do that.  It was -- it was -- it fit my schedule the best so I'm taking it at a local community college and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but reacclimated myself back into the -- to college world and it's very interesting, especially when I went to two large universities and now I'm going to community college.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So that's -- that's good, um [LAUGH].  
L:  I feel that --
R:  [french word] American.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A- So, we're talking about family and that was -- that wa- that was hard, uh, topic because we
