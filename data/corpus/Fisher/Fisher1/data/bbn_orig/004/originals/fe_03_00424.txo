R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Sheena[?].
L:  I'm Que[?].
R:  Okay.  So, do you want to go ahead and say what family means to you?
L:  Um, I guess.  I mean, ah, th -- this would be my, ah, first call. But, anyways, um, I -- I suppose in a holistic sense, even if you just throw out, you know, your traditional definitions, family would just be a -- a group of people who you can immediately rely on for whatever needs.  They may be emotional, you know, physical, financial -- all that good stuff.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think of family as the people related to you, I guess.  Um, as in, like, by blood or -- yeah, by blood.  But, um, I think most people -- like, if family is an emotional term, then it's people that give support and that you can go to for advice -- whatever. [LAUGH]  How are we supposed to talk about this for ten minutes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, why -- how many people in your family?
L:  Um, just -- in -- in my immediate family -- I'm an only child.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yourself?
R:  Um, I have one older brother.  He lives in New York.  And I have, um -- my dad remarried, so I have a stepmom and I have a half brother, who is ten.  And, yeah -- they live in DC.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty.  How are you?
L:  I'm nineteen.
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Let's see.  Do you get along with your family?
L:  Um, [NOISE] fairly well.  My mother and father are divorced and remarried -- both twice.  Divorced twice, remarried once --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for my father.  But anyways, um, yeah.  My -- my mother's pretty -- pretty conservative and my father's pretty liberal.  So, it's a nice little spectrum of ideals to live under.
R:  Hm.  So, um [several inaudible words] go to them with problems or advice or whatever.
L:  So, you're from Pennsylvania?
R:  Yeah.  No -- no -- no.  I'm from Washington DC.
L:  Okay.  And you're living in Washington DC right now?
R:  No, I'm at U Penn.
L:  You're at U Penn?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, right now I'm at Georgia Tech. [NOISE] 
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Minnesota. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, that's -- I guess my family would be more like my friends than my [several inaudible words] because since my parents were divorced I barely ever really spent time with any of them.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  I mean, like, for -- for myself at least, I don't see my parents as most people traditionally would.  But, [NOISE] I -- I would say that [NOISE] personally I -- I feel that [NOISE] my family [NOISE] doesn't actually include my legal family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  My family? [NOISE]  See, I told you.  The scale didn't break. [NOISE]  I don't know.  It's just an electronic scale. They break periodically. [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] You know, that -- that brings up a good topic that people you end up living with at dorms can also become [NOISE] part of a, you know -- sort of your family as well, because you're stuck with them for eight months a year.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- you know, if [NOISE] -- if you end up living with them in subsequent years then they can, in effect, become family, especially if you guys, you know, go and rent an apartment or someplace off campus.
R:  How many years have you been with your roommates?
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm with all these people for the first time.
R:  Okay.  Are you still getting along with them?
L:  Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] my roommate and I are pretty different.  I'm like -- I -- I'm from Minnesota, and I'm [NOISE] very, very, very liberal.  And of course, he's from Georgia and he's pretty conservative, but so are -- are most of the people in my hall.  But, um, generally speaking I get along with [NOISE] the majority of the -- well, yeah, everybody in my section I get along with.  And there are of course those people that you get along with better and those that you don't.  Are you still living in on campus housing?
R:  No.  I live off campus.  I live with six other girls that [inaudible] freshman year.  One of then actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was my roommate [several inaudible words].  So, um, which is weird because when we were in the same room we really didn't get along.  But the year after, like, we were pretty much best friends, once we had our space.  And it's interesting -- it'll be interesting to see, like, if we're still close after [several inaudible words] was their[?] last year.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I guess, as in like living with your family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you need space from them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And you're not as close any more after being in close spaces.  So, they all get along, but I think that our new house is a better fit for each other 'cause we're all pretty relaxed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we have the same schedule, and we like to do the same stuff.
L:  What are you majoring in?
R:  Um, I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- business.  I'm doing management, polit- policy and real estate.  How 'bout you?
L:  I, ah -- I recently changed to a physics [NOISE] major.
R:  Ooh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, um, a- among the -- the obvious academic strenuants[?] there's, um, also the issue of whether or not I shall be employed after I graduate.  Even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even with --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a PhD.  It's not exactly like people are screaming, you know, "Come --"
R:  Well --
L:  "-- here, Mr Physics Man".
R:  Are you a junior, or a -- sophomore?
L:  Um, no, not yet.
R:  So, you're a sophomore?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, we don't have to worry about it. [LAUGH] I'm worrying right now, especially with business.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What did you change from?
L:  [NOISE] Um, engineering. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How come you switched to physics?
L:  It [MN] -- I -- I felt that it better suited, um, what my specific professional goals were.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- hated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- physics.  I took AP physics in high school, and it was the worst subject ever.  I was amazing at history, and physics I just couldn't deal with.  So, I used to want to be an engineer, but at the last second I decided to just do business 'cause I really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't know what I wanted to do.  And my brother --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to [several inaudible words] with [PAUSE]. But, when I came over here [several inaudible words] um [PAUSE] we're still not that close [several inaudible words] close as family, but [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] [several inaudible words] Hello?
L:  I didn't hear anything you said for the last thirty seconds.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Is the reception always this bad?
R:  Oh, okay.  Can you hear me now?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's a little better.  It -- it [NOISE] just starts cutting in and out periodically. [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you want to have a big family?
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  Or is it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not important?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I think, you know, [NOISE] having -- having just two kids that's -- that's more than enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, I -- I would imagine that I would prefer to [NOISE] have [NOISE] -- oh really? [NOISE] Well, thanks for your moral support, Brian. [NOISE] Yeah.  Um, I -- I would rather have a girl first and then, a couple of years later, have a boy. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  That's what I think too.  Why a girl first?
L:  Um --
