R:  Hi.  I'm Mark.
L:  Hi.  I'm Bill.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  That's good.  Um, so this is the first time you've ever done anything like this?
L:  Yes. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]  It's kind of weird.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Can you hold for just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one second?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right. [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [inaudible] gonna put those on, put 'em on. [PAUSE]
R:  Okay.  You there, Bill?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.  I'm back.  Sorry about that.
L:  It's all right.
R:  I was in the middle of a phone call. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] Okay.  The top- -- what does family mean to you?
L:  Yeah, that's it.
R:  [LAUGH] Go for it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, ah, gee, it means, ah, my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family means my --
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Yeah?
L:  Folks related to me by whatever I choose to consider that, but mostly it means blood. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's pretty much what it mean -- but, what -- what does it mean to you?  I mean, [NOISE] what is family, to you?
L:  Ah, it's people who have the first dibs on my attention.
R:  Yeah.  People that come first?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Okay.  Um, [LAUGH] God, um -- well, um, [NOISE] is there anything -- I mean, mm, what does family mean to you?  Um, is there -- does it conjure up any kind of thoughts or memories of whatever? [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, sure.  I mean, memories of growing up and kind of what -- what family meant, in terms of my parents and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their parents, to the extent I knew 'em.
R:  Mhm.  Has it changed at all since from -- from when you were little to [NOISE] now?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I'm kind of in the reverse [NOISE] situation.  I'm -- I am a parent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, so I can see that what -- trying to figure out whether -- you know, what my kids are getting from [NOISE] my attitudes versus what I got from my parents.
R:  Yeah.  You find you turn into your dad, don't you? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Awful. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, God.  Are you a single father?
L:  No.
R:  No?  How long you been married?
L:  Ah, a long time.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  You like being married?
L:  Yep.
R:  Cool.  I'm not married.  I'm single still.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  I have a girlfriend though, and [NOISE], you know, we're -- we're -- we're in the, you know, kind of beginning stages of dating and all that kind of crap, although we been -- we been talking about it.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, yeah, it does kind of change from when you're a little -- when you're little.  You think it's, you know -- you got the mom, you got the dad, and you got, you know -- you got your -- what you think -- you know, nice happy brothers and sisters and crap like that. And then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you're watching, you know, stuff like The Brady Bunch, and then the reality hits.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  You think, "Oh my God". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It isn't as easy as it looks like it is on TV.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Man, I hated The Brady Bunch.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I did.  It was such a lie. [LAUGH]  You know, it was like, "Man, that is such a lie". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean? [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, [NOISE] yeah. [LAUGH]  But, fa- -- okay, for -- to me, family -- family means, you know -- well, it [SIGH] -- you got -- you -- you -- you know, you say family, it kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gives you a sense of closeness.  And you think of people that are close and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- loving, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all that.  You know what I saying?
L:  Yeah.  I mean it can have -- there can be different definitions of it too.
R:  Th- that's true.
L:  Like, I -- there -- you know, you -- you may have a -- a crew of people at work that you relate closely to.
R:  Right -- right.  Yeah, you can have --
L:  Or a -- or another situation, so it tends to be more defined -- more as team than family, but --
R:  That's -- yeah [NOISE] -- yeah.  But, yeah, it's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a -- it's a very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  It changes.  It -- it can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a hard -- it's a hard thing to define.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know?  But, was does it -- you know, what it mean -- mean to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is just the people that are close to me.  The people, you know, I grew up with and, you know, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Wh- -- not much else to it.
L:  That's about all I can think of -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to say about it.
R:  [LAUGH] I wonder if there's a time limit or something?
L:  I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm a little lost about what we're supposed to do with this.
R:  Well, I don't know.  [NOISE] How did -- how did -- how did you get a hold of -- how'd you find out about it?
L:  Ah, I should look.  It was a news group announcement.
R:  Oh.  Are you up in Washington?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.  Where are you?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm in Columbus, Ohio.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, no, it was, ah, just a blurb in a [PAUSE] news group I was looking at.  And since it's the U Penn, and they're down the street, I thought, "Oh --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- I don't mind hoping -- helping those guys out".
R:  Yeah.  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] But, if it, ah -- I'm not [NOISE] clear exactly what it's supposed to be about. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  All I knew was they give you a topic and you talk about it.
L:  Right.
R:  Man, they could've given us --
L:  So --
R:  -- a better topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Are -- are they gonna grab pieces of this and use for, um -- as speech models, I suppose?
R:  I imagine.
L:  Huh.
R:  To see how -- [NOISE] how -- how different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different parts of the country affect a person's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- speech.  You know, like, dialect and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something -- things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that.
L:  I'm kind of lost about what they're doing with it.  It -- maybe they're transcribing -- I mean, trying to mechanically transcribe it. 
R:  Maybe.
L:  That would be interesting too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it would be.  Hm. [NOISE] But, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, ah, I'm still trying to find the original announcement to see if I can figure out how it's supposed to work. [PAUSE]  No, that's not it. [NOISE]  There it is. [PAUSE] Okay.  "Calls will be recorded.  One to three phone calls, talking for ten minutes"  Ah, that would explain it.  
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Okay.  I -- I was not keeping track of time at all.
R:  Well, hold on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I can tell.  Hold on. [PAUSE]  Okay, we got four minutes to go.
L:  Okay.
R:  All right.
L:  Well, we should say some more things about family 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- otherwise we'll be off topic.
R:  Yeah, really?  Um, [NOISE] [MN] Christ, I can't think of a thing.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, [MN] --
L:  Well, let's see.  Well, there's extended family.  Have you got cousins?
R:  Oh God, yes.
L:  Okay.  Well, that's --
R:  I got more cousins you can shake a stick at.
L:  Right.  Well, I got a few cousins myself, and my wife has a few cousins.  My kids [NOISE] don't have any cousins.  Let me think --
R:  Really?
L:  Is that right? [NOISE] 
R:  If --
L:  Yeah.  I got one sister and she doesn't have any kids, so --
R:  Okay.  That -- that --
L:  And my wife doesn't have any siblings.
R:  Really?  Oh.
L:  So, she's -- yeah, she's an only child.
R:  Wow.
L:  So.  She had cousins, but [NOISE] --
R:  Hm.  I got [LAUGH] -- I have six brothers and three sisters.
L:  Ah.
R:  I got a -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I got a bunch of -- of, ah -- of -- of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cousins and stuff like that.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most of 'em are in southern Ohio, around Portsmouth and all that. [NOISE] 
L:  Ha. [NOISE]
R:  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] it was really weird when I was little.  When I was little -- I mean, I had this one cousin in particular I just could not stand -- her name's Missy[?]. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah -- and I haven't -- I haven't -- I, you know, didn't like when I was growing up.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- later on, you know, we didn't -- we didn't keep that [MN] -- my family isn't all that close.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  We're not, you know --
L:  You don't get -- all get together every Christmas --
R:  No -- no.
L:  -- or ...?
R:  Hardly.  Um -- um, but, ah, I went to my aunt's funeral, ah, last -- I think it was last July or something like that.  And they had -- they had a big -- a big get together afterwards, and, you know, I saw Missy again.  I was, like, "Whoa man, she's different". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  She'd got really old looking. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, it's really funny.  I mean, I have a lot of family.  There's a lot of people in my family, but I hardly know any of them 'cause we aren't -- we really aren't very close.  I'm close to one brother and one sister, and that's about it --
