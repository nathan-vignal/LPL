R:  Wow!
L:  So, he --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- He gets to go for a couple of days at a time every now and then.
R:  Mhm.  I see.  There is a -- there is a Chinese saying that, uh, uh, uh, [SIGH] a little, -- how to say that, I don't know.  It's kind of a -- a little departure between the -- the -- the couple just like, uh, a n-- give you a feeling of a new marriage.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or something -- yes?Do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Like absence makes the heart grow fonder?
R:  Yeah, I think so.  The same -- kind of the same --  same meaning's is there.
L:  That's what they say.  Yeah, we've been married for ten years, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it must work.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  so you --
L:  At first I was kind of jealous because I wanted to go too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  It wasn't fair that I got to stay here where it's cold and ugly, and he got to go everywhere pretty.  
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  But now I kind of look forward to him going so I can watch the TV and pick what shows we watch.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  You g-- you got to fall in love with the life where you are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You are [several inaudible words], right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And yet you have four kids.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you -- do you think you are --  do you like -- do you like it?  Like the life with the four kids surrounding you?
L:  I love it.  It's very busy though.
R:  Oh, yes [MN].
L:  Um, they have a lot of times have their friends come over, so I've usually got a whole house full of them.
R:  Oh, I see.  So ...
L:  But --
R:  I don't know, because I never can imagine that because I plan to not have kids in the future.
L:  Not at all?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  I think that maybe I should spend more time in taking care of for my -- maybe my, kind of, my career, because I want to be a professor in the future.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that will be a lot of pressure on me.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, yes, I don't know if I really want to a -- a kid or --  and I talk with my current boyfriend and he also said, "Oh depends-, all depends" because we can't decide right now.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, families in China are small, aren't they?
R:  Yes.  Right now they are small.  Oh, usually only have a -- the one kid one per family.
L:  Gosh.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  I can't imagine that.
R:  But I'm -- I'm -- I'm lucky.  I have my sister.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And yeah, so ...  I have my other classmates who are friends, so they -- they are the only child in the family so they feel -- they told us that -- they told me that, uh, they are -- they were just so lonely in a hou- -- in -- in the family.
L:  Yeah, with no one else to talk to.
R:  Yes, and they still now want -- they still now want to talk with their fa- [inaudible] parents, that they think they are the old generation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Not as much in common.
R:  Uh-huh.  So what are here about, uh?
L:  Um, really large families aren't common.  There aren't very many people who have four children.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think most families, two is about the most.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't seem like it's real common to just have one now.
R:  Oh, I see.  So [COUGH] so -- but I heard -- I read something on the internet, it said all American family still wish they had a boy in the family, right?
L:  Right, to carry on the name.
R:  Right, oh, that's the reason?
L:  Yeah, because when -- I don't know if it's this way in China, but when the man gets married the woman takes his name. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- So then the children all have his name to carry on.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So, if you only have a girl.  She takes her new husband's name and --
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that name doesn't get carried on.
R:  Oh, I see.  Name -- I think is it's the r- kind of a same reason in China.  All the family -- although it's -- right now, it's, um, kind of, a model [inaudible].  The family still wants a -- a boy.
L:  In China?
R:  [NOISE]  Yes-ah.  [inaudible] like, uh, because, maybe, they think a boy can support a family better than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a girl.  Yes, that's the reason.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  So, I don't know.
L:  I'll see if I can switch telephones.  One of them's dying.
R:  Ok- [LAUGH].  So --
L:  So --
R:  Mhm?.
L:  So, Yes-ah, sometimes having four of them can be so busy but it's nice to have 'em there because there's always somebody doing something and always noise around the house.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, so ...
L:  But my two older ones are both boys and they like to fight a lot.
