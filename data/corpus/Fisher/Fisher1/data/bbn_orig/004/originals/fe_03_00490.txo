L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, I'm -- oh, hi.
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm Brandy.
R:  I'm Katherine.  I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Hi.  Um, yes, I think that you definitely need to keep yourself warm in this kind of cold weather.  I've been taking a lot of vitamin C. drops myself.
L:  Um.  I think, 'cause I live in the south.
R:  Okay.
L:  It doesn't get as cold here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it's easier not to get [LAUGH] sick.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But every year I get sick.  [LAUGH]  So --
R:  How cold -- how cold does it get in the wintertime?
L:  Um.  It's been cold this month, and the coldest that it's gotten, I think, was seventeen.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's not --
L:  And that was really cold.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that is cold. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is pretty[?] cold.  
L:  Um --
R:  We're -- [LAUGH] we've had some snow just a couple of days ago so, yeah, it's been pretty cold around here and all of my room mates are actually sick right now so I'm just trying to stay out of their way and get lots of rest and, um, you know.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Have juice.  Yeah.
L:  It -- usually they -- they get it anyway.  I have two kids, too.  So ...
R:  Oh, wow.  [MN]
L:  And I'm a college student.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness. That must be really tough.
L:  Yeah.  It is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- horrible.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought it would be really easy.
R:  Oh.
L:  I thought, you know it'll be so easy, but it's not.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I try to keep my health.  I -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I try to do things that I know are good for me.  Um, and I did get a flu shot this year.
R:  Yeah, I -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- got a flu shot as well.
L:  So, it seems that -- I haven't gotten really sick this year so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it [LAUGH] doesn't happen.
R:  Yeah.  So, do your kids get sick more easily in the wintertime, do you think?  Uh, do they get more easily, uh, sick more easily than adults do?
L:  No.  I -- I think they are m- -- they are more resistant than we are.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  I really do.
R:  I wouldn't have thought so.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I think what [MN] -- I think when they do get sick though it's -- it's usually in the summer.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or -- or at the very end of the summer where the seasons are changing.
R:  When [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are not ready for the cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got it.
L:  That's usually when it is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But normally they're -- usually they're in pretty good health.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would think that -- I would've thought that kids would get sick more easily and then you're going to get sick because all your kids are sick.  Maybe because I think they're going to school, they're meeting a lot of other kids who are, you know, who have a flu or have a cold as well.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- that's funny because usually my husband is the one that brings it home.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then the kids get, it and I am the last one to get it and I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- always keep it longer than anyone else.
R:  Oh, no.  Because you're taking care of everybody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
R:  I think -- yeah.  You spend your energy doing all this stuff and then you're going to get ill as well.
L:  And then no one's here to take care of me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have to go to school --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.  And see, so much responsibility. 
L:  Yeah.  It's ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You just have to balance it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You just have [inaudible] --
R:  Do you think -- do you think that going to the doctor helps when you have a cold?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think that sometimes -- sometimes now -- sometimes when, you know, you just have something that, doesn't matter what they give you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes I go and they say, Well, there's nothing we can do, you just -- just --
R:  I know.
L:  -- take this and do this".  And I think, "I came here because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- I wanted to get better". 
R:  I know.
L:  But there's really -- sometimes there's nothing they can do.  
R:  I think [MN] --
L:  But I -- but I am a doctor person.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I believe in the medical field.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  They always send me antibiotics home but I don't think it helps at all.  I mean, if I just stay in bed and rest a lot, have lots of water, I think that will help more than anything else.  And then you also have to go to the doctor, then you go outside and it's cold and you're feeling awful.  So ...
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Usually -- usually you do get better on your own.  Your body -- if you're [NOISE] normal and your healthy, your body will --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- recuperate by itself.  Normally.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know, um.  [LAUGH]  What else?  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you think a lot of other students -- like, I think for us a lot of students here will get sick all at the same time.  So, we'll be living in a dorm together and, I mean, one person will catch it and the whole entire, um, you know, floor will have it too.  Because we have communal showers, we have, um, communal living spaces.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- living rooms, so ...
L:  That makes sense.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we -- because I don't live in the dorms I --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- can't say that much.  But I do know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, um -- because I'm in my upper level classes now.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, most everyone that is in my field, we take all the same classes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we're around each other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  All day, every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we do end up passing -- I'm telling you that flu shot [LAUGH]!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I haven't gotten anything yet, but almost everyone has had it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- I -- I try to say, "God, please don't let me get it".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But everyone else has been sick this semester so far [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- but me and about three of my friends.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I think, uh, it's -- it is easy [NOISE] to pass along a lot of things.
R:  I know.  I mean, we've only started to come back to school but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- already I think people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it's the shock of coming back from holidays too.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You're all somewhere else and you're maybe coming back from a long way.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  And I -- that -- that too can affect it, I think.  When you travel or when you get -- I know it was hard to go back this semester.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And getting back in the groove.  Because of --
R:  That's right.
L:  The break was --
R:  Any stress.
L:  -- so long.  It --
R:  Any stress.
L:  Yeah.  Though, well, the break was so long. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I've been going and going and going and I'm not taking breaks and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Usually the summer break is [NOISE] -- it, I don't know, maybe the summer just seem to pass more swiftly than, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the low cold winter.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it's always nice to look forward to -- I think, in the springtime at least, things get warmer and warmer.  It's awful in the fall when you know that every day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is just going to be colder than the last.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  My children have decided --
R:  Oh, that's [inaudible].
L:  -- they don't want to leave me alone.  
R:  Oh, no.  I can hear them in the background, but [LAUGH] it's --
L:  Well, they --
R:  -- all right.
L:  Yeah, well, the kitty cat scratched him.  He --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- seems to -- he's at that age and he will -- won't stay out of her face and she ends up--
R:  Mm.
L:  -- biting him.  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Um, I have a five year old, he'll be six in March.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I have a one year old who'll be two in [LAUGH] March.  
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  So, they're little.
R:  Yes, they are --
L:  So, it's even harder.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- very little.  It's kinda -- I know, but I guess they have fun playing with e- -- playing with each other?
L:  Sometimes. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes --
R:  You [MN] --
L:  Sometimes they fight.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, some- --
R:  The gap's pretty big though.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The age gap.
L:  It's -- yeah, mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, and that's what I thought, but so many people say, "Oh no, they ..." -- I've talked to people who've had kids that are like, seventeen years apart.  I'm like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "You're crazy!"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I don't think I can handle it.  Because I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean you just have to start all over every time.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Anything that you learned before was minimal compared to what the next --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- one's going to teach you!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  You'd think that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- once you have one everything will pass through, right?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It -- it's easy.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  It's easy with the first one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because [NOISE] as far as -- you -- you don't know a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you've never had kids but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's no one there for them to argue and fight and fuss with.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You don't have to worry about sharing [LAUGH] and all of that, 'cause --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, you do.  But really at a minimum point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't have to live with other people they have to share with!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  They get all your attention too, so then they're not jealous, right?
L:  Yeah.  And I think -- speaking of that, I think last year, was it last year, if not, two thousand two.  But two thousand one, the year that I had my son, I was really -- I got sick really easy that year.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I was sick about four times.  I think it was --
R:  Is it --
L:  -- just from -- I mean, the weather has something to do with it but ...
R:  Were you just really tired from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just having given birth or ...?
L:  Yeah, your b- -- well, I think, your body just -- the baby takes so much from you --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and then your body has to, like, rebuild your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, your immunities and everything else. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because when you're pregnant they pump you so full of vitamins and --
R:  [LAUGH]  Do they?
L:  There's no way you're getting sick.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, yeah, I'm the healthiest person alive!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  So you just have to keep taking your vitamins.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Afterwards, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm really bad at that.  I never remember to take my vitamins. 
L:  Yeah, I forget to take medication.  I don't wa- -- [LAUGH]  It --
R:  I know.  Yeah.  I don't enjoy it.  I think that you should be able to get all your nutrients from your regular food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know.
L:  But ...  [LAUGH]  But ...  [LAUGH]
R:  But, so ...
L:  We have -- we have that fast food diet.
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  Society.  We do.  And --
R:  It's convenient.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it is.  And sometimes it's -- it's just -- it is.  It is easier to -- you don't have time. You have other things that you have to do and you're hungry.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  So, you eat.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What is available.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  And it's cheap, you know.  It makes it very easy for everyone to get into it.
L:  Yeah.  And I imagine s- especially for you.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you're a college student.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You're away from home.  
R:  And you don't want to be cooking yourself and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  I can imagine.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, no, I mean, with your kids, I'm sure you have to cook a bit more and it's even more time consuming for you, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes -- sometimes I -- I don't cook very often. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I -- I probably should cook more.  I -- I probably cook twice a week.  Maybe --
R:  Okay.
L:  Sometimes -- sometimes I cook every day of the week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- we live, um -- I live about thirty miles from college.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I have to drive out of town.
R:  Oh.
L:  And as soon as I --
R:  That's tough.
L:  -- get -- as soon -- yeah.  As soon as I g- -- as soon as I get out of class I have to drive straight home so that I --
R:  Yeah.
