L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Um, well, my name is Buddha.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  My name is Buddha.
R:  Buddha?
L:  Yes.
R:  My name's Michael.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Michael.  I'm good thank you.  Ah, well, it's basically my first conversation on the phone, like, ah --
R:  Likewise.
L:  -- regarding this one.  Is this the same for you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] [COUGH]  Well, I guess we are supposed to talk about education.  But, are you from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Philly[?], or somewhere else?
R:  No.  I'm in south Florida.
L:  South Florida?  Oh, this is pretty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- good.  Oh, I -- I'm in Pennsylvania -- central Pennsylvania.
R:  And how's the weather today?
L:  Oh God, it's freezing outside.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's unbelievable.
R:  Yeah?  Sorry to hear that.  I won't tell you what it was like here today.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how 'bout computers in education?
L:  Computers in education, um -- well, in fact, I'm teaching, ah, in a university.  Um, I'm at -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm teaching an undergrad class and I'm using computer widely [NOISE] in my teaching.  Um, but, like, it's not like distance education -- that everything is on the computer. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm using it as a supplement to the main teaching.  So, um --
R:  And -- and in -- in what are you using it?  Ah, is it for assignments, or communications with the students, or, ah, doing research, or ...?
L:  It's not doing research.  It's basically communicating with the students, um.
R:  Mhm,
L:  So, now[?] I'm posting everything on the Net.  We have a website, ah, related to the -- to the course that I'm teaching.  And we have all the activities, assignments, guidelines for the projects, or, um, even the schedule, the syllabus, and of course the email list.  They're all on the Net, um.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And students are supposed to, um, check their mails and, um, look into this website, like, at least two times a week and get all the information.  And basically I'm using, um, computers and technology -- like, ah, in terms of the computers, like kind of a tool, ah, in order to communicate with the students more, um, efficiently -- like, more effectively.  Um --
R:  But -- b- but not so much, like, in the classroom, right?
L:  In the classroom?  No, not really.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, w- we have, like, several computers labs and students are doing some kind of simulations by using some of the softwares.  But, um, basically they're kind of like -- they're supplementing.  They're not, like, really supplementing the class, but are kind of helping us to understand the concepts better.
R:  Right -- right.  So -- but, it sounds like primarily it's a communication tool.  Just make it easier so that all the information that teachers have always had, which is like you said, the syllabus and the assignments and whatnot, are available at any time.
L:  Yes, exactly.  And even the grading -- um, they post their assignments on the Net and I just grade, um, while I'm sitting in my office, and just, um, grade them on the Net.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they will get the -- they will learn the true Internet too.  So, it's basically for, ah, communicating, yes.  I mean, we are not, like, creating artificial realities on the Net --
R:  Right.     
L:  -- and living there, to be honest. [LAUGH] [COUGH] 
R:  And -- I'm sorry, you said that was undergrad college?
L:  It's, um, undergr- -- no, it's in a university level.
R:  Right.
L:  It's an undergrad class.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I'm a graduate student.
R:  Right.
L:  So, basically, I mean -- I -- I -- I like computers as a tool of communication, um, but I am skeptical in the sense that it's always good for us to, ah, create some realities through the computers.  
R:  Right.
L:  Like, I have some doubts about that --
R:  It's interesting.  I, ah -- I read something the other day that said, ah, somebody had done a study of, um, you know, bringing computers into the -- primarily I guess, elementary, up through high school level, ah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- bringing them into the classroom and making available -- and didn't seem to have made a difference.  Ah, and the conclusion they drew was that was because, um, m- they -- the teachers, you know, the th- -- who really haven't grown up with it --
L:  Yes.
R:  And the kids are more used to the technology and using the tool.  And the teachers haven't really been able to find a way to make it part of the day -- you know, part of the education.  Um, it's --
L:  Hm. 
R:  It's -- an auxiliary right now, you know?  It's, ah -- like -- like you guys do -- it's a -- you know, you do a lab or something.  It's not part of the education per se.  [LIPSMACK] And, ah, I have a daughter who's just in high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, I remember in -- even when she was in elementary school and middle school, they always had computer labs, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but, you know, they either -- they got an hour, or a period a day or every couple of days, or, um, you know, they had exercises to do on the computers.  You know?  It wasn't, ah -- it's not integrated into the -- the fabric of the curriculum.
L:  Mhm -- mhm -- mhm.  I see.  So, um, do you think she's enjoying, um, learning something on the computer?
R:  She's, ah -- she's quite adept with it, yeah.  Ah, she does a lot of, you know, homework research, ah, she knows -- much like you guys have, there's her -- some of her teachers post their stuff on the web.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there's sites that the high schools can use and they -- she gets homework help on the web, and she can find her assignments, and she co- -- certainly communicates with her classmates, and email, and instant messaging, and --
L:  Mhm -- mhm. 
R:  You know, paper research, and all kind of things.  Yeah, she's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- quite good at it.
L:  So, um, well this is pretty neat though, but maybe I can ask you a question?  Like, do you think computers, um, are in general tools that we should always, um, considering using in any kind of human activity?
R:  Well, I won't --
L:  Like --
R:  -- say any kind.  
L:  In terms of --
R:  You know, there's --
L:  Like, for instance, teaching.  Yeah, let's just talk about teaching.  Maybe it's better.  Um, like I -- I -- to be honest I can't a find a difference -- in terms of, um, um, paper and pen, like pencil and paper, and the computer and keyboard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I -- I think it's the same tool.  I mean, if it's -- they are dissimilar tools, but just one of them is technologically advanced when compared to other.  But, um, I mean it's just a tool, I guess.  Like, the computers -- they're not, like, going to open up a new perspective and a better understanding of world or something.  Because, like -- [MN] paper and pen -- pencil and paper, we know, ah -- at least we use them in order to save our ideas, +thoughts by writing down the text.  And, um, maybe like, um, while reading some other's papers we -- we, ah -- we somehow communicate with them through the paper.  And I think computers are the same, ah, in some manner.  But, on the other hand, um -- so, basically, like, I'm not expecting too much things from the computers.
R:  Well, like you said, they're strictly a tool.  And, um, I'm in computers.  I find it interesting in that for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the last, ah, you know, twenty years or so a lot of the -- a lot of people's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- time and exposure with the computer has been a fascination with the tool.  You know, it's like people who buy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cars, not because they like to drive or to get from point A --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to B --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but because they like to tinker with them.  You now, they like to paint 'em, and wax 'em, and -- you know what I mean?  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- same thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with computers.  We're still at a stage, I think, in, um, software development where for a lot of people it's the -- the tool is more interesting than what you can do with it.  And I [NOISE] -- I think once the computer itself sort of fades into the background and we -- we're able to [LIPSMACK] take the communications and the computing power, you know --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- literally for granted.  And -- and at every turn -- and have it, you know, at our fingertips without having to think about, "Okay, what program am I running and how do I do this?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, where they really become ubiquitous.  And everybody's got all the bandwidth you need and -- and, ah, you know, anywhere you're at you can communicate or -- or get access to computing power.  Then I think a lot of things will open up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Because if --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I do agree, yeah.
R:  You know, look at -- look at pen and paper now.  They -- to carry on with what you were saying.  I'm sure that when -- you know, when only rich people had paper, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was expensive to make.
L:  [several inaudible words -- not English]
R:  You know, it was a fascinating thing.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  Um, but look at it now.  I mean, you know, how many sheets of paper do you throw away a day?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know?
L:  I don't know.  I don't count. [LAUGH]
R:  And so, [NOISE] you know when -- when computers get [NOISE] to that point, um, [NOISE] when you don't think about, "Oh, I'm using the computer" or [NOISE] "I have to go use the computer [NOISE] to do this" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, then I think things will -- they'll integrate [NOISE] and we'll be able to make a lot [NOISE] better use of 'em.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.  That's probably --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  Shh. [NOISE] 
L:  So, what about -- what about this idea?  Do you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think, ah, computers are, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of promoting, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the kind of -- the inequality within society?  Like, for --
R:  Well --
L:  -- instance, some people --
R:  You mean like the --
L:  -- have a --
R:  -- computer haves and the computer have nots?
L:  Yes -- yes.  The --
R:  Um --
L:  -- people who -- who have access to computer and the ones who doesn't -- who don't.
R:  Certainly it been true, you know --
