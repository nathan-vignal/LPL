AH WHY SPECIFICALLY BAD  (fe_03_00404-B-0007)
UM  (fe_03_00404-B-0008)
I GUESS IF THEY ARE USED AS JUST A DISTRACTION I WOULD SAY YEAH THEY THEY ARE A PROBLEM FOR EDUCATION BUT AH THERE IS ONE ISSUE IN THAT I THINK THEY  (fe_03_00404-B-0009)
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY READING MORE BOOKS THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I NOTICE  (fe_03_00404-B-0010)
UM YEAH I MEAN BUT DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF INFORMATION YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THERE ARE SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT AH ARE MORE OR LESS OFFICIAL ON ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_00404-B-0011)
SO YOU DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE PERSON PREFER LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ON UM MEDICINE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE NUMBER OF SITES THAT ARE  (fe_03_00404-B-0012)
UM MAINTAINED BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SO YOU GO LOOK FOR INFORMATION THERE I  (fe_03_00404-B-0013)
I THINK IT'S THE SAME WITH BOOKS I MEAN YOU GO TO THE LIBRARY DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOU MIGHT NOT  (fe_03_00404-B-0014)
FIND A SOURCE THAT WOULD BE AH BELIEVABLE IN MANY RESPECTS UM I GUESS THAT THAT RISK ALSO EXISTS IN WITH THIS  (fe_03_00404-B-0015)
AH THE POINT IS THAT ON THE INTERNET YOU HAVE WAY MORE INFORMATION THAN WE CAN HANDLING A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT AH IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A SPECIFIC SOURCE SO THAT THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S COMPLICATES  (fe_03_00404-B-0016)
UM I YEAH I DON'T REALLY KNOW I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES WHERE IT SHOULD THAT PEOPLE MIGHT MENTION I I I THINK  (fe_03_00404-B-0017)
EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LIKE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE A SPELL CHECKER AH ON A COMPUTER I THINK THEY THEY SHOW THE SAME KIND OF PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO SPELL- ESPECIALLY IN ENGLISH  (fe_03_00404-B-0018)
IN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH VOWELS FOR EXAMPLE AND THE WAY THEY ARE SPELT I I GUESS  (fe_03_00404-B-0019)
I I I I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING AUTOMATIC BECAUSE IT'S ACTU- IN THE END IT'S ACTUALLY BORING TO CHECK FOR SPELLING ON THE TEXT OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS  (fe_03_00404-B-0020)
UM AND I GUESS SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T DON'T CARE ABOUT SUCH ISSUES I MEAN IF THEY KNOW IT THEY THEY DO BUT IF THEY DON'T THEY JUST DON'T DON'T PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS  (fe_03_00404-B-0021)
UM YEAH I I GUESS I MEAN LIKE THERE'S PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH PUBLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE MANY TIMES PEOPLE WHO WRITE PAPERS FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_00404-B-0023)
THEY JUST  (fe_03_00404-B-0024)
DON'T EVEN CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS 'CAUSE THEY SAY OH THERE IS GOING TO BE SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA BE THE AH GONNA BE THE COPY EDITING AND THEY'RE GONNA FIND AH PROBLEMS LIKE THIS SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT AND THEY ACTUALLY CATCH A LOT OF THESE THINGS IN THE END  (fe_03_00404-B-0026)
OH WELL I MEAN BASICALLY I I I PEOPLE DON'T ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE COLLEGE EDUCATION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO D- DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE COMPUTER NOWADAYS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MANY OF THE THINGS HAVE BEEN OVER THE THE INTERNET  (fe_03_00404-B-0027)
SO YOU EXCHANGE A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH STUDENTS AND MATERIALS AND IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO RELY ON THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_00404-B-0028)
UM AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE MOVING MORE AND MORE IN THIS DIRECTION SO FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_00404-B-0029)
MANY CLASSES ARE TAUGHT NOWADAYS WITH AH ALL THE MATERIAL BEING MADE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_00404-B-0030)
AH SO IT'S NOT USUALLY THE CASE THAT WE'D BRING PRINTOUTS TO CLASSES ANYMORE BECAUSE MANY THINGS ARE JUST MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS AND THEY JUST GO AND CHECK  (fe_03_00404-B-0031)
SO THEY DON'T FOR EXAMPLE HOMEWORK MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF HAVING ASSIGNMENTS MADE AVAILABLE ON THE WEB THEY DON'T GRADE THEM  (fe_03_00404-B-0032)
THE STUDENTS JUST HAVE TO DO THEM AND THEN THEY GO AND CHECK THE THE THE ANSWERS FOR THE ASSIGNMENTS IF THE IF IT IS JUST HOMEWORK  (fe_03_00404-B-0033)
AH BUT I MEAN IT'S JUST GONNA BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY UM JUST ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE  (fe_03_00404-B-0034)
AH CHECKING ON WHAT STUDENTS ARE DOING ALL THE TIME THE PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE THEM MORE RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT WELL THEY WANT TO LEARN AND IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT IT'S IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO BE CHECKING ON WHETHER THEY ARE DOING THEIR WORK OR NOT  (fe_03_00404-B-0035)
WELL I MEAN THERE ARE GOING TO BE THERE ARE THERE ARE AH THRESHOLDS RIGHT THEY HAVE TO TO PASS CERTAIN AH AH THEY HAVE TO SATISFY CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS SO  (fe_03_00404-B-0037)
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO BE GRADED ON THEIR ASSIGNMENT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE GRADED AT ALL SO IN THE END THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN EXAM THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE FINAL PAPER  (fe_03_00404-B-0038)
AH THINGS THAT I MEAN AT SOME POINT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE A WHOLE SEMESTER COURSE  (fe_03_00404-B-0039)
THEY ARE GOING TO BE TESTED ON HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEARNED AND AH THAT'S WHEN WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS OR NOT  (fe_03_00404-B-0040)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_00404-B-0042)
YES  (fe_03_00404-B-0043)
UM I MEAN BUT NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE THE COMPUTERS THAT'S JUST USING THE COMPUTERS IN GENERAL I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS NOWADAYS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN DO WITHOUT THE COMPUTER IN TERMS OF LIKE EDUCATION THEY ARE NOT USED JUST AS SUPPORT  (fe_03_00404-B-0044)
THEY ARE ACTUALLY AH THE MAIN TOOL TO TO DO A LOT OF THINGS IN MANY IN MANY FIELDS SO PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK  (fe_03_00404-B-0045)
EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT THE COMPUTER AT ALL I MEAN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LIKE ARE WRITERS OR LIKE PHILOSOPHERS AH HISTORIANS PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RELY  (fe_03_00404-B-0046)
ON PRINT MATERIAL A LOT  (fe_03_00404-B-0047)
IT MAY NOT BE SUCH AN ISSUE BECAUSE IN THE END THEY'RE GONNA USE COMPUTERS FOR MAYBE AH WORD PROCESSING IN MANY RESPECTS BUT IN OTHER FIELDS IN WHICH WE SHOULD NEED TO DO EXPERIMENTAL WORK  (fe_03_00404-B-0048)
LIKE LAB WORK IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO DO MUCH WITHOUT THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_00404-B-0049)
YEAH BUT I MEAN ACTU- ACTUALLY THE DATA COLLECTION ITSELF AH IS MANY THINGS ARE NOW MADE THROUGH COMPUTERS SO IT'S NOT  (fe_03_00404-B-0050)
