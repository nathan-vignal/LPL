I DON'T USUALLY GET A COLD I GET LIKE PSORIASIS  (fe_03_00493-A-0037)
BECAUSE OF THE STRESS I DO  (fe_03_00493-A-0038)

AND I I REALLY DON'T KNOW UM HOW THE CHANGE OF SEASONS REALLY AFFECTS  (fe_03_00493-B-0036)
COLDS IN GENERAL I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH  (fe_03_00493-B-0037)
THAT COULD BE UH  (fe_03_00493-B-0038)
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM DOWN HERE  (fe_03_00493-B-0039)

WHY I'VE GOTTEN COLDS SO MUCH THIS PAST YEAR BECAUSE I'VE I REALLY NEVER GET SICK AND I'VE BEEN SHOCKED WHEN I GET COLDS AND I'VE HAD TWO REALLY BAD COLDS IN THIS PAST YEAR  (fe_03_00493-B-0044)
YEAH I I HAVE I  (fe_03_00493-B-0045)
I'M THE ULTIMATE  (fe_03_00493-B-0046)
BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS PERSON  (fe_03_00493-B-0047)

UH NOW IT'S INTERESTING YOU SAID THE PSORIASIS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND MY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BOTH HAVE HAD PSORIASIS FOR YEARS UM  (fe_03_00493-B-0053)
SINCE WE'VE MOVED TO FLORIDA FIVE YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THEM HAS HAD A REAL FLARE UP EXCEPT FOR MY DAUGHTER ONCE DURING FINAL EXAMS IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_00493-B-0054)
YEAH IT IT DEFINITELY WAS WITH HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO EMBARRASSED BECAUSE HER SHE GOT IT ALL IN HER SCALP AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD THIS MAJOR MAJOR DANDRUFF WHERE SHE USUALLY GETS IT IN HER UM JUST ABOVE HER NOSE AND IN IN THE CENTER OF HER FOREHEAD WHEN SHE GETS IT  (fe_03_00493-B-0055)

PLACES WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE A [MN] A NICE AN AREA TO WALK AROUND I USED TO GO TO THE GYM  (fe_03_00493-B-0060)
BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL PIECES OF GYM EQUIPMENT IN THE HOUSE AND WITH THE POOL I REALLY CAN GET A GOOD AEROBIC WORKOUT WITHOUT HAVING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE  (fe_03_00493-B-0061)
SO THAT'S  (fe_03_00493-B-0062)
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET OVERHEATED AND YOUR BODY HAS SWEATS ON IT UM EVEN IF IT'S COLD OUTSIDE SOMETIMES YOU GET THAT OVERHEATED FEELING  (fe_03_00493-B-0063)
I ALWAYS SNE- START TO SNEEZE I WON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A COLD BUT IT'LL START A SNEEZE REFLEX AND I'LL SNEEZE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND I KNOW I HAVE TO TAKE MY JACKET OFF OR SOMETHING TO COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I'M FINE  (fe_03_00493-B-0064)
