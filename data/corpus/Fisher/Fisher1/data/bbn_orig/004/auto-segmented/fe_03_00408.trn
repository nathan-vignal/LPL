AH BRINGING THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM AND MAKING AVAILABLE AND DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_00408-B-0030)
AH AND THE CONCLUSION THEY DREW WAS THAT WAS BECAUSE UM M- THEY THE TEACHERS YOU KNOW THE TH- WHO REALLY HAVEN'T GROWN UP WITH IT AND THE KIDS ARE MORE USED TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND USING THE TOOL  (fe_03_00408-B-0031)
AND THE TEACHERS HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT PART OF THE DAY YOU KNOW PART OF THE EDUCATION UM IT'S  (fe_03_00408-B-0032)
IT'S AN AUXILIARY RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S AH LIKE LIKE YOU GUYS DO IT'S A YOU KNOW YOU DO A LAB OR SOMETHING IT'S NOT PART OF THE EDUCATION PER SE  (fe_03_00408-B-0033)

A LOT OF THE  (fe_03_00408-B-0044)
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S TIME AND EXPOSURE WITH THE COMPUTER HAS BEEN A FASCINATION WITH THE TOOL  (fe_03_00408-B-0045)
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE PEOPLE WHO BUY CARS NOT BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO DRIVE OR TO GET FROM POINT A TO B.  (fe_03_00408-B-0046)

[LIPSMACK] TAKE THE COMMUNICATIONS AND THE COMPUTING POWER  (fe_03_00408-B-0049)
