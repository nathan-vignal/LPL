GIVE IRAQ EVERY CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING  (fe_03_00106-A-0006)
AND HOPEFULLY AVERT WAR  (fe_03_00106-A-0007)
[MN] I'M  (fe_03_00106-A-0009)
WONDERING IF AH  (fe_03_00106-A-0010)
THE INSPECTORS WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND  (fe_03_00106-A-0011)
WEAPONS  (fe_03_00106-A-0012)
OF MASS DESTRUCTION FOR FEAR THAT THEY'VE BEEN HIDDEN TOO WELL [NOISE]  (fe_03_00106-A-0013)
AND THEY WON'T BE FINDABLE [MN]  (fe_03_00106-A-0014)
BUT STILL I THINK THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE  (fe_03_00106-A-0015)
IS AH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS INTELLIGENCE THAT CAN'T BE MADE PUBLIC THAT  (fe_03_00106-A-0017)
IRAQ IS CLOSER TO  (fe_03_00106-A-0019)
DOING SOMETHING RECKLESS  (fe_03_00106-A-0020)
THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC KNOWS ABOUT  (fe_03_00106-A-0021)
UM  (fe_03_00106-A-0022)
I AGREE THAT THE WAR WOULD BE VERY COSTLY  (fe_03_00106-A-0023)
PERHAPS UNBEARABLY COSTLY  (fe_03_00106-A-0024)
UM  (fe_03_00106-A-0025)

[LIPSMACK] IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MAKE UP MY MIND WITH ANY CERTAINTY  (fe_03_00106-A-0029)
THAT IS TRUE  (fe_03_00106-A-0030)
[NOISE] THAT IS TRUE [MN]  (fe_03_00106-A-0031)
OH THEY DID  (fe_03_00106-A-0032)
[MN] IF UM THERE IS A STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ DO YOU WORRY ABOUT RETALIATION  (fe_03_00106-A-0033)
[LIPSMACK] THAT'S VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_00106-A-0034)
UM  (fe_03_00106-A-0035)
UM  (fe_03_00106-A-0036)
STILL  (fe_03_00106-A-0037)
USING BIOLOGICALS ON A NEARBY COUNTRY COULD BE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE DISEASE COULD SPREAD  (fe_03_00106-A-0038)
IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS  (fe_03_00106-A-0039)
NOT NECESSARILY RAPIDLY BUT IN WAYS THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT OR EXPECT  (fe_03_00106-A-0040)
NO NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_00106-A-0041)
[LIPSMACK] OR WALKING ALL AROUND TOWN SNEEZING EVERYWHERE [LAUGHTER] [LIPSMACK] [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00106-A-0042)
I FEEL THAT DEMOCRACY NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED  (fe_03_00106-A-0043)
MUCH AS  (fe_03_00106-A-0044)
IT NEEDED TO BE PROTECTED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IN EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD  (fe_03_00106-A-0045)
WE MAY BE OUT OF TIME  (fe_03_00106-A-0047)
I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT WORLD WAR TWO HISTORY  (fe_03_00106-A-0048)
HELLO THIS IS RICKY CALLING Y- AH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AH U._S. POLICY IN IRAQ I BELIEVE  (fe_03_00106-B-0001)
AS TO WHAT WHAT SHOULD WHAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DO  (fe_03_00106-B-0002)
I DON'T KNOW I I HAVE AH STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO  (fe_03_00106-B-0004)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_00106-B-0005)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00106-B-0006)
THINK WE DO NEED TO  (fe_03_00106-B-0008)
LOOK VERY CAREFULLY THEY'VE GOT SOME INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION OF VARIOUS KINDS OR THEY SAY THEY DO  (fe_03_00106-B-0009)
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT I'M I'M JUST NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT THE PRIORITIZATION OF IRAQ OVER TERRORISM AND AFGHANISTAN IN GENERAL  (fe_03_00106-B-0010)
IT SEEMS IT CAME UP RATHER SUDDENLY WHEN WE REALLY HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THE OTHER TERRORIST ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION  (fe_03_00106-B-0011)
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IRAQ WAS UNLIKELY TO ATTACK ANYONE AT THAT POINT 'CAUSE IT WOULD MEAN SUICIDE AND WE DID AH WE FACE A LOT OF DANGER I THINK FROM THESE AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0012)
THESE VARIOUS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AL QAEDA ESPECIALLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0013)
YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF AH WE'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING THEM  (fe_03_00106-B-0014)
AND WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE SORT OF COSTS OF THE WAR [MN]  (fe_03_00106-B-0015)
I THINK THE  (fe_03_00106-B-0016)
PUBLIC NEED TO BE SORT OF BETTER INFORMED ON THE COST OF THE WAR THEY FIRED AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0017)
THE ECONOMICS ADVISOR FOR SA- ESSENTIALLY FOR SAYING THAT IT MIGHT COST TWO I THINK IT WAS TWO TRILLION DOLLARS OR SOME SOME  (fe_03_00106-B-0018)
SOME HUGE AMOUNT ANYWAY FOR AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0019)
FOR SAYING THAT PUBLICLY ALTHOUGH THEY'D BEEN SAYING IT PRIVATELY  (fe_03_00106-B-0020)
AND IT SEEMS THAT SO THERE NEED TO BE THERE WILL NEED TO BE A NUMBER OF SACRIFICES THAT AH WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS  (fe_03_00106-B-0021)
SO THAT'S AH ONE ISSUE THAT THAT I'M CONCERNED WITH  (fe_03_00106-B-0022)
IT SEEMS SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ECONOMY IS REALLY IN A NOT VERY GOOD SHAPE IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE FROM WHAT I READ ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT THIS MORNING  (fe_03_00106-B-0023)
SO THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT I I'D LIKE TO SEE SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON IRAQ  (fe_03_00106-B-0024)
WHILE OUR ECONOMY AND THE FATE OF THE FORESTS ARE SORT OF GETTING WORSE AND  (fe_03_00106-B-0025)
I- YEAH GO AHEAD  (fe_03_00106-B-0026)
YEAH  (fe_03_00106-B-0027)
IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE DOING SPENDING A LOT OF  (fe_03_00106-B-0028)
W- WE'RE CUTTING TAXES ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHER INCOME BRACKETS AND SORT OF SPENDING MONEY THAT INVA- SPENDING MONEY FAIRLY WILDLY ON DEFENSE  (fe_03_00106-B-0029)
WHICH YOU KNOW WHICH MAY BE NEEDED BUT WE'RE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO LET EVERYONE HAVE THEIR CAKE AND EAT IT I GUESS EX- EXCEPT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING CUT  (fe_03_00106-B-0030)
AT THE LOWER LE- INCOME LEVELS  (fe_03_00106-B-0031)
I DON'T KNOW THE THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF AH YOU KNOW TH- THESE PEOPLE PROBABLY KNOW SOMETHING THAT AH W- WE DON'T BUT WHICH THEY CAN'T MAKE PUBLIC  (fe_03_00106-B-0032)
IS A IS A SORT OF WAY OF AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0033)
REALLY GETTING TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT AH AND FRUSTRATING DEMOCRACY  (fe_03_00106-B-0034)
IF YOU SAY WELL WE CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO  (fe_03_00106-B-0035)
NOW SOMETIMES I AGREE THAT IT'S SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO  (fe_03_00106-B-0036)
DO THAT BUT AH I'M NOT SURE THAT I  (fe_03_00106-B-0037)
TRUST OUR GOVERNMENT AT THIS AT THIS STA-  (fe_03_00106-B-0038)
STAGE TO TO DO THAT AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE OTHER  (fe_03_00106-B-0039)
POWERS ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL REALLY ARE AWARE OF  (fe_03_00106-B-0040)
OF THIS KIND OF INFORMATION WHETHER BRITAIN AND AH FRANCE AND SO FORTH HAVE BEEN BRIEFED ON IT AND UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND APPARENTLY AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0041)
MANY OF THEM DON'T SEEM TO BE AWARE OF THAT THAT SAME SITUATION  (fe_03_00106-B-0042)
SO IN A WAY SAYING OKAY  (fe_03_00106-B-0043)
YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME SECRET INFORMATION SO WE GIVE YOU ESSENTIALLY A BLANK CHECK  (fe_03_00106-B-0044)
UH MAYBE  (fe_03_00106-B-0046)
YEAH IT'S IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION ISN'T IT  (fe_03_00106-B-0047)
YEAH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS  (fe_03_00106-B-0048)
YOU KNOW I I WE DON'T KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALL THE FACTS EITHER WE'RE  (fe_03_00106-B-0050)
GOING TO SEE SEE WHAT THEY AH DO WITH ALL THESE REPORTS THEY'RE GETTING THEM TRANSLATED THEY WEREN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN GETTING THINGS TRANSLATED THEY RAN SHORT OF TRANSLATORS APPARENTLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0051)
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LED THEM TO IGNORE THE WARNINGS ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH  (fe_03_00106-B-0052)
AND THEY DIDN'T GET TO TRANSLATE THE WARNINGS UNTIL AFTERWARDS  (fe_03_00106-B-0053)
THEN THEY FIRED THE [MN] GROUP OF AH ARAB ARABIC TRAINED AH TRANSLATORS BECAUSE THEY WERE GAY  (fe_03_00106-B-0054)
APPARENTLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0055)
YES THEY FIRED AH AT LEAST SEVEN OF THEM I THINK FROM AH MONTEREY  (fe_03_00106-B-0056)
BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY WERE GAY  (fe_03_00106-B-0057)
AND IT SEEMS THAT BEING GAY IS MORE SERIOUS THAN AH THIS CRISIS IN IRAQ  (fe_03_00106-B-0058)
IF THAT'S THE ONE AREA THAT WE REALLY NEED IT IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE PRIORITIES ARE SORT OF NOT BEING SET OUT STRAIGHT  (fe_03_00106-B-0059)
SO IT'S A LITTLE THE WHOLE THING IS A LITTLE SCARY IF WE GET SORT OF PUSHED INTO A WAR THAT'S G- THAT'S  (fe_03_00106-B-0060)
GONNA CO- BE VERY VERY COSTLY BECAUSE IT WILL AFFECT OUR  (fe_03_00106-B-0061)
COULD AFFECT OUR STANDARD OF LIVING SERIOUSLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0062)
IT SEEMS TO BE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME VERY HAWK LIKE PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION  (fe_03_00106-B-0064)
WHO ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT PERSUADING THE PRESIDENT THAN  (fe_03_00106-B-0065)
POWELL AND OTHERS WHO ARE  (fe_03_00106-B-0066)
SOMEWHAT MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE RUSHING INTO THINGS  (fe_03_00106-B-0067)
YES I DO BECAUSE  (fe_03_00106-B-0069)
[MN] I MEAN IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE  (fe_03_00106-B-0070)
A A TYRANT A SADISTIC TYRANT IN IRAQ AND YOU YOU HAVE SOME GERM WEAPONS OR WHATEVER IT IS  (fe_03_00106-B-0071)
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO USE THEM BECAUSE AH THE RETALIATION WOULD BE SO AH SEVERE  (fe_03_00106-B-0072)
THAT AH YOU'D BE COMMITTING SUICIDE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'RE ATTACKED AND THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU ANYWAY  (fe_03_00106-B-0073)
THAT'S THE TIME WHEN YOU YOU USE ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT  (fe_03_00106-B-0074)
AND AH THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU REACH O  (fe_03_00106-B-0075)
THE A COUNTRY LIKE THAT MAY REACH OUT TO VARIOUS TERRORIST GROUPS AND SAY LOOK AH WE MAY NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING BUT WE'RE ALL MUSLIM AND AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0076)
WE- WE'LL GIVE YOU THESE AH GERM WEAPONS OR WHATEVER IT IS AND AH YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN WITH THEM PUT EM ON A PLANE ON A PLANE SOMEWHERE OR [MN] IN SOMEONE'S BAGGAGE [MN]  (fe_03_00106-B-0077)
AND SO FORTH AND AH YOU KNOW KENNEDY AIRPORT OR CHICA- O'HARE  (fe_03_00106-B-0078)
AND YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PROSPECT IS IS RATHER SCARY I MEAN IT'S A SITUATION ANYONE WOULD BE IN IF IF YOU'RE LIFE IS REALLY THREATENED YOU'LL USE ANYTHING YOU'LL GE- YOU'VE GOT RIGHT  (fe_03_00106-B-0079)
IT'S NOT LIKELY HE WOULD USE IT TO INITIATE A CONFLICT IF NO ONE WAS NO ONE WAS THREATENING YOU  (fe_03_00106-B-0080)
YOU AH YOU'D PROB-  (fe_03_00106-B-0081)
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO TO DO IT EVEN ON A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY ISRAEL MIGHT BE AN OBVIOUS TARGET BECAUSE THE RETALI- THEY W- THE RETALIATION PROSPECTS WILL BE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD  (fe_03_00106-B-0082)
IT COULD VERY EASILY I I'M THINK- IMAGINE IF SOMEONE  (fe_03_00106-B-0083)
CARRYING AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0085)
SIMPLY SOME MICROBES  (fe_03_00106-B-0086)
AND AH FLYING TO NEW YORK  (fe_03_00106-B-0087)
AND HE COULD GET THROUGH ALL THE SECURITY SYSTEMS I WOULD THINK WITH THERE ISN'T A SYSTEM FOR DETECTING MICROBES AS FAR AS I KNOW  (fe_03_00106-B-0088)
A- AND THEN AH SIMPLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0089)
DUMP THEM IN AH THE WATER SUPPLY  (fe_03_00106-B-0090)
YEAH WELL THAT WOULD BE A LESSER [LAUGHTER] THAT COULD ALSO WORK  (fe_03_00106-B-0091)
ASSUMING THAT IT COULD SPREAD BUT THOSE THINGS ARE ARE NOT THAT HARD TO E- ENVISAGE AND VERY HARD TO PREVENT  (fe_03_00106-B-0092)
WE'VE BEEN WALKING INTO THIS KIND OF SITUATION FOR A WHILE  (fe_03_00106-B-0093)
IT SEEMS THAT IT'S HARD TO  (fe_03_00106-B-0094)
BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN SUCH A STRONG POSITION PROTECTING ISRAEL  (fe_03_00106-B-0095)
AND I THINK ISRAEL IS A COUNTRY THAT'S WORTH PROTECTING IN A SENSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN SUCH A STRONG TO THE MAJOR DISADVANTAGE TO THE ARABS THAT THE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MUSLIM WORLD ALL OVER THE PLACE ARE SYMPATHETIC  (fe_03_00106-B-0096)
EVEN THOUGH TH- THEY MAY NOT CARE FOR AH SADDAM  (fe_03_00106-B-0097)
YEAH THAT'S AH  (fe_03_00106-B-0099)
WH- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED AH WERE YOU THINKING OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION  (fe_03_00106-B-0100)
