AND  (fe_03_00114-B-0005)
YEAH SO THEN SHE REPHRASED THE QUESTION  (fe_03_00114-B-0006)
SHE REPHRASED IT SAYING WELL SUPPOSE THAT THE U._N. INSPECTORS GO IN [MN]  (fe_03_00114-B-0007)
AND THEN  (fe_03_00114-B-0008)
THEY GET REBUFFED WHAT SHOULD BE DO MILITARILY  (fe_03_00114-B-0009)
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE NOW THE U._N. INSPECTORS ARE THERE  (fe_03_00114-B-0010)

WELL IF IF THEY DID THAT SHOWS SOME REAL SAVVY  (fe_03_00114-B-0023)
SO THIS IS AN INTERESTING PUZZLE  (fe_03_00114-B-0024)
I THINK HE'S HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE THAT HE SHOULD PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE THAT MAKES ANY INTERVENTION LOOK ALL THE LESS JUST  (fe_03_00114-B-0025)
I MEAN IF HE HADN'T PLAYED THE GAME INTERVENTION MIGHT HAVE LOOKED JUST [MN]  (fe_03_00114-B-0026)
