[MN] THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT WHAT WE SEEM TO DONE  (fe_03_00147-A-0037)
AH TO HAVE DONE AT LEAST IN THE MEDIA  (fe_03_00147-A-0038)
AND PARTIALLY IN UM  (fe_03_00147-A-0039)
YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I H- HAVE HEARD IN YOU KNOW THE FEW SPEECHES THAT HE'S GIVEN AND YOU KNOW ASHCROFT HAS GIVEN UM [MN] THEY THEY S- THEY'RE TRYING TO ASSOCIATE WHAT HAPPENED WITH SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WITH IRAQ  (fe_03_00147-A-0040)
AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00147-A-0041)
THEY ARE COMPLETELY TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO TIE THEM TOGETHER IN ORDER TO SWAY THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE COUNTRY AND I FIND THAT TO BE KIND OF INSULTING  (fe_03_00147-A-0042)
[MN] BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE'VE ALL HEARD WHO THE MAJORITY OF THOSE AH TERRORISTS WERE THEY WER- A LOT OF THEM WERE SAUDIS  (fe_03_00147-A-0043)
YEAH  (fe_03_00147-A-0044)
YOU KNOW AN- BUT [NOISE] WE ARE FIGHTING THE WRONG COUNTRY YOU KNOW BECAUSE  (fe_03_00147-A-0045)
EXACTLY SAUDI ARABIA WE ARE ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT ON BECAUSE OF THE OIL AND THE REALITY IS [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00147-A-0046)
THAT WE CAN'T FIGHT THEM AND WE KNOW IT BECAUSE WE'RE JUST TOO DEPENDENT ON THEM  (fe_03_00147-A-0047)
SO WE CAN'T GO INTO SAUDI ARABIA AND BLOW THEM AWAY BUT WE CAN PICK A COUNTRY LIKE KUWA- UM IRAQ WHERE WE HAVE PAST AGGRESSIONS WITH THEM  (fe_03_00147-A-0048)
THE LEADERSHIP IS FAULTY AT BEST AND YOU KNOW A- WE CAN COME OUT LOOKING LIKE WELL AT LEAST IN  (fe_03_00147-A-0049)
I THINK  (fe_03_00147-A-0050)
EXACTLY AND I THINK THE REST OF THE WORLD IS SICK OF US I'VE TRAVELED A LOT I'VE LIVED  (fe_03_00147-A-0051)
KNOW IF IT WAS REALLY ALL THAT LARGE OF A THREAT I MEAN I IT IT KIND OF CAME OUT OF NOWHERE  (fe_03_00147-A-0054)

AND UM  (fe_03_00147-A-0064)
YOU KNOW IN HIS POINT OF VIEW IS IN FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT WERE IN IT THEY JUST FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WENT IN AND THEY DIDN'T REALLY FINISH ANYTHING AND IT'S ALMOST THE SAME ATTITUDE LIKE  (fe_03_00147-A-0065)
RIGHT AND IT'S JUST LIKE VIETNAM  (fe_03_00147-A-0066)
EITHER THAT OR IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU KNOW WE'VE PROVEN THAT WE CAN K- WE CAN WE CAN KICK YOUR BUTT AND YOU KNOW NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANY MORE AND THE REALITY IS IT'S I MEAN IF WORLD WAR TWO SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT US SOMETHING  (fe_03_00147-A-0067)
YOU KNOW AND WE THINGS WERE DONE RIGHT ON A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU KNOW WE WENT IN AND WE WON BUT WE REBUILT THOSE COUNTRIES  (fe_03_00147-A-0068)
AND NOW THOSE COUNTRIES ARE YOU KNOW THEY NO- NOT COMPLETE DEMOCRACIES BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY A LOT CLOSER THAN THE DICTATORSHIPS THAT THEY WERE  (fe_03_00147-A-0069)
YOU KNOW AND THEY ARE ECONOMICALLY OUR ALLIES LOOK AT JAPAN AND GERMANY I MEAN WE'RE TIED WITH GERMANY COMPLETELY  (fe_03_00147-A-0070)
YOU KNOW [NOISE] AND IT WORKED OUT TO OUR BENEFIT ON BOTH LEVELS WHEREAS YOU KNOW FROM THE KOREAN WAR ON ALL WE'VE DONE IS GO IN  (fe_03_00147-A-0071)
