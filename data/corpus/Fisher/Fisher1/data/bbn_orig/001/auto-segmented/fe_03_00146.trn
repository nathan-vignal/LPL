I DON'T WANT TO BE FROM A COUNTRY THAT JUST UNILATERALLY DECLARES [LAUGHTER] WAR ON ANOTHER COUNTRY  (fe_03_00146-A-0065)
AND OF COURSE I'M VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUSH FROM THE BEGINNING  (fe_03_00146-A-0066)
I I'M JUST REALLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT HIS MOTIVATION FOR THE  (fe_03_00146-A-0067)
THE  (fe_03_00146-A-0068)
