HI  (fe_03_00155-A-0002)
HI I'M SAM NICE TO MEET YOU  (fe_03_00155-A-0003)
I GUESS SO THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I'VE DONE  (fe_03_00155-A-0004)
I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0005)
ARMS INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ IS A FALSE ISSUE THAT'S BEING CREATED TO DRAW ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS  (fe_03_00155-A-0006)
ON UM THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE UH AND ESPECIALLY SO FOR THE THE RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS  (fe_03_00155-A-0007)
MHM  (fe_03_00155-A-0008)
[MN] [SIGH] WELL YEAH I THINK UH TOUCHY SUBJECTS ARE THE ONES THAT THEY  (fe_03_00155-A-0009)
THEY PICKED I IT  (fe_03_00155-A-0010)
I HAVEN'T BEEN READING THE NEWS RECENTLY EITHER JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MAKING ME VERY SICK UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0012)
BUT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WOULD ASK FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND THEN  (fe_03_00155-A-0013)
AT ONE POINT IRAQ SAID OKAY WE'RE WILLING TO MEET YOUR DEMANDS AND THEN ALL THEY DID WAS UP UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0014)
WAS UM INCREASE INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S VERY CONTRIVED AND THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE  (fe_03_00155-A-0015)
ANY INTEREST IN UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0016)
MAKING THE WORLD SAFER OR DOING THE RIGHT THING UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0017)
WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN  (fe_03_00155-A-0018)
IS GETTING EVERYONE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AS AN ISSUE RATHER THAN TO THE ECONOMY AS AN ISSUE  (fe_03_00155-A-0019)
OR TO THE FACT THAT NO ONE HAS DONE ANYTHING ABOUT UM WHAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ELECTION OF TWO THOUSAND UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0020)
WHICH IS WHICH WAS THAT THE UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0021)
VOTING PROCESS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT  (fe_03_00155-A-0022)
ELABORATE ON THE THE CORRUPT VOTING PROCESS WELL JUST  (fe_03_00155-A-0023)
UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0024)
[SIGH] IT W- [SIGH] IT WAS SORT OF BL- IT WAS BLATANTLY [NOISE] SHOWN THAT OVERSEAS BALLOTS WERE SENT IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WITH THE POSTMARKS CHANGED AND UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0025)
VOTING SITES IN HEAVILY BLACK AREAS WERE DEMOLISHED  (fe_03_00155-A-0026)
AND THE UM PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE VOTING THERE WERE NOT NOTIFIED SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY SHOWED UP TO EMPTY HOLES IN THE GROUND UM TO VOTE AND THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE TO GO OTHER PEOPLE WERE UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0027)
LABELLED FELONS RANDOMLY AND THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO VOTE THERE WERE ALL THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT THAT CAME UP WHEN THE SYSTEM UH WHEN THE UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0028)
THE VOTING  (fe_03_00155-A-0029)
UM BUREAUCRACY WAS PUT UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY FOR PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM VOTING AND UM SKEWING THE RESULTS  (fe_03_00155-A-0030)
AND NO ONE HAS DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I MEAN IT WAS A HUGE ISSUE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME [COUGH]  (fe_03_00155-A-0031)
AND THE SUPREME COURT DECISION UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0032)
SUGGESTED  (fe_03_00155-A-0033)
THAT VOTING WAS AN EQUAL PROTECTION THING WHICH IMPLIES THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE ON MACHINES OF DIFFERENT TYPES EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD VOTE ON A MACHINE OF THE SAME O- OF THE SAME TYPE  (fe_03_00155-A-0034)
BECAUSE SOME MACHINES ARE UM FAIRER THAN OTHERS AND UM SOME MACHINES ARE MUCH BETTER AT  (fe_03_00155-A-0035)
ACTUALLY HAVING THE VOTE COUNT AS THE VOTER INTENDED IT TO  (fe_03_00155-A-0036)
BUT THEN  (fe_03_00155-A-0037)
THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON NEW YORK AND SINCE THEN NOBODY'S REALLY CARED ABOUT THAT AT ALL  (fe_03_00155-A-0038)
AND THE ATTACK ON NEW YORK YOU KNOW WAS OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY SERIOUS AND IT UM BUT IT DREW PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER STUFF UH AND THE VOTING THING IS JUST  (fe_03_00155-A-0039)
WHAT I THINK IS THE BIGGEST THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THAT I'M REALLY  (fe_03_00155-A-0040)
NOT HAPPY WITH IT'S IT'S A WAY OF PROLONGING IT IT'S WELL IT'S A WAY OF PROLONGING IT  (fe_03_00155-A-0041)
AND OF UM CONTINUING  (fe_03_00155-A-0042)
THE POWER THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED THE PRESIDENT I MEAN HE  (fe_03_00155-A-0043)
HE WAS  (fe_03_00155-A-0044)
SO MUCH POWER JUST UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0046)
TO TO GO INTO AFGHANISTAN AND TAKE OUT THE TALIBAN  (fe_03_00155-A-0047)
UM BUT NOW THAT THAT'S OVER  (fe_03_00155-A-0048)
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THAT UP HIS ABILITY TO JUST MARCH IN  (fe_03_00155-A-0049)
ANYWHERE WITH A BLANK CHECK FROM CONGRESS  (fe_03_00155-A-0050)
AND SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR MOMENTUM  (fe_03_00155-A-0051)
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT AS WELL  (fe_03_00155-A-0052)
RIGHT AND RATHER THAN BE VIEWED AS IMPOTENT  (fe_03_00155-A-0053)
WELL IT I MEAN IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE I THINK  (fe_03_00155-A-0054)
IT WAS MAINLY TO MANUFACTURE AN ISSUE FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS AND VICE VERSA AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00155-A-0055)
AND I THINK THAT THE REASON IS THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN  (fe_03_00155-A-0056)
UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0057)
CREATING THIS ENORMOUS SMOKESCREEN  (fe_03_00155-A-0058)
BY UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0059)
THRUSTING IRAQ IN EVERYONE'S FACES AND MAKING IT LOOK AS THOUGH THEIR PLATFORM WHICH INCLUDES THIS WHOLE HOMELAND DEFENSE THING IS INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  (fe_03_00155-A-0060)
AND I DON'T THINK IRAQ IS ANY MORE THREATENING NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND I THINK THAT IF ANYTHING [COUGH]  (fe_03_00155-A-0061)
IF IT IS MORE THREATENING  (fe_03_00155-A-0062)
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS BRAND NEW POLICY OF UM THE WAR ON TERRORISM  (fe_03_00155-A-0063)
AND MARCHING IN ALL OVER THE WORLD EVEN MORE THAN WE DID BEFORE [NOISE] AND JUST TAKING OUT RANDOM GROUPS OF PEOPLE I MEAN IF YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT TERRORISM THE C._I._A. ITSELF COULD BE CONSIDERED A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0064)
BUT  (fe_03_00155-A-0065)
THAT'S THE SORT OF THING  (fe_03_00155-A-0066)
THAT'S THE REASON WHY  (fe_03_00155-A-0067)
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HATE AMERICA IS BECAUSE AMERICA IS PRESUMPTUOUS ENOUGH TO JUST SORT OF  (fe_03_00155-A-0068)
STEP IN AND  (fe_03_00155-A-0069)
RIGHT AND AND DECIDE RIGHT IT'S THIS SELF RIGHTEOUS  (fe_03_00155-A-0070)
CRAP THAT GETS PEOPLE SO PISSED OFF AT US IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_00155-A-0071)
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE THE SITUATION ANY BETTER  (fe_03_00155-A-0072)
YEAH I DIDN'T EITHER  (fe_03_00155-A-0073)
I DID I NEVER GOT MY ABSENTEE BALLOT 'CAUSE I REGISTERED TO VOTE IN IN MY HOME STATE  (fe_03_00155-A-0075)
UM AND NOT NOT HERE AT COLLEGE  (fe_03_00155-A-0076)
I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_00155-A-0077)
THEY USUALLY DON'T UNLESS THERE  (fe_03_00155-A-0078)
YEAH WELL UNLESS THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_00155-A-0079)
IF THERE I THINK THEY DON'T BOTHER TO COUNT THEM IF THERE UNLESS THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM TO UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0080)
CHANGE THE BALANCE  (fe_03_00155-A-0081)
[SIGH] I JUST I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE  (fe_03_00155-A-0083)
UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0084)
AND I THINK THAT IT'S REACTIONIST  (fe_03_00155-A-0085)
NO I THINK I MEAN  (fe_03_00155-A-0086)
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BEHIND IT THAT ARE SAYING LET'S LET'S PUT OURSELVES BEHIND THIS TO CREATE A SMOKESCREEN AND DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM WHAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING IT TO  (fe_03_00155-A-0088)
UM  (fe_03_00155-A-0089)
ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT IT AND I THINK ANOTHER  (fe_03_00155-A-0090)
ISSUE IS THAT  (fe_03_00155-A-0091)
IT'S A VERY REACTIONIST THING TO DO  (fe_03_00155-A-0092)
YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE HIT AND WE WERE HIT VERY BADLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST SORT OF BLINDLY SWINGING NOW AND PEOPLE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THEIR  (fe_03_00155-A-0093)
UM THEIR RE- THEIR SENSE OF REVENGE  (fe_03_00155-A-0094)
ASSUAGED  (fe_03_00155-A-0095)
THEY WANNA THEY WANNA BE SATISFIED THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00155-A-0096)
THEY'RE GETTING THE PEOPLE THAT HATE AMERICA AND THEY WANNA BE SATISFIED THAT THEY'RE SAFE  (fe_03_00155-A-0097)
YOU KNOW AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA INCREASE THE ACTUAL SAFETY BUT I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL AS THOUGH THE NATION IS DOING SOMETHING AND SO THEY WANT TO SEE FIGHTER PLANES ON TELEVISION  (fe_03_00155-A-0098)
AND NOT IN THE SKIES OVER NEW YORK  (fe_03_00155-A-0099)
