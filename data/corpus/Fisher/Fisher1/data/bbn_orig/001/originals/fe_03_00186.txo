L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, I'm Chris.  Um --
L:  Hi, Chris.  I'm Nina.
R:  Hi, Nina.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you over the phone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm just changing phones so I can hear a little bit better.  Now, did you hear the question again?  It was if you could --
R:  It was about holidays, wasn't it?
L:  If you could create a holiday and then who would be involved?
R:  Right.  Do you have any idea about that?
L:  Where -- where do you live?
R:  I live in Columbus, Ohio, but I'm British, as you can probably hear.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Actually, I'm from Ohio, too, but I live in Oregon.  I go to Portland State.
R:  Right.  Well, your voice sounds really familiar then. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, that's where that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, let's see.  Um, if I could create a holiday I think I would ... let's see ... well, what do you think?
R:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I -- I like -- I've -- I've just experienced US Thanksgiving properly --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- for the first time, and I like that because it's like British Christmas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it doesn't have presents and it's not so commercial.  You know, it seems to be --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- about -- about --
L:  Well, the original --
R:  -- about family and I like the eating.
L:  Right.  Well, the original idea behind Thanksgiving is a really great one, though, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know the whole story, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- see, that's what I like about holidays is that they really -- if they have a whole story then I think that that's what's more, uh, meaningful rather than just kinda making something up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I actually would have to say there must have to be some really interesting reason to make up a holiday.  I don't see ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the point of doing it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess the last one was Martin Luther King, and I can kind of -- I definitely see the point of that.
L:  Oh, yeah, no, exactly, yeah.  I would definitely agree with that.  And that's what I was thinking, too, Martin Luther King.  But I mean, like, that's -- yeah, I guess that's a -- like, a holiday that you celebrate rather than just, like, having, like, a meal or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some other reason.
R:  So, we've got to think up something that good, right?
L:  Okay, yeah, yeah, I agree. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Tough.
L:  Ah, well, I was actually going to have to say, um, International Women's Day.  That's what I would say.
R:  Is that not a holiday?
L:  I think that --
R:  It is some places, I think.
L:  No, I think it's, like, women's month, though, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's like, you know, March.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think if we had a specific day, just like you said, like the importance of having Martin Luther King be remembered every --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- year, I think that that --
R:  Well, which -- what would you like to happen?
L:  Well, I think that people should really look at women as being an important part of the world.  I -- I don't think in a lot of different places, even here in the United States or even in England, that women are recognized as much as they should be.
R:  [NOISE] No, I'm sure that's true.  But I guess men could say the same thing, "We're not recognized as much as we should be either".
L:  Well, then, I think there should be a men's day.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, I think there should be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a men's and -- and a women's day, and -- and people should make more of an effort, I think, to recognize the importance of the sexes.  And not just of your sex necessarily, but I mean of the importance of -- of whatever differences that there are doesn't mean that you have to change them just because of one or the other but the necessarily, uh, importance of having equality.  I think that's important.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Equality and respect.
R:  I wonder what people would do.  I mean, the tradition -- th- there are -- there are quite -- I'm -- I'm very conscious of the traditions because the American holidays are mostly new to us, so we don't really know what's -- what's gonna happen.  My -- my son is just getting me to sign something. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No, he's showing me something.  Okay.  Is it anything to do with holidays, Jamie?  Because we've got to think of what's a good holiday.  Okay.  Sorry, third participant, doesn't count.
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, and have you -- have you had any holidays that you've really enjoyed more than you expected?  With holidays?
L:  Well, let's see.  I would have to say Easter when I was really little, and that's probably because I got to get dressed up and be with my sister and brother and then my mom would have us look for Easter baskets that she'd hide really early in the morning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, something that kind of involves mystery and fun.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  That's -- that's magic, isn't it?
L:  So, do we just kind of like talk until we're done or ...?
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH] I have no idea.
L:  Is this the first time you're doing the study?
R:  First time I've done this, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, me too.  I just signed up today. [MN] But it's sort of what people would be involved, so ... well, I guess we could just make up another one.  Um, let's see -- and I think this is for analyzing linguistics, right?
R:  I think so, but I've -- I think we're supposed to act natural.
L:  Yeah, right. [MN]
R:  Um, which is not --
L:  But I mean, like, I'm trying to enunciate, though, too, not -- instead of just kind of mumbling into the phone.
R:  Oh, yeah, we do that. [LAUGH] That's all right.
L:  Right, right.
R:  That -- I mean, we're communicating fine, so I think, no, it must be okay.
L:  Right.
R:  We could have a communication day.
L:  Oh, that's a good one.  Or -- or like a -- like a languages day.
R:  Hey, you know what I'd like?
L:  What?
R:  I know what I'd like.
L:  Okay.
R:  This is just me feeling guilty.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I do most of my communication by email nowadays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I kind of like written letters.
L:  Written letters like a letter day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a great idea.
R:  We could call it a red letter day.
L:  Yeah.  That's a -- that's a good one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's good.
R:  And then we'd know what to do, wouldn't we?
L:  But then -- yeah.  But then you'd have to have -- like I said, what people would you have involved?  So, who would you have be the spokesperson necessarily?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I think you could g- -- I think you could get, you know, authors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- might get to --
L:  Actually, you know what?  Today is Emily Dickinson's birthday.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, when she died, she had a whole stack of letters and then a whole 'nother stack of poems and two ribbons in piles for her, uh, sister.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then she told her sister to burn them, and the sister burn- -- did burn the letters, but she kept the poems.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, maybe it could be something like, um, you know --
R:  Burn somebody's letters?  No, I don't think --
L:  Non burn -- non burn letters day, like writing letters to make up for all the different things that -- that people haven't been doing with written letters before.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or no junk mail day.  That would be a good one.  They had that, didn't they?
L:  John mail day?
R:  No junk mail.
L:  No junk mail day?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I think they'd -- I -- I -- I think I heard about that, that sort of one of these things they -- they -- the people who normally send out junk mail decided not to for a few days.
L:  But see, this is the thing now.  You -- you'll laugh because I used to work for a company that, um, sent out different, uh, [MN] letters for people to have credit cards.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they don't think it's junk mail, though, you know?
R:  No.
L:  So, I mean, like, your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- junk mail is another person's interesting ...
R:  Quite right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, uh, advertising.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so that's why solicitors think that they can figure out who you are and what your tastes are and then they can figure out what stuff y- -- they think that you would wanna receive in the mail.  But see, I don't -- I don't like any of that stuff anyway.
R:  Was any of that stuff when you were doing it interesting to do, or was it just a job?
L:  Oh, I was actually editing all the letters just to make sure that they were correct.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was, uh, editing for spelling and grammar and syntax.
R:  Oh, gawd, yeah. [LAUGH] Get it right, but no fun.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Well, that's okay 'cause they paid me well, so ...
R:  That's good.  The money's good, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  So, yeah, I think that that would be an excellent holiday, letter writing day.  And then you could have, like, different categories to suggest for people for the -- 'cause, you know, people kind of need more direction, like you have to hold 'em by the hand and say, "Okay, you know, why would you wanna write a letter and to who?" and then ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You could say -- you could write for different causes, too.  Or political prisoners to get out of jail.
R:  Yeah.  The US Postal Service would like that.
L:  Who?
R:  The Postal Service would like that.
L:  The Postal Service, yeah.
R:  But it would be a good idea.  I'm -- I -- I like that one.
L:  Well, I mean, even now, for example, I think the, uh, Post Office is still doing an excellent job.  I mean, I know people they have a problem with the US Postal Service, but I know other postal services who are much worse.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well --
L:  Yeah, we could -- we could put posters up in the -- in the mailroom if we have our letter day.
R:  [LAUGH] Sounds nice.
L:  That would be great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's -- that's a good one.
R:  I think we must be nearly done by now.
L:  Okay.  Well, sounds like you gotta get back to your kids.
R:  I -- well, I -- I've gotta -- I've just got -- I've -- I have no idea how long the pizza which I put in half way through this phone call has actually been in, so I'm going to stop now.  Thanks very much, Nina.
L:  Okay.  All right, bye-bye.
R:  Okay, thanks, bye-bye.
