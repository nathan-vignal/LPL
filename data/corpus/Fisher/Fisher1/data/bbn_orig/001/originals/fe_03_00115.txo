L:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Jeff Hill.  I'm in Boston.
L:  Okay.  I'm Robin, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Hi, Robin.
L:  Good to meet you.  Um, so you want to -- you want to start off?
R:  Yeah, you know, it's interesting.  I've -- I've -- like everybody else, I suppose, I think about this and I almost go back and forth on -- you know, I'm of one of two minds.  On the one hand it seems like a very dangerous precedent to go marching in to other countries just because we don't like what they're doing.  On t-
L:  Of course.
R:  And I'm -- I'm constantly reminded of -- of World War Two and saying, "Gee, in nineteen thirty eight or thirty seven if someone had marched into Germany to start Hitler -- stop Hitler, wouldn't we all be in a much better situation?  [MN]  And --"
L:  Right.
R:  I'll tell ya, I'm -- I'm not sure which one of those is the more valid or -- I mean, they're both valid but which one of those should guide our actions is -- is a decision I guess I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not able to come to.
L:  Well, do you feel like it's kind of out of our hands also?  Like, I -- I feel like there's not even really going to be a decision made.  Like, the decision has already been made and this is all kind of a formality, like, the inspections and all that.  I think [MN] somewhere in there Bush will find something that -- that he -- he would --
R:  Yeah, I guess I'm not quite so fatalistic.  I mean, I -- you know, I -- I-- I feel as though I'd be willing to believe [NOISE] that -- that it's true.  But I -- I think if you look at the history of what's happened, you know, he's basically, ah, you know, made very strong statements and then backed down.  I- in fact I had this kind of -- you know, in terms of strange conp- conspiracy theories, I had this kind of thought, "Well, what if in fact he's staging this whole thing?  What if he never intended to invade Iraq but just really wanted this inspection thing to work?"  So by becomin- coming across incredibly belligerent and doing all this stuff, he actually did in fact get Saddam to finally cooperate.  Like [LIPSMACK] that would be an amazingly clever, huh, you know?
L:  That would be really clever.  I hadn't even thought of that.  But, ah, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- conspiracy theories are constantly going through my head and that's -- that's --
R:  Yeah, no one's willing to think that he's that clever but [LAUGH] you know, it's like, you know, he -- he could be that clever and he's certainly surrounded by a lot of very clever people.
L:  He's surrounded by clever people, definitely.  And I -- some of them I wouldn't, you know, that would seem like a possibility.  [LIPSMACK]  Um.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I mean, what do you think about -- about the -- the kind of World War Two analogy?  I mean --
L:  I -- I [SIGH] I'm already -- I mean, in that -- in that Saddam is, you know, tyrannical and a dictator and [SIGH] but at the same time I [MN] I -- I guess I'm -- I'm sort of in the same position.  I don't know.  I go back and forth, you know.  I think he is a threat to his people and possibly to the rest of the world, but I just [SIGH] I'm kind of an advocate for peace and I -- you know, what war to be the last -- the last resort, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm definitely in the kind of good situation where -- where, you know, my kids are too old to go to war and my grandkids are too young.  So, you know, it's like [LAUGH] like, you know.
L:  I'm -- I'm just at the age where I could go to war.  So, [MN] and my sister's in the army and -- and I -- I know a lot of people [SIGH] you know, that if they did start a draft or something like that again, that could go.  But ...  And I think people our age have also forgotten about Vietnam even.  At least my age.  I'm -- I'm twenty three so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know about it, my dad was in it.  But [SIGH] it's so horrific.
R:  Yeah, an-
L:  And --
R:  And th-
L:  Do you think -- do you think it's a ploy about, uh, Bush trying to cover up the econ- the -- or trying to avoid the failing economy issue?
R:  I -- I really don't.  I mean, you know, I -- I -- I mean, it's kind of -- it's kind of strange how, you know, I [LAUGH] it's one of the things that [MN] you -- you become a little bit more sanguine with age in terms of, you know, ah, taking things more at face value, I guess.  And, y- you know what?  I -- I honestly think he's a sincere person and I think he really -- when he talks about evil, you know, which is -- it's a strange thing.  You don't -- you know, people don't talk about evil anymore.  I mean, even people that are nominally religious don't seem to think about evil.  And I actually think that -- that -- that he actually believes there is evil in the world and that, ah, it's -- it's part of, ah, a sense of -- of so- something we should do to root it out, you know?
L:  But I feel like his com- his, you know, just stamping that on, evil, the word evil [MN] not only does it bring up connotations of religion, which is, like, the last thing we need right now.  We don't need any more associations with [SIGH] we don't want to pin them as Muslims and us as Christians.  And that's -- I think that's a huge mistake and that's -- that's, ah, stirring it up even more. 
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Stirring up all the heat and the [SIGH] us versus them and --
R:  I guess it just goes to --
L:  -- driving even a -- a bigger risk.
R:  Yeah.  I guess I think of it just in terms o- of more, you know, wh- why I think he -- that, you know, he's not doing this as a ploy.  Ah, although, I -- I clearly have, you know, several friends who are -- are, you know, kind of, totally skeptical about, you know, anything Bush says.  And I think, ah, you know, wh- i- almost in their eyes he can do no right.  So, I suppose it's, ah -- they're kind of, you know, so far one way it's -- it's hard to -- to form a -- an opinion.
L:  Well, sure it's the evil thing.  He also doesn't [SIGH] you know, his -- his background hasn't -- he's never had any experience with any kind of foreign policy.  He doesn't know anything about it.  So -- and he sees things in black and white when he doesn't --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- know personally, first hand, things about.  Like w- with big business he can see shades of gray all over the place.  That's what his background is in.  But [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- with foreign policy and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- and this situation in particular, he doesn't [MN] have a more [MN] definite stance.
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean, he also has an incredibly experienced foreign policy team.  I mean, you know, ah --
L:  Behind him?  Okay.
R:  Right.  And, you know, I -- I also think that even though, ah, they talk a lot about how disciplined, you know, his whole operation is and people tend to speak with one voice, I think if -- if -- if this was really, you know, ah, a shell game, if -- if, you know, I just find it hard to believe there wouldn't be somebody like, you know, ah, you know, Barrigan, who basically would blow the whistle on this.  I mean, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's -- it -- the experience of Vietnam, I mean, I think a lot of people realized that, you know, it's not moral to kind of cover up something, th- the kind of big lie that was going on.  And it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it was a very hard thing when those people broke those kind of stories.  I mean, they were accused of being unpatriotic an- and much worse.  [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  An- but 'cause they did that today, you know, the climate's a little different.  And so, ah, if there really was -- if this was g- you know, in some sense a giant sham I just don't think he'd get away with, you know?  That there'd be people, probably at pretty high levels, that would -- would basically kind of go for your conscience and say, "Look, I -- I just can't keep quiet about what's happening here".  And there seems to be enough difference of opinion in different parts of the administration between, you know, kind of the -- the more hawkish and -- and the more, you know, not so much dovish but, say, the more, you know, careful or procedural voices coming out of the State Department, that I think that, ah, if -- if something -- if -- if this was no truth to it at all, if these things were completely fabricated -- a- and the other thing is there's evidence that they weren't completely fabricated.  I mean, you know, not at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible] but clearly, you know, Iraq, you know, many years ago said, "We don't have anything, ah, any weapons" and people, you know, found them.  So, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they -- their track record's not great.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I r- I don't -- I don't really have [SIGH] it's really hard to say.  I -- I wouldn't want to be [LAUGH] in their position right now, having to make these decisions.  Definitely.  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.  Did you -- did you see any of the, ah, specials that were out on the Cuban missile crisis, ah --
L:  No.
R:  There were a couple on the anniversary, you know, ah, you know, that -- that -- that were on TV and --
L:  What are they -- what were they saying about that?
R:  [inaudible] recordings released.  And I guess the -- the kind of fascinating thing about it is that, ah, there was a lot of difference of opinion about what to do.  You know, much more than I would have thought.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact, it was the President who actually did make, you know, kind of, ah, the final call.  I mean, you -- I mean, I -- I suppose that's -- [inaudible] the buck does stop there.  But you kind of think with [NOISE] with all those people and all that advice, you know, there must be some consensus that forms.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  He just ratifies it.  And -- and in fact, ah, you know, i- th- th- the kind of thread that -- that -- or the image that -- or impression that came through was that most of his advisors were advocating a much more aggressive stance, that they really wanted to, you know, attack the missile installations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, by -- by going with the blockade he took this much more, ah, cautious approach. And that -- and that looking back on it everybody says, "Gee, that was really a good thing to do".
L:  Yeah, thank god.
R:  So ...  So, in some sense th- the -- you know, a very similar situation is playing out in our times.  And I guess forty years from now people will look back on it and, ah, you know, make the call.  [MN]
L:  Mhm.  [MN]  Do you think that if we do go to war that's going to bolster the economy or be detrimental?
R:  Well, probably both b-
L:  Because in the past it's been good but now wars are just so expensive as far, you know, just million, millions, millions of dollars onto the bomb that we just drop and we, you know, however many thousands of them.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I must confess, I feel like, gee, here I'm a well educated person and everything like that but th- the whole economy thing is often a mystery to me.  Like, apparently it's a very good for the economy if everybody were to go out and buy a new car tomorrow and throw away their old one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right?  And that seems an awful lot like dropping bombs [LAUGH] you know, on some [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We built all the bombs and the government pays for it but, well, actually we're the government so we're buying them from ourselves and throwing them away and somehow that makes everything good.  And it -- it does seem like there's -- even though that -- that's on the surface kind of ludicrous, there's some of that going in, all right, in terms of, ah, you know, what happened, you know, after the various wars in terms of, you know, World War Two.  There was just such an outpouring of productivity.  But, ah, you know, I mean what happened with the last war is that, you know, in Kuwait was that, you know, ah, you know, things were bad for a little while and then, ah, quickly got better.  In fact, you know, the -- the last ten great years of the nineties kind of came after that war.  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it seems kind of awful though to think that, ah -- you know, to -- to wish that -- th- that -- almost it's awful that anything good comes out of that much destruction.
L:  Right.  And we don't even want to [MN] you know, speak about what could happen.
R:  Right, but --
L:  Just like, you know, us having control of the oil fields possibly if, you know, we did go in and wipe out everybody over there [LAUGH].  But [SIGH] which has also crossed my mind, you know.  A lot of people's minds, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah, I mean, that --
L:  That's another conspiracy theory but ...
R:  [NOISE]  I r- I was- I read some article that said that, you know, the war is not just a big expense, it's the rebuilding of Iraq that would be a huge expense.  But because Iraq is so wealthy in terms of the oil wealth in the country, that the country really, you know, could more that easily, you know, rebuild itself if only it were given the chance of it, ah, you know
