L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, um --
L:  I'm Julie.
R:  I'm Deni. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi. [MN]
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, so what do you think about this whole situation? [MN]
R:  I think, um, it's [inaudible] for the Bush administration.  Um, I'm an international student -- an international student, um ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, from international -- from the view of international students --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just think, [MN] um, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's also for oil, just like -- just like, um, the war in nineteen eighty nine?  Oh, no, no, no.
L:  Mhm, yes.
R:  Yes.  What do you think?
L:  Um, [MN] I don't know.  It's definitely typical for a Republican government. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- a lot of it, I honestly think is because of his father and, like, just kind of wanting t- -- you know, because of what all happened with Bush Senior.  And he's just trying to do the s- -- like, kind of make up for his father.  'Cause Clinton didn't do anything. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, so I think he's just following in the same footsteps and having the same enemies.  And I completely disagree and I'm really sick of hearing about it on TV and I wish all the crap would just stop.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah.  All most American people dislike that.  But I don't know why do the Republicans, ah, succeed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the last election?  No, no, no, at just, ah, the mid term election, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.  [LAUGH] I -- I'm not familiar with -- with this topic actually. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I don't really have too much of an opinion on it, other than I'm annoyed of hearing of it and it's definitely just because we have a Republican government and I don't think that he is nearly as much of a threat as everybody says he is.  And I think we're just trying to push people around 'cause that's what Democratic governors -- ah, Republican, you know, people do.
R:  Mm.
L:  They [MN] always are wanting to start a fight and [MN] do all that good stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [PAUSE] Can you predict the -- if -- if, ah, US --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, after the war on Iraq, ah, were it to succeed or not?
L:  Um, it depends.  I don't really think -- it depends on if Saddam Hussein thinks he's in a -- in major -- like, if he's at -- if he's -- what's the word I'm looking for?  Like, if he's threatened by it and he thinks that he's going to be killed, whether it's assassinated or just whatever, if he thinks he's going to lose power I honestly think that he will use the weapons that he is hiding.  And he is going to basically end up killing us all because [MN] the weapons that he has will eventually [MN] -- whether he, like -- a nuclear weapon eventually will be in the area and eventually everybody would die from it.  It would destroy the entire world.  I think if he thinks he's going to die, he's the type of man that would take everybody else down with him.  [MN] And it just scares me to death that Bush is being as ignorant as he is and --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- doing the things he's doing.  And I hope that what happens is we kind of push around a little bit and then finally back off, but I don't know.  I'm definitely a Democrat. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  I'm really upset with the whole [LAUGH] situation and ...  [MN] I mean, I -- I think that Bush handled nine eleven pretty well, but I think that his actions since then have been [MN] inappropriate and [NOISE] I really -- I expected that this would happen though.  As soon as he came into office it was like, well, he's got to pick up where his dad left off. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um.
R:  Do- do you think Bush administration, ah, um, just want to divert, ah, people's attention from the -- the -- the recessive economy?  Because they don't -- they -- this -- this im- -- they don't seem to have, um, effective solutions to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to this, um, economic -- economic situation now. [LAUGH]
L:  That's a really good possibility.  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure.  What do you think about the whole thing since you're not even from here?  Like, [MN] are you just completely amazed at how he's handling everything?  Like, going, "God, what an idiot?" or [MN] what do you think about it?
R:  [PAUSE] [MN] I -- yeah, I j- -- I agree with you that he -- he just, um, follow his father's [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  with foreign policy.  Um, um, military, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How do you say?  Construction --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- such stuff, mm.  [PAUSE] Mm.
L:  [MN] What do you think that we should do about it now?  Like, just -- obviously we already know what Bush is going to do but [NOISE] what do you think a good solution for the whole situation is?
R:  I would like, um, [LAUGH] actually, ah, the [inaudible] people can't do anything to change the situation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to change the idea of the -- the -- the -- [MN] the political sense --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think.  Mm. [PAUSE]
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I -- I would like to see a peace solution on this issue. [MN]
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  I just wish that we could all, like, [MN] I don't know.  Everything seemed fine before and I thought the -- that we were supposed to be concentrating on the whole issue from nine eleven.  [NOISE] And instead it totally turned to the Iraq thing and ... I don't know.
R:  Yeah, because war always brings, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the sorrow for the --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- that we -- we don't like to see and ...  So, some people just say the -- the war on Iraq is just like the terrorism.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  It's true.
L:  I don't know.  I think, like, even people in the US -- I'm sure we don't hear about it all that much but I'm sure that people in the US do things that are bad for other countries all the time.  I mean, like, shoot, our government is almost like its own terrorist organization by the way that they handle things and push everybody else around when they don't like the way things work.  And that's what terrorist groups are doing.  They don't like the way things are going over here so they're pushing us around just as much as we push every other country around. [MN]
R:  Yes, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, [MN] I think America as a country will benefit from the war if -- if it succeed.  If, um -- if, um, the American, um, government can take care of, um, [MN] um, the government's -- ah, the government of Iraq --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they can just -- they can just, how do you say?  To sending the troop there and, ah, they elect -- they -- they will help the, ah, Iraqi p- -- ah, Iraq people to elect, ah, a president --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who -- who will, ah, follow the idea of American people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, no, no, Am- American government.
L:   Mhm.
R:  And, ah, since American government has, ah, a power, ah, in Iraq -- oh, Iraq -- in Iraq --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they can lower the oil price.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's w- what B- -- mm, Bush administration wants, I -- I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so the -- the oil price will go down. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, maybe it will -- maybe it -- it will encourage the economy.  I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh
R:  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  And, ah, with this problem in, oh, Iraq and South +Asia, ah, Asia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the Bush a- a- -- the American government will, ah, get more power from that area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then get economic benefits from that.  I [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- that's what I'm thinking.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] I don't know really what else to say on the subject because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mo- mostly I'm just annoyed by it and I want everything to kind of stop.  And I don't really have too much of another opinion after that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I am kind of close minded though, just because I am a Democrat and Bush is --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a Republican and [MN] so I automatically just [MN] don't like anything he's doing but ...
R:  Ah.  [PAUSE] You think, ah, the -- the tax -- ah, how do I say it?  The ta- -- ah, the revenue, the tax revenue, should allocate to education or to, ah, healthcare othe- other than military?
L:  Yes.  I think that we spend way too much money on military stuff, considering --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- that the schools -- like, I'm in Oklahoma and the schools here in Oklahoma, the high schools and stuff, are having to have their hall lights out because [MN] we don't have enough money for the schools to pay the electric bills.  And so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- why should we be spending a billion dollars on weapons and planes and stuff when people that -- [MN] in the United States don't even have the money to be going to [NOISE] a decent school? 
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, in -- like, my tuition's being raised and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we're just in a bad pla- -- like our whole economy's just completely in a bad place and it's because [LAUGH] we're spending so much money on unnecessary things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I just think the whole thin- -- like, we shouldn't be involved in this at all.  I don't think [MN] that if he has weapons [SIGH] that he's really going to use 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unless he feels threatened and what we're doing right now is pushing him to feel threatened and so we're asking him to use 'em, pretty much.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you know what, ah -- how long did they ...?
L:  [MN] What?
R:  Do you know h- how long we should, um, [LIPSMACK] talk on this topic?
L:  They, ah, should tell us when our time's up that we have thirty seconds left to say goodbye or something.  But they haven't done it yet.  I'm trying to look and see how long we've been on the phone but I can't tell.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let me see how long.
R:  We can't change our topic, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and they'll just hear the same talk -- topic the whole time.  I just
