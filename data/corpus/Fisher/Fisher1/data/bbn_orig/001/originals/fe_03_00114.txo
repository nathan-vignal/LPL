R:  [MN]  Hi, this is, ah, Doug.
L:  Hi.  I'm Corey.
R:  Ah, so, what do you think we should do about Iraq?
L:  I don't know, that's a tough one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't it.  Ah [LIPSMACK] we had a congressional candidate come through town who asked this question to an audience full of people, asking, "Do you believe we should intervene militarily?" [SIGH] and got a confused response.
L:  I guess --
R:  And --
L:  I would say that's kind of where I'm at.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.  So, then she rephrased the question.  She rephrased it saying, "Well, suppose that the UN inspectors go in [MN] and then they get rebuffed, what should be do militarily?"
L:  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  That's almost harder.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's because now the UN inspectors are there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Isn't it different?  Ah, she asked this question, ah, what was it?  A month and a half ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And at that time people said, "Well, if we get rebuffed we should just go in, that's -- that's the time to respond militarily".  And, ah, I wonder if people would change their mind.
L:  So far it -- it sounds like -- and you never know because you never know what spin the media's got and, you know, where they're getting their information from.  But it sounds like so far they have cooperated and they've done everything that's been asked of em.
R:  [MN]  I'm just amazed by the how many thousand pages and how many CDROMs of documents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they've turned over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The idea that someone has to read all that.
L:  Well, it kind of make you wonder if it's a baffle em with BS type thing.
R:  Doesn't it.
L:  You know, did they just, you know, spend -- you know, think of how many people it would have taken.  They've only had, what was it?  A month or whatever to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- put it all together.  Think of how many people had to have been working on this in Iraq for the --
R:  Well --
L:  -- past year or --
R:  But they've had since summer as warning.  I mean, the US decided to really start pushing hard, when, in August?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  So they've had some warning.
L:  That's true.  But I don't know if he would have started gathering documents [LAUGH] to support --
R:  Well, if --
L:  I guess they might have but they --
R:  -- if they did that shows some real savvy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So this is an interesting puzzle.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I was actually impressed that Saddam, you know, has played the game thus far.
R:  I think he's -- he's smart enough to know that he -- that he should play the game because that makes any intervention look all the less just.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if he hadn't played the game, intervention might have looked just.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so it -- it's a -- it's a challenge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  And I -- I just hope Bush doesn't -- doesn't decide to -- just decide to get frustrated with it and do it on his own.
R:  Well, that was the editorial that I saw in today's paper, that said, "Well, suppose -- the editorial I saw this morning said that, ah [MN] said that it looks suspiciously like Bush is now going to try to, ah, come up with a pretext to go ahead anyway.  And, ah, that's -- you know, I -- I -- I haven't seen evidence of that but it certainly is easy to imagine if you put your pessimistic hat on, that he might do that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I know that I've seen different news shows where they're, like, you know, "Why is this is all coming to light now?"
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, "Why is this -- why is it right now all of a sudden we have to do something about it?"
R:  Well, I th- I thought it was pretty obvious, the timing for the election season.
L:  Right.
R:  It distracted everybody from the economy.
L:  Right, which --
R:  And so now -- now after the elections we've got, ah, suddenly the economic team in the administration is being fired.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think that's 'cause he knows in two years he could be in real trouble if they haven't [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- fixed the economy.
R:  Right.  And it- it'd be very hard to stretch the Iraq mess out for two years.
L:  Well, and even if they did, financially that would just be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- devastating to the country I would think.
R:  Well, but -- and the other thing is if -- if there's a military in- intervention now, two years from now, that's when you expect an army of occupation to be unraveling at the seams.  [MN]
L:  That's true.
R:  So you need -- you need something else to get people's support.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN]  [PAUSE]  Well, ah. [PAUSE]
L:  It's -- it's an interesting time to be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to be living in the US.
R:  Yes.  My -- my Chinese students tell me that the old Chinese curse, "May you live in interesting times" isn't -- isn't Chinese.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- it's a fairly well invented made up curse though.  Ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I have students who are on the -- who are in the reserves who are very nervous about being called up before the end of the semester and wrecking another semester to another military adventure.
L:  Oh, yeah, that would be -- that could be a big problem --
R:  Yeah, one of -- one of them lost a semester to the Gulf War and now he's still trying to finish his degree and is in danger of losing another semester to this.
L:  Oh.  When does your semester end?
R:  In December.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, ah, this is the last week of classes.
L:  Well, they might make it then.
R:  Yeah, well, it looks like they will this -- this time around.
L:  That's good.
R:  But, ah, he was worried about that.  He's, ah, I guess he's been trained as a combat nurse, so he's [MN] he's all ready for it.
L:  Yeah, he could be in demand.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where do you teach at?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I teach at the University of Iowa.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  I go to school at the University of Iowa.
R:  Ah, okay.  Perhaps we were responding to the same email asking for volunteers.
L:  [LAUGH]  Probably.  Which department are you in?
R:  Computer Science.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Library Science, so ...
R:  Okay.  Ah, but the -- the request came from Dave Eichmann.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That was the one.
R:  [SIGH]  Ah.
L:  Yes, it's a small world.  [LAUGH]
R:  It is.
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, this is my first.
L:  Okay.  This is my fourth so ...
R:  Ah, you must have volunteered to do multiple calls from multiple phones or something?
L:  Um, just -- I just thought I would do as many as they needed, so ...
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  I signed up on Friday and I've gotten called every day.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Oh, I didn't sign up for any weekend calls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  [MN]
L:  But it's been really interesting.
R:  Well, yeah.  So, what do you make of the, ah, the student, ah, the student anti war movement?
L:  I guess I haven't really heard that much about it.  I live out of town and I'm --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- finishing up for this semester.
R:  You haven't walked by the paintings on the fence around the Old Capitol?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Okay.  There's a -- there -- there's a big stretch of fence near Jessup Hall that has, ah -- that ha- that's done by the Students For P- Students For Peace With Iraq.  And they have painted beautiful portraits of -- of all o- well, beautifully tongue in cheek portraits of all of the, ah, key players in the Middle East.  Ah, Bush, Sharon, Saddam, Arafat.  [MN]  Very nice caricatures of these people.  Ah, all of them -- there- there's sort of equality of insult involved in them.  [MN]
L:  Okay.
R:  But none of them are -- [LAUGH] no- no- none of them are exactly pleasant.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Someone actually complained to the newspaper about the painting of Arafat in a Hawkeye football uniform waving a peace sign.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  They did Sharon in a tutu.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, Saddam just looks like himself and Bush looks sort of -- Bush is done as a hippy.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Waving a peace sign.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if he's as peaceful as most hippies were.
R:  We- well, that's the whole point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the- none of these portraits are exactly, ah, honorable.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's fun political parody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's -- it's evidence that there is a fairly large student group that's -- that's, ah -- that's talking about trying to be an anti war group.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I guess I've gotten a couple of emails that the graduate students were working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or were trying to form something but --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.
L:  We live in Muscatine so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  To -- to drive up for that kind of stuff is [inaudible].
R:  Yes, that's a long commute.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So ...  But, um.
R:  The pearl city.
L:  Yeah.  So ...  It's nice to hear that they at le- there is an interest in it and that people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are at least aware and care.
R:  Yeah.  What really bothers me though is that they seem to have real interests but they seem to be very much -- their sources of information are highly biased and -- and they're -- they've decided to disbelieve everything they hear except what they hear through the anti war movement.  And frequently that's just as biased.  So, they don't se- I don't see much evidence of -- of strong critical thinking skills there.  Ah.
L:  Yeah, that's a problem then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it does make it hard to know what -- what you should believe, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's very clear that every source is suspect and the problem is to, ah, to not let that lead you to believe that everything sa- said by a suspect source is false.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Even the greatest scoundrels tell the truth sometimes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's true.
R:  Ah, and in this case I'm not sure [MN] -- I don't -- I'm not really sure who the scoundrels are and who is merely deluded.
L:  I was going to say that could be the biggest problem in this one, is trying to figure out who the scoundrel is.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- I'm willing to believe that Saddam Hussein is a scoundrel and deluded.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, but the -- the -- the peace movement people are busily attempting to -- oh, I've heard charges that said that [MN] this was a, ah, this was a military intervention that -- that -- that was going to make money for the, ah, military industrial complex in the United States.  And [MN] the economics of that argument just strike me as very bizarre because it's very hard to find any example of a war that has actually had an- a long term economic benefit for anyone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wars seem to be losing propositions all the way back to Worl- all the way back to the Civil War.  Ah ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard to get rich off war.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And I think that's part of why Bush is worried about the economy.  Um, you know, going back to his firing of his --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- economic advisors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, he knows this isn't going to be -- this isn't necessarily going to help.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  How long are we supposed to sustain this conversation?  [LAUGH]
L:  Ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ten minutes, my golly.
L:  They --
R:  Okay.
L:   They beep in and tell you when you're done.
R:  Yeah, I assumed.  [MN]  Ah.
L:  So ... But, um, it is -- it's been very interesting and just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to see how the media portrays it all.
R:  Right.
