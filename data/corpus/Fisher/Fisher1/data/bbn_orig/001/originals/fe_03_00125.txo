R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Stephanie.
L:  I'm Mitch.
R:  How're you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  Okay, so the topic.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, what do you think?  I guess -- I guess I don't really think it -- it's doing any good.  I -- I don't know why we're messing around with Iraq and, um, I -- I -- I don't think that arms inspections are going to help at all.  I mean, 'cause obviously they're gonna hide anything good that they have.
R:  Right, well, I'm kind of torn with it.  I'm a little bit -- I -- I agree that we need to be doing something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't know what exactly we need to be doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I support it because, I mean, it's better than doing nothing I suppose.  And at least we're showing that we're doing something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to Iraq.
L:  Why do you think that we need to do something?
R:  B- because I think at this point especially we've already started to make a stand and if we pull out now --
L:  Yeah, I suppose.
R:  -- we end up looking like a weak country.  And with already knowing that we've been attacked once and people are willing to attack the United States, we have to do something at the very least.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not to mention I'm a little bit more liberal when it comes to doing something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Do y- do you think that the arms inspections are going to help at all though?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, the -- the only reason I think it may help is just to make sure they realize that we're always there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's someone always looking over their shoulder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's going to make it a little bit more difficult for them to do something to us hopefully --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it's one step in the right direction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's my perspective.  I mean [MN]
L:  I guess I don't really feel like th- that would help in -- in terrorism and all, on us.  I think terrorists are going to be around no matter if Iraq is helping them or not.
R:  So, do y-
L:  And I just feel we're giving the rest of the -- rest of the international community are kind of mad at us 'cause no one else is really supporting us on it.  But, you know, I'm not a big fan of Hussein or anything.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  But ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what do yo- what do you think we should be doing then if ...?
L:  I don't know if we should be doing anything in -- in Iraq.  Um, I -- I don't know if there's anything we can do really.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, that's kind of the whole point of terrorism is that it just takes one guy and, you know, household supplies to make -- wreak havoc, you know, and build a bomb or something like that.  But ...
R:  True.
L:  I -- I think that terrorism is going to be the biggest problem for us from now on, you know?  Since there's no one else -- there's no other super powers, no one else like that we have to worry about.  I just hope it doesn't get to the point where we're like Israel.
R:  Right.  I completely agree with that one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the only reason I think I'm willing to do anything, is to prevent us from having to live -- I mean, I don't want my kids, when I have kids [MN] to have to live every day in fear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because that's not the reason that we should be living.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Um, w- do yo- um, do you think there's something we should be doing in the United States then, besides, you know, just going over to Iraq?  Like --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- should we be taking better precautions in the United States for terrorism or ...?
L:  I don- I don't think so.  I just don't think there's anything that you can do.  You know, I guess it doesn't hurt, airport security and things like that, but I don't like -- I -- I'm not a big fan of the new homeland security -- Office of Homeland Security or anything like that.  I -- I think that we're starting to give up a lot of our personal freedom --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the name of security and things like that.  You know, like they can subpoena records from the library and [LIPSMACK] all sorts of things like that that I don't really agree with.
R:  Yeah, I would agree on that aspect. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not a big fan of having my privacy stepped on.
L:  Right, mhm.  And it's to the point now where, you know --
R: [NOISE]
L: -- computers are fast enough and people can write code to figure these things out where they can churn through the data fast enough.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  But [PAUSE]  So, ah, how did you hear about the study?
R:  Um, through one of my professors at Northern.
L:  Northern where?
R:  Out in Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, okay.  Quite a distance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Are you a linguistics student or something?
R:  Um, I am, ah, English Education Masters student.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  For the time being.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  What do you want to do?  Teach?
R:  Um, I'm actually are going to go back and teach high school.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because it didn't quite work out as I had planned.  [LAUGH]  I wanted to be a professor but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's not going to happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about you?
L:  Uh, well, I- I'm working on my Masters degree in Computer Science.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I participated in an earlier study, the switchboard one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's how I heard about it.  A- I was into linguistics for a while.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I've never taken a linguistics class but --
L:  You should.
R:  -- next year I need to start taking em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, right now I'm just trying to hope I can actually get through the classes I'm in now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How much do you have left on your Masters degree?
R:  Um, this is my first semester.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's going to take me three years 'cause I have to do student teaching for getting my teaching certification.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm going to be in school forever again.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm ready to --
L:  Are you going full time?
R:  Yes.  Yeah, and I'm teaching up at Northern too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  I'm going part time, I just take one class a semester.  So, it'll take me even longer.  [LAUGH]
R:  True.
L:  I -- I -- I don't know how long it's going to take actually.  I was thinking of switching and taking two this semester --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I- I'm working full time.  Um, my company's paying for it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, you know, two a semester, I think that might be too much work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But at the rate of, like, one a semester, it's going take me, I don't know, five or six years or something ridiculous like that just to get a Masters degree.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I figure since it's paid for I might as well keep taking courses.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's the way to do it.  That's why I'm teaching up at Northern 'cause I don't have to pay for classes then.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  But they don't pay me enough to quite, ah [LAUGH] feed myself.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you teach like -- like freshman courses or ...?
R:  Freshman composition.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they're fun.  I think that's the best part of sc- about school though -- [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is my kids.  But, I don't know, I might end up leaving the program after this year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We'll see.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's good to know how you feel though, you know?  You can take the courses and decide you don't like it and you're not --
R:  Right, that way I tried and I can't ever look back and be like, "Well [LAUGH] --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- maybe I should've".  [PAUSE]
L:  So, you- in your composition class, do you have to grade, like, essays and things like that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does it take a long time?  I had a friend who was --
R:  Oh, my god yeah, it's insane.  Well, on Wednesday they're handing in their portfolios so I'm going to have sixty six papers for -- I only teach one class this semester.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm going to have sixty six papers to read in two days.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that- that- my friend who was a TA for the composition class said it took him at least an hour to grade each paper, you know?  And [LAUGH] at that rate, that- that'll take you forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  To say the very least.
L:  What sort of things are they writing about?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, let's see.  They had to write about their family for one of th- their first paper.  And then they had to write about the media.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And how they think the media affects stereotypes.  [LIPSMACK]  And the last paper was on the movie LA Confidential.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, th- that was, I think, the -- the best paper they wrote on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Everything else has just been [LAUGH] horrible.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, I bet.  I was going to ask of- about the quality of papers you get in.
R:  Yeah, it's disturbing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's very disturbing.  I mean, my grammar, I'll admit it isn't great.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But oh my goodness.  I mean, it- this -- the computer age has, like, ruined all of our possibilities for writing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I get papers where students instead of writing out the word Y.O.U. they just put the letter U.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And they don't understand that that's not academic writing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  It's really bad.  Worse than I ever expected.
L:  Wow, I didn't think it'd be that bad.
R:  Yeah, it gets bad.
L:  You get things that aren't sentences and ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]  Just -- and, you know, really bad slang that I don't know what the words mean.  I'm only twenty two --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I've suddenly gotten old in a matter of a couple of years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because I have no clue [NOISE] what some of the they're saying, ah, mean.
L:  Yeah.  So, are there a lot of apostrophes floating round where there shouldn't be?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  Yeah, I -- I noticed that, like, when I was in college as an undergrad, that y- I think if you can write well, you can do well in pretty much any class because no one else knows how to write.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's ...
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I- I think that's -- that's what I'm trying to teach my students.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't quite teach them the way, um [MN] my professors taught me, they always said, you know, "Make sure you know all the material".  And I'm trying to teach my students that if you can write, you can get through anything.
L:  Yup.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You either have to study or know how to write.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's worth your time to learn how to write.
R:  If you can't do either [LAUGH] you're in trouble.
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Leave now and go find a really good paying job.  [LAUGH]  Find something.  They're getting better though, so ...  I -- I don't think I'm failing any more than one person, so that's always good.
L:  Yeah, that's good.  [NOISE]  What was your undergraduate degree in?
R:  My undergrad was in English literature and philosophy.
L:  Oh.
R:  How about you?
L:  Mathematics.
R:  Mathematics, ooh.
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm honored in linguistics and computer science.  I was actually going to switch to linguistics at one point but I -- I was in the technical college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or the, I don't know, IT, I guess.  Not the Liberal Arts college.  And so I'd taken physics and chemistry and things like that but no foreign language --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because there wasn't a requirement.  And to switch to linguistics, which is in the Liberal Arts school, you need, like, three years of a foreign language.  So ...
R:  Right.
L:  It would've pushed me way back.
R:  Yeah, that would be enough to --
L:  So, I stuck with mathematics, even though I didn't really like it toward the end but --[LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I figured it's better to just get out of there.
R:  Right, yeah.  You don't want to spend ten years as your undergrad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Might as well get out there.  Yeah.  I think I got o- got out of college with only taking half a semester of math.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The one requirement.  What'd you take?
R:  It was math for public discourse and it wasn't even required 'cause I ended up transferring schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, it didn't even count towards my --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
R:  -- credits.  And then I took logic.
L:  Logic.  That's a- a lot of people take logic here too.
R:  Logic -- logic was a lot of fun but it was for my philosophy degree too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it all worked out.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I -- I didn't take logic but I thought about taking it.  It
