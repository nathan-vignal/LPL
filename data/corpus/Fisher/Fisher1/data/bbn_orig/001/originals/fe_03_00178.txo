R:  Hello.  This is Marie.
L:  Hi.  This is Mike.
R:  Hi.  So, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Oh, it's got to be Christmas.
R:  [LAUGH] No question?
L:  No question.
R:  No question. [SIGH] Okay.  Well, that's mine, too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But as far as creating one, I have no idea.
R:  Ah, now that's a tough one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Should be -- should need to be something that, um -- [MN] well, I don't know.  The best ones, I think, are the ones that involve the kids. [LAUGH] But maybe not in, uh, such a, um ...
L:  Materialistic way?
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] As the hol- -- as Christmas does.  I don't know.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, well -- y- -- it probably should be something that appeals to, uh, many people of different, um, backgrounds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Almost something a bit m- -- a bit more non, uh -- or it should be non religious then?
L:  Probably you may -- I -- I guess ... I -- I guess what people get most excited about, though, is -- are things that also happen to divide people. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, we have -- we have Independence Day, which is very American centric.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have -- we have Christmas.  We have Easter.  We have Halloween.  Um ...
R:  Okay, they've got one thing in Sweden which -- which is the country that I'm from --
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, which is, uh, a hedonistic thing, actually.  A remnant from the Nordic, uh, holidays, which is Midsummers, um, which only celebrates summer.  But I think that makes more sense in a country where, uh, it's winter most of the year. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, but that's just -- that's just, uh, sort of getting together, n- no, uh -- no gifts and stuff, just eating, uh, pickled herring and, um, strawberries, actually.  Uh ... and that's sort of a favorite in Sweden, which would be a sort of non naturalistic, anyway.
L:  M- must help to have, uh, the entire country with nearly the same climate?
R:  Yes.  Yes, exactly, mm.  That helps. [MN] No, really.
L:  Mm, how long are we s- [LAUGH] -- are we supposed to keep this up?
R:  Uh, [LAUGH] until they tell us to --
L:  Okay.  Was it ten minutes or ...?
R:  Yeah, something like that.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, th- this was a sort of a not that easy topic, I think.  Um [SIGH] so, no -- no -- no clues whatsoever on, uh, making up your own, huh?
L:  Oh, no.  Um ... I think I -- I agree, it's gotta be something that you can get the kids involved in, that they can, uh -- they can learn about in school and, uh ...
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
L:  But no ... no ideas.
R:  No, me neither.  It's something that you almost have to -- it's something that's supposed to be there and then -- that you miss when it's not there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not something ...
L:  Yeah, you can't just start a tradition.  You can't just --
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- decide you're going to start a tradition.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I guess you can but -- but it may take a while to catch on.
R:  Yeah.  Takes time.  Uh, I don't know, I think -- I think holidays are so connected to, you know, the things you remember when you were a kid, like you --
L:  Right.
R:  Easter and eggs and Midsummer and strawberries and Christmas and gifts and stuff like that.  Oh, Halloween and all the ... um, goblin stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  No.  I suppose to start a new one we need some traumatic event that would -- everyone can remember and, um ...
R:  Mm. [PAUSE] There must be something that, uh ... it's interesting really how -- how Christmas is -- there are so -- it's celebrated in so many countries, not just Christian but others.  I mean, in the -- in a different incarnation, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- still sort of a ...  I know I read some place that Christmas, um -- well, you know, when -- when they christianized Europe, for instance, it was, uh -- [MN] they just took a hold of -- of the date for the -- the regular holidays that --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- they already had and -- and just turned it into a religious thing.  That's sort of interesting [SIGH] because I suppose that would be -- that -- that's just the thing.  They were in -- in that, uh, uh [LIPSMACK] -- they had to create something new but not really because people wouldn't accept getting rid of --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- like, the old, I suppose.
L:  Uh, one thing, um, I thought was kind of funny.  Um, some friends from Singapore actually have a Christmas tree and decorate and -- I mean, and they're -- they're Singaporean. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But they've just tak- -- adopted the western holiday even though there's no snow or -- or, uh, or no -- no tradition.
R:  Oh, so they celebrate it in Singapore?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's sorta neat.  I've got, uh -- I live out in California and I've, uh -- have quite a bit of, uh, um, friends from, uh, India, um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- Asian India, and, um, I always bring them over because they think it's -- this thing with a -- with a tree they think is so funny. [LAUGH]
L:  It is bizarre if you think about it.
R:  Yes, I know.  Taking in a tree --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and just [LAUGH] putting up a bunch of stuff in it.
L:  Hanging -- hanging little -- little trinkets on it, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And then you just throw it out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, waste of natural resources really. [SIGH] But the traditional American Christmas only lasts for one day, right?  So ...
L:  Right, yeah.  I guess in -- in some other countries it's a much longer affair.
R:  Yeah, yes.  O- ours, uh, lasts all until the sixth of January.  That's the twelfth day of Christmas and that's when you throw your, uh, tree out.  It's so amazing here.  Here you see the trees on the twenty seventh, th- they're already out in the dumpsters. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, feels weird.
L:  Yeah.  It's when we -- if we had a fireplace then we could at least burn it, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We don- -- we don't even allow that here.
R:  No.  They don't like it anyway.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] So, what -- what holiday would you do away with if you had a choice?
R:  Oh, do away with? Um, [LAUGH] ah ... that's tough, too.  But we got one -- well, ours -- well, [SIGH] I don't know.  I think it seems more like there should be more, not less. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  At least ones that, uh, you take a vacation from work for.
R:  Yes.  Exactly.  Especially you guys need that here.  You don't have that many vacation days.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm really surprised to hear that you're from Sweden because your -- you have perfect -- a perfect, uh, American English accent.
R:  Oh, really?  Thank you.  You can't -- oh, you must be able to tell?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Not at all?  Wow.  Thanks.  Oh, I'm glowing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, I've lived here for a while and I was an exchange student a while back. [MN]
L:  I would have guessed East Coast, but that's -- that's it.
R:  Yes, Maine.  That's where I stayed.
L:  Okay.
R:  For a year. [PAUSE] No, it's -- it's -- it's really, um -- if we're gonna -- just a quick anecdote on something else [LAUGH] but it's really weird when I'm in -- when I'm in Europe because everybody thinks that I'm an -- I'm an American and I don't get treated w- -- very well always.
L:  Mm.
R:  Mm.  That's a bummer.  So, the Singaporeans, uh, is -- is that a general tradition thing or is it just the friends you have that's, uh, celebrated --
L:  I think -- I think that probably there -- there's a -- a -- a part of society that wants to be westernized.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so they -- they adopt, uh --
R:  A lot of the --
L:  -- a lot of the western practices, even if they don't quite fit. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do they do it, uh -- uh, would you -- I mean, if -- have you celebrated Christmas with them so you would recognize the way --
L:  No.
R:  No?  Okay.  I was just wondering because I've -- I've heard about, uh, Midsummer, uh, uh, c- celebrations here, you know, in -- in, uh -- w- -- in Nebraska, I suppose, where there's quite a large Swedish community, and it doesn't sound anything at all [LAUGH] like we -- like we do at home.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was just -- be interesting to hear if ... [SIGH] seems like when things get translated they don't really come out the same.  Or it's probably the memories that get diluted in time, I suppose.
L:  Uh, New Year's seems to be pretty universal.  It --
R:  That's true.
L:  The different cultures seem to have different calendars and have --
R:  Yes, but it's still celebrates --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something new.
L:  And I guess the -- the Greek -- Greek Orthodox Christmas is much later than the -- than the, uh, western Christmas.
R:  The western?  Might be.  Such a long time since I read about that in school. [PAUSE] Yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is -- [LAUGH] that is not a -- you don't have any religion at all in -- in schools.  I mean learning about other religions either.  It's -- it's -- it's totally banned.
L:  Really?
R:  Well --
L:  In Sweden?
R:  No, for you, is it?  Or -- or a --
L:  Oh, um --
R:  I mean -- I mean in high school and up to high school.  I mean, at university obviously you can study it, but ...
L:  Yeah, that -- well, I mean, there's -- there's world history and -- and --
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  -- there's -- there's those aspects of world history that do get touched upon, but -- but, yeah, as far as presenting any particular belief system, I think it's -- that's pretty much a no no in public school.
R:  Yeah.  It's a bit sad really because it would, uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Goes to something, uh -- you get a very li- little hint about what other people believe, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Always good for communication, stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  You have to wait until college to get that.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we get that from I think it's third grade and up.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, you get to know all -- or you -- you're supposed to get to know about every -- every sort of kind of fate or faith that's, um, [NOISE] practiced all round the world.
L:  Interesting.  Well, I'm sure some of that goes on.  I've even heard of a c- -- a controversial, uh -- or
