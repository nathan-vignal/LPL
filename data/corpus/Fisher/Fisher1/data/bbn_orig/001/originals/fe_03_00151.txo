R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Helena from Florida.
R:  Hi.  This is Peter.  I'm from Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  Hi, Peter.
R:  Hi.
L:  We are supposed to be talking about Iraq, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Are you from the university?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Urbana Champaign?
R:  No, um, Northern Illinois.
L:  Okay, all right.  All right.  Um, so, what do you -- what do you think of the, um, the war that is being ...? [PAUSE]
R:  Well, I'm -- I don't know enough background about it --
L:  Mm.
R:  But I think, um, the -- the arms inspections was part of the, uh, wh- what had happened earlier, uh, in the decade.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And -- and it was sort of a requirement that Iraq sorta fell through on.
L:  Right.  Basically, they didn't do what they were supposed to do and, um, uh, I was just reading yesterday about, um, about this report that, um, Hussein had provided, like, twelve thousand pages or something and, um, yeah, it's gonna be really interesting to see what, uh, Bush will do now because they are saying in twelve thousand pages that they don't have nuclear arms, but, um, it seems that he doesn't believe the -- the reports.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's our Bush. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, should he believe?  What do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, honestly I think that we -- I don't know.  The whole Saddam Hussein issue perhaps should have been taken care of during the Gulf War, but since it wasn't --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like, s- since we didn't take care of that, we have no right to be trying that now, especially since they've been complying with the arms agreement.
L:  Yeah.  Um, y- okay.  Well, that's -- that's a very interesting position.  I -- I was afraid that you might have a [LAUGH] very, very, um, conservative view about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you know, you never know.  Um, because -- because there are a lot of people who really think that yeah, we have to go there and just, you know, get rid of him.
R:  Although, I mean, how 'bout us?  We have nuclear capabilities and no one's trying to take them away from us.
L:  Well, and what would happen if somebody -- yeah, that's ...
R:  If -- if somebody did, we just wouldn't comply, just like Iraq. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah. [LAUGH] Well, that's a good -- that's a good point. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because even -- even during Reagan's time he was, uh, he was, uh, he wanted the Soviet Union to disarm but kept building more and more himself.
R:  And I'm sure they wanted us to disarm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, of course, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But now that that's solved, there needs to be somebody else to -- [NOISE] to be picking on.  Um, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I was just kinda thinking that maybe, [NOISE] like, Bush was kind of embarrassed that he couldn't -- wasn't able to locate and kill Osama bin Laden [NOISE] and now this whole [NOISE] Saddam Hol- Hussein chase is like a red herring, that people would forget that --
R:  Sort of like Wag the Dog?
L:  Right, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  It's -- it's kind of -- it's kind of [NOISE] interesting.
R:  Yeah.  We haven't heard very much at all about Afghanistan lately. [NOISE]
L:  I know.  I know.  It's because nothing got established there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, or -- or maybe -- maybe something did, but -- but, uh, nothing very concrete.  And I -- I don't know, you know, if -- okay, if -- if -- if he goes there and kills Hussein, then what?  That's ...
R:  I mean, are -- you're talking about Iraq?
L:  R- yes.
R:  Yeah.  If the -- I don't even -- th- the Iraqi people don't even support us, do they?  I mean, do they want a regime change?
L:  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I -- I mean, I don't think it's a very democratic government [LAUGH], but --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  But -- but still, I think it's kind of their business.  [NOISE] But, um, at -- I don't know how -- to what extent the US should be dictating how people in other countries organize their society, that's all, and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it's -- it's not -- it's not a good place to be, I am sure, but, um -- but, you know, how would -- w- would it be better if some kind of an artificial western system was installed there?  I don't know.
R:  Well, I mean, that's assuming that the western systems are the truest way to go.  I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I find that a lot of the freedoms that we're awarded are very nice, but at the same time a lot of our freedom is taken away in order for us to have an illusion of more freedom.
L:  Well, that's -- that's the -- that's quite an insight.  I'm not an --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not -- I wasn't born in this country, so I'm always very, um, [MN] I -- I try not to criticize anything here, but then I'm quite delighted to agree [LAUGH] if somebody says something insightful.
R:  [LAUGH] Would you mind if I asked where you were born?
L:  Not at all.  I was born in Finland.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  But I've been in the States for thirteen years, so it's been a while.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  And are you originally from Illinois?
R:  Yeah, born and raised here, though I've been to Germany a couple of times and I'm planning on studying abroad in Japan next year, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  Stud- -- do -- studying what?  Japanese language or ...?
R:  Um, well, I -- I'm minoring in Japanese, but I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going for more like a business, uh, major leaning towards financing but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's still open.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, how did you hear about this study, by the way?  I'm just curious.
R:  Oh, I have a few, uh, linguist friends, so ...
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm a linguist myself and I just spoke like half an hour ago with another linguist.  So, I'm kind of like, okay, it's gonna be interesting, linguists talking to linguists.  This is not normal conversation, [LAUGH] but maybe that's what they are interested in. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, no.  It's like you'll be analyzing, uh, the -- the confrontations that we're -- we're stuck in and not actually doing the study. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are the people running this linguists?
L:  I think so.  I think so.  And, um, you know, they just -- they just posted it on a linguist list, um, email list, and -- and so it seems that some -- ev- everybody is somehow affiliated with this one way or another.  But, um, but it's -- it is kind of -- I was -- I was just curious of how it's gonna work.  I was curious if I'm ever gonna get my ten dollars. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hear, hear.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  This is the first one.  I -- I actually used my cellphone for this and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used both my cellphones and I -- I -- I came home last night and I forgot my cellphone at home, and I looked, it's like six missed calls, Jesus. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] I was -- I was just telling my daughter that how pathetic is my life that I have to organ- -- I -- I have to -- have to participate in a study like this so that somebody would call me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  But -- but it's kind of -- you know, it's kind of interesting to see how, you know -- like, I -- I wanna hear about the results if they ever publish them.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I -- I wonder, do you know what -- what their, like, hypothesis is, what they're going for?
L:  I have no idea.  I have no idea because they could look at whatever, you know, features like phonology to -- from phonology to discourse, you know, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But telephone conversations are kind of interesting.
R:  Mm.
L:  How people go about doing it.  And, you know, then you have -- then you have the factor that, you know, people are total strangers to each other and they are supposed to be talking about some -- a given topic.  So, I mean, it doesn't -- it doesn't take ver- -- I -- it doesn't take very long to exhaust the topic on Iraq with somebody with whom you pretty much agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- one could also argue that various, um, errors in the experiment could be that the types of people that would do this are most likely linguists or people who have that sort of --
L:  Sort of --
R:  -- lack of concern about talking to a stranger or less fear.
L:  Y- right, yeah, could be.  Could be.
R:  'Cause if they threw you in the middle of this -- like, I sort of knew that I would be getting a call from someone and have to talk face to face with someone else, so you can easily prep for it.
L:  Uh, what?
R:  You -- you could prep for it, uh, just --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- like, [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  I, um, yeah, I [MN] -- I think, I guess, it's kind of a like a self selective population who wants to do something like this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, um, that they enjoy talking, I guess, and don't mind talking to strangers, yeah.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it's [LAUGH] -- it -- it's certainly -- like, I was -- I was surprised to see that it worked so well because, um, [MN] because I really -- I mean, I was gone -- the first day when I volunteered, I was gone for the evening and then, you know, my phone was full of these out of area messages [LAUGH] which were -- were most -- uh, not messages, but, you know, the caller ID showed, so --
R:  Well, they actually left me voice mail. [LAUGH]
L:  What?
R:  They -- they actually left me the voice mail like when --
L:  Oh, they did?  Oh.
R:  When you get the call and it says, like, press one if you wanna accept this call --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They actually recorded that.
L:  Oh, all right, [LAUGH] okay.
R:  I guess it sounded like my voice picking up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] yeah.  Um, Iraq, I guess, I just hope that they won't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, it -- it'll be interesting to see if, you know, if it's resolved, but I -- I -- I think that Bush just wants this war.  He wants to show that he's, you know, tough and he can do it.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  There's an election coming soon.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  My problem was for the last election I considered myself strongly republican, and then after coming to the University for, what, now a year and a half, almost two years, I -- I've just really gotten more liberal views on -- on life and -- and learned that it's not as [MN] -- it's more honey to the ears than actual, uh, good that they're bringing to the country.  And so I'm sort of on the fence going for the best candidate, and I don't know if there's many, uh, identities coming up.  I haven't been doing enough research, but just to see what o- other parties can bring to this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm unhappy with Bush's performance so far, though.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.  Yeah.
