L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, uh, this is Hua.
L:  Oh, what is your name?
R:  Uh, my name is Hua.
L:  Hua?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My name's Heather.
R:  Heather?
L:  Yes.  How are you?
R:  Uh, good.  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Mhm.  So, uh, so today's topic is, uh, what we should do, uh, uh, a- I mean --
L:  Yes, about our --
R:  What's our attitude to Iraq?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.  So -- so, what's your opinion?
L:  What do I think?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, well, I have to be honest and say that I haven't been watching the news that much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm not a lo- really familiar with it.  But I have some -- I have some major issues with it [SIGH], and, um, I think from my understanding of it --
R:  Yes?
L:  Our weapons inspections with Iraq --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- aren't -- aren't the same -- we don't have the same expectations of other countries as we do of I- Iraq.  For example, in Israel.  We're not inspecting Israel, so I don't think it's fair.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think, um, I understand why Iraq could be annoyed with the United States, and I think instead of threatening to go to war, I think, um, maybe the US should reconsider its foreign relations.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's my opinion. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  I'm very anti war, and I don't -- I don't think we should ...
R:  Okay.  But, uh, I mean, uh, I think th- the first thing is that, um, so what's the first priority of, uh, today's United States?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I think the -- the -- that the most -- I mean, the first priority is the economic, uh, economy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I mean, so if we can -- we can -- I mean, if we can get recovered from today's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, problem of -- I -- I think that's the first priority.  We do not -- so if we cannot, uh, um, face -- I think th- that's the -- the biggest problem that everyone is co- -- everyone is concerned, so ...
L:  I think so, too, but then I'm gonna disagree with you a little bit --
R:  Yes?
L:  Because I think maybe our economy is not as good as it usually is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's still pretty good.
R:  It's still pretty good?
L:  Uh, I think so. I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but, uh, one of my, uh, my friends just got fired. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  What's that?
R:  I mean, uh, one of my friends just got fired.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  So -- so th- [LAUGH] that's not a good --
L:  No, no, I agree, and -- and I have a younger -- I have some friends who are having trouble finding jobs and things.
R:  I mean, especially, uh, I mean, in the -- in telecom area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it -- it's terrible. [LAUGH] Yeah, so I'm --
L:  But I also think safety's important, and -- and I think, um, maybe the -- I -- I think maybe people should be thinking about -- okay, for example, the terrorist attacks?
R:  Mhm.
L:  We talk about the terrorist attacks, but nobody really talks about why that happened.  We keep hearing the word jihad and stuff, but that's not very specific.  I think we need to think about why are so many people in the world anti American?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And if we don't, then -- then I think the -- we're putting ourselves at risk for more things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, let me ask you this.  Can I ask you this question?  How do you think, um, how do you think a war with Iraq would help the economy?
R:  Um, so, uh, from my o- opinion, I -- I think, uh, that, uh, if we can -- we can, uh, I mean, we can conquer or whatever, I mean beat Iraq, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very quickly, uh, it will be helpful because, uh, so every day, uh, uh, right now, uh, we are worried about the war, but if the war is finished very quickly, so I think, um, our, um, economy will recovered.
L:  I -- I see what you mean.
R:  I mean, and we'll get benefit from this.
L:  I understand.
R:  But if the war, uh, g- if nothing for about ten years [LAUGH] that will be terrible.
L:  I -- I understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, can I -- I'm gonna ask you another question.
R:  Yes?
L:  Since I notice you have an accent, I'm wondering where you're from?
R:  Oh, uh, I'm originally from China, the People's Republic of China.
L:  Can I -- uh, from where?
R:  People's Republic of China.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's what I thought you said.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, so I'm just curious what do you think the general attitude in China is?  Does -- does China have any concerns over this situation?
R:  You mean concern about the --
L:  Does China care at all [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is what I'm asking?
R:  So, I think, um --
L:  Does it affect them?
R:  The first problem is that, um, um, I think a -- a -- a -- Chinese people would think terror- terrorism is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is really the bad thing. I -- I -- I -- a- -- at least, uh, from personal I -- I have been contact with they -- they do not agree with the terrorism.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and, uh, the second thing -- the second thing is that, um, we -- we do -- we do think that the -- nowadays there are many, many, uh, foreign -- I mean, other countries, uh, people from other countries are -- are very -- I mean, are [several inaudible words] the United States.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and I -- and I think, er, that -- that is not because of our -- the -- the difference of our, uh, government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, um -- so, for example, I -- I -- I think the -- the -- the policy of, uh, the United States current government, I mean, is -- is not -- it's kind of -- I -- I mean it's -- it's kind of effective.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's -- and I -- I think that President Bush is always trying to find a -- an opponent and trying to beat it, beat him.
L:  All right.
R:  So, so, but I think, uh, y- you'll -- you'll beat -- if you -- for example, you'll, uh, you'll beat Afghanistan.  You will h- -- you -- you may have -- you -- you may have more en- enemies than -- than ever --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't think, um, beat someone else is a good idea, so ...
L:  Um, no, I -- I'm just -- I'm worried, uh, that it comes down to oil.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because our -- our leaders are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they promote the oil industry and I -- I'm worried that maybe the American public isn't getting the full picture.  We don't see it as clearly as ...
R:  Uh, I think, um, I think oil is -- I think is the main concern.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there are -- there are some other concerns such as, I mean, the terrorism --
L:  But --
R:  Although I don't think -- personally, I don't think there are any relationship between the -- I mean the president in Iraq and between the president in Iraq and the terrorism.
L:  Terrorists?  But see, yeah, I agree.  I'm not sure -- well, I don't know if there is or not, but that's why I'm confused about -- about the possibility of war because I keep hearing on the news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it's a response to nine eleven.
R:  Yes.
L:  A- and I don't see the connection.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, actually I haven't been a- -- paying -- watching the news in the last couple of days.  Do you know what --
R:  I'm not --
L:  Have they publicized anything about the inspections?
R:  Um, I've heard that, um, um, Iraq's just, uh, handing, uh, about ten thousand page, uh, inspection report --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to the United -- uh, I mean the [inaudible] union.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but I -- [LAUGH] personally I -- I don't think this kind of report will help us.  I mean, th- -- basically there is just, um, this kind of report means nothing really.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, and I've heard that, uh, the chance to get, uh -- I mean, to -- to have a war between the United States and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Iraq, uh, is very -- is -- is increasing now.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I mean --
L:  I think it's --
R:  And -- and another thing is that, uh, if we -- I mean, if we, uh, fight with Iraq and, uh, force -- forced them to -- to have another leader --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, is -- will the situation change?  I -- I -- I don't think so.
L:  I'm not sure either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm -- it -- it worries me, too, that the people who suffer the most from war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are not people who are involved.  They're -- they're the citizens of the country.  They don't make the decisions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think the people who are in the positions of power --
R:  Yes?
L:  -- that make the kind of decisions that the US is concerned about, they're wealthy.  They can get a -- they can avoid confrontation.  They can leave the country for a while or whatever, you know?  And -- and I think ...
R:  Yeah, but -- but the problem is that, uh, once, uh, the United States, um, stand in the opposite way, for example, to Iraq, so wh- what are these people thinking about?  I -- I think people in Iraq will think that the United States always hate us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we should hate them.
L:  I -- I think so, too.
R:  So -- so, this -- this will be a big problem.  I mean, this kind of heat will last forever, so ...
L:  That's sad, and it happens.
R:  [MN] I mean, I -- I think another problem is that the -- the people in -- in the Middle East have -- have some kind of a history.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean to -- they -- they like -- uh, they -- they do like to fight with each other.
L:  Oh, yes, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] So, uh --
L:  Israel seems to be in the middle.
R:  So, if you -- if you, uh, kept, uh -- you -- if you -- if the United States stand in -- in the opposite way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with them, I -- I -- so I think the -- the problem will -- I mean, the terrorism, I mean th- this kind of, um, anti -- anti United States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this kind of, um, things will happen.  I mean, last for -- for long time.  I -- I don't think this kind of thing -- this kind of, uh, environment, uh, will help the United States.
L:  [MN] No.
R:  So, in -- in the long run, it will hurt us.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um --
R:  And another thing is that, uh, the -- the oil, I mean, the oil in the Mid- Middle East will --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- will -- it will eat up all the oils in the Middle East in just about one hundred years.  So, what happens [LAUGH] after that?
L:  Well, I -- I agree.  I think -- I think the government should be spending more money on researching alternative fuel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I know a little bit about -- I forget what it's called.  There's one made from corn.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I've seen it advertised on TV and I don't even --
