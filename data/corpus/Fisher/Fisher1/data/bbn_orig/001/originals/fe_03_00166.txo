L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Jennifer.
R:  I'm Kristin.
L:  Hi, Kristin.  Um, gee, what a topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Make our own holiday, how very interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Um, let's see, my favorite holiday in the past has always been Christmas and birthdays 'cause I always get presents.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But now that I'm the mom it's not quite so much Christmas.  There's so much work involved.  It's probably still my favorite, though.
L:  Oh, I don't even know if I have a favorite holiday, [SIGH] um, hard to say in all honesty.  It just seems like there's so much rushing around, there's so little to enjoy.
R:  Right.
L:  When you get down to it.  Um ... I don't know.  I kinda like Halloween 'cause it's so much fun for the children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, as far as making up my own holiday, [SIGH] I don't know [LAUGH] what I would do.
R:  Yeah, I have no idea.
L:  Might wanna close everything down and have a day off for everybody.
R:  Yeah, sit on a beach day, something like that.  Sit and do nothing day.
L:  That would be good.
R:  That sounds good, definitely [LAUGH] in the middle of this holiday season.
L:  [LAUGH] A little -- something that forces everybody to rest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No stores, no shopping can be done.
R:  Yeah, you have to sit at home with your family and do mostly nothing.
L:  That would be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  That does sound nice. [SIGH]
L:  So, where are you calling from?
R:  Um, Pennsylvania.
L:  Pennsylvania.  I'm --
R:  And you?
L:  I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, boy, that's an odd topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, it doesn't leave very much to talk about.
R:  I know.  Oh, I suppose we, uh, can talk about [SIGH] our families' Christmas traditions.  We're, um -- m- my husband -- w- we -- we joke that we come from a mixed, um -- we're in a mixed marriage.  He's a Lutheran and I'm a Presbyterian and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he, uh -- his family had big lights on his Christmas tree, and I had the little tiny lights, and so we have to alternate Christmases about who gets the lights on the tree.
L:  Very interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like very -- it's a, uh -- it is a -- we -- we've negotiated a settlement, so we're fine. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm glad to hear that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I come from a family that likes to sort of stay in the house together for twenty four hours, and it drives my husband insane 'cause he comes from a very small family.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's not used to so many people around.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was from one of those, too, where, you know, like, Thanksgiving was twenty people in the house and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eating and running around, and then all th- -- all ten guys end up in front of the TV asleep --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- watching the football game, yeah.  So, that was -- that was kind of my family holidays.  And we also have the negotiation of who gets who at Christmas [LIPSMACK] in our families, so right now it's, uh -- we're going to my family for Christmas since my family's in Illinois and his is in Baltimore.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, we're kind of all over. [SIGH]
L:  That's a long way to go, especially with kids.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We just have one, but she's three and driving all the way to Illinois ...
L:  It's a long drive. [LAUGH]
R:  Very [LAUGH] long drive for a three year old, so ...
L:  No.  Well, we don't have any children but we try to keep the driving to a minimum.  Since we're the only people in the area we always have to drive somewhere.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, we did that, too, until three years ago. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And then everybody had to see the grandchild?
R:  Yes.  That was nice for a while, and then -- but -- but we still end up traveling a lot somehow. [SIGH] You know, like my -- my mom would put up the money so we could go see her and -- [LAUGH] and things like that, [SIGH] so ...
L:  It's funny how parents do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The bribe.
R:  Yes.  It works. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then, uh, but my husband's going to seminary right now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, pretty soon everybody's gonna come to see us at Christmas.
L:  I would hope so.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause he'll be working. [LAUGH]
R:  He'll be working. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you go to U Penn as well?
R:  Uh, no, I go to, uh -- I'm -- I'm a new professor at University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I heard about this on the -- the -- a -- a linguistic child language requisition list.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, don't know a whole lot about the study.  I -- I'm assuming it has something to do with computer transcription of voice or -- or something like that, but, uh, other than that I don't know.
L:  That's possible.  I'm also wondering -- I'm gonna keep track for myself, uh, [MN] the -- the sex of the people that I'm paired with.  I'm wondering if they're looking for discourse interchange --
R:  Yeah, that's the -- that's the other possibility is --
L:  Between s- -- you know, sex or same sex and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That kind of thing.
R:  So far, I've only had two calls, and they were both women, so ...
L:  Oh, I've had one man and one woman. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You and -- and a gentleman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, so it's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I could in some ways need a vacation from the holidays.
R:  Yeah.  Although right now I'm -- I'm, uh, giving finals so [SIGH] I get a week off before we start traveling for holidays, so that'll be nice, where I have a -- a whole week with no work.
L:  Oh, that you don't go right to the bitter end?
R:  No.  No, fortunately.  My husband will be.  His -- his classes go till the twentieth, and then we're gonna be driving that weekend, but, uh ...
L:  Oh.
R:  You'd think at a seminary they'd give you more time off at Christmas, but ... oh, well.
L:  No, our university will be open on the twenty fourth.
R:  Ooh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you professor, staff?  Are you ...?
L:  I'm staff, and I'm a student in the linguistics department.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, a graduate student.  I'm almost done.  I have to do my research project now.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah, a lot of fun. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what's your research on?
L:  Well, it depends [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- if it works out, I'll probably looking at prosodic phrasing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, in a, um, corpus of read speech.  And, um, trying to test someone's conclusions from a paper, wonderful --
R:  Right.
L:  And see if they hold true for a different type of, uh, corpus.  So, a person that had looked at performed speech, dr- -- a dramatic reading --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And, uh, so I'm gonna see if it's different with just sort of read speech.
R:  Conversational?
L:  Yeah.  So, I'll see what happens.  I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to find enough of what I'm looking for.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I might have to do something else.
R:  It never comes out the way you predict.  It never even comes out the way that your advisers predict, I've found, so ...
L:  Really?
R:  Well, when I did mine -- [LAUGH] I just finished mine.
L:  Your dissertation?
R:  Yeah.  I'm gonna be writing it up for publication, um --
L:  Oh, wow.  What was it on?
R:  On, uh, children's language erudition[?] and how they learn what a verb means, especially verbs like thinking or discovering, that, like, you can't really see --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't point to thinking very easily, and it's very difficult to draw it [LAUGH] 'cause I had the little -- you know, I showed the little pictures to tell 'em a story and it's very difficult to kind of, you know, depict thinking on a page for them.  But, um, but, um, it ended up there was a third factor that nobody had thought of until the results came out [SIGH] so ...
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's very cool.
R:  Kinda tied everything together, but it meant that I should've picked older kids. [LAUGH] So, it was, like, oh, well, it's interesting.  It's something to do for the next summer's research, but, uh, obviously they gave me my -- my degree, but ... but, yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, did you graduate from, uh, in Pennsylvania or ...?
R:  No, uh, University of Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, that's nice that you were able -- are you tenure tracked?
R:  No, I wish. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my husband's going to seminary, so we're -- we may try to pick up and move everybody at the same time when he's done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And try for a tenure tracked job, so ...
L:  Well, that would be good.
R:  And then that would be hopefully the last move, but pastors tend to move more often than [SIGH] -- than, um, [LIPSMACK] professors do.
L:  That's true.  Now, he's Lutheran?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, they're very into Christmas and they're very into the meaning of advent, not advent is the time to get your house decorated and get the cookies made and -- and the presents wrapped [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- which is what everybody else thinks it is, [SIGH] so ...
L:  That's true.  My husband is from a Methodist background.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I don't come from a very religious background.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's just interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  His focus is sort of very -- sort of quiet, introspective holiday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I come from a compl- -- hundred and eighty degrees in the other direction.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, and for them it's still a big family event on Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just that the advent time is supposed to be a time of preparing and watching and waiting for Jesus and getting yourself ready for Christmas, and I, of course, think of getting myself ready for Christmas as getting the cards out and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- shopping done and [SIGH] not a whole lot of time for --
L:  Are you ready to be a minister's wife?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not really. [LAUGH] Not really at all, no.  I, uh, I've been thinking about that a lot lately.  He just started this fall, so [SIGH] yeah, thinking about what that's gonna mean for me and our kids.  I mean, we only have one right now, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're hoping to have more than one and -- [MN] and, uh, what that all is gonna be like I have no idea.  I've watched -- Peter's dad is actually a minister, and Peter tried very hard to not become a minister.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but ended up doing it anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, just 'cause he couldn't find anything else that meant anything to him.  So, he, uh -- I've been watching his mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and trying to learn from her on how she handles it.
L:  It's tough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I know my husband's childhood church, the minister's wife -- he's still there.  Methodist ministers are supposed to move every two years --
R:  Oh.
L:  But he's been at the same church for, like, over twenty years.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's a very unusual --
R:  Right.
L:  -- arrangement.  And, um, she's completely withdrawn from church life.  She got so tired of the politics -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, it's horrible.
L:  -- of the parishioners.  She couldn't take -- she was just -- became very disgusted by it.
R:  Mm.
L:  And just stopped attending altogether.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  I'm hoping I never get that far.  I just wanna make sure that I don't end up on every committee and directing the choir and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, organizing the bake sales and whatever.  I'm trying to avoid that particular aspect.
L:  A balance of involvement.
R:  Yes, yes.  It -- it will be -- it will be harder to be, I think, a spiritual person if the only person I ever listen to is my own husband preaching.
L:  Mm.
