L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Uh, this is David.
L:  Hi, David.  This is Eric.  How you doing?
R:  Eric, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.
R:  I'm doing fine.
L:  That's good.  Now, where you calling from?  You in Philly?
R:  Uh, I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  You're in Massachusetts?  That's where I am.  I wonder if this -- this study is being conducted all on Massachusetts?
R:  Are -- are -- are you -- no, actually, I talked to someone from Oklahoma the other day.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Are you at U. Mass?
L:  Uh, actually, no.  I'm actually just a -- a friend of mine works at the, uh, LDC speech study thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so he -- we're good friends and he said, "Hey, wanna make a few extra bucks?  Just, uh -- I'll give you a PIN number and just take some phone calls between these certain times of the -- the night".  And I said, "Sure, why not?"
R:  Cool.
L:  So, no, I'm not a student any more.  I was a student a while ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, now I'm working at, uh, the Home Depot of all places.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And, uh, that's what I'm doing right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout you?  Are you a student?
R:  No, I'm a -- I'm on the computer staff there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, doing some -- I'm doing some research.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Excellent.  And how long you been working there?
R:  Oh, a couple of years now.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You enjoy it?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, we might as well cover the topic.  Holiday, what's your favorite holiday?
R:  Oh, it's Thanksgiving.
L:  That's mine, too.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I love Thanksgiving.
R:  Now, wh- why do you like Thanks- Thanksgiving?
L:  Oh, I love cooking.  I love food, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I try to be the one that -- that always brings the folks together to -- to entertain 'cause I love experimenting with new dishes, so I love entertaining and I love good food, good drink, so it's always that's a great excuse to go out and experiment and just go -- go off, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Buy interesting ingredients and great Belgian beers and have a lot of friends over and it's a good time, so I always make it a big event.  There's always something special going on, so I'll make something interesting.  Like, I won't always do traditional stuff like turkeys.  I'll do a pot roast on the grill or do something interesting with the turkey, deep fry it. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  That kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah, a friend of mine just, uh, had a leg of lamb this year.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, he -- he said it went over very well, so that was -- that was nice.  And we may try that some time.
L:  Yeah, I had a -- a -- a bourbon marinated, uh, pot roast once, and it was phenomenal.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Everyone's like, "Oh, my God".  So, yeah, I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't really, um, go for doing the same exact thing all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And also my side dishes, I try to really do some interesting sides, so it's not always the same traditional corn and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, and what about you?  Why do you like, uh, Thanksgiving?
R:  Well, uh, it's -- it's like the no pressure holiday, you know?  There's -- there's just the family getting together to enjoy time with each other.  There's -- there's, you know, no -- no gifts, no religious celebrations, it's just, boom, we're there, we're together, and it -- it -- it seems to be the, if you will, American holiday.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I- It's one distinctly American holiday, yeah.
R:  Mm.  So, I --
L:  Yeah, uh, but you actually made a -- a good point.  There's no gift exchange, there's no pressure to give stuff, there's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's nothing ulterior about the whole gathering.
R:  Right.  You -- you don't -- you don't feel like you have to go out someplace or see a parade or -- or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just getting together with the family, enjoying a meal together, enjoying an afternoon together, um, so I -- I -- I really like that.
L:  That's cool.  And so how has that -- so, how was your Thanksgiving?
R:  Oh, it was -- it was very nice.
L:  Nice.
R:  It was at my, um -- my aunt has done it every year for as long as I remember.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, she's getting pretty old now, but -- but she was up to it again this year.  And, uh, and came out -- everybody now instead of she m- -- instead of her making all the food, everybody brings a dish or something.  So, she'll cook the turkey and, you know --
L:  Everybody brings a side, yeah.
R:  -- a couple of the sides, and everybody else brings the sides and so forth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the desserts.  So, yeah.
L:  Does anybody have, like, a specialty with their sides?
R:  Um --
L:  Like, is there something that you particularly like, like there was som- -- one person that brings something?
R:  There was one person, I think my cousin Ann made a really nice, uh, sweet potato.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Uh, just this year.  Uh, it was -- it was absolutely delicious.
L:  Wow.
R:  And my mother in law made, um, made rice with lamb this year, which was very good, too.
L:  Nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  And -- and I love the rolls. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  The rolls are good.  The biscuits. [LAUGH]
R:  When my -- my grandmother was alive, she would always make, uh, potato salad, which was -- which was very, very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as she got older, she lost her taste and it ended up being, you know, swimming in, uh, vinegar.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  So, the last few years of her life we wouldn't let her make it any more because she -- it would just be -- you -- you couldn't eat it.
L:  Could be, uh, uh, inedible.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so how did you gently tell her that there was something wrong with the dish?
R:  Oh, it was -- it was -- it just came out.  We can't eat this, you know.
L:  We can't eat this. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And she took it in stride?  She was cool with it?
R:  Well, no, she -- she thought there was nothing wrong with it because it tasted fine to her.
L:  Right.
R:  It was just that her -- that her taste got so -- then she let my aunt make it. [LAUGH]
L:  That's too funny.
R:  It was.
L:  Yeah, you know, the funny thing is my -- my Aunt Mary started to lose her -- her taste buds and when she would make dishes they were, like, very bland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it was like, oh, my God.  So, but the thing is we were too embarrassed to tell her that, you know, that the dish wasn't that good, so we had to just tough it out.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But, um ...
R:  So, what -- what ho- -- what holiday would you invent if you c- could invent one?
L:  Jeeze, that's a good question, you know.  I [SIGH] -- did you think of one?
R:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
L:  Yeah, what would you invent?
R:  Opening day.
L:  Op- --
R:  Baseball opening day.
L:  Oh, baseball opening day.
R:  Yeah.  There'd be --
L:  And so, what would be required at baseball op- --
R:  No work.
L:  No work?
R:  No work.  Everybody could -- would either go to a game or watch the game on TV. [LAUGH]
L:  That's nice.  That's nice.
R:  'Cause I -- I've only -- I -- I used to work at a -- at a company where, um, they d- didn't -- their vacation policy was basically you got twenty days a year and you could do w- whatever you wanted with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that included holidays and vacation days and so forth.  Um, so I always said that -- that opening day was my holiday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so they knew I would be at -- at Stanway[?] Park, you know, watching the Red Sox opening day.  And, you know, just --
L:  That's a good one.
R:  -- marked on the calendar. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Your name, there you go, holiday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that would be a -- a -- a fairly well received holiday in Massachusetts.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I've never seen a town so devoted to baseball as Massachusetts, like, and Boston.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Unbelievable.
R:  I -- I -- I would [inaudible] Phillies because they're signing all these free agents and whatnot and building a new stadium.  I would think that the Philies fans would be -- would be pretty excited.
L:  Just as ecstatic, yeah.  I -- you know, the funny thing is I was always like -- I was never a big fan of baseball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I ha- -- uh, but I did feel this sort of, you know, really strong devotion to baseball and -- but not as much as in Boston.  I mean, and I was -- I was born and raised in Philly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now being a transplant here in Massachusetts for, I don't know, two -- two, three years, it just doesn't feel like this is like a significant event, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like this is part of your culture and so you're bred this whole thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, at -- at work it's -- it's huge, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Everybody talks about it and it -- they're right on the game, they know what's going on with all the players, and it's, like, incredible.  And even to the -- the cashiers at the front end, they all know about this stuff.  I'm like, "Damn, I gotta get involved because [LAUGH] this is -- you know, I'm looking like a complete fool not knowing anything about the game".  But, um, so it's amazing.  I mean, I -- I didn't experience that in Philadelphia as much, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't think, uh, the Phillies were ever a really, really good team.  I just remember, like, in the early eighties they were doing something pretty good, but --
R:  Yeah, they had Spent[?] for a while, but, no, the -- the -- the Phillies would be one of the lesser --
L:  The worst -- yeah.
R:  -- successful franchises in the history of major league baseball.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, and as far as the -- like, the whole pedigree on who was -- who's come out of the Boston Red Sox, because I can name a couple of players and I can't name any from Ph- Philly.  Pete Rose, but he's like -- he's got some --
R:  Not Mike Schmidt?
L:  And Mike Schmidt [LAUGH], they got some problems.  Well, Pete Rose has some problems. [LAUGH] His name's sort of notorious.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But other than that, I mean, it's always been, like, the Yankees and the Red Sox [LAUGH] to a certain extent.  But, yeah, that's interest- --
R:  So -- so, have you thought of a holiday yet you'd like to have?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I mean, I actually haven't thought about it that much, to tell you the truth.  Don't really think about -- it's kind of an awkward question because I never really thought about an -- a -- a particular holiday that I would want, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess it would be like a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hm, something where people had to give me gifts. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Besides -- it wouldn't --
R:  Eric Day. [LAUGH]
L:  Eric Day, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, everybody has a day off and they all gotta come round my house and give me gifts. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, I guess something like what you said, [MN] probably around an event.  And I -- I'm a big cyclist, so I like -- I like the Tour de France.  So, I guess --
R:  Oh, I -- I -- I bicycle, too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think, like, if the Tour de France, like, would open, that would be like -- kind of like that would be the day you get to watch the first day.  But actually that -- that race doesn't really kick in for me until they hit the Alps.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's when I start getting excited about that race.  But, um, other than that, how -- how long you been riding?
R:  Well, [MN] I was -- I was riding when I was in college and that was twenty years ago.  And then I stopped for a long time and then about three or four years ago I picked it up again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now that I've started working at U. Mass, um, there's a bike trail that goes from Northampton right up to the university campus, so what I'll do is I'll drive up to there, um, and then bike in the last eight miles to work.
L:  Nice.
R:  During the summer.  Yeah.
L:  That's a --
R:  And then -- and on weekends when I have time I'll -- you know, I'll do a longer ride. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and then every fall I do a, um -- the American Lung Association ride on Cape Cod.
L:  Oh, how -- how -- and h- h- how long's that?
R:  That's a hundred and sixty miles in three days.
L:  Wow, that's a good ride.
R:  Yeah.  And I did -- a few years ago I -- I took a vacation and did, um, a, uh, back roads trip through wine country in California, and that was two hundred miles in five days.
L:  Wow.  So, you've logged some -- some serious miles on your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on your legs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The funny thing is I just -- I -- like you, I took a hiatus from the saddle and, uh, before I was really competitive.  I was really getting involved and I was, you know -- my performance was pretty good.  And the funny thing is your brain remembers exactly where you left off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but your body is nowhere near that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I got in the saddle just like in the summertime and I was ripping up a hill and I'm thinking, "Oh, I'm gonna tear it up.  I'm gonna do it, like, ten times like I used to do" and I went up it and I was dying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I went up.  It was like the first thing I did, didn't even warm up, did nothing, just went on it cold --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and went from zero to flat out, and I was like -- I think I almost, like, passed out.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It was, like, this is really stupid, so, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But the funny thing is I felt that I was much more resilient like ten -- ten years ago, and I -- that's true, I was.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  I mean, I -- I could do stupid crap like that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  But now it's like my body's telling me, "You know what?  You really gotta be careful". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I got some back problems now.  It's like it's not even funny.  I'm, like, this is ridiculous.
R:  Oh, I had the same bike for twenty years.  I had an old Univega[?].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And last -- last year, I just couldn't get the hills with it.  Um, and I saw everybody else had the granny gear and I didn't.
L:  The triple?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I went out and got myself a new -- a new bike with a -- with the granny gear and I've had no problems with any hills since then.
L:  See, the funny thing is, I have not changed my gear ratio.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was a -- a fairly strong climber.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I actually was trying to max out the size of my -- my ring.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I was like a forty two inside ring.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With the -- with the largest ring in the back was a twenty one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was getting me over any major obstacle in Philadelphia 'cause we weren't known for our big -- our big hills.
R:  Right.
L:  All right.  Just for the [inaudible] legendary thing.  There's a tour de -- tour de pont or some sorta like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And one of the legs is the -- is that Philadelphia they have like a -- a core states race, used to call it, now it's called fleet or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  One of the banks bought the whole thing.  Any case, that was a pretty tough climb, but now it's like I'm thinking about you.  I'm thinking maybe I should actually get a triple because even though my ego would be shot to shit, [LAUGH] it's like, you know, putting a triple on, it's just one of those things.  Like, I can't climb any more.  I mean, even if I had like a -- I guess a -- what are they?  A -- a -- a thirty nine inside ring?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can probably go as low.  What's the lowest you can go with the granny on a -- on a road bike?
R:  Gee, I don't know.
L:  You know.  There must --
R:  I don't know.  I just -- I just bought the --
