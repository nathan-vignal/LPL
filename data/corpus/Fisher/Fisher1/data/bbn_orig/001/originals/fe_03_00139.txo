R:  Hello?
L:  Ah, hi.  Um, I'm Melanie.
R:  Hi.  I'm Pauline.
L:  Hi.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Ohio.
L:  You're calling from Ohio, okay.  'Cause I'm calling from actually from Ottawa, Canada.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I'm not actually American.  So, interesting conversation.
R:  That's funny.  I didn't know -- I thought -- I thought you had to be in the US but ...
L:  [MN] Well, no, I contacted them and they said it wasn't a problem so ...
R:  Guess North -- North America.  That's interesting. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So they --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  What if anything should the United States do about Iraq?  Is that what the -- what the topic was?
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  So, maybe [LAUGH] you want to start.  You probably have a [LAUGH] --
R:  Um.
L:  --  different opinion than I do.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  It just seems like whatever we were supposed to do about Iraq [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't seem like the situation has changed since -- [NOISE] I don't know.  It seems like the situation is the same as it has been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for about ten years.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever we should do now, we should've been doing it for the past ten years.  And I think Bush is [NOISE] [MN] using this as a pretext to finish the -- as a pretext to start a war, to finish the war that his father [MN] couldn't finish.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  And I think, ah -- I don't know, I think he must be pretty annoyed at the UN and all the -- and Canadians and other countries like us who weren't very, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, necessarily so supportive about -- about -- about having a war with Iraq so ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Some people -- some people think that, ah, that he's doing this partly to, like, distract people from the fact that, you know, the economy in the US isn't good and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a war is kind of like, I don't know -- it just gives something -- people something else to focus on and --
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH] Yeah.  I mean, it's -- I think it's definitely a way for him to [NOISE] [MN] continue his popularity ride.
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Um, [NOISE] but -- I mean, I do think it's true that Saddam Hussein is [MN] --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- not a good leader and --
L:  No, that's --
R:  -- is probably developing weapons programs.  But I think that that can be dealt with within the framework of the United Nations.  And it should be because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's in everyone, the United States included, long term interest.
L:  Yeah [inaudible].
R:  I mean, when the United States is looked at [COUGH] excuse me, abroad as [LIPSMACK] -- as a cowboy nation that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- imposes its will on everyone else, um --
L:  That's right.
R:  It doesn't -- you know, in the short term, um, the government may accomplish its shore term -- sh- short term goals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [SIGH] in the long run it will backfire.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
L:  And most Canadians are of the opinion, yeah, you should, you know, send the UN first and -- what -- I guess typically we're -- we're a little -- we sit on the f- -- I wouldn't say we sit on the fence about things but, ah, you know, we're definitely very cautious about, you know, striking up a war with anybody so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So most people here support, yeah, the way things are going now with the weapons inspectors and what not.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean, the weapons inspectors, I mean, that's an interesting thing because --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I was reading something about [MN] how they're apparently not particularly well screened.
L:  Really?
R:  Like, so there -- it's an international team and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [COUGH] one of the Americans is, um, [LIPSMACK] is this guy from Virginia who has no advanced degree in anything that you would think that -- or maybe even no degree period --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in anything you would think a -- an arms exp- inspector should be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trained in.  And is also has a leadership position in a -- on a sadomas- mad- mas- -- [LAUGH] I can't say the word.
L:  Yeah.
R:  An S and M, a sadomasochistic organization.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which--
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, so our [LAUGH] -- whatever our guys that --
L:  Oh my god.
R:  -- that we're sending in to, you know --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- a Muslim country, a country who already thinks that the United States is [NOISE] [COUGH] a bunch of infidels.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um.  [NOISE] But, so -- I'm -- I'm not so sure that my -- my confidence that they even know what they're doing is ...
L:  Well, I wonder how one -- I mean, what kind of training they would have to go -- go through for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or where they pull them from.  I have no idea.
R:  And it might be that the kind of training that they have, you know, maybe military people would be just the people that Iraq and their allies would -- would -- whose qualification Ir- Iraq and its allies would question.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, these [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, former American military people, for example, or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Do they have any Canadians on the [inaudible]?
R:  You know, I don't know.  I didn't actually -- um, in this artic- -- I just read that one article and --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- um, it didn't say -- it didn't talk about the composition, um ...
L:  Oh, it didn't say where people are from, hm.
R:  Well, I mean -- but -- 'cause it was focusing on this one guy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and his kind of shady [MN] --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- shady past.  But, I mean, you would hope and, you know --
L:  It's so bad for the poor guy.  It's not his -- I mean --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- he's had his -- his life exposed now and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They picked him so ...
R:  Yeah, it's a good point.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  It's -- it's hard to know.
L:  Yeah.  They showed them, I saw a picture today of them climbing around a whole bunch of tubes.  I don't know if they really looked like they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] knew what they were doing.  I was, like, what are those things?  But ... [NOISE]
R:  Well, I saw the -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- the, um -- they were carrying around these black suitcases which were being delivered to the UN Headquarters in New York and --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  It just seems like the -- from statements that have been made by --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not just people in the, um, you know, the executive branch of the US government.  Also Phil Lieberman [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, in the Senate, he said, you know, he would be surprised if it wasn't packed with a bunch of lies.  [NOISE] And I suppose, I mean, in a way I would be too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [MN] making public statements like that just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just invites people to say --
L:  Nasty things.
R:  You know, they went through the motions but [SIGH] --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- they were going to find what they were going find and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, wh- why couldn't we wait a couple of days, [NOISE] review the documents?  And if there are [NOISE] completely false things, which --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, [MN] I really wouldn't be surprised if there were.  Then -- then we can say we've reviewed the documentation, our allies have -- or we, being the United Nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We've reviewed it and we -- [MN] there are these problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] But instead, I don't know.  The administration there are not very good at, um [MN] --
L:  So, are you are -- you're a --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] diplomacy or --
L:  Are you a Bush supporter?  [LAUGH]
R:  Me?  No, [LAUGH] hardly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].  I wasn't sure, that's why I thought, "I'd better let her talk first because, ah, you know [LAUGH] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know that the Bush doesn't really care for Chretien and the, ah, Liberals over here too much [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- skirmishes between them, so ...
R:  I heard that, um --
L:  About the -- the -- the top aid called Bush a moron?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you hear about that?
R:  No.  In Canada?
L:  Oh, mi- well, they were at the, um, [MN] at the NATO summit.  When was it?  Two or three weeks ago now?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And one of the top, ah, bureaucrats to Chretien --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  She was his Director of Communications, within like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, range of a microphone called Bush a moron.  Well, the Canadian press just went crazy and they were like, "Oh my God, how could you --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- how could you let her get awa- -- you know, you've got to ask for her to, you know, resign and what not".
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Yet, you looked at the American papers or CNN dot com and you couldn't find reference about this.  I mean, the American --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Well, the Americans didn't really seem to care that the Canadian called him a [LAUGH] moron.
R:  [NOISE] That's so funny.
L:  You couldn't find mention of it their news.  In our news it was like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people are calling for her to recant it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I would have thought that -- I mean, if anything I would've thought, you know, people would be, you know, "You go girl, tell it like it is".
L:  Well, I mean, yeah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- 'cause people don't really like -- I mean, they don't -- th- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Most people are not big Bush fans.  But, I mean, they don't -- nonetheless, Canadians recognize the fact that we benefit so enormously from our relationship with you --
R:   Right.
L:  -- we don't [inaudible] --
R:  As do we, right?  I mean, [NOISE] Canada's our biggest trading partner.
L:  Exact- -- well, and for us --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- as well.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So they were like, "Okay, we don't like him but, you know, you don't have to say it in front of a microphone for everyone to hear, right?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  But then, ah, Chretien acted on it.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  He's not always, um, so --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- very articulate but -- which -- which makes him popular 'cause he kind of is just seen as a regular guy, you know, in some sense.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But he said something like, um, "Well, I like Bush.  He is not a moron at all, we are friends".  [LAUGH]  And I thought it was so funny. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] But, um --
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, speaking of Bush being a moron and -- and Canadians knowing it, um, [LIPSMACK] I have a friend, ah, who lent -- um, lent me some tapes of This Hour Has Twenty Two Minutes ...
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah, isn't it funny?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And although I heard that after September eleventh they, um, stopped doing, um, talking -- talking to Americans, just 'cause it was too --
L:  Well --
R:  -- sensitive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they have, um [LAUGH] I have, ah, these tapes that have, um, clips of the election ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where they go up to Bush and say -- or the, um, campaign.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where they go up to him and say things like, um, [MN] um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  "Sir have you heard that, um --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Gilles Leflore[?], the, um --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "-- the Canadian Prime Minister, has endorsed you?"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And he's like, "Oh, oh, yeah. I -- [MN] you know, he's a great man, that --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- Gilles Leflore, the Canadian Prime Minister".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  I remember that too.  And they were saying, like, ah --
R:  Or like -- oh, no, it was like, you know, um, Pierre Poteen or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  And, I mean --
L:  Yeah, that's right.  And he was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah".
R:  Yeah, and he just betrays the fact that he has no idea who the Pri- -- the Canadian Prime Minister is.
L:  Well, they said, yeah, that it's just [MN] obvious that -- they think Bush is more interested in the relationship with Mexico than with --
R:  Yeah.  Well, that was another casualty of the, um, [MN] September eleventh.  In -- in August of that year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, all over the US press was that, um, President Fox and -- and -- and Bush that they were [COUGH] -- they were working on a plan to legalize a lot of illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, labor unions supported it and it would be a great boost to the economy and to Mexican American relationships --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the Mexican American relationship.  But, [LIPSMACK] you know, then after the attacks --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, people just ...
L:  I thought they rather enjoyed having all these illegal Mexican immigrants there 'cause they could pay them, like, nothing and --
R:  Well, that's why the -- I mean, but that's why the labor unions, at least at that time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- pre September eleventh, supported --
L:  Right.
R:  -- legalizing them because then that raises wages for everybody and --
L:  True enough, yeah.
R:  Um, but --
L:  Oh, that's a good point.
R:  [MN] Who knows what will happen.  I mean, but now, [MN] you know, it's understandable in a way that -- that people are kind of, you know ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kind of like u- uncomfortable with the idea of ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I --
R:  I mean -- I mean, I -- you know, I feel like [MN] the Mexicans are [LAUGH] not -- I mean, they're not a threat, right?
L:  No.
R:  I mean --
L:  Not really.  [LAUGH] I can't imagine, but ...
R:  But, I mean, I suppose it is understandable that people --
L:  Well, you never --
R:  -- now want to be more cautious.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, even go- crossing from Canada.  I mean, I've crossed a million times over from, you know, ah, like Toronto or whatever into the Buffalo.  And -- and the last time -- I crossed at the beginning of November, I had a -- had a hell of a time getting in the country.  I thought, "Oh my god --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is the first time ever --
R:  Yeah, I've never --
L:  -- where it's not, you know, been so easy, you know?
R:  Yeah, it used to be.  At least at certain border crossings you just --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- you know, they would -- if they stopped you at all they'd say, like, "Y'all American or Canadian?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you say, "Yes" and then you'd be on your way.
L:  That was it, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I remember, like, last time I didn't have -- well, unfortunately, ah, I did not buy a return ticket, [LAUGH] not even really thinking about it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it's been so easy in the past.  And of course that caused all the problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Why don't you have this return ticket and, ah, whatever?"
R:  Yeah.  You know, people don't think about this but do you know that, um, Ohio and Ontario border each other?
