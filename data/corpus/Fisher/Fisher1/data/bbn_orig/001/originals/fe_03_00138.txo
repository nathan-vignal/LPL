R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  [COUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Laurie.
R:  I'm Arda.
L:  Hi Arda.
R:  Hi.
L:  We got a tough question today. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I'm [LAUGH] surprised.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so what do you thing?
L:  Well, I didn't really have too much time to think about it so I'm gonna go from the top of my head.  Um, [MN] I really feel that, um, the UN should [COUGH] take all its time in, um, inspecting.  Um, [MN] I don't believe [NOISE] that we should go into a war, um, as we hear every single day on the news and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  Um, I have my personal, um, feelings about any war, um, and to me this is just too, too scary.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [SIGH] I -- I've kind of been struggling with this issue back and forth for a while now and I -- I'm really not sure where I stand because on one hand I kind of feel like something has to be done.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm just not sure what.  Um, I kind of think that things in that part of the world have to be kept in check somehow.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm -- I -- it's easy for me to say that I'm not as opposed to war as a lot of other people, but that's only because I haven't had any first hand or even [SIGH] you know, remotely related experience with it.  Um, so I don't feel as strongly against going to war there.  Um, just because I do -- I -- I just keep thinking of the future evolution of that region of the world.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know.
L:  Well, I can agree with you somewhat.  [COUGH] Somewhat I can't because, um, [MN] you know, we still have the terrorists.  What about that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [MN] in my opinion I feel that they are linked.  But I just feel so saddened that so many innocent people, um, in that area -- um, the Israelis are going to be, um, part of it, there's going to be so many other targets.  And we're not just fooling around with [MN] people coming in with guns, you know?  These are rockets and missiles and God knows what.  It's scary to me.
R:  That's true.  I mean, i- [LIPSMACK] it's true that when you're talking about rockets and missiles it's much less targeted in the sense that of course you're -- you're going to get lots more innocent people.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, and that's the part that terrifies me too.  Um, but I guess the question is, is that going to save more innocent people down the line?
L:  [MN] Who are we saving?  I don't really think we're, um, [COUGH] at the point now of -- [MN] it's even difficult to save ourselves.  Um, there's so many things I feel that we, as Americans, just let go.  Gun control law --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, where -- where you have a sniper, of what happened, um, you know, in the Washington area and what's -- I live in, um, [MN] California, Southern California, and what's happening here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that there's not enough of a police force.
R:  Mm.
L:  But yet, [MN] where is all this -- I don't know.  I- i- it's very confusing to me.  [NOISE] I'm older.  I went through, um, [COUGH] um, the Vietnam war and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we were pacifists then and there was so much of a movement that was against it.  And you just don't have this now, ah, that I think President Bush is getting a mandate and maybe ... you know, who am I to say that he's wrong?
R:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, that's -- that's part of it.  [MN] You know, part of it has to do with how much do you trust that he knows [LAUGH] what he's doing?  Um, and I -- I have no idea. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah, but w- we've seen within the last, um, several months, you know, here people are just going out to have a nice evening for dinner and for dancing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're getting blown up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] You know?  Um, [MN] if all -- if all that a war would do, if it would stop it, but I don't think it will.  Because it only makes [COUGH] [NOISE] other people angrier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, that -- you've got a good point there but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's how they're going to respond if they're angry and if -- yeah, it might not help.
L:  And it seems like, um, [COUGH] it's so simple.  You have a, ah, a person, individuals that say, "I know I can, um, take out at least forty or fifty people on a bus or that, and it's okay that I give my life".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that -- this is the difficult thing for me to understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This martyrism that --
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  -- they claim to have.
R:  -- once you have people who are not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- afraid to die, then that's -- that's it.  That pretty much [inaudible] out for any kind of --
L:  Well, the American military, they're not afraid to die either, you know?  But at least there's -- you know, they're going through a process.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  But I don't think they have the attitude that -- I mean, what's different is that the terrorists have the attitude that they're not afraid to die and they don't care who they take with them.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I think the military does care who they take with them.
L:  Oh, sure, sure.  [MN] But I really feel that we should see, you know, l- like make it, like -- I imagine it is like a chess game or whatever you want to call it, you know.  Um, [MN] see exactly what happens, um, you know, with this, um, investigation that they are doing in Iraq.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I- I'm curious to see how it'll go.  I'm actually surprised at -- you know, I've seen that there are quite a few --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- protests, but they seem to be really limited in number, ah, in the number of people that show up.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Which is kind of interesting.
L:  Definitely.  [NOISE] Because, um, of, I think, what happened now of n- [COUGH] of nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's really hard to, um, you know, separate, um, the groups.
R:  Right.
L:  Um [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, th- -- you're right, that's a big part of it.  That that i- -- the entire Middle East is being lumped into one group, I think.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I think a lot of people probably think that, you know, taking care of things in Iraq is going to take of [MN] all the other problems.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  If -- if it does [LAUGH] I'm for it then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm older and --
R:  Though I don't think it will.
L:  You know, I'm older now and, um, I have a lot of sadness, you know, all throughout the years.  Um, [COUGH] you always look towards, um, your country to be peaceful and to be fair.  And so many times they're not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we're [NOISE] cheating children out of a decent education.  We're making it so difficult for, um, homeless people.  We're making it difficult for people that enjoyed, you know, at least having, you know, jobs and a home.  And every time you turn around, it's so sad, you know?  This one's going out of business and that one's going out of business and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [MN] it's hard.  It's really difficult on, um, on us Americans [LAUGH] now.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you sound like you're speaking from a lot more experience than I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well, I'm a senior citizen and unfortunately, you know, I, um, have to, um, [MN] depend on, ah, Medicare.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the little bit of savings that I had, um, is dwindling now because our coverage is so poor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so, so very poor.  And what can you say, you know?  I say to myself I'd rather see the younger people, [MN] the schools at least, you know, where we're giving kids a good education, because that's the main thing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  That's a big issue.  Um, ri- right, so back to the Iraq thing though.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, what do you think is -- is actually going to be the outcome of this [inaudible]?
L:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I -- I -- I don't want to [SIGH] -- I -- I have a -- a somewhat belief in my heart that [MN] things will take its place sometime next year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because it's going to take them several, um, [MN] a week or something, you know, to go over all the reports --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [MN] I just feel that we have [MN] enough on the boil with our special militaries and stuff like that, where, um, they may be able to be guided.  Because we're not the only ones involved.  The English are involved.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] The Canadians and [MN] there's so much that they can see, you know, through their reconnaissance and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know what to say about it.  I'm just p- praying that [COUGH] [NOISE] -- I don't think, um -- I -- I -- I think there'll be some -- some type of confrontation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But how -- how that is, we don't really know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're not -- they're not really giving [MN] out all that information.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And in a way, I don't really want to know, you know?  I -- I have trust in, ah, [MN] in -- in our President and, um, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the people that are, um, working, um, [MN] you know, in this.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, let's -- let's hope that, ah, that they know what they're doing.  That's -- that's the only thing we can hope for [LAUGH] I think.
L:  Uh-huh.  But do you think we're going to have a war?
R:  I -- I honestly don't know.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't even know how to -- how to make that judgment.  Um, I have no idea.  I -- I get the feeling that this administration is being much more -- maybe I'm naive, but much more secretive than the last one.  Um, I don't think that we know everything that's going on behind the scenes so I don't -- I -- I don't really feel like I could make a guess as to what's happening or what's going to happen, because --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I just think we -- we know only a fraction of --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- what they have in mind.
L:  And, you know, I think a lot of it is, um, [MN] we just hear, ah, maybe seven to ten words when the President does speak.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, whoever else is -- is talking on the matter.  We only hear a small fraction.
R:  Yes.
L:  And this is -- I'm really annoyed at the darn television.  I try to, you know, read some of, um, [MN] the New York Times ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we have, um, [COUGH] um, oh, what's that, um, program?  It -- it -- it -- they have a decent news hour on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, they have, again, a lot of people coming in and giving their thoughts.  Um, [MN] um, but -- so, I kind of go by what they're saying and [COUGH] th
