L:  Hi, my name's Elvis Wagner.
R:  Hi, this is Denise Best.
L:  Hi, how're you doing?
R:  Pretty well.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, ah, would you like to start the conversation?
L:  Ah, sure, I guess.  So, what do y- what do you think about the arms inspections in Iraq?
R:  Um, what little I do know about it is, it's a -- a pretty -- I wou- it's not a very easy task, to tell you the truth.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Uh, all aspects, um, scientifically, politically, morally.  There's a lot of questions with not a lot of answers, ah, in my opinion.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  I don't know, I -- I mean, A I'm pretty left wing so I think it's very political and I think it's a kind of a -- well, in a lot of ways it's just, ah, the President trying to --
R:  Payback.
L:  -- I don't know, defend the honor of his father for, you know, not finishing the job.  Because he got so much criticism for not, you know, ten years ago actually going in and getting rid of Hussein.  But I don't think that's a -- a good reason to actually invade a country.  But it's kind of bizarre.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, I think it's not a legitimate reason to go.
L:  What- what's that?
R:  I don't think it's a legitim- legitimate reason to go and invade another country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now.  I mean, w- are we just perpetuating the ill feelings that are already --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- present?
L:  Yeah, and, I mean --
R:  And what's in the past has passed.
L:  I'm just very thankful that at least he did go to the United Nations and got the, ah, you know, the Security Council to [MN] you know, the resolution to actually --
R:  Do you think that was just a pony show for the media, or  --
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I -- I think --
R:  -- we're gonna do whatever we're gonna do, no matter what?
L:  It would have been -- I think it would been like a political nightmare to not do that.  I mean, he would've --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- had absolutely no allies whatsoever and so ...
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I -- I mean, I think they were s- the administration were still very disinclined to consult the UN but they -- I think they just realistically realized that, ah, if they didn't it would be political suicide for em, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, I don't know.  And then whether he actually has weapons of mass destruction I'm a little skeptical about.  Um, I mean, if he does then I -- I hope that, you know, the United Nations can actually find them and -- and, you know, get rid of them.  But I'm just, you know, like you were saying, logistically I don't know --
R:  I don't think we have, ah --
L:  -- how feasible that really is.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't.  I don't think we have the backing of even the United Nations, even though it says that, you know, yes, we've g- have permission to do the onsite inspections, but where's the political clout afterwards?
L:  Yeah, well.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Well, and so many things, you know --
R:  Right.  If we find it, wh- what's the next step?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, is there a -- is there a -- in writing and has it been told to the public what -- what we will do, other than we- we're constantly on our, you know, ah, on our toes about when?  You know, like, war is imminent, basically.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, I don't unders- I -- I -- I -- I don't know.  I live in New York so it's -- it's a pretty liberal place, but in the --
R:  Well, I live in -- well, not close -- not far from Washington DC.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, the -- the Mecca of all this [LAUGH] prob- ah --
L:  Yeah, where it's all going down, yeah.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But I -- I just don't -- you know, I don't hear anyone, like, beating the war drums, anyone I ever talk to.  I mean, granted that's because I'm living in Manhattan so it's probably a little different than if I were in, you know, the mid west or somewhere.  But it just doesn't seem like [MN] -- I don't think they have a convincing case anyway to argue to the public, but even if they did, um, th- I don't think they've done it.  And people don't -- people don't seem to be convinced and yet the- there isn't a huge outcry against it.  And I think to a large extent --
R:  I know what you're saying but do you think that that has to do with terrorist attacks that have already been perp- perpetuated against the United States --
L:  Um.
R:  -- and various stories?  So people --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- are kind of, like, hesitant at saying, "No, we don't want war".
L:  Yeah, I think it's th-
R:  'Cause maybe this is gonna be the preemptive --
L:  I think they're willing to accept the government's assertions and stuff more than they were, you know, sixteen months ago.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  But, I mean, I don't see how anyone can equate this with a direct, you know, extension of that because it's like, yeah, it's an entirely different thing.
R:  [MN]  I know.  But th- the less educated would probably make that connection.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And that's --
R:  And that's what they're -- they're, I think, banking on.
L:  Yeah.  And it's incredibly frustrating for me.  Um --
R:  Oh, it is, it is.  I am totally -- I think y- with power you have responsibility.  You have to -- there has to be checks and balances and there has to be some kind of a common sense to its policy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Otherwise, you know, this -- the -- and I'm not sure if I really truly believe he's trying to, you know, honor his father by going back in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there's other venues he could have chosen instead of something so public, you know?
L:  Yeah.  But I do-
R:  They do it all the time.  It's not a matter of that it can't be done.
L:  Yeah.  I don't understand it, I really don't.  And, ah -- and that there isn't more outcry.  It's a -- I mean, also I wonder how much -- I mean, I'm not a conspiracy theorist but, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's also, I mean, in case anyone's forgotten, which is possible because it's never  in the newspaper or on the news but, you know, public enemy number one, Osama bin Laden, apparently is still alive and for some reason -- you know, I wonder if it really is, is a -- you know, to get that -- that whole aspect of it out of the press and, you know, and concentrate everyone's a- attention on -- on, you know --
R:  I th-
L:  -- another public enemy that's --
R:  Mm, I think --
L:  -- that's more salient.
R:  Honestly, I think it's more in the [MN] you know, to -- if -- if it's -- it's just like anything else.  If -- someone in -- in a public place points up to the sky everybody [MN] looks up.
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  You know, kind of deal.
L:  True, true.
R:  And i- in fact what we should be looking at is, like, what's going on at home.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, personally that's what I think.
L:  Yeah, no, I ag-
R:  You know, you can't clean other people's backyards if yours is so messed up, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know it.
R:  You need to [SIGH] --
L:  I -- I agree completely.
R:  -- focus on our policies here at -- domestically. And, you know, I mean, yes, we're part of the world and yes, we need to -- there is a time place for everything [NOISE] but is this really what we want to do, is to have, you know -- th- I mean [MN] what are we going to do as far as -- I mean, it- it's the same pony dance because he's doing it already, um --
L:  Wh- I'm sorry, what did you say?
R:  Th- with Iraq.
L:  Yes.
R:  Th- Saddam Hussein is already doing the same thing he did ten years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nothing has changed.
L:  Very effectively, yeah.
R:  Right, so --
L:  Yeah, and not to -- not of course not to, ah, you know, f- the whole Saddam Hussein administration is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's, you know, it's a horrible administration, I agree, but [SIGH] I don't think that gives us the right just --
R:  Ho-
L:  -- because we're the most powerful country in the world, to -- to go in and dictate our will and our political preferences on a country, you know, on the other side of the world that not coincidentally has a huge --
R:  Has a different dogma than us to begin with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, yeah, different culture, different everything.  But also -- not coincidentally also has a huge amount of oil reserves.  I mean, I -- I --
R:  That's something more you're hitting it round on.
L:  Yeah, that's definitely a consideration.
R:  It's not a humanitarian kind of, you know, "We're trying to rid the wor- world of terrorists and bi- biochemical warfare" because that's untrue.  If that's so then why is Fort Dietrich open, you know?
L:  What's Fort Dietrich?
R:  Wh- well, that's our, ah --
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  You know, we're --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That's the other thing.  It's like, um, they can't have we- weapons of mass destruction because they're Iraq.  I mean, we have more than anyone else.
R:  But we can.
L:  But that's totally fine because that's us, yeah.
R:  And if that's so, well, who's next?  North Korea?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've admitted it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've broken up -- bro- you know, broken all the treaties.  I mean, why -- why not go in there and --
L:  And to India and Pakistan and Israel.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, it's --
R:  In -- ah, exactly.  So, I mean, I don't.  And truly, isn't Iraq one of our bad children to begin with?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Ah, yeah.
R:  I mean, we've put him in power.  We --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  Just like Osama bin Laden.
L:  That's a pretty long list [NOISE] yeah.
R:  Yeah, it is.  I d- I --
L:  I -- I do find that --
R:  I don't think we should be there.
L:  Yeah.  I find it very frustrating also th- and I guess that we were talking about this at the beginning.  I find it very [MN] abhorrent that, ah [NOISE] that the administration is so incredibly cynically connecting this with the war on terrorism, when it really has absolutely nothing to do with it, you know?  And i- without a doubt, if anything it's going to make, you know, terrorist acts against the United States much worse, you know?  But they're --
R:  That- that's exactly my --
L:  To -- to -- to cloak it in a [MN] in the argument that, ah, you know, "This i- this is the war on terrorism" when it has nothing to do with the war on terrorism, except making, you know, the whole thing much worse.  A- an- and such a cynical, you know, abuse of power and then -- then people falling for it, you know?  And people not arguing with it or questioning it because questioning it would be, ah --
R:  Un American.
L:  -- to be not patriotic, yeah.
R:  Right, exactly
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're either -- well, and that was a- already based on [SIGH] what, um, President Bush had put up front, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, you're with us, yeah.
R:  Either you're with us or you're not.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You're them or yo- or -- or you're us.
L:  Yeah, that really --
R:  And that's not a really good --
L:  -- pissed me off, yeah.
R:  -- ideology fo- I mean, it's simple.  It's a -- it's a cute phrase but it's not -- not reality.
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  There's more to it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And there's the implication that, you know, I mean, it's just the -- the, you know, "We know best, you know, just listen to what we say because if you don't we know better than you".  And it's like, you know, "I don't think you're [SIGH] perhaps better informed, perhaps not, but you're definitely not any more intelligent than I am".  So, yeah.
R:  Mm, I don't know.  I just -- it's -- it lends itself to [LAUGH] different political [SIGH] I mean, i- isn't this supposed to be a democracy where we -- I mean, I'm not foolish enough to no- to, ah, to think that we have all the answers, but still yo- it just, I don't know, I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a scary topic, to tell you the truth.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  And I don't know if I'd -- I definitely wouldn't want to be in that position to have to make choices.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [MN] I do want to be informed.
L:  Yeah.  And it's also frightening 'cause at this point they've definitely backed themselves into a corner.  And if they, ah, you know --
R:  How do you think this is going to play itself out?
L:  I don't know, I really don't.  I mean, I'm fascinated.  I was having this discussion last night with a friend and -- and, ah, you know, the Iraqis seem to be playing it really well, so far.  You know, politically they're, you know, they're getting -- you know, they're going along with it, you know, just enough and they're, you know -- and they're agreeing and they just -- to the inspections enough.  And they're complaining about it, which is, you know, understandable, but they're going along with it and they're -- it seems like they're playing along really well and I think, you know --
R:  [SIGH]  So, was it --
L:  -- the world opinion's on their side so I --
R:  W- I -- unfortunately I think you're -- I mean, not unfortunately, but I do think you're correct.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I think Iraq is having a -- has more al- allies in the --
L:  Yeah, and they're playing it very well.
R:  -- what the outcome is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- then we're the big bad wolf here.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  We're the evil American.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just ad- adding gunpowder to the fire over here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, we- we're, I think, increasing our enemies, to tell you the truth.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know how it's going to play out.  It's i- the- you know, they just delivered their forty thousand page document to the UN yesterday and, you know, that's got to buy em, you know, you would think a couple of months of time to -- to decipher that and go through it all.  And so it'll be interesting to see what happens.  I guess we will find out.
R:  Is there going to be also a comparison of what was the last reports too, besides what they're saying now and ...?
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I think so.  That's what the inspectors, I guess, are doing, you know.  And finding out if [MN] what's in the report is actually there.  So ...  I don't know.  It'll be --
R:  [MN]  They're implying, I know, because it [MN] as far as I'm concerned I haven't heard or seen any kind of information from [SIGH] the inspectors.  There hasn't been any forthcoming information from them.  You know, the- other than they've been here, they looked at this and they have grim faces and they leave the pa- the --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, that's the
