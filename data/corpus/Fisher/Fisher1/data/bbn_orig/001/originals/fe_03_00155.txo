R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  I'm Debbie.
R:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Sam.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.  So, we answer the question or ...?
R:  I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first one I've done.
L:  Okay.  This is the first one for me, too.  So, what do you think?
R:  I think that, um, arms inspections in Iraq is a false issue that's being created to draw attention away from other things on, um, the political landscape, uh, and especially so for the -- the recent congressional elections.
L:  Hm, that's interesting.  I haven't, um, caught up on my news too much, so I've only heard a little bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about what's been going on.  But I think it's -- I don't know.  I don't know why we're so con- -- well --
R:  [MN]
L:  We can't really control it.  We have no right to control it.  But, I mean, it is an issue because they could do so much with all of their weapons, I guess --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- which could involve us.  But, uh, it's a tough territory, too.
R:  Well, yeah, I think, uh, touchy subjects are the ones that they -- they picked.  I -- it -- [SIGH] I haven't been reading the news recently either just because it's been making me very sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but it seemed as though they would ask for a certain amount and then at one point Iraq said, "Okay, we're willing to meet your demands" and then all they did was up, um -- was, um, increase -- increased their demands.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I think that it's very contrived and they don't actually have any interest in, um, making the world safer or doing the right thing.  Um, what they're interested in is getting everyone to pay attention to that as an issue rather than to the economy as an issue or to the fact that no one has done anything about, um, what was discovered in the election of two thousand, um, which is -- which was that the, um, voting process is totally corrupt.
L:  Wh- what do you mean by that?  Or -- or how?  Elaborate.
R:  Elaborate on the -- the corrupt voting process?
L:  The -- the voting.
R:  Well, just, um, [SIGH] it w- [SIGH] -- it was sort of bl- -- it was blatantly [NOISE] shown that overseas ballots were sent in after election day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the postmarks changed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, voting sites in heavily black areas were demolished and the, um, people who were supposed to be voting there were not notified.  Some people actually showed up to empty holes in the ground, um, to vote, and they had no idea where to go.  Other people were, um, labelled felons randomly, and they weren't allowed to vote.  There were all -- there were all sorts of different systems that -- that came up when the system, uh -- when the, um, the voting, um, bureaucracy was put under close scrutiny --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for preventing people from voting and, um, skewing the results.  And no one has done anything about that.  I mean, it was a huge issue for a very short time [COUGH] and the Supreme Court decision, um, suggested that voting was an equal protection thing, which implies that no one should be able to vote on machines of different types.  Everyone in the country should vote on a machine --
L:  Equal, yeah.
R:  -- of the same -- o- of the same type.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because some machines are, um, fairer than others and, um, some machines are much better at actually having the vote count as the voter intended it to.  But then there was the attack on New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And since then nobody's really cared about that at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the attack on New York, you know, was obviously incredibly serious and it, um -- but it drew people's attention away from other stuff.  Uh, and the voting thing is just what I think is the biggest.  There are lots of other things that are going on that I'm really --
L:  So, this weapons inspections is just an excuse not to deal with our problems?
R:  -- not happy with.  It's -- it's a way of prolonging it.
L:  Huh?
R:  It's -- well, it's a way of prolonging it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And of, um, continuing the power that has been granted the President.  I mean, he -- he was granted [PAUSE] so much power --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just, um, to -- to go into Afghanistan and take out the Taliban, um, but now that that's over he doesn't want to give that up, his ability to just march in --
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.
R:  -- anywhere with a blank check from Congress.
L:  I think -- yeah --
R:  And so you have to keep your momentum.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's part of it as well.
L:  Yeah, that he couldn't -- he cannot find Osama bin Laden and he doesn't know whether he's dead or alive.
R:  Right, and rather than be viewed as impotent.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I agree with that.  Um, but, yeah, that voting thing is an interesting point that you bring up.  I haven't thought about that really.
R:  Well, it -- I mean, it's just an example.  I think it was mainly to manufacture an issue for the congressional elections.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because if you look at what normally happens when you have a Republican president, you have a Democratic congress, and vice versa.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we don't have that right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that the reason is that the Republican party has been, um, creating this enormous smokescreen by, um, thrusting Iraq in everyone's faces and making it look as though their platform, which includes this whole homeland defense thing, is incredibly, incredibly important, and I don't think Iraq is any more threatening now than it was before.  And I think that if anything [COUGH] if it is more threatening, it's because we have this brand new policy of, um, the war on terrorism and marching in all over the world even more than we did before [NOISE] and just taking out random groups of people.  I mean, if you wanna talk about terrorism, the CIA itself --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- could be considered a terrorist organization.  Um --
L:  Definitely.
R:  But that's the sort of thing, that's the reason why all of these people hate America, is because America is presumptuous enough to just sort of ...
L:  Step in and --
R:  Step in and --
L:  -- think that we're, like, so right about everything.
R:  Right, and -- and decide --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right -- it's this self righteous crap --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that gets people so pissed off at us in the first place.  So, I don't think it's gonna make the situation any better.
L:  Yeah.  I have to say I did not vote in this last election. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I didn't either.
L:  I feel really bad, um, I didn't register in time, so ...
R:  Mm.  I did.  I never got my absentee ballot 'cause I registered to vote in -- in my home state.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and not -- not here at college.
L:  Um, so that last election they never even counted the absentee ballots, right?
R:  I don't think so.  They usually don't unless there --
L:  I mean, and plus the stuff in Florida, I d- -- I mean, I don't, like --
R:  Yeah, well, unless there are enough of them to make a difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If there -- I think they don't bother to count them if there -- unless there are enough of them to, um, change the balance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh ... what was I gonna say? [SIGH] I just -- I don't know.  I think it's a huge mistake, um, and I think that it's reactionist.
L:  To our initial issue about the inspections, weapon inspections, or ...?
R:  No, I think -- I mean, it's not the -- the people that are behind it that are saying, "Let's -- let's put ourselves behind this to create a smokescreen and distract attention from what we should be paying it to" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, are not the only people that support it.  And I think another issue is that it's a very reactionist thing to do, you know.  We were -- we were hit and we were hit very badly, and for the first time in a long time, and, you know, we're just sort of blindly swinging now and people -- people want to have their, um, their re- -- their sense of revenge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- assuaged.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  They wanna -- they wanna be satisfied that, you know, they're getting the people that hate America, and they wanna be satisfied that they're safe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I don't think that this is gonna increase the actual safety, but I think people want to feel as though the nation is doing something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they want to see fighter planes on television and not in the skies over New York.
L:  Hm. [PAUSE] I don't know.  It's a very troubling issue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm always back and forth.  It's kind of depressing at the same time. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- [SIGH] I, um --
L:  More and more I think about, um, I -- I'm definitely not a Republican --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, uh, I -- I feel really sad that I did not vote in the last election and this recent election, um, involving my state. [NOISE]
R:  Involving what?
L:  My state with the, um, with the governor and, um, you know.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Ah, New York.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But not -- not the city.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Not the city.
L:  Just someplace in New York?
R:  Yeah, up -- upstate.
L:  Okay.
R:  Just upstate.
L:  Yeah, we had a recent election and, um, we had a -- we had a governor and our current Governor Tass is, um, excuse my language, a total dick. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, he really doesn't know what he's doing and, I mean, he's -- he's awful.  I mean, I can't -- I could go on and on but I won't, but -- and he was reelected and, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they were, you know -- it -- it's troubling to me 'cause I'm hearing a lot about, um, you know, the Republicans took over Congress now --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Um, and the whole thing with Wellstone -- did you know about Wellstone?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Um, Senator Wells- Wellstone from, I believe it's, uh, Missouri or -- no, Minnesota, um, he was a professor, a well known Democratic senator and, um, I've only heard a little bit about him, but he -- he sounded like a great person, and, um, he was going for his second election, I guess, but he got killed in a plane crash.  And I'm believing it's more of a conspiracy now, like, uh, you know, something's -- somebody had to have been behind it.  His whole family was killed, I believe.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or his -- him and his wife --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and his, um, son or daughter.
R:  That's really, really interesting.
L:  Well, I -- I --
