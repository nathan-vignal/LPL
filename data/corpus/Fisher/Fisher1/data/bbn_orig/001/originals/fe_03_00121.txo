L:  [LIPSMACK]  Hello.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi.
L:  Hi, how're you doing?
R:  Good.  My name is Anna.
L:  Um, my name is Mike.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where're you calling from?
R:  From, ah, Washington [inaudible].
L:  Washington, ah, State or Washington DC?
R:  DC.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  How about you?
L:  Ah, I'm in, um, [LIPSMACK] Malvern, Pennsylvania, which is, ah, outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Near Valley Forge.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, how'd yo- how'd you hear about this, ah, program?
R:  Ah, via email.  I got, um, an email from, ah, I guess the people that are doing the study.  They sent it out to our, ah, linguistics department.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Wh- what department is that?
R:  The linguistics department.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you- you're in -- in linguistics?
R:  Yeah.
L:  At, ah, at a school down there?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah --
L:  Wh- what school's that?
R:  -- here in DC.  Georgetown.
L:  Wh- oh, Georgetown, oh, good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I work for Unisys, ah, Corporation, um, up here in New Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, what kind of corporation is that?
L:  Ah, well, it's a computer company but, um [LIPSMACK] I'm in a group that does, um, speech recognition.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um [LIPSMACK] we do that for, ah -- ah, products related that we sell to phone companies, like voicemail systems and stuff like that.
R:  Wow.
L:  So that's how we got hooked up with, ah, UFP, you know, it's because we, ah, we -- we needed, ah [inaudible] like the ones we're recording right now.
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's --
R:  Well, do you have any, ah, strong opinion on the, ah, on the topic --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um --
R:  -- as , ah, they gave to us?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, I -- I, ah -- I really don't think, um, ah, George Bush can lose at this point.  I mean, you know, even if -- even if Saddam Hussein outsmarts him and, ah, finds a way to get -- keep world opinion from, ah, you know [LIPSMACK] ah, giving us permission to, ah, to -- to disarm him.  Um, you know, like if they come up and they -- they say they have nothing, the inspectors can't find anything.  I think they got him pretty well pinned down anyway.  I don't think he can make any really bad moves without everybody really looking at him and going, "Ugh" you know.  You know what I mean?  It's like --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I think [inaudible] --
L:  You know, if he -- if he reaches and -- and -- and attacks anybody then there'll be, you know -- everybo- it's all re- really well, you know, exposed that he's a bad guy and, ah, you know, then we'll say, "All right, let him have it".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's all pretty carefully orchestrated, right?
L:  Yeah, but -- I don't know.  He s- he seems, you know, that -- that -- they all surprise me.  I mean, Bush surprises me sometimes that, ah, you know, he seems -- he's sort of like Colombo, you know?  He talks kind of -- he sounds kind of dumb but he's -- but he's really pretty shrewd.  But there's, ah --
R:  Yeah.  I think he's manipulative.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  I think this is all, you know -- he's -- he is shrewd in the way, right, that he -- I think he's hell bent on going to war and he's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- figured out a way that he can -- you're right.  No matter what happens, he can go to war and nobody's going to [SIGH] be able to say, you know, that shouldn't have -- he didn't base his -- you know, he didn't rationalize his decision.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I don't think there's really a need to go to war at this point.  Like I say, I think they've got him boxed -- got Saddam Hussein boxed in.  H- h- he can't, you know -- he can't -- he could do something covert but, you know, if it's ever traced back to him then ever- everyone will just agree to let him have it.  But I -- I --
R:  Do you --
L:  I'm concerned now that -- that Bush is going to make a move just to save face, you know?  It's like, "Well, they can't do that to us" you know, "I know they have em in there, we're going to go in and find em".  And that's what worries me.  I think that would --
R:  No.
L:  --be really, really [inaudible].
R:  So you don't think it's going to be resolved without -- without a war?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um.
R:  Or you do?
L:  [MN]  Well, let's see.  I don't think the inspectors are going to find much and I think Bush is going to pissed.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I don't know what's going to happen.  I hope he doesn't go to war but -- but, ah, he'll sure want to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, so, ah, I- I'm very concerned and -- and -- and I'd be disappointed if we did.  I think -- I think if -- if the inspectors don't find anything they should just -- Bush should just lay back and say, "Oh, well, I'll find -- find something else important to go, you know, ah, to go holler about, like the economy or something like that".
R:  Yeah.  No, they were talking on -- on -- on the news this morning.  They were saying, you know, "We've got a Republican, you know, we've got a Republican house, Republican Senate, you know, and how is this going to affect domestic policy now?"  And the interviewer was saying, "What domestic policy?"  [LAUGH]  You know?  We're -- we're focusing so much on what's happening in Iraq, we're focusing on, you know, hunting out terrorists.  I mean, are we really going to focus any attention on -- on domestic issues?  And I really think that we should, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  Ah, I think we're getting ourselves a bad name in the world too.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Th- there was -- there was something on, um [LIPSMACK] in the newspaper, the Philly newspaper, t- this morning tha- that, ah, it was just talking about how -- how bad we're looked upon by all the European countries and stuff, as just being, you know -- we make all the weapons and, you know, we, ah, you know, we- we're in all the wars and we- we're just, ah, you know, very aggressive, war oriented people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- based on -- based on external, ah, you know, observation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  Ah --
R:  And it's weird -- I -- I find it weird that Tony Blair is so, you know, gung ho about jumping on our -- our bandwagon too.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't get that either.
R:  I wish that he were more -- I -- I wish that he were portraying himself as a little bit distant from George Bush.  I don't understand it but I --
L:  Yeah, it makes i- it almost looks like, "Well, if you speak English then you're this type of person" right?
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  So, it pu-  so it kind of, um [LIPSMACK] stereotypes all English speaking people.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, Canada is keeping itself a little bit out of it but I guess --
L:  That's true.
R:  I was talking to some of my European classmates and they were saying that they think that Blair is trying to distance himself from some of the -- some of the anti-immigrant sentiment that's been kind of going around in, um, in France and is kind of being articulated in some other countries.  Ah, like in different elections that just were happening in Austria and stuff, there's some -- some anti-immigrant sentiment that's -- that's kind of becoming, you know, public discourse in -- in some of these countries and that he thinks by -- maybe by -- by showing himself to be affiliated with the US he's trying to distance himself from that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which could be.  But I think it's a strange way to show [LAUGH] that you've got, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- open mindedness, by rushing off to -- to, um, be aggressors, you know?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So, it's weird.  So, have you done a lot of these, ah, calls?
L:  No, it's my first one.
R:  Yeah, mine too.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I guess, ah -- I -- I -- I guess, ah, they just started signed everybody up just this weekend, huh?  Was it like over the weekend or last week --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did you collect your form?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I was frustrated because on the, ah, form it was f- it said, "What state are you in?"  And they didn't give DC in the drop down menu.
L:  Really?  Wow, how about that?
R:  Because it's not really a state, you know, but ...
L:  You're right, right.  Well, it sh- it's supposed to be.  It's supposed to count.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As, ah, I guess -- what'd you put then, Maryland?
R:  I put Virginia.  [LAUGH]  I actually am right across the water from Virginia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I put Washington DC Virginia [LAUGH] as my address.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Kind of strange.
L:  So, you're in a graduate program?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So what -- what -- is it -- you say it's a linguistics degree?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  So, you doing any research?
R:  Yeah.  Right now I'm doing, ah -- the kind of research that I'm doing is more, um, about story telling --
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  -- narratives.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, ah the kind of data that I'm getting are just, you know, um, narratives of personal experience, and kind of analyzing those right now
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, also a little bit of, um, some tactic variation type analysis, looking at, ah, different communities.  One particular community in Maryland, the way that they, ah -- their, you know, regional variety of English uses some interesting ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Is that like a rural community?
R:  Yup.  They're, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  an island community actually, off the coast of Maryland.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  [SIGH]
R:  So, when you do speech recognition you do -- um, are you working with a -- with a specific company, you said, that -- that has voice recognition software?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, we, um [LIPSMACK] we use s- s- some of the major companies and like Nuance and Speechworks.  You've heard of them?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And then, um, we write the applications that, um, telephone companies use for, ah, voice mail and -- and getting, like, content off the web and stuff like that through their telephones.  'Cause the phone companies are really -- they're -- they're hurting for, um, for finding ways to, um, make, ah, their mobile providers, their mobile customers, spend their money.  [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, they're trying to find s- you know, glitzy things to, ah -- that, ah, that users might want like, um, you know, automatic, ah, subscriptions to traffic reports on roads they travel.  And we're just trying to dream up tec- technical solutions to [SIGH] that stuff.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, you know.  But then, um [LIPSMACK] people are using, ah -- you know, the- they want to -- they want the user interface to be speech recognition because a lot of people are -- are using their phones.  You know, walking around with the microphones and all that stuff, the headsets and that kind of thing.
R:  So the idea would be the cell phone caller could just say to, you know, whatever software --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "I want to know about traffic"?
L:  Yeah, read my email, you know, traffic report.  And it says, "Well, you know, what -- what city?"  "Philadelphia".  You know, "What road?"  You know, "I Seventy Six".  "East bound or west bound?"  "East bound".  You know, um, you know, that kind of thing.  "Well, there's a blockage on, you know, near exit twenty two" or something like that.  It reads it to ya, you know.
R:  So, your -- your company would also be trying to figure out, like, ways to -- to take, like, maybe a -- ah, a traffic report and figuring out ways to pass it and ...?
L:  [MN]  No- not that so much as trying to guess what the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what the humans are going to say.
R:  I see, I see.
L:  You know, and try to -- try to let them speak naturally and ask for things.  Like, some of our applications get pretty complex and -- but, ah, capturing, um -- letting people say a whole, ah, like the airline reservation.  You know, "I want to fly from Philadelphia to Chicago, uh, tomorrow, December, ah, tenth, ah --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then -- and then let you say as much of it as -- as you want and then having it come back and ask you for the rest.  Say, "Well, what time do you want to leave?  You didn't say that".  [LAUGH]  Or if you said --
R:  I've got to tell you, I don't like -- do you know the one on American Airlines?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot -- there's a whole number of them out there [inaudible].
R:  American Airlines one makes me angry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?  That --
R:  [LAUGH]  I really hate that one.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK] a lot of em are really bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but some of em are -- you know, the- they- they're getting better.  People are learning more about, you know, the human factor so -- and you know, how to -- how to, um, how to bou- pe- how to -- how to give prompts.  That's a big part of it too, how to give prompts so that peop
