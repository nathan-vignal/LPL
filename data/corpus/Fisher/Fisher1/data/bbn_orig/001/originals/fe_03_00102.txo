L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hey, my name's Jay Brubacker[?].
R:  Oh, my name's Melanie.
L:  How're you doing?
R:  Good.  How're you?
L:  Good.
R:  Can you hear me okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you know how this works exactly?  I mean, how long are we supposed to speak for?
R:  Yeah, I think it's, like, ten minutes and you can stretch it out and say whatever you want.  This is my fourth phone call [LAUGH] and --
L:  Oh, really.  It's my first one I'm kind of [LAUGH].
R:  And I actually had -- I -- I accidentally phoned up for two PIN numbers and they said I could keep both so I [LAUGH] just talked to somebody about reality TV so now I'm, like, complete confused on what I probably already said.  I'll probably say everything twice.  So, that's okay.  It's their fault for giving me two PIN numbers.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  So, where are you calling from?
L:  Um, I go to Georgetown University in Washington DC.
R:  Oh, I just graduated last year.
L:  From Georgetown?
R:  Yup.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Did you get the -- through linguist posting from --
L:  Di- did I do what?
R:  Did you get this number from the posting, I think, Sharon Cariballo[?]?
L:  Yeah, I did, I did.  I --
R:  I did too 'cause I didn't take my name off the list [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, what do you study?  Linguistics?
L:  I'm in the Business School actually.
R:  Oh, you're in the business school.
L:  How about -- were you Business School as well or ...?
R:  I -- no, I was, ah, Linguistics.  I did undergrad and then I sta-
L:  Oh, you were in Linguistics, okay.
R:  Yeah, I stayed a fifth year for the Masters.  And so Sharon Cariballo, I guess, is in both departments.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  She does, um, well, she do- she teaches, like, a linguistics course.  I mean, a computer I think, like, ah, some kind of statistical linguistics.  I don't know what [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So [LAUGH].
L:  So, how does this work exactly?  Do you just speak for, like, ten minutes and they record it?
R:  Yeah, you just talk for ten minutes and then we're supposed to, like, I guess, as much as we can keep to the topic of reality TV.  So, all right.  So, I don't like reality TV but all my friends do and, ah [LAUGH] I know that the kid from Big Brother was from my hi- the kid that won big brother, I don't watch it, but he -- his name is Eddy McGee and he had one leg and he was from my high school, so I was proud that someone from my high school won money.
L:  Yeah, that's impressive.  Wow.
R:  Other than that I don't, um, I don't watch -- I watch the Fifth Wheel dating show once [LAUGH] in a while.
L:  Really?
R:  And it's really bad [LAUGH].
L:  Only things I watch are The Real World, personally.
R:  Oh, no, you're an MTV person? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm an MTV guy so I watch that all the time.  I've never really got into Survivor.  We used to watch, ah [LIPSMACK] Temptation Island actually, my buddies and I, like, two years ago.
R:  Yeah, my friends all used to watch every single one of those shows, like --
L:  We watched every one.  We'd all get together, like fifteen of us, and watch Temptation Island.
R:  Oh, no [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it was --
R:  All of you in, like, Harbin, or something [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  All of us -- it was actually Village V we'd all get together
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was a lot of fun.  But, yeah, I'm actually I think -- I love The Real World and I think it's a great show.
R:  You do?  I --
L:  I think it's, like, so interesting.  I -- it's like so pathetic, I know, but like --
R:  I know.  But [LAUGH]
L:  I just get so into, like, watching these kids and, like, wh- 'cause they get so weird.  They're like my age and being on TV, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know.  I -- I can understand.  Like, my friends a- actually Vill- I was at Village C freshman year, Village C West, and my [LAUGH] my friends would all -- 'cause I had the -- I kind of -- when I went on the dorm tour I remembered there was, like, one big room on -- in Village C and I remembered the number.  So, I was very happy I remembered that number because I wound up getting the big room but it meant that everybody watched TV in my room.
L:  Oh, right [LAUGH].
R:  From the entire floor [LAUGH].  So, everybody loved The Real World and Road Rules and that was like my -- I like -- I like tried to leave the room every time it was on 'cause, you know, I think it was, like overkill.  Like, I didn't like it and then, like, everyone was constantly, like, that was -- that, and Ally McBeal.  Those are my two least favorite things to, like, have people in my room for [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, I understand, like, why someone would like it and -- because, you know, I guess, like, it's all random people that they lump together and you see what they do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there's not, like, a script.
L:  Yeah, I really think the key is, like, if you don't watch the first couple of episodes you're not going to be into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, you really need to know, like, exactly how it started.  If you don't see the first episode and see how everything, like, forms and relationships like that, like you really can't catch on, like, half way through too much.
R:  Yeah.  And th- the -- I don't know if you know, like, which year this is from but the ye- the year that my friends watched was one there was like someone that called themself a lipstick lesbian, and someone named Genesis and somebody that [LAUGH] and some big black guy named, I think, like, no, not Cyrus, something -- no, I don't even know.  But --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  It was like the weirdest mix of people.
L:  Yeah, they always --
R:  Like, some girl from Alaska.  The funniest part for me was there was girl from Alaska --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who had like never done anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- remotely, like, bad.  And then there was, like, this complete, like, rebel who called herself the lisp- lipstick lesbian or something [LAUGH].
L:  The lipstick lesbian.
R:  And the two of those.  I mean, you know, I even -- you know, it was fun to laugh at but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  I would, um -- I -- you know, I, um -- like, that show [MN] it kind of, like, that and Road Rules too, like, I think it just, it kind of falls into the whole MTV, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of culture.
L:  It is.  It's all, like, I mean, kids our age basically like.  I mean fifteen to twenty five or so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just get stuck watching MTV and I always get Road Rules on.  And I always get, like, um, Real World or --
R:  Yeah, like, the Carson Daley link [LAUGH].
L:  I'm a big Carson Daley fan, yeah.
R:  His generation of people [LAUGH].
L:  He's the man.  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]  He's okay.
L:  He's okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  He -- well, he -- you know, he's -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's okay because he's, like, he's not one of the people that's always go- like, has to always talk about music videos, no matter where is like, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Like, he has his own show.  And, you know, like, the other day he had on, god, oh, um, Harvey Keitel.  And he was cool, he could talk to Harvey Keitel.  I like, more, like, gangster movie people.
L:  Gangster movie people.
R:  So, I was impressed with his, like, a- ability to converse with Harvey Keitel [LAUGH] and say something other than, like, "So, what's songs were in [LAUGH] like, your last movie?"
L:  Yeah, Carson -- the thing I like, I read articles on him, he really, like, hates doing, like, TRL or MTV stuff because he's so not into, like, the teeny bopper scene and everything.
R:  Yeah, he seems like he's -- he -- he knows he too old for it so ...
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, he's, like, way past that now.  He really just wants to get out of that scene, like, so badly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I think he has a contract for, like, another year or a couple of years, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  That's good that he's, like, making money though.  He's good, yeah.
L:  Yeah, he -- he's doing fine for himself.  I mean, he's got his town TV show late night now, so ...
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  So, I'm trying to think what other, ah -- um, last -- the last phone call we were tal- talking about -- I never watch The Bachelor or any of those either but ...
L:  Yeah, I really don't -- not too [inaudible].  Like, all the girls around here, like, always watch The Bachelor.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But my -- there's a couple of my groups of friends, like, they always are so into that.
R:  I just think it's so sad for those women that are all like after -- do they even like the guy?  Like, they hadn't seem him before they, like, went to the show.  So, what if they get there and they're like, "Oh my god, I hate this guy [LAUGH] but --"
L:  Yeah, it's so ridiculous.
R:  "-- you know, I want to win".  [LAUGH]  I don't know, it's kinda -- and, um, oh, god, but the show where they make you, like, eat worms, that's like my least favorite.
L:  Oh, what's that called?  Fear Factor?
R:  Fear Factor.
L:  Right.
R:  And, like, they just need to get, like, a really obese person who will just eat anything.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Just like starve the person for a day and be like, "Okay, go on the show".  [LAUGH]  And they would just, like, eat the whole show.
L:  I know.
R:  And they'll win.
L:  I can't believe some of the stuff they do.  It's unbelievable.
R:  It's like, will you eat the worm?  Will you stick your head in a boxful of worms?  Will you [LAUGH] will you go swim with the -- you know, we won't give you enough air but try to do it in, ah --
L:  I know, but I can't --
R:  -- in sixty seconds or less.
L:  Some of the stuff they make them eat is just, like, ridiculous.  I can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- imagine putting that in my body.  [LAUGH]  It's just disgusting.  I'd just throw it all right back up.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  I mean, I think those people are probably people that are either, like, just like thrill seekers or, like, so bored with their life that like, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sticking your head in a vat of shit is like the best thing you could think of [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] I don't know though.  I don't know.  It's -- I mean, I gue- like, um, the person I was talking to last said that she heard that, um, all these shows are going, like, kinda be a thing of the past in a couple of years.  I don't know, I think --
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think it might phase out pretty soon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I really -- I suppose, like, for me personally I can't see myself watching it too much, like, after I'm twenty five or twenty six years old, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, me, you know, I -- I'm, like, unemployed after graduating from Georgetown, so I may have to look into [LAUGH] watching more TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not a good job market.  Good thing you still have another how many years do you --
L:  Uh, no, I'm actually a senior so I have, like, a couple of months.
R:  Oh, god.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  What are you?  Business School, better idea than doing linguistics, so ...
L:  I guess so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm kinda desperate right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, I -- like, Georgetown, I don't know.  Like, are you from somewhere around there?
L:  No, I'm actually from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, I'm from, ah, Long Island.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, yeah, I came back home after Georgetown and they're like, "Oh, you mean you're not going to stay in DC?"  I'm like, "I don't actually like DC that much.  Like, I- it's good for, you know, like government and some other stuff and I kind of am more of like a family person so I want to go home.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And they're like, "Well, what kind of job are you going to get there?"  I'm like, "Well, I don't know".  Like, New York and DC are both kind of big of the s- scale of, like, cities but I think linguistics is the thing that's preventing me from getting a job and not the fact that I went home.  [LAUGH]
L:  You think so, huh?
R:  I don't kn- like, ah, I -- I -- I'm looking for a job in anything.  Like, I'll even do, like, just Spanish or linguistics or, um -- [MN] I'm teaching ESO at night at, like, this -- to, like, illegal immigrants.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Just, like, for a part ti- I have like three part time jobs and tutoring some kid with ADD and [SIGH] I don't know.  I'm just trying to make money but it's very hard.  There was, like -- Georgetown was not helpful at all.  Maybe 'cause the people in linguistics don't really look for jobs and they just try to get PhDs and, like, become a Professor and I don't want to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they were no help at all.
L:  Really?  That sucks.
R:  Yeah.  I -- hopefully, like, if you have, like, a, you know, a degree that's like something people want and maybe the Business School would, you know, help -- give you a boost or, like, you know, at least, like have contacts for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because --
L:  I mean, we have that new recruiting website which is pretty helpful.  I mean, I've applied for lots of jobs and stuff.
R:  That's pretty good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so are you going to try to s- c- like, come back north or are you going to stay in DC?
L:  Um, I think I'm going to stay around DC hopefully.  I mean, I only live in Jersey, which is, like, four hours away.  It's not really that far at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, I -- I come from a really small town in Jersey so, ah, if I went back there, there would be, like, nothing to do.  So, I -- probably I'll stay round here and maybe go to, like, New York or something like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- you know, I'm -- there's probably going to be a lot of people in your same, like -- for me, I felt like I went home and I was the only one that, like, left the area from, like, the whole department.  I'm sure, like, there'll be, like, five million people going every which direction.  Like, staying, going.
L:  Right.
R:  Going west, going north.  But, yeah [LAUGH] I'm sure you'll -- you won't have the same, like, job problem I have.  And maybe, like -- I think the economy will -- can't get worse.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And reality TV --
L:  I was hoping it --
R:  -- says so too.  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm trying to connect it again at the end.  [LAUGH]  The last per- actually we stayed on the topic longer than, like, my other three phone calls.  I had, like, one conversation on illness and the other person's like, "Ah, yeah, I think that's enough on illness".  I'm like, how long do we have to ke- [LAUGH].  No, they --
L:  Yeah, I know.  Ho- how do they monitor how much you speak about it?  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I -- I -- I bet, like, part of the project they want to see, like [LAUGH] how quick we [LAUGH] like, forget about the topic.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, oh, what was I going to say?  So, what kind of other topics have you spoken about, besides that?
R:  Um, let's see.  I -- well, I spoke about this twice.  I did illness and there was one more.  What did I think was the worst habit, and they named, like, smoking, drinking, overeating, a whole bunch of things like that.  And, ah, and I picked smoking and the other person picked gossiping.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  I'm like, okay.  [LAUGH]  That's an interesting choice.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  I guess gossiping could cause cancer, depending on where you're from.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, I'm not the biggest gossip.  We don't really do too much of that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess guys don't really do too much of that but ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  So, I -- I like this project because you get paid and they -- I don't know how many calls I'm going to get, but I signed up for the thing where I could maybe get, like, twenty five of 'em.
L:  Yeah, I did that too, actually.
R:  I'm like, if you want to pay me two hundred and fifty dollars to talk, I'm going to talk on the phone anyway so ...
L:  Yes.  So, how do you get paid, by the way, for this?
R:  I don't know.  I'm just guessing they send you a big fat check right at the end.
L:  You think so, yeah?
R:  I don't know.  I -- a- they -- and it said like you had to put down your social security number, right, if you wanted the money.
L:  Yeah, I saw that.
R:  So I didn't want to do it, and them I'm like, "Argh, no money, no project".  Okay.  [LAUGH]  So, I don't know.  I think this is the best money making scheme ever.
L:  It seems like it.  I'm just like -- I really just hope you get paid.  I wonder how it works, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  I kept thinking, like, if I did bad maybe, like, they would, like, take the money away.
L:  Yeah, I [LAUGH]
