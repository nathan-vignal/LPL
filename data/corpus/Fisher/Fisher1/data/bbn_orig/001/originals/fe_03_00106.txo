L:  Hello, this is Susan.
R:  Hello, this is Ricky calling.  Y- Ah, we're talking about, ah, US policy in Iraq, I believe.
L:  Yes, as regards to arms control.
R:  As to what -- what should -- what the United States should do.  And, ah, I don't know.  I -- I have, ah, strong feelings about it.  I don't know if you do?
L:  Ah, I think they should do inspections for arms to give Iraq every chance to do the right thing.  And hopefully avert war.  [MN]  Um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [PAUSE]  [MN]  I'm wondering if, ah, the inspectors would be able to find weapons of mass destruction, for fear that they've been hidden too well [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they won't be findable.  [MN]  But still, I think the attempt should be made.
R:  Yes, I -- I agree.  Ah, I think we do need to look very carefully.  They've got some intelligence information of various kinds, or they say they do, and I think that -- that's important.  I'm -- I'm just not absolutely sure about the prioritization of Iraq over terrorism and Afghanistan in general.  It seems it came up rather suddenly when we really haven't dealt with the other terrorist aspects of the situation.  It seemed to me that Iraq was unlikely to attack anyone at that point 'cause it would mean suicide.  And we did, ah, we face a lot of danger, I think, from these, ah, these various terrorist organizations, Al Qaeda especially.  You know, the question is that what happens if, ah, we're not successful in finding them?  And what are the -- what are the sort of costs of the war?  [MN]  I think the public need to be sort of better informed on the cost of the war.  They fired, ah, the economics advisor for sa- essentially for saying that it might cost two -- I think it was two trillion dollars or some -- some -- some huge amount anyway for --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- ah, for saying that publicly.  Although they'd been saying it privately.  And it seems that -- so there need to be -- there will need to be a number of sacrifices that, ah, we will have to make in order to be able to afford this.  So, that's, ah, one issue that -- that I'm concerned with.  It seems -- seems to me that the economy is really in a not very good shape.  It seems to be getting worse from what I read about the unemployment this morning.  So, that I'm not sure that I -- I'd like to see so much emphasis on Iraq while our economy and the fate of the forests are sort of getting worse.  And i-
L:  It's is --
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  Ah, it is possible that there is intelligence that can't be made public that, ah, Iraq is closer to doing something reckless than the general public knows about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  I agree that the war would be very costly, perhaps unbearably costly.  Um [PAUSE] --
R:  It seems that we're doing --
L:  Yet --
R:  -- spending a lot of -- w- we're cutting taxes, especially on the higher income brackets, and sort of spending money that inva- spending money fairly wildly on defense which, you know, which may be needed.  But we're also, at the same time, trying to let everyone have their cake and eat it, I guess, ex- except for those programs that are being cut at the lower le- income levels.  I don't know.  The -- the whole business of, ah, you know, th- these people probably know something that, ah, w- we don't but which they can't make public, is a -- is a sort of way of, ah, really getting to do whatever it is you want, ah, and frustrating democracy.  If you say, "Well, we can't tell you what it is but we can tell you that this is what we have to do".  Now, sometimes I agree that it's sometimes necessary to do that.  But, ah,  I'm not sure that I trust our government at this -- at this sta- stage to -- to do that.  And then the question is whether the other powers on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Security Council really are aware of -- of this kind of information.  Whether Britain and, ah, France and so forth have been briefed on it and understand the need.  And apparently, ah, many of them don't seem to be aware of that -- that same situation.  So, in a way, saying, "Okay, you probably have some secret information so we give you essentially a blank check" seems very dangerous.  [PAUSE]
L:  [MN]  Yes --
R:  Uh, maybe --
L:  -- I have to agree with that.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Um.
R:  It's a difficult situation, isn't it?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  It's very difficult for me to make up my mind with any certainty.
R:  [PAUSE]  Yeah, because we don't have all the facts.  And, ah, you know, I -- I -- we don't know if the administration has all the facts either.  We're --
L:  That is true.
R:  -- going to see -- see what they, ah, do with all these reports.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're getting them translated.  They weren't too successful in the past in getting things translated.  They ran short of translators apparently.  That was one of the things that led them to ignore the warnings about the -- September the eleventh and they didn't get to translate --
L:  That is true.
R:  -- the warnings until afterwards.  Then they fired the [MN] group of, ah, Arab -- Arabic trained, ah, translators because they were gay.  Apparently --
L:  [MN]  Oh, they did?
R:  Yes, they fired, ah, at least seven of them, I think, from, ah, Monterey, because they found out that they were gay.  And it seems that being gay is more serious than, ah, this crisis in Iraq.  If that's the one area that we really need it.  It just seems that the priorities are sort of not being set out straight.  [PAUSE]  So, it's a little -- the whole thing is a little scary if we get, sort of, pushed into a war that's g- that's gonna co- be very, very costly because it will affect our -- could affect our standard of living seriously.  And, ah, it seems to be because we've got some very hawk like people in the administration, who are more successful at persuading the President than Powell and others, who are somewhat more cautious about the rushing into things.
L:  [MN]  If, um, there is a strike against Iraq, do you worry about retaliation?
R:  Uh, yes, I do, because [MN] I mean, imagine that you're a -- a tyrant, a sadistic tyrant in Iraq and you -- you have some germ weapons or whatever it is, you may not want to use them because, ah, the retaliation would be so, ah, severe that, ah, you'd be committing suicide.  But on the other hand, if you're attacked and they're going to kill you anyway, that's the time when you -- you use anything you've got.  And, ah, that's a little scary because that's when you reach o -- the -- a country like that may reach out to various terrorist groups and say, "Look, ah, we may not agree on everything but we're all Muslim and, ah, we- we'll give you these, ah, germ weapons or whatever it is and, ah, you do what you can with them.  Put em on a plane, on a plane somewhere, or [MN] in someone's baggage" [MN] and so forth and, ah -- you know, Kennedy Airport or Chica- O'Hare.  And, you know, the whole prospect is -- is rather scary.  I mean, it's a situation anyone would be in if -- if you're life is really threatened you'll use anything you'll ge- you've got, right?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  That's very likely to happen.  Um ...
R:  It's not likely he would use it to initiate a conflict.  If no one was -- no one was threatening you, you, ah, you'd prob- you wouldn't even want to -- to do it even on a neighboring country.  Israel might be an obvious target because the retali- they w- the retaliation prospects will be pretty straightforward.
L:  Um, still, using biologicals on a nearby country could be dangerous because the disease could spread in unpredictable ways.  Not necessarily rapidly, but in ways that we can't predict or expect.
R:  It could very easily.  I -- I'm think- imagine if someone, a suicide type carrying, ah, simply some microbes and, ah, flying to New York.  And he could get through all the security systems, I would think, with -- there isn't a system for detecting microbes, as far as I know.
L:  No, not to my knowledge.
R:  A- and then, ah, simply dump them in, ah, the water supply.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Or walking all around town sneezing everywhere.
R:  Yeah, well that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- would be a lesser [LAUGH] -- that could also work, assuming that it could spread.  But those things are -- are not that hard to e- envisage and very hard to prevent.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  We've been walking into this kind of situation for a while.  [PAUSE]  It seems that it's hard to -- because we've taken such a strong position protecting Israel, and I think Israel is a country that's worth protecting in a sense.  But we've taken such a strong [inaudible] to the major disadvantage to the Arabs that the -- a lot of people in the Muslim world all over the place are sympathetic.  Even though th- they may not care for, ah, Saddam.  [PAUSE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I feel that democracy needs to be protected, much as it needed to be protected in the nineteen thirties in Europe and around the world.
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, we may be out of time.
R:  Yeah, that's -- ah, wh- what do you mean by it should be protected?  Ah, were you thinking of a particular situation?
L:  I've been reading about World War Two history
