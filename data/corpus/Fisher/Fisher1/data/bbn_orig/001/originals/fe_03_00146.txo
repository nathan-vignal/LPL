R:  Hi, my name is Robert Felty.  I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan.
L:  Oh, hi, Robert.  I'm Sharon Bodie and I teach English as a Second Language at, ah, the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah.  I have a very g- good friend at the University of Michigan though.  Um, one of my former students from a year ago.  So, I imagine you're pretty cold these days?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN] Um, I would imagine [LAUGH] it's about the same in Pennsylvania though.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know.  I always think of Michigan as very snowy.  [MN] Anyway, I guess our topic is about Iraq, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  And I haven't really talked with anyone about this topic, although I've been [MN] listening to the news and watching programs on television.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, do you have any, um, background in this area?
R:  [MN] Um, not -- not any expertise, just, ah, what I hear on the news.  I get most of my news from NPR.
L:  Yeah, so do I [LAUGH] as a matter of fact.
R:  [MN]
L:  NPR in the morning and, ah -- and then, ah, I usually read the New York Times on the web.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm fairly depressed about the whole situation.  I was at a march in Washington in, um, [MN] at the end of October [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, basically protesting any possibility of going to war with Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess that's my sort of baseline.  Um, I don't think that the United States should be declaring war on another country.  And even though I understand and probably agree with the danger that Hussein represents, I -- I strongly disagree with our government at the moment.  Do you have any particular background or feeling about that?
R:  I would basically agree with that. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  The, ah e- -- what I don't understand is now they're doing weapons inspections and they've got the twelve thousand page document and -- and they haven't really read it yet, but w- we -- you know, they say that they don't have anything but Bush and his administration are -- are still skeptical.
L:  Yeah.  I think that, you know, it's really, ah, arrogant to say that it doesn't matter what it says or, you know, i- it's up to them to prove that -- that we're wrong instead of us pr- proving that we have something.  Um, I think if we have evidence then that should be shared with whoever else is going to be, um, in a coalition with us and that it shouldn't be so mysterious.  I mean, there's either evidence or there's no evidence. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, to put it, ah, in the way that -- that I hear the Bush administration putting it, it -- it sounds like, you know, we -- we just want to g- -- to, ah, to go to war and it -- and, ah, doesn't matter if anyone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- agrees with us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I find that v- -- a very, um, [MN] I don't know, dangerous and arrogant and I hope -- I -- what I don't really understand is why there isn't more objection from most people.  I'm not -- I'm not really sure, um, why more people aren't protesting.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I don't know.  A- a- apparently the -- the polls seem to se- -- say that most people are, or at least more than fifty percent of the -- the populous is in favor of it.  But the people that I talk to don't seem to be and that's -- you know, obviously the academic community is somewhat generally pretty liberal so you would expect that, but I also, ah -- I am, ah, an assistant scout master with a boy scout troop and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when I go camping with all of those guys most of the dads are, you know, construction workers or whatever, you know, working class people, and they -- they all think it's crazy too.  They're [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I'm happy to hear that.
R:  They're not saying, "Hey, let's bomb the -- yeah.  [MN]
L:  I'm really happy to hear that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just spent, um, Thanksgiving with [MN] my dad, who lives, ah -- and my stepmother who live in Texas.  And they've always been very conservative and unprogressive, in my mind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I was really reluctant even to, um, raise the topic.  I -- I really didn't raise the topic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I just feel that [LAUGH] -- that they're part of the group that says, "Whatever the President thinks is right is right".  And -- and I just -- and of course they're from Texas so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and they're Republicans [LAUGH] so I just didn't think it was a valuable conversation to try to have.  But I do know it was very reassuring when I was in Washington for the march that the people that were there, th- the Saturday that, ah, I was there, just seemed to be so much like me, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  M- more or less my age, which is late fifties and [MN] you know, and -- and not really very young radical looking people at all.  There were lots of children. [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Lots and lots of families.  [MN] And I thought that was really wonderful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so I hope it continues.  I know that some more actions are planned, um, [LIPSMACK] around the, I don't know, seventeenth or eighteenth of December.  I forgot what that date i- -- represents.  And then again Martin Luther King holiday is a kind of target date for some more, um, gatherings, I think, in January.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy about that part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I just hope it keeps building because I don't want to be from a country that just unilaterally declares [LAUGH] war on another country.
R:  Right.
L:  And of course I'm very skeptical about Bush from the beginning.  I -- I'm just really skeptical about his motivation for the -- the declaration against Iraq.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it seems -- you know, the weird thing, the -- I was just listening to NPR tonight and they had someone on who has written a book about the war in Iraq.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Or -- or the -- you know, the ...  A- and -- but the fact that we've been talking about it so long that you can write a book on it [LAUGH] is just crazy, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.  I -- I -- I do [PAUSE] feel, I guess, that y- -- ah, that you would have wanted someone to stop Hitler in nineteen thirty or thirty two or thirty three --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as opposed to nineteen forty five.  And so there's that -- that kind of argument does affect me, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I remember being in Hawaii in the sixties and seeing all of the young men go through on their way to Vietnam and -- and, um, I guess I was pretty conservative at that time and thought that we were doing a good thing there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] which I don't think anymore, I guess.  So, I -- I think it's a confusing area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- I really think that just, ah, without evidence and with- without support it's just not the right thing to do.
R:  Yeah.  At least with the Vietnam war and the Persian Gulf war there was some kind of, um, you know, conflict or ... you know?
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  But they ha- -- Iraq hasn't even done anything.
L:  No.
R:  They haven't invaded anyone or --
L:  It's been, what --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- eleven years or twelve years?  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] -- and they haven't done anything except, you know, not follow our instructions, more or less.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  I suppose that I want the United Nations to be the forum really.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it makes sense that -- th- that's what it's set up for.
L:  [MN] Well, that's at least my feeling about what it's set up for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know that most of the time the Republican leadership has, ah, really seen it in a very negative way and so I can't really think that this administration [MN] will make a difference in that thinking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I've read, I -- I don't remember where, that Colin Powell was instrumental in getting Bush to at least make the speech to the United Nations and -- and take them into account to the extent that he has.  But I think Colin Powell, from what I've read, is not really very -- [LAUGH] very widely supported in this administration.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, that he's, um, [MN] sort of constantly at -- at odds with the other advisors, um, [LIPSMACK] like Cheney and, um, [LIPSMACK] who's the Secretary of Defense?
R:  Um, Rumsfeld.
L:  Yeah, Rumsfeld.  So, um, so Powell seems to be like a -- a much more statesman like person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't know if that's true or not but I -- I have read from time to time about the disagreements in the advising about the approach to Afghanistan a year ago and to, ah, to Iraq now.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it's interesting.  Powell does seem to be a pretty level headed guy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for the most part.  He's definitely a lot better spoken than most of the, ah -- the rest of the administration. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think -- [LAUGH] that's my bias too.  Um, what do you study?
R:  I study, ah, linguistics.
L:  Oh, that's my background too.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Applied linguistics anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I do Germany mostly.
L:  Do you?  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, you're at the home of the linguistics, all the -- all the parents and grandparents of linguistics seem to have been connected with Michigan.
R:  A lot of them did, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's h- -- really hard to be someone whose whole life has been devoted to [MN] communication and bringing people together t- t- to communicate with one another, which mine has been as a teacher --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and as an ESL teacher, um, and then to -- to see the American government be so arrogant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, my -- my whole life has been spent respecting other people's cultures and belief systems and languages and stuff and -- and then -- and then to -- to have this be the -- the government that's representing us is -- is really hard for me.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] Well, who knows what'll happen in two years? [LAUGH]
L:  Right. Y- -- who knows what will happen in two years.  But how many people, you know, could die --
R:  Wi- within two years, yeah.
L:  I- in the meantime I just -- I just have to think that we can make a difference in -- in protesting and bringing more light on to the act-
