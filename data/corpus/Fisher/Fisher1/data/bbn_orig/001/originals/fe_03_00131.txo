L:  Hi, my name is Gina.
R:  Hi, my name is Erin.  [NOISE] [MN] Ah, go ahead.  [LAUGH]  You can go first.
L:  So, is this your first call?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mine too, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, let's see.  Ah, arms in Iraq and all that fun stuff.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, what do you think?  Do you think they're hiding, ah, weapons right now?
R:  Um, [SIGH] yes.  I -- I do think they're hiding.  Um, generally I think that, ah, we have ulterior motives [SIGH] in -- in our policy about Iraq right now.  I mean, I really don't even think it's about weapons at all.  I think it's like a personal vendetta.
L:  Well, as they said after all, "This is the man who tried to kill my dad".
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  I mean, that's like the most unprofessional, ah --
L:  But it's nice to b- -- to hear it said.  Let's be honest, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I'd rather he said it.
R:  Right.
L:  Then we all know.
R:  Right, exactly.  That's true.
L:  You know, it- -- at least he's up front.
R:  That's true.
L:  You could hardly blame him.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right
L:  You know.
R:  But it's, you know, you'd hope he'd have a little [SIGH] less, ah, emotional involvement.  I -- I -- I just feel like -- I don't -- I don't feel like we're getting the whole truth of what's going on and I -- I, um, I feel like we're getting yanked around by the press.
L:  Oh, I don't think either side ever tells you the whole truth.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  I mean, government as a -- as a general rule never tells the populous everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a -- a friend who's husband is working for the military right now.  He's in charge, or he's going to be in charge of the briefings for that area.
R:  Huh.
L:  In the war room.  And she says he -- she comes home and she finds a note on the cabinet that says, you know, "Ah, I'm leaving, I'll be back in a few weeks".  And she --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- won't hear one word.  And when he comes back he can't say anything.  I mean, her own husband --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- not a word.  But, you know, she's -- she says, "Well, I -- I guess he needs to go.  Um, [LAUGH] you cross your fingers and you hope it was necessary".
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  So ...
R:  I -- [MN] I was listening to MPR today and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was listening to, um, Kofi Annan, telling a -- telling -- um, saying, you know, "I hope that everyone can let us -- let the officers do their job and, um, let the inspectors go thoroughly through everything".  And [MN] I think he's really [LIPSMACK] -- I really respect him a lot.  Um, when I listen to him talk I feel like he's, um, he's kind of an even keel, you know?  Um, [SIGH] th- -- I -- I think the inspections -- I mean, I don't think -- I'm not sure it will work.  [LAUGH] I don't think we'll find any- -- I don't think they'll find anything.
L:  They ha- -- the- there's so much room to hide things.  But at the same time, I mean, I think we've got generally equipment that's probably more technologically advanced than there's.
R:  Right.
L:  So hopefully our sniffing, ah, machines are better than they are at hiding.  But it'd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be nice if they didn't find anything 'cause there wasn't anything.
R:  Right.
L:  I just -- I think either we're not going to find it 'cause they hid it too well, or we're going to find it.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] There's probably something there.
R:  [MN] See --
L:  Especially with all the palaces.
R:  Ah, yeah, I don't think we'll find it.  I mean, I just -- I think that they -- they know where the inspectors are.  There's like seventeen inspectors.  It's like they're -- they know where they are and even if they do the surprise visit like they did the other day, you know, they're gonna -- they're -- they're gonna hide it, you know?
L:  Although some of the sniffing stuff can tell if it's been there within even months.
R:  Huh.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's -- because the stuff has ha- -- the -- a lot of the things they use have half life and the equipment can say, "Well, within the past three months you had this grade of plutonium here --"
R:  Huh.
L:  "-- and we can tell".
R:  Right.
L:  So, although some of that stuff has valid uses.  But, you know, like, ah, there was one plant over there, when they did the inspections the last time, all those years ago, there was a plant that they said they did animal vaccines at.  But when you looked at how much growing medium they had to grow the stuff to make the animal vaccines, a plant of something like five times that size in the United States would have had one tenth of the amount of growing medium.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you start to -- exactly, mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  "And exactly how many vaccine -- you know, how much vaccine do you make?"  "Ah, well, we make this much".  "Ah ha".
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, it -- it doesn't ...
R:  [MN] But if you think about, like, if you reversed the situation.  I mean, [LIPSMACK] we -- we feel like we have the right to judge this country, you know?  I mean, if we were like, "Okay, inspectors are coming here, are we going to show them everything we have?"  There's no way.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  There's no way that we'd show anybody.
L:  But then again, we don't generally run around trying to take over countries that often.
R:  Right.  I mean, I -- I --
L:  I -- we -- we come in when we f- wh- --not always when we have to.  I mean, I think sometimes where places unnecessarily.  But at the same time [SIGH] we don't go, "Let's annex Canada".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, "We like your natural resources, you're ours".
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  So, we're -- if we have a few things we're not telling about, what of it?
R:  Right.  [SIGH] --
L:  I- it's --
R:  I mean, I -- I -- I do think we're right, okay?  [LAUGH] But, um, but I do feel like we don't, ah, we don't have the right to be so assertive.  And I'm not sure where it's going to get us.
L:  Well, most of the UN team this time isn't American.
R:  Yes.
L:  It's only a few.
R:  Yes.
L:  And that's become a problem because the Americans on the team [MN] are cleared and have access to a whole lot of information the rest of the team doesn't, because it's our militaries.  And they're saying, "Do we -- how do we tell people we think they should look somewhere without telling them how we know?"
R:  Huh.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH] Because sometimes our people have access to, say, satellite photos --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that the others aren't allowed to see.  And you can't -- you also can't tell them -- in a way you can't tell them what we know because we don't want anyone to know how much we know, because we use the same satellites to track, say, troop movements and whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's like, [SIGH] "Hey guys, why don't we go to this town?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Come on, come on, tell me you want to".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Why?"  "Ah, ah, I -- I hear the food there is great".
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  "Great, ah, great belly dancers.  Something, I don't know.  Let's --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- let's go that way".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think probably a lot of it -- th- there was some reports that he had sent -- Saddam had sent a lot of this stuff home with people, to houses, to -- to palaces.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  And, you know, you feel really sorry for the women and children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, what happens if little the equivalent of Suzie knocks over the wrong bottle?
R:  Right.  No.  And they have no choice.
L:  Right, absolutely no choice.
R:  I mean, their culture is just -- we can't even imagine how they live.
L:  Well, not even the men have a choice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, let alone the women and children.
R:  Right, right.  And --
L:  And I assume if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if something happens he'll send a payment to the family, but what use is that really?
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  No, it's totally unfair.  I -- I think that it's good that the inspections are going on.  I feel like there's a presence there and they know they're being watched and I [MN] -- but I don't think --
L:  It makes it harder.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It doesn't make it impossible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Now, did you hear his apology to Kuwait this week?
R:  No.
L:  I -- ah, he apolo- -- Saddam apologized to Kuwait for invading, finally.  [SIGH] And his apology basically, in so many words, said, "I'm sorry I did it.  I'm sorry if it caused you any problems but the UN and the United States made me do it".
R:  What?
L:  "Their unfair tactics and policies and their draconian attitude made me invade you, so blame them".
R:  Oh, please. [MN]
L:  And I forget what his position is in the government but the Kuwaiti -- it's like the equivalent of, say, Prime Minister.  His basic response was he wasn't even going to dignify it with a response.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It wasn't even worth replying to.
R:  Right.
L:  But, ah, I mean [MN] ...
R:  It's just -- I don't know.  I mean, I think he's -- he's a horrible person.  I think he has, like [MN] absence of soul, you know?  I --
L:  Pretty close to it, if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not entirely.
R:  Yeah.  I was listening to somebody who interviewed him in the seventies [NOISE] and, um, [LIPSMACK] and she said that his -- he was very polite, civil, and she talked to him for, like, four hours.  Then she said she never saw [NOISE] him display an emotion.
L:  No, of course not.  He's --
R:  No.
L:  He's probably a sociopath.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Which is crazy, that this person has the power --
L:  And his -- they say his son is worse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They say his son is, like, ten times more evil.
R:  I know, I heard that too.
L:  Which is just kind of scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, he's bad but he's -- he's sort of like a sane evil.  And his son, they say, is just ten times more evil and completely [MN] loony tunes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I -- Saddam at least understands, "If I do this, they'll bomb me".
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And -- and sometimes it's worth it [MN] but sometimes it's not.  I mean, he understands a little bit of the game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But his kid doesn't care.
R:  I -- I don't -- I mean, I don't really understand where their technology is at.  I mean this --
L:  Less than ours, no doubt.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, much, much less.  But, um, but they do -- I -- I -- I mean, they're developing things.  They have scientists working on things.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, ah, I mean --
L:  They -- they do have some good scientists.  Some that even went to, say, um, American and English universities.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] You know, back in the old days before Saddam came up and he was the enemy .  And they were allowed to come here and we taught them everything and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sent them back home again so they could build a strong country that would be pro-United States.  Whoops.
R:  Right.  Well, I don't know what we thought we were doing giving anybody weapons though.  Why is that going to make them into a stronger [LAUGH] country?
L:  I don't know.  I think we always hope these countries will fight it out amongst themselves and leave us out of it.
R:  Yeah.  It's like we're so involved at every aspect.  It's like we [NOISE] don't even --
L:  Although Afghanistan, they did a lot of their own fighting, you know?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  During this last little war we spent a lot of time in -- in -- in planes going, "Now, move right two paces".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which was good, I mean, there were much less casualties than you might have expected.  But --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- who knows what they'll be doing in -- in twenty years.
R:  Yeah.  It's all really whether we have an interest or not, an epi- an economic interest.
L:  I don't even think we need their oil, actually.
R:  You know [NOISE] I wish that we would just [MN] step away and be self sufficient.
L:  We don't really need theirs.  I mean --
R:  No.
L:  We -- we -- well, we have -- I mean, we've been trading some of the oil for food with Saddam, but we don't -- I don't think we need as much of the Middle Eastern oil as we think we do.
R:  And that would be our greatest power, if we cut them off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If we said, you know, "We're not interested.  We're not going to trade with you".
L:  No, every time they get new regulations for the cars with the, ah, the gas mileage and, ah --
R:  Yup.
L:  There's the electricity, it just kind of goes by the way side.  No- now, I own a twenty year old car with crappy gas mileage but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  As soon as they -- they price me one in a range I can afford, I'd be happy to switch.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Actually, you know what the government ought to do, is give tax breaks for switching.  "Here's an electric car and your taxes are cut in half for five years".
R:  You know, there was something going on about that.
L:  There were.  There were little ones.  But, I mean, when you're talking about being lower middle class in terms of income, especially in this economy --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And you're talking about a fifteen thousand dollar car --
R:  Yeah, forget it.
L:  -- for someone who's never bought a new car and probably never will --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You go --
R:  Yup.
L:  "Ah, sorry guys, you're going to have to subsidize me a little more --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- than -- than that".
R:  Th- [MN] they don't want us in the electric cars though.  I mean, they want us dependent on, ah, on -- on the gas.
L:  Well, the gas companies do for sure.
R:  I mean, you look -- look at just our heating, how we heat our homes.  I mean, [NOISE] thirty years ago a lot of people heated with wood.
L:  Yes.
R:  And now we're all -- we're switched over [NOISE] to fuel.
L:  Wood's renewable but it does have some, ah -- it does have some environmental issues.
R:  Oh, definitely.  It's -- it's polluting [NOISE] bu
