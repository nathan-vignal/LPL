R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. Ah, I'm Lauren.
R:  Yes, I'm -- I'm -- I beg your pardon?
L:  Ah, my name's Lauren.
R:  +Lauren?
L:  Mhm.
R:  My name's Joan and I live --
L:  Hi, Joan.
R:  -- I live in Tennessee.  Where do you live?
L:  Ah, I live in Philadelphia.
R:  In Ph- -- oh, in Philadelphia.  All right.  Well, we're supposed to discuss what, if anything, the United States should do about Iraq.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think that's our topic.
R:  That is a -- that's a mouthful of a topic and, ah --
L:  It's a big one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, indeed.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what can we do about Iraq?  Um, I've been watching it on the news and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- watching the, ah, arms inspections.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, then, ah, d- -- ah, seeing the reaction on, ah, our side, where they say, "We're just waiting for them to, ah, hide things and make mistakes" and, ah ...
L:  Well, I -- I think part of my concern with the whole thing really is -- I mean, I'm glad that it -- it does seem as though the rest of the world is at least slightly backing us.  I don't think that it's a hundred percent.
R:  No.
L:  And I think to a certain degree Bush just wants a war.  Like, it's almost as though he wants to finish his father's unfinished business. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yes, yes.  Is this what everybody in Philadelphia thinks?  Because that's exactly what my Quaker friend in Philadelphia thinks.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's so funny.
R:  Yes.  I was just talking with her today and, ah, that she's often said that this is simply a -- do you listen to, ah, radio talk shows in Philadelphia?
L:  No, I don't.  I -- actually I'm a student at Penn.
R:  Okay.  And s- -- and this is just a -- a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe this is, ah, j- -- ah, just a common response, thinking that he merely wants to finish what his father started.  Um --
L:  [MN] Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, ah, h- -- what's the attitude down there in Tennessee?
R:  Ah, actually a lot of my friends do not discuss this.  I mean, I don't discuss this with my friends so I kind of inform my own opinion by watching the news and my husband and I talk about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but as -- this is not a general topic of conversation among --
L:  [MN] Oh, really?
R:  -- me and my friends.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  Because, ah, ah, most -- a lot of what I do is in Spanish and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, that's not top priority for them.
L:  Oh, [Spanish phrase].
R:  [Spanish phrase]. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [Spanish phrase]. [LAUGH]
L:  [Spanish phrase].  [LAUGH] How long have you taught?
R:  Oh, how wonderful.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  So, I -- I actually think that [MN] it's a burden for us to feel that we need to regulate the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At the same time, [LIPSMACK] who else is going to do it?  And this man has used his weapons of, ah -- biochemical weapons against his own people and against --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- other people.  [MN] Um, the government has, ah, agreed that the Gulf War participants were gassed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, they probably didn't want to agree that that had happened, ah, because now they have to pay for care.
L:  Right.
R:  But, ah, they have agreed and s- -- when they examined the soldiers that they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do see results that are very similar to the Sa- -- ah, Sar- Sarin.  Remember the --
L:  Um, yeah, Sarin.
R:  +Sarin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [MN] ah, ah, gas --
L:  From Japan.
R:  -- used in Japan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yes he's done it and yes he's got 'em.  And if he's used 'em once he surely will use them again.  They say he cannot -- ah, the only reason he didn't use more of them in the Gulf War is that he couldn't buy the antidote.  He was short on antidote which is -- what's it called?  Atrop- at- atropine?
L:  Yeah, atropine.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- since he has got them and going to use them, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, if he feels like he -- it -- like it would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- benefit him, [LIPSMACK] ah, this changes what relations between countries are and maybe should be.  Um, do we have the right to do this?  Is it morally correct?  [MN] I'm not sure.
L:  Well, [MN] the concern that I have is that what we seem to done -- ah, to have done, at least in the media and partially in, um, you know, from what I h- have heard in, you know, the few speeches that he's given and, you know, Ashcroft has given, um, [MN] they -- they s- -- they're trying to associate what happened with September eleventh with Iraq and, you know --
R:  They're probably two different issues.
L:  They are completely two different issues but they're trying to tie them together in order to sway the public opinion of the country.  And I find that to be kind of insulting [MN] because, you know, I mean, we've all heard who the majority of those, ah, terrorists were.  They wer- -- a lot of them were Saudis.
R:  Yes, they were Saudis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were Saudis, yeah.
L:  You know, an- -- but --
R:  So may- maybe we're fighting the wrong country? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] We are fighting the wrong country, you know, because --
R:  But -- but Saudi Arabia has more oil. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Saudi Arabia we are economically dependent on because of the oil.  And the reality is [LIPSMACK] that we can't fight them and we know it, because we're just too dependent on them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we can't go into Saudi Arabia and blow them away but we can pick a country like Kuwa- -- um, Iraq, where we have past aggressions with them, the leadership is faulty at best and, you know, a- --we can come out looking like, well, at least in --
R:  With -- with -- with looking like what?  Yeah, that's -- [LAUGH] there isn't any real --
L:  I think --
R:  There isn't any real end to that sentence 'cause we'll come out looking like [LAUGH] mud on our face, no matter what.
L:  Exactly.  And I think the rest of the world is sick of us.  I've traveled a lot, I've lived --
R:  But it's easy to be sick of us.  They're not doing it themselves and really if -- if this fellow does complete, ah, successfully a, ah, ah, ah, gassing or -- or -- or diseasing or [LAUGH] whatever he's planning on doing, they know they're next, right?
L:  Mm, I don't know if it was really all that large of a threat.  I mean, I -- it -- it kind of came out of nowhere.  He hadn't threatened us, he hadn't -- he hadn't even been in the news for years.  And, you know, when you really think about what happened with the Gulf War [MN] we went in there and devastated that country and left.  It wasn't like --
R:  Y- yet had we -- had we stayed and helped the Kurds he would not have done that to them but they were down and he could do it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So he did.
L:  We never finished.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've had, um -- a friend of mine was actually in the only tank that was actually hit by enemy fire.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And died or was injured?
L:  [MN] No, he was -- he was badly injured.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But no, he's totally alive. [MN]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, in his point of view is in -- from a lot of people that I've spoken to that were in it, they just feel as though they went in and they didn't really finish anything.  And it's almost the same attitude like --
R:  Well, we n- -- we never do.  It's -- we aren't doing in Afghanistan either.
L:  Right.  And it's just like Vietnam.
R:  It -- yeah.  It's -- at -- at some point I think we back out saying, ah, "We really shouldn't be doing this". [LAUGH]
L:  Either that or it's like, okay, you know, "We've proven that we can k- -- we can -- we can kick your butt and, you know, now we don't have to prove any more".  And the reality is it's -- I mean, if World War Two should have taught us something, you know.  And we -- things were done right on a certain level, you know.  We went in and we won but we rebuilt those countries.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now those countries are, you know, they -- no- not complete democracies but they're definitely a lot closer than the dictatorships that they were, you know.  And they are economically our allies.  Look at Japan and Germany.  I mean, we're tied with Germany completely, you know.  [NOISE] And it worked out to our benefit on both levels.  Whereas, you know, from the Korean war on all we've done is go in, fight for a while and leave.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And it -- there's no victor, you know, there's nothing.  It's just pointless war.  I-
R:  [MN] That  -- and the other point -- th- -- another part of it though [MN] is if there was greater world support for this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it might be easier to browbeat them into, if they're supposed to burn their weapons of mass destruction, to browbeat them into doing it or whatever they're supposed to do with 'em.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because, ah, surely they are not -- it's -- it's not a stable situation.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, ah, [MN] I'm a little worried about what they might do toward Israel.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  I think -- well, I think that's going to be -- that's an issue in general just -- I mean, with -- between the hatred of the Israelis and the hatred towards the United States i- -- I would not want to be in Israel right now [MN] because --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I wouldn't want to be anywhere right now except here.  I've stopped traveling.  I used to travel a lot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yup.
L:  Oh, no, I'm still traveling.
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] Definitely.  Um, I would -- I would get my Italian passport.  I wouldn't give up, obviously, would never give up my American passport but [MN] I would get my -- my grandfather was Italian and I --
R:  Oh, can you have dual?
L:  Uh-huh.  You can have a dual -- dual passport.
R:  Okay.  Do you have to start it when you're, like, thirteen or something or ...?
L:  I don't think so, uh-uh.
R:  You -- you can get it any time?
L:  I'm pretty sure, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  They change the rules every once in a while but I'm pretty sure that it's -- [NOISE] it's fairly flexible, as long as, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- obviously as long as you're not --
R:  Th- -- for some -- for some that have dual [MN] there's a window where you can get it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then if you don't get it in that window of time you can't get your --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  -- point -- point of origin passport.  So, if you want to get it, you might look into it and see if --
L:  Probably depends on what country it is --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- to a certain extent.
R:  Absolutely, because it -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- depends on how they've decided to handle it.
L:  Exactly.  I'm pretty sure Italy's not much of a threat.  [LAUGH]  They can't even get their own stuff together.
R:  Oh, well, no, but there's -- the -- the country that I'm referring to is Ireland.  And there is a window.  And Ireland --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Ireland is not a threat.  So, it doesn't have to do with whether they're a threat, it has to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with reciprocal agreements.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, we'll that would make sense, yeah.  Huh.
R:  Well, anyw --
L:  Yeah, I should look into it.  No, I haven't actu-
R:  Oh, so you -- you want to go to Italy?  Well --
L:  Oh, I've been there.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I've been there.
R:  And ca- -- came back with both knees, I take it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I came back fairly unscarred.
R:  [MN] Well, there it is.  There it is.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I lived in Europe for, um, almost two years.
R:  Oh, did you?  What were you doing?  Were you studying?
L:  Um, or- -- well, no, um, originally I went over I was modeling.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And I was living in London and then, ah, you know, ended up working in Paris and parts of Italy and, um -- I didn't do it for very long and then I just started bar tending actually, in England.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So ...  But you said --
R:  Oh, did y- -- were you an undocumented alien working there?
L:  No, I actually had a work visa but it d- -- it did expire and then I was an [LAUGH] undocumented alien.
R:  There we go.
L:  And I did get thrown out. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yo- you got thrown out?
L:  Well, not really thrown out but when I went to go [MN] and travel in, um -- backpack through Europe ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] They were like, "Do you know your work visa expired, um, oh, I don't know, nine months ago?"
R:  Okay.
L:  And I was like, "Oh, yeah, hm, hm".  [LAUGH] So they said basically you can't come back in so ...
R:  Okay, [inaudible].
L:  [MN] But it wasn't really --
R:  It wasn't too serious [inaudible]?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  It wasn't any big deal.  It wasn't like they were, ah, you know, holding me under arrest or anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] I was [inaudible].
R:  If -- in Switzerland if it runs out and you're caught there you can't come back for twelve years.
L:  I've heard that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've heard that.  [MN] Switzerland's a beautiful country.
R:  Yeah, I -- I l- -- I used to work in Switzerland.
L:  Oh, did you?  So you speak Swiss-German, Swiss-French and Swiss -- Swiss-Italian?
R:  Oh, no, French.  [LAUGH] French, yeah.
L:  Ah, [French phrase].
R:  [French word].
L:  [French phrase].
R:  [French phrase].
L:  [French word].
R:  [French phrase].
