L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Christina.
R:  I'm -- I'm Gee.
L:  Gee, nice to meet you over the phone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so, [LAUGH] do you have any opinion on Iraq?
R:  Well, it's kind of premature, isn't it?
L:  I know.  I -- well, I'm -- I was just trying to think of what I was going to say when they introduced the topic because --
R:  I, ah, I -- I heard a couple of -- of things they left on my answering machine while I was out so I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- knew what the topic was, except that I -- I, you know, erased the messages as soon as I knew --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that much.  And, ah, ah, I thought it was just about invading Iraq.  And I'm not even sure what the purpose of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the invasion is but I -- I have just been totally astonished that there hasn't been more of a general objection to this.  It's like, you know, what -- what right do we have?
L:  Yeah.  It seems [MN] I don't know about the --
R:  No, I don't like what's going on but, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um [MN] I don't know about where you are but where we are there is anti war demonstrations but they're very small.
R:  Oh, you must be in the north east.
L:  Yes, yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How did you guess that?  [LAUGH]
R:  I kn- I know how this world works.
L:  [LAUGH]  And where are you located?  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in the mid west.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, there is -- there's a small --
L:  Yeah, very.
R:  -- a small active, um, community.  But mostly, you know, nobody's just -- nobody's making any noise at all.
L:  Mhm.  Are there [SIGH] a lot of, um, people in the armed forces where you are?
R:  [MN]  No, no.  It's a college town as a matter of fact.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um [LIPSMACK] it's just, you know, it just -- a- th- because I'm old enough to remember the Vietnam war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the sixties and I- I'm astonished at the difference.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Even though there is, um --
R:  Because we've got our eyes open now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Even though there's protest I can't believe that there's not more [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- protest here.  Um, and that could very well be because we have one of the larger contingents [SIGH] that are overseas, the Tenth Mountain Division is, um [NOISE] ah, about -- probably about fifty miles from here they're based out of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, they have a lot of troops over there.  [COUGH]  And I personally know quite a few, um, people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are stationed overseas between Iraq and Afghanistan right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um [SIGH] as far as [MN] the reaction, yes, I- I'm with you in that I'm surprised that more people aren't vocal against it.  Because that -- that was one of my immediate thoughts, and you already said that, is why are we [LAUGH] why are we there?  Um, what -- what do we have to do with it?  Um [LIPSMACK] and I don't feel -- I don't feel right to give [NOISE] a -- a full voiced opinion like, "We shouldn't be over there, we shouldn't be doing anything" because I don't think I'm -- I'm knowledgeable enough about the entire situation.
R:  Yeah.  I guess -- I guess what I think is that if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, the inspectors and the report gives any reason to believe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, you know, anything is going on the way -- the way Bush has been saying, then the United Nations should do something and, yeah, we should support it.
L:  Mhm, s- yeah.
R:  But the United States acting alone, this is the part that I just don't get.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just don't get, you know, how [LAUGH].  I mean, tha- that -- that puts you in the class of an aggressor as far as I'm concerned.  And I -- I have never -- course I'd -- I'm -- I'm not old enough to remember the Spanish American war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really don't know what that -- that one might have been an imperialist war, a full fledged imperialist war.  But in my lifetime [LAUGH] um, you know, i- it's just totally foreign to me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- an- [SIGH] it's scary and I -- and I feel, um, no- not just bad, I feel poor in the fact that I haven't educated myself more about the situation.  But I do know that it -- it does not seem like something a peace- a peacekeeping nation would do, is actually, you know [NOISE] instigate some sort of [SIGH] military action in a country that is, at the moment, not directly -- no- now I say this [LAUGH] -- not directly threatening us with anything.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... [SIGH]
R:  You know, I did -- I -- didn't Congress debate this a couple of months ago?
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.  And I -- I recall that Bush was saying, "Well, it doesn't matter what you're doing because [LAUGH] I'm going to do what I want".  I mean, that's putting it in layman's terms but --
R:  Well, I think he knew -- I think he knew he had the votes --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- which he did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they had a long debate because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would hear it in my car when I was driving around.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  And the people who were speaking against it were saying all, you know, the right things that, you know, everybody should be considering and all of this.  And [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess -- I -- I think maybe the difference is September eleventh, that that just --
L:  Oh, I'm sure.  No, you're --
R:  Although --
L:  I'm sure you're right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think there's any -- any direct -- I don't know of any direct connection between Saddam Hussein and September eleventh but ...
L:  Mhm, yeah.  But it's -- it's not --
R:  And you'd think if there was one they'd have told us about it.
L:  [SIGH]  And even if there is a connection, I don't think that the connection is being made, at least in American minds, the connection is being made between Saddam Hussein and September eleventh in a physical form.  It's the philosophical form of terrorism and that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- connection enough for most people.
R:  I guess.
L:  In other words -- in other words we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- experienced a -- a terrible, terrible [SIGH] event as a nation that was a result of terrorist activity and so [NOISE] we're not going to anymore, you know, stand for anybody who's -- who's posed a threat to the US.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...  [NOISE]  But -- sorry.
R:  Oh, somebody just got up from their nap.
L:  No, somebody's [NOISE] just [LAUGH] got up from a fall on the floor.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's worse.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  But, um, let's see if I can [LAUGH] distract him.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  So, um.  But no, I think that it's just the overall idea of what happened on September eleventh that has given people, maybe people that would have spoken out before, people that might have said something, people that were on the fence are now going to no- either not say anything or support military action because, you know, September eleventh was so drastic.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- you know, personally I just get the feeling that, um, go- that -- that people that would speak out, th- they -- they run a risk of, you know, social ostracism and vilification if they do it in the wrong circles.
L:  Yup.
R:  I mean, much more than -- than I remember it being.  I mean [LIPSMACK] of course I was a lot younger then.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, during the Vietnam war.  But, yeah, you spoke out and people that you didn't give a damn about thought you were terrible.
L:  [NOISE]  Yup.
R:  But, um, I -- was it last year?  Was it just a year ago?  I guess it was.  Um, you know, everybody put -- put, ah, American flags up.
L:  Yup.
R:  And there was a woman in this town who went around telling the shopkeepers that if they had their flags up that she wasn't going to shop there because, you know, the flag waving made her uncomfortable.
L:  Huh.
R:  And they wrote to the newspaper, you know, letters to the editor.  It's a big thing in a small town.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They wrote letters to the editor, ah, describing this activity and -- and giving her name.  And for weeks people wrote letters about what a terrible person she was and she should go to Afghanistan if she didn't like it here.  And, uh, jeeze.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I understood her sentiment, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I personally complained to the grocery store, you know.  After a week I said, you know, "Could we go back to, you know, Elvis Presley and the Beatles as some muzak?  I've had enough of patriotic music --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- it's beginning to get on my nerves".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want to think about something else when I go to the grocery store.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Well, ah, it- definitely there was a [LAUGH] huge outpouring of brand new fresh, you know, Americanism and patriotism and everything that could be red, white and blue.  And again that, you know, leads into the how terrible September eleventh was and the same reason that people now are -- even if it's passively supporting aggression they are, you know [MN].
R:  I guess, I guess.
L:  I think -- I think -- [LAUGH] I think being quiet about it is [SIGH] is a -- is a way of supporting it for some people, you know?
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  I think people have to feel like they have some power and that must be, you know, okay, support the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- support any action against any terrorism and I have a little bit more power then, I'm not so helpless.
L:  Yeah.  Yup, yeah.  And September eleventh made people feel helpless.
R:  Oh, yeah, no doubt about that.
L:  And -- and that, you know -- and so it -- it's [NOISE] reactions against that.  So ...  But [SIGH]  Other- but [LAUGH] -- but for me to say, "We shouldn't be over there doing anything.  We should have nothing to do with it" I'm not quite at that point now.
R:  No, no.  I think -- I mean, it's -- I think it's the United Nations.  And I don't -- I don't have any reason at this point to think that anything's rigged with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:   Either way, you know?  If they find that there's a problem then, yeah, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- a multinational force should -- should go in and solve the problem.  But i- if that means [LAUGH] you know, you can't go taking out the heads of state in other countries.  This is just, you know, this is against international law.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't do that.
L:  Well, um [SIGH] the only thing I can say to that though is that [NOISE] I've done enough study to hear the -- the overall ineffectiveness of the United Nations and the lack of power and the lack of [SIGH] the lack of unity as far as any governing that they do, that -- that to say, you know, "Let the United Nations take care of it" doesn't hold a lot of water.  [LAUGH]  And --
R:  Well, yeah, there've -- there've been problems, that's true.  That's true.
L:  And now --
R:  But I don't know, isn't -- isn't -- isn't -- aren't things working out in Yugoslavia slowly?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, slowly.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I -- like I was saying, I do- [LIPSMACK] I know th- they have power but I also know there's a lot of question of how -- how effective they are.  And so the only thing I could think of, going back to what you say -- what you said about having the US, um, support [NOISE] in any way, the United Nations and what they're doing, maybe the US could become a more supportive -- or find out a way to be more supportive, more a vocal factor in the United Nations so that [SIGH] we are doing our part to make the United Nations strong.  And the fact that
