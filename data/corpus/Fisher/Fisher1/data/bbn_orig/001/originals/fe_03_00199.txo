R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, [LAUGH] I'm Larissa.
R:  I'm Candace.
L:  N- nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, do you wanna start, or should I start?
L:  Um, does it matter?  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess my favorite holiday would have to be Christmas.
R:  I think mine is, too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just like everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] d- did he say why?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Did he ask why?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Why -- d- did he want -- why?
R:  Oh --
L:  Is that what he asked?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Why is it, sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, because I don't know.  It's so easy to get into it, like, the mall and everything, it's all decorated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all the music and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, like, buying stuff.  I like to buy for people instead of -- I'd rather re- -- give than receive, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I like both, but I -- I do enjoy buying stuff, um, and I have a niece and nephew this year so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's kind of fun, to go and get kids' things and go and have Christmas where there -- there are some kids around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then I don't have to take care of 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's nice.  You can give 'em back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.  Um, I think it's -- it's also my favorite and I usually go to my parents' or my sister's house and then, um, the one thing I don't like about it, I have a boyfriend who I've lived with for, like, ten years and we still go to each other's parents.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Or he goes to his parents' and I go to mine, so it's like we've never spent a Christmas together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But this year, um, we're going to for the first time, so we had to tell his parents that he wouldn't be coming home and ...
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know, that's okay.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I figure, you know, at some point we would have to do that anyway, so ...
L:  Yeah, you can alternate.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Huh.
R:  And we went there for Thanksgiving.
L:  Oh, that was nice.
R:  Yeah.  So, that, you know -- where do you go for Christmas?  Do you go to your parents or ...?
L:  Um, yeah, uh, I mean, I go home.  I'm in college right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm gonna go home and, um, my grandmothers are coming down from Minnesota.
R:  Oh, that'll be nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I live in Oklahoma.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in Iowa.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, they're gonna come down, which it'll be interesting --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause they're like polar opposites, so it's like giving -- it's like a movie.  It could be a movie.
R:  Have you -- so you've had Christmas with both of them before?
L:  Yeah, and the --
R:  Does anything bad ever happen?
L:  Well, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they don't -- they don't g- -- th- they're like total extremes.  Like one's a total introvert and one's an extrovert.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, the ex, she's so opinionated, and the other one, like, you cannot -- she won't say what she's thinking or anything.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  It's kind of hard to probably try and please both of 'em.
L:  Yes, and they're just --
R:  Or to make sure they're both having a good time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, and then it -- they're, like, extreme when they're together 'cause they don't really -- I mean, they're just civil to each other, not like buddy buddy, you know.
R:  But have they ev- -- have they ever kind of ruined the holiday?  I mean, at Christmas --
L:  They've never ruined it.
R:  -- you think everybody tries to be on their best behavior and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just enjoy it and relax and have a good time.
L:  Yeah.  They've never ruined it, but, um, they've -- they don't, like, at each other's throats, not like -- like a all out fight --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but just, um, [LAUGH] it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's funny when you look back at it now [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it will be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's just -- it's so extreme.  Like, my parents are normal [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's amazing, so --
R:  Um --
L:  Christmas is interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  My boyfriend's family, like, his parents are very normal and, like, out of all their siblings, his parents' siblings, they all have girls and then my boyfriend's parents have two boys.  And, um, so Adam's two aunts, one who is, um, from the fa- -- his father's side and one's from his mother's side, have never gotten along.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they always kind of have this weird competition at Christmas specifically about who gets the other kids' girls better presents.  And it was always kind of like this unspoken thing and -- but it became just so stressful for everybody because it was so obvious as they were opening it up, you know, commenting, "Oh, well, so and so probably wouldn't wear something like that" or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And one time they actually got in a fistfight --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- over who gave better presents or not.  And so, like, every Christmas, you know, everybody kind of jokes about that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they've never had both of 'em for Christmas at the same time since then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can -- I can imagine. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that's -- I mean, that's the only family I've heard of ever doing that, but it's just kind of amazing.
L:  It's -- actually, it's comical.  I mean, it's --
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, they're this very, I mean, um, you know, upper class family.  They're not like, you know --
L:  White trash. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so it's even, you know, they're buying, you know, really nice gifts and they have this beautiful Christmas and everything, and yet these two women just can't [SIGH], you know [NOISE], get into the spirit enough to not be punching each other. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  That's -- that's -- it's kind of funny. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is kind of funny.
L:  I mean, it's sad that it has to come to that, but ... wow.
R:  Yeah.  It's always a good story to tell.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  What -- do you have a least favorite holiday?
L:  Um, not really.  I mean, I would say Valentine's Day, but, I mean, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not really -- it's not really.  That's usually what everybody says.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess Saint Patrick's Day 'cause it really isn't like -- I'm not I- Irish or anything.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  And that's just kind of an excuse for people to go out and --
L:  Get drunk.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which, I mean, I've done, but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] There's nothing wrong with that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right, exactly.  Yeah.
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  And then they say, well, if we could create our own holiday?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't -- I have to think about that.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Did you -- could you think of anything?
R:  Well, I mean, it would have to be, um -- I'm a total -- this is weird.  I'm, like, a pretty big cat fanatic [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I -- I mean, I wonder if it -- it -- I was thinking in terms like, you know, some sort of like spay neuter holiday. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  They have something like that.
R:  Yeah.  I think they do have a spay neuter day and if, like, we -- if we could make it a holiday and, like, make cards and give people, you know, certificates to go get their pets spayed or neutered.
L:  That would be cute.  I think I heard --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Was that your cat I heard in the background?
R:  Yeah, I have -- yeah, I have a couple in here right now, so ...
L:  Oh, cute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know --
L:  Hm.
R:  I'm not very imaginative, so ...
L:  No, neither am I.  Um, my brain's kinda fried. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], I guess that's a good idea.  I might do like an -- like an animal holiday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would agree with that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they don't get appreciated.
R:  I mean, it seems like we have so many holidays.
L:  Yeah.  Like a pet appreciation day.
R:  That's a good one, yeah.
L:  That would be a good one.
R:  Because we have, like, Mother's Day and Father's Day and whatever, yet you should have a -- we should have a pet day.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  That'd be a good one, yeah.
L:  I used to think that we should have a kids' day, but my mom would always say, "Every day is kids' day". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] May Day is kinda like kids' day, I think, you know, 'cause you get all the candy for no reason other than it's May Day.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I never thought about that.
R:  You know, and you get to run around and, [LIPSMACK] you know, ring people's doorbells and leave a bunch of candy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all that stuff, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, do you guys do May Day?  I m- -- I guess ...
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, in -- at -- like, in -- at home I did, but not here.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  I -- I -- yeah, I suddenly wondered if that was just kind of like an Iowa thing or what.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think so.  I'm from up north anyway, so, like --
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm kinda close to where you are. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Where do you go to school?
L:  Oklahoma State.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay. [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Okay, well --
L:  Well, I think we answered all the questions.
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, what -- so, for Christmas, have you finished your shopping?
L:  I haven't even started.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.
R:  Do you get stressed out about that?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  I have fun doing it.
R:  Yeah.  It is fun, and it's, you know, sometimes I kinda -- you know, when it's around Thanksgiving and people are already putting up the stuff, at that time I'm always kinda like, "Grr", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but then you just kinda get into it and they decorate our downtown and everything and they have music playing outside and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's kinda nice.
L:  Do you, like -- so, do you enjoy Christmas shopping then?
R:  I do.  And this year I started doing it a little bit early.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I know I'll still have that kinda rush right at the end.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it -- it does --
L:  I always do that.
R:  Does it ever get stressful for you?  I mean, do you ever get -- not stressed out, 'cause you said you didn't, but, um, so many people complain about the commercialism.
L:  Oh, my gosh, Sears commercials and J.C. Penneys.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Those drive me nuts.  I'm like, "If you play one more of those ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and the -- the jingly music that they all have and everything.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I work at the mall, so --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- like, it -- it gets -- it gets pretty stressful --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when people get mad.  They get all irritated.  They get mad that you're -- I mean, you can only ring so fast. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, sure.
L:  Or if you -- you're out of something.  I mean, that's the only thing that I get stressed out about, but usually I do my best shopping if it's, like, last minute --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- down to the line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And then, what do you have, like, after Christmas when you go back to work?  Is it just a ton of people bringing stuff back?
L:  Yeah, returns like mad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or exchanging.
R:  Well, that kinda ruins the Christmas, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The feel of it.
L:  Yeah.  But and then the second that it's over it's like they take down the decorations and everything and that makes me sad.
R:  Right, and then they start doing, yeah, Valentine's Day or whatever.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
R:  But no, I think -- I think a lot of people would also pick Christmas as their favorite holiday.
L:  Yeah, I do, too.
R:  I think that that would be probably pretty normal, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's one of those -- I mean, ever since you were a kid, it's just kinda one of those magical [SIGH] things, you know.
L:  Yes, all the memories.
R:  Yeah.  And I can remember as a kid, you know, I'd actually get up and kinda look outside and see if I could see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Santa and his reindeer.  And, I mean, of course, I don't do that any more --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you still kinda get that anticipation.
L:  Oh, yeah, you get so excited.
R:  You know, and when you wake up, like, in the middle of the night and you're kinda like, oh, it's Christmas Eve --
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's gonna be Christmas soon.
L:  Yeah, h- has Santa come yet and ...
R:  Do you go to -- do you go to church or anything, then, for Christmas?
L:  Yeah, we do.
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you go to a midnight mass type thing or just the day of?
L:  Um, I usually go to a midnight mass.  Like, I'll bring one -- my parents usually don't make it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but one of my brothers or sisters will.
R:  That's nice.
L:  So as you -- yeah.  I -- usually those are fun or they're more, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Christmasy or whatever.
R:  Yeah.  People, I think, are just feeling more generous so it's -- you know, it's kind of nice to go and be with this group of people who are all there for the same reason.
L:  Yeah.  Well, when --
R:  And do you have --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I was gonna say, do you have, like, a special Christmas dinner?  Do you guys do that?
L:  Um, on Christmas Day?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, we do.  We have, like, our little, um -- Christmas Eve we do, like, appetizers and stuff and --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, we'll sit around and open presents and then, um, Christmas Day we have, like, this big [SIGH] Martha Stewart meal that my mom makes, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, do you do all your presents on Christmas Eve?
L:  Um, we do most of them.  We usually --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, we're -- we do 'em different. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I do know -- I mean, I know a lot of people who do 'em on Christmas Eve.
L:  Well, we'll do some -- we'll save some for Christmas Day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause otherwise it's kind of like, "Oh, it's all over".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] But ...
R:  So, have you always done it that way?
L:  No, we haven't.  We used to go to our cousin's house in Minnesota but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then we moved here, so [LIPSMACK] we had to change it up a little bit.
R:  And do you v- invite people from outside of the family to your Christmas?  'Cause I know some people who, like, invite their family and then invite their friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and their friends' people and whatever.
L:  No, we don't.  Do you guys?
R:  No, no.  It's just always like my parents and my sister and her husband and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, his mom comes, [LIPSMACK] who is always kind of awkward to have at Christmas because she's kind of a [LAUGH] born again, I guess.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's a born again Christian, so she's very much into the, "Oh, this is just blessing" and all -- you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Continuously saying stuff like that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and I -- it's kinda nice 'cause she's very -- you know, she does every once in a while kind of remind you, oh, you know, Christ and everything on this day and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time she -- you know, she'll only get the kids like Christian themed presents and stuff [LAUGH] like that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Which is -- I mean, you know, she has a good heart but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  -- sometimes you just wanna say, you know -- [LIPSMACK] just kind of accept Christmas for what it is now --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and kinda get into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I can see that.
R:  Yeah.  But no, we always just have our family and it's usually, you know, less than ten people.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have a small family, then?
R:  Yeah, very -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, ours is, too.
R:  And th- -- what's weird, though, 'cause, like, if I'll go to Adam's then for their Christmas, they have -- they'll have, like, twenty or twenty five people there.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and it's r- -- you know.
L:  Oh, that's so different.
R:  It is very different, and they have this huge -- they have a big -- their thing is Christmas Eve also except they don't open the presents then.  They just have a huge dinner --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that everybody comes to.
L:  Oh, that sounds like fun.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  So, is that where you're -- did you say you were going there this year?  Or you -- are they coming to your ...?
R:  No, they'll do theirs in Illinois and we'll go to my sister's in Iowa.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then we'll probably go to his parents', um, like, within a couple of days after Christmas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I imagine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, and -- you know, they're gonna have to deal with it.  It's kinda like -- it's kinda funny 'cause, you know, once you get married then people expect you to switch off and on for Christmases.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But until you're married it's kind of like, "Oh, well, we want you to come home and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- we want you to come home", so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] I can see that.
R:  You do that, too?
L:  No, I am single, but, I mean, I can see --
