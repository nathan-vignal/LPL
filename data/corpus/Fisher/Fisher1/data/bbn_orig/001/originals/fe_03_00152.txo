R:  Hi.  My name is Sherie.
L:  Hi, Sherie.  My name is Kelly.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Good. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So, our topic today is Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I guess, first of all, I've got a -- I know a little bit, but I really don't watch the news like I should. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  And keep up like I should, so I guess I don't know too much about it.  So, but I'll let you start. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, shall we change the topic?
L:  Um, actually -- are we allowed to do that?
R:  You know what?  I don't know, but, um ... [MN]
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I -- I mean, I know a little bit, and, I mean, I --
R:  Okay.
L:  I wouldn't mind learning about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that's my biggest thing, is I always go, "God, I really should start watching the news and reading the paper and ...". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Especially doing the study. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You never know what pops up.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um, well, I guess -- I mean, well -- well, I guess what I'll start off with is what I do understand about it is, I mean -- actually I just saw on the news last night, I actually did watch it last night, but it was because of the Packers. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, that they had gotten, like, these huge amounts of papers regarding their chemical warfare and all that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, t- -- yeah, twelve hundred pages worth.
L:  Twelve hundred?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, uh, I guess we're reading through it.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, but pretty much -- I mean, what I think of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of this whole thing is obviously it's sort of like a son cleaning up the father's mess.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Uh, you know, uh, from back in the early nineties when we went in, uh, and helped out Kuwait and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we should've taken care of all this --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to begin with.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess I -- like I said, is -- is my ignorance, I guess [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is what I'm talking from, but --
R:  Well, no.  I mean, you know, everyone has their, uh, you know, can things be resolved peacefully?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I don't think these people understand -- understand that.
L:  Right, right.  It's, um, I guess my view of it is, you know, especially after the whole terrorism thing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is we're not as invincible as we think we are. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I guess, although I think that what we've done in the past that -- I guess I kind of think that things that the US government has done in the past may have been what caused some of these problems now.  I -- I mean, that's just from other people's opinions that I've heard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And bits and pieces of things that I've heard on the news.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I mean, ob- obviously I would prefer it to be all peaceful because I really hate to see a lot of innocent people, you know, over there and of our people getting killed.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean anywhere, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  And -- and it's not just, um, the actual deaths --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's the lives that are disrupted.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, hopes and aspirations of the families, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Kids going to school and all of a sudden they can't go to school.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, so --
L:  I think, you know, you lose -- you know, kid -- young kids losing parents and stuff, like happened in nine eleven and ...
R:  Right.
L:  It's -- but I also don't want the threat to be out there for us either. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  And I -- and I think it will.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we can't undo the past.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if we sort of instigated things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't think so much we did.  I think it all -- it also ties back into the Arab Israeli conflict.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  And, uh, as long as -- you know, every time you talk to someone in the Middle East, oh, we like the Americans, we just don't like their government because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they -- you know, they kiss up to Israel.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so that's, I think, what it really stems from.
L:  Okay.
R:  And they view America on the Israeli side, not on the Arab side.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And as long as that exists in their minds, uh, they'll keep attacking.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I guess I don't -- see, I mean, to me, I don't understand any of this stuff, especially when they say it's, you know, well, you know, it's our God telling us to do this, and they all -- it seems like they always blame it on religion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm like, why -- I don't understand why people can't be accepting of others people's religions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I figure as long as you have faith in something, no matter what it is, it's doing good for you [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, uh-huh.
L:  And getting you through your life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And yours isn't the only right one out there, and if you're -- but you -- but what I think is if yours is telling you to hurt other people and kill other people, then that's not really a religion. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  At least, you know, what it -- what I call -- I perceive any religion out there is one about love and of acceptance of other people as opposed to, you know, let's start a war because of religion.  I never understood that concept. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess it goes all the way back to the crusades or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and earlier.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, uh, it is -- it's bizarre.  It's almost unfathomable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, for people here in the west to understand how extreme these views can be and how deep the hatred is.
L:  Right.
R:  Because over there there's people that never knew peace.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's almost a separate economy.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And it keeps them going.  If all of a sudden they got what they wanted, they wouldn't know how to act.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yes, yes.  And actually I'm -- I'm in a class now where we were studying Ghandi.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I mean, the -- the people there worked so -- in India worked so hard to get the British out, and once they did the Hindus and the Muslims started killing each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was almost like they needed someone to hate [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And it was like they worked so hard together to get rid of the British, and when they finally achieved that and became their own independent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nation, it was, like, they hated each other.  And I'm like, well, isn't there any peace there [LAUGH] or anything?
R:  Y- it's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- I think some people can't exist without that --
L:  Well --
R:  -- uh, type of drama.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it even goes back into something, you know, almost as bizarre as going back to, uh, high school or elementary school.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, when, uh, friends are ganging up on someone else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They need -- they need that extra person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to gang up on.
L:  Right.
R:  Or else that little small clique doesn't exist.
L:  Right, right.  I even -- I mean, I even have -- kinda have that going on at work right now, and I'm -- you know, I'm in my -- I'm in my late twenties and I work with people who are, you know, all the way up into their fifties, and they still have that, where they have to have, like, one person in the office --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- that -- that -- and I am -- uh, right now I tend to be the one that's it.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  And then I hired a student worker, and, um, they started picking on her.  And she said, "I'm not taking this" and she left.  And then it all went back to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  And it was, I mean -- and this was -- I even had a student who was you- -- who was, you know, she was, like, fresh out of high school, and she was just telling me that they hired her to tell -- teach me how to -- how to be in -- work in an office and organize and be a manager.  And I'm like, "Excuse me, I've been in the work world for the last ten years" [LAUGH].  You know, I'm not gonna hire someone who's fresh out of high school to teach me that. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, and it was like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she kinda got, you know, another -- like the director's assistant to kinda gang up on me, and it was like, "Wow, you guys just need someone to hate, don't you?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, but, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's -- I mean, so I've been on the end where, God, that's a lot of negative energy to deal with day to day and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't un- -- and I feel sorry for the people who are in that position 'cause it's just emotionally and physically draining on you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  It doesn't make for an efficient, you know, work, you know, office.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Doesn't keep the boss happy.
L:  Right, right.  And even in the world when you look at different situations, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the minority group that's being, you know, hurt or attacked is --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, to just have to live with that every day is just unbelievable.
R:  Mhm.  Do you work for the language center that ...?
L:  No.  No, no, no.  I actually work at a college.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I work at a college and I'm also a student there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So.
R:  So, how -- how are you doing this study?
L:  Um, actually, uh, one of the psychology professors just sent out a general email to the school.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I thought, "Hey, this sounds kinda interesting". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what, you're a -- what -- what are you studying?
L:  Um, I'm going for communications.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, are you in school also?
R:  No, no, I'm a dentist, actually.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so how did you get involved, then?
R:  Um, well, a friend of mine works at the language center.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, uh, needed thirty people to sign up.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, I volunteered.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  So, I've been getting all these messages on the answering machine for, like, three nights in a row, and so I'm finally home because I said, I think, between eight and ten.
L:  Oh, yeah, so did I.  So did I.
R:  And, uh, but I've always been home late.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh, so finally I'm -- I'm caught.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, this is fine.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I was surprised 'cause I signed up late Friday afternoon.  I got my first call Friday night and I've had a call every night since, so ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it's just kinda been -- usually I'm out running around and crazy, but I'm getting ready for finals so I've been home, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so this is study break? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes, this is my study break.  Actually, tonight was my night off, and then I'm gonna start working on my exam tomorrow, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  But tonight I'm veging in front of the TV, so [LAUGH] this is -- this is -- now I'm learning more from this call [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- than watching the sitcoms. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh.
R:  But Mondays are a good night on TV for home and garden television --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- if you're in- into decorating homes.
L:  Yes.  Yes, I --
R:  But --
L:  I watch that once in a while, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get -- like, right now they have a sofa that's on that looks just like my sofa, and, boy, they can make it look so much nicer.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know.  I love the kinda -- I -- I always like that trading spaces a lot, too.
R:  Mhm, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  On TLC.  And I just -- I'm amazed at some of the things they come up with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I tried to talk my mom into doing that with me and she goes, "I hate what they do". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "I don't want them messing up my home". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you could do it yourself.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, so I figure when I -- I -- we just bought a new house so I'm gonna tackle that when I have a break from school. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Oh, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I just, um, bought a new condo, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I am in the process of renovating.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Uh, like with an architect and the whole bit.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  So, I've been carrying round plans thinking what to do, what to do.  I store papers.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm a pack rat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I need a office that's closed in so no one can ragle me about my papers.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  See, I'm laughing because we -- I turned one of the bedrooms in the new house into my office.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you can barely get in the door [LAUGH] with all the stuff piled up in there.  It's the catch all room.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, um, during christmas break is my -- that's my chore, is to get that cleaned up and organized and -- which I really should because it's just kind of piles of stuff everywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when it comes time to do homework I -- I stand in the middle going, "Okay, now where's that stuff?" [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Gosh, it's -- it does take time to organize.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  And, uh, I collect newspaper also.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] So, it -- it's a bizarre habit, you know.  I just think that there might be something that I might need to refer to.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, if that's ...
L:  So, y- you're really into, like, the current affairs and ...?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  All that kind of stuff?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, now, see, you are a good one to learn -- to teach me about this topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.  Shall we get back to Iraq? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, sure, sure. [LAUGH]
R:  So, this -- so, this is being taped?
L:  Um, yeah, we get taped.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's -- and I read the email again today 'cause I was wondering about that because I've had a couple of calls where we've gone off the subject.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it says that you should try to stick to it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so back to Iraq.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  But I really like the hardwood floor that they're showing on HDTV right now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a really nice shade.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  Now, do you think, um -- I mean, I don't know if this is totally on the subject, but do you think people are -- would be more involved in if we went to war or anything now just because of what happened on September eleventh, as opposed to ...?
R:  Well, I don't know if the average American equates Iraq with September eleventh.
L:  Okay.  'Cause, see, what I heard was that the whole reason we're doing this, because I always -- I'll catch, like, a little piece of it and I'll, like, talk to my boyfriend and go, "Now, exactly why is this happening?"
R:  Mhm.
