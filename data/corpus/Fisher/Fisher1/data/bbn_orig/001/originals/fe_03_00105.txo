R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  My name is Kristen Asplen[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Tina Koller[?].
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I haven't -- this is my first call on this system.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine too.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um [LIPSMACK] I am a professor and I am --
L:  Where are you a professor?
R:  Uh, Pittsburgh, at --
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'm relatively liberally minded.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm actually kind of pacifistically minded, so I -- I really [MN] don't believe in, um, [LIPSMACK] a pre emptive strike.  I -- I feel that that's kind of aggression.
L: Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Do you think that Iraq has these weapons of mass destruction that the US claims they don't have and they cla- I'm sorry, the US claims they do have and they claim that they don't have?
R:  Um, I think it's certainly possible.  [MN]
L:  Then, what do you think should be done to disarm them?
R:  I think that the steps that the UN are taking are fine.  I don't know what's going to happen when things come to a head.  [LAUGH]
L:  You mean like when they find it, find some --
R:  We-
L:  -- evidence of --
R:  Oh, actually, probably when Iraq says, "I'm sorry, you can't look here" and -- and -- and -- 'cause I -- I don't think they're ever actually going to find anything.
L:  Ah.
R:  I think Iraq's just gonna say, "No, no, that's it, I'm sorry".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like they did last time, so ...  [LAUGH]  Nah, too close, sorry.
L:  Yeah.  They seem to be very open right now and very cooperative.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is curious.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  A lot of people think they may have, ah, shipped their stuff somewhere else.
L:  Out of the country?
R:  Yeah, so ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  I wouldn't be against that.  I -- I -- I don't agree with [SIGH] going to war without a really good reason and I'm not sure whether this is a good reason right now.
R:  No, me either.
L:  'Cause th- [SIGH] the US claims that they have proof --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which I'm inclined to believe but I haven't seen the proof so I -- I wouldn't want to be in a decision making position on this --
R:  No, and --
L:  -- issue right now.
R:  And even so -- and I understand that [SIGH] it's extremely difficult when you're in the position of can you keep someone from dying or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but personally I don't think that I have the right to kill or attack anyone to keep someone else from maybe -- who might have been dying --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to keep them from dying.  You know what I mean?
L:  No, I'm not sure.  Can you explain that again?
R:  Uh [MN] you know, I don't think I can be the one who can make a decision to say, "Okay, I'm gonna kill you to keep you from killing other people".
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]  If you haven't already killed people, I can't --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- make that decision.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So.
L:  There's the potential, like that movie that- that's out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with, um [LIPSMACK] Tom Cruise.  They -- they arrest potential criminals.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  No- not quite as extreme as the movie is but ...
R:  Well, of course not, yes.  Just bas-
L:  But there's -- there's already evidence that Saddam Hussein is a pretty nasty guy.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I realize this.  And I have great conflict over this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Personal conflict.  But I am [LIPSMACK] generally a pacifist in nature.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and Bush is so [SIGH] kind of gun toting [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gung ho.
L:  Maybe that comes from his Texas upbringing.
R:  Yes, quite possibly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That kind of rankles me.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know -- I -- how to classify myself.  Whether I'm passive or aggressive or passive aggressive.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or what.  I -- I do believe in, um [LIPSMACK] taking action when necessary.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the definition of when necessary is, that's the tough part right there.
R:  Right, absolutely.  These are, of course, very gray areas.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, they are, which is what makes it, um, an interesting topic, I suppose --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for this to discussion.  [LAUGH]
R:  For them to overhear, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  That's right.  [LIPSMACK]  It's a tremendous investment to do something like this.  The last time they went over it -- it -- the victory was so absolute and so quick --
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- that you would hope that a similar --
R:  Or there was -- there was so much help and it was such an impoverished country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There was so much help within the country and it was such an impoverished country that -- and -- and the leadership was so obnoxiously oppressive --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that -- that it was not hard to get world support for it.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  And th- I don't know that the leadership has changed their, um, tactics any --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now.  And except for the [MN] Arabic countries, there's not -- e- even so, there's not quite as much support now as there was then.
R:  Right.
L:  Because they didn't invade another country.  There's --
R:  Right.
L:  There's the threat now --
R:  They're not as directly linked.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Well, technically [MN] you know, that Afghanistan wasn't -- didn't invade us either.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, well, it depends on whether you agree that Al Qaeda came right out of [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Afghanistan.
R:  Right.  If it was directly, kind of a sub part of the government, or how close you believe it was to the government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or all that kind of stuff.  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't have any solutions for disarming Iraq, other than seeing what happens with these weapons inspections and then deciding.
R:  Right, yeah.  I'm very, very glad.  For a while it didn't sound like they were going to be doing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the inspection part.  [LAUGH]  So, I'm -- I'm much happier right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than I was a month ago.  But, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess it was getting a little scary there.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I was wondering what was going to happen too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There was a lot of sword rattling.
R:  Yes, yes, definitely waving the swords.
L:  And kicking dirt and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Name calling and --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- other -- other adult like behavior.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  You- you're really glad that world leaders are -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, right.
L:  -- doing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  But --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I don't know what else we can say about this.
R:  I don't know either.  So, where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in Maryland.
R:  Oh, Maryland.  My in laws are in Maryland, at Baltimore.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, yeah, I don't live to far from Baltimore, in Columbia.
R:  Oh, yes.  [MN]  Actually, is that right by DC?
L:  Ah, it's between Baltimore and DC.
R:  Okay.
L:  Not quite half way.  A little closer to Baltimore than DC.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  But easy to get to both -- both cities.
R:  Yup.  [MN]  My, ah, in laws have lived in several places but right now they're in, ah, let me think [LAUGH] kind of Sparks Parkville area.  I don't know if you know?
L:  No.
R:  The- those are kind of like small communities.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it's, um, [LIPSMACK] south, no, north east of the city.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I'm not as familiar with -- with that --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- area up there.
R:  Yup.
L:  Being -- living s- south of the city.
R:  Yeah, th-
L:  So, a- are you an electrical engineering professor at Pittsburgh?
R:  No, ah, psychology.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, are you already aware of the Ears program and that's why you're participating in this?
R:  I -- I got the information from, um -- [MN] I haven't done this before.  It's from, ah, a linguistics researching --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, ah, information newsletter that I get.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They said that this was available and [SIGH] I always believe it's good karma to participate in all the research I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that other people [LAUGH] participate in mine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  That's why.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  That makes sense.
R:  Yes.
L:  So you're probably either st- coming up on exams or in the middle of finals?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, yeah, I'm giving my first final tonight.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah.
R:  So ...  In fact I have someone studying in my house just right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's like, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So ...
L:  I- I'm an adjunct professor at Morgan State University.
R:  Ah.
L:  I- I'm giving my final for -- I'm only teaching one class, so that's tomorrow night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this is only the second time I've taught a class.
R:  Ah.
L:  It takes a lot to put an -- a good exam together.
R:  Yes, yes, it does.
L:  But I'd still rather be putting it together and giving it, than taking it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  It's -- it's amazing, you know, I- I'll put it together and I'll read it three times and I'll sit down and read it while they're taking it and be like, "Oh, my god, how did I put this question in the test?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yup.
L:  So, you- you're questions are probably more discussion oriented?
R:  Ah, um, I wish it could be.  I have --
L:  Really?
R:  I have very large classes.
L:  [MN]  Oh.
R:  Um.
L:   So then grading something like that would be a nightmare.
R:  Yeah.  I do do one essay, even though all my classes are sixty.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, forty to sixty.  But, ah -- but they're very, kind of, factual essay.  They're not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- terribly mentally complicated.  I do get to, next semester, do a, ah, more advanced course that should have about a dozen people or so in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then I'll get to do a little more discussion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'll be nice
L:  Yeah.  I've only got five students in my class so that does change your attitude about the exam.
R:  Yes, very much so.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  The amount of effort, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You don't have a grader that can help you out with it?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I don't do that for tests.  It's an undergraduate so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's, um -- I don't do that for tests.  I do do, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, multiple choice for most of it so it's, um -- about eighty percent of the test is based on the multiple choice so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it doesn't have to kill me -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- grading.  So ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So my tests are usually mathematical, so th-
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  -- if they don't get the answer you have to figure out why they didn't --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- so you can determine how -- how many points to deduct if they accidentally said three times two is five.
R:  Right.
L:  Then that's only a point or so.  But then you have to work your way through and make sure that they didn't make any other errors in there.
R:  Right.
L:  So that can -- that can be time consuming.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  I did teach statistics once.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, I -- I've gone through those math homeworks [MN] where there's multiple stages and you have to figure which [LAUGH] parts they got right and which ones are more important --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to assign values to all that stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  That's what I found when I last -- I've o- I've o- I only teach in the fall --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so last year when I first started grading I thought, "I've got to be consistent in this".  So I had to start writing down wh- how many points I took off on when --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this student made that mistake.
R:  'Cause if you don't then two best friends will have the same answer and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- come see you and, "Why did he get four and I got five?"
L:  [LAUGH]  "I like him better".
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yup.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]  That would be pretty mean.
R:  Yeah, I don't think that's right.
L:  No, no, you probably don't.
R:  I wonder how much we're supposed to stay on our topic?
L:  [MN]  I was just wondering that too.
R:  [LAUGH]  'Cause I'm like, "How long has this call been?"
L:  Ah, yeah, how long is it supposed to be?  I haven't rea-
R:  I th- I thought it was supposed to be ten minutes.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I don't know how long we've been talking though.
L:  Ah, I've got twelve minutes on my phone.
R:  Ah.
L:  But it probably took a little time to set things up because I had to try --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to find my PIN number.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I- it was in my email.  I had to go find my email.  I was surprised that they didn't hang up on me but  ... [MN]
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  I thought that they cut th- the call off after a little while.
R:  Ah.
L:  After the time is over.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  I don't know.
L:  Ah, wh- what do you want to do?  Keep talking or go ahead and stop?
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know what we're supposed to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Me either.
R:  Let me see if I can [MN] find any pieces of paper I have here.  What do they say?  Oh no, I think I left them at home.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  My -- my email's -- let me see if I have my old emails up here.
L:  Yeah, my don't say anything.
R:  They don't?  [LIPSMACK]  Maybe that's part of the test.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, they just say ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes?  All right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, that's probably been ten minutes.  It was very nice talking to you.
L:  It was nice talking with you too.
R:  All right.
L:  Have a good holiday.
R:  You too.  Have good grading.  Bye bye.
L:  Thanks, bye bye.
