L:  Hi.  This is Jenny.
R:  Hello, this is Heather.
L:  Hi, Heather.  What holiday is your favorite?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know.  Seeing as how Christmas is coming up, I'm pretty excited about that, to be honest.  I'm a college student, so I'm really looking forward to going home and spending time with my family.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I think -- I have a daughter that's a college student, so I --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I -- I can see -- I can relate with you very well. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And as far as making a holiday, that's a tough one.
R:  I think that is difficult.  I was [LAUGH] -- I don't know.  I mean, there's so many insignificant holidays, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  Like remote holidays that I guess people don't even celebrate, so it would be difficult to come up with something original that's worth celebrating. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  There's -- there's [SIGH] so many charitable things that we could make, but I don't know if everybody would cooperate with it.
R:  That's probably true also.
L:  Hm [MN].  Well, [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] Well, I don't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I was reading this thing once and it -- like, um, apparently there's some day in July that's, like, National Ice Cream Hol- -- th- -- like, the National Ice Cream Holiday or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and -- and no one even knows about things like that.  I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's really [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'd never heard of it until I was reading -- I don't know what it was, some magazine or book of tidbits or something like that.  So --
L:  Well, you know, I think, like, some of the more elite, um, card shops --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Don't they have, like, a calendar or something that says --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever particular holiday there is that they know of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That would be interesting just to read that.
R:  It probably would be.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you could use the most ridiculous excuses, "Well, it's a holiday today". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it -- you would come up with all of these crazy things.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So, I -- I don't -- but to create a holiday, um ...
L:  You'd really have to put on your thinking cap.
R:  That's probably true.  I don't --
L:  I mean, they have Grandparent's Day, which is nice.
R:  They do have Grandparent's Day.
L:  But I don't think a whole lot of people participate in that.
R:  Participate in that, no.
L:  I know, like, I have a granddaughter that lives in Overland Park, Kansas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have one day at school where they invite the grandparents to come to have lunch with them and -- and spend half the day with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now, at my local -- where I live --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they don't have that at our school, which is disappointing to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I could make that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's too bad.  But that's neat that they do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've never heard of that before.
L:  Oh, you haven't?
R:  No, I mean, I've heard of Grandparent's Day, but I've never heard of them inviting, like, grandparents to come.
L:  Oh, in school you mean?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, where are you from?
R:  I'm from Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Well, it's -- it's really popular in the Kansas area --
R:  I --
L:  -- I know that.
R:  I see.
L:  And I think some of the public schools in Missouri do it, too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not the Catholic schools as much.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's where my grandparent -- well, one set of grandparents live, but, of course, I've never lived there so --
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it doesn't do me a whole lot of good.
L:  Isn't that -- isn't that funny how different areas of the state have different --
R:  Different things.
L:  -- ways?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause I'm -- I'm going to school actually in the Deep South, which is a lot different than [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- than, you know, when you live in Dallas.  It's -- I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess they say that, you know, Texas is southern.  I think that we should have a Texas day, there you go.
L:  Oh, yeah, you go.
R:  I've noticed something about that.  My school has a lot of n- -- like, native Texans even though it's not in Texas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I've noticed that Texans have an amazing amount of state pride.  I mean -- and I didn't even realize it because I've always lived in Texas until -- until I came to school.  And I didn't even realize how [SIGH] -- just how much it -- it meant to me to be a Texan.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?  Because when you think about -- or even just -- just like a state pride holiday of some sort.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because --
L:  Yeah, there you go.  Let's have -- once a month have a different state celebrate their state.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know ...
R:  Because, I mean, I think there's a lot of interesting things about all the different states in the Union --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that probably you don't know about.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  And Texans probably have a lot of things to be proud of.  I mean, I know, like, we do -- I mean, we have, you know, little cliches of cowboys and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oil millionaires that we're proud of.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But just, you know, the vastness and everything, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think every state does, like you were talking about, have a lot of individual character, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Yeah, there you go.  I think we should [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get something going here.
R:  [LAUGH] We're gonna start writing our Congressmen.
L:  [LAUGH] The only problem is there's only twelve months in a year, so we'd have to --
R:  Unfortunately, that's -- that's true.
L:  -- double it up somehow or whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it would have to be -- it would have to be every, I don't know, four years or something along those lines.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess that would cover forty eight states.  We'll just leave out Hawaii and Alaska --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they're not -- they're not --
L:  Well, I don't think they'd --
R:  -- continental US.
L:  -- they'd be happy about that, though. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe they can have leap year or something.
L:  Well, there you go, yeah.
R:  We'll just -- we'll just slip you in February. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gosh.  Well, it cer- -- it reminds me a little bit of a Christmas tree --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that has lots of ornaments.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And every year the ornaments, you -- they accumulate, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because of memories or whatever.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  So, um, a little story relating to that is this year, uh, I got a very small artificial tree --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to just put on a table because I'm getting too old to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- lug the big old thing up and down the stairs.  And I was talking to my daughter about that, and I said, "Oh", I said, "I don't know if I should be doing this 'cause I've got all these wonderful memories" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "in my ornaments".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she said, "Well, mom", she said, "There's a good way of doing that".  She said, "Just rotate, every year just put different ones on" --
R:  Mm.
L:  "And that way you'll be remembering certain ones one year and certain ones the next year".
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's neat to bring out different ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know for, um, for Thanksgiving, I guess for Thanksgiving we have the Thanksgiving tablecloth at my house.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we have to write something that we're thankful for every year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so that becomes cumulative as we see, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- over the years, like, what -- what it is that matters to different members of the family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's also just something to remember who, you know -- I mean, it's just -- my mom just has, like, fabric markers and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I mean, a cheap tablecloth.  It's nothing special, but just to see who was there and, you know, kind of what -- like, for instance, wh- when we looked back at what happened last year and, you know, a -- a lot of -- like, there was a lot of patriotism in what people said because of, you know, September eleventh and all that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, you know, I mean, I think -- I think holidays are -- because they're kind of a way to step back from reality, they're also kind of like reflective of what's going on, so ...
L:  Well, you know, that's interesting that you do that because that's kind of like a little diary.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, a memory book or whatever when you do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really neat.
R:  It is.  I mean, I don't know, my mom's really great that way.
L:  Well, good.
R:  Of always making the holidays special and -- and things like that, so ...
L:  Oh.  Well, is that kind of a tradition in your family?  I mean, did she do that --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- when she was growing up, too?
R:  Well, it -- it's something that she started in our family.  I mean, so it's not -- it's not terribly old, but, I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because I guess I can remember when she started it, but it seems like a -- a bit back that -- that that happened, so, I mean, it was -- it was enough to create, you know, some kind of interesting contrast [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of as -- as we looked back on it just thinking, "Huh, that's -- that's interesting that we would say that", so ...
L:  Well, and then this is something that you could pass on to your family whenever --
R:  Exactly.
L:  That was neat.
R:  I'm sure that eventually it'll -- [LAUGH] it'll get too full, but not yet, so ...
L:  Well ...
R:  I also -- I was reading something the other day.  It was much along the same lines, but it was, like, it was a scrapbook of Christmas lists, you know, what you want for Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that that's probably similar, you know, because it's -- when you're young especially, that's such a big deal.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  The things that you want.  I mean, 'cause you can remember -- I can even remember things when I was young that I just had to have for Christmas --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that I just had to have.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And everyone has them, and I -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm sure -- looking back on it, I'm sure my parents went through incredible feats to get these gifts because they were --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- probably the toys that everyone wanted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that you couldn't find anywhere and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they were the -- always the things --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that you had discarded by the end of January. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because they were usually not very high quality and full of, like, gimmicky things.  But the commercials must have been really good --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because everyone wanted them that year, so ...
L:  Well, then it also stems usually to the fact, I've noticed with my grandchildren --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can give them the most expensive gift and they really wanted it but thirty minutes later they'll be playing with the boxes.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  You know?
R:  My -- I'm the oldest of -- of -- of five children.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, uh, I know even now my parents say, you know, "Why don't we just wrap up empty boxes?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "And put them under the tree because they wouldn't know the difference".  They just -- on Christmas morning you can't even see the living room floor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because there's wrapping paper and, you know, opened boxes everywhere and everything, but ...
L:  And speaking of Christmas, have you ever done the Chinese Christmas presents?
R:  Oh, those Chinese Christmas present exchanges?
L:  Yes.
R:  My mother throws one of those parties every year.
L:  Does she really?
R:  For her girlfriends, and she has so much fun.  I think that I -- I don't know if she's going to do it this year because she's been having some back problems and she's --
L:  Oh.
R:  But that's -- her friends are going to be so upset.  I haven't -- not being at home, I don't know all of what goes on [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- any more, but I know that in years past, I mean, you know, she -- she would say things like, "Oh, I'm not really sure if I feel up to doing it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all of her friends would call and say, "Please, please".
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Whoops.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I guess that's it, huh?
R:  I don't -- I think that may just be my phone.
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I -- I think someone will come and tell us. [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't even look at the time when we --
R:  [NOISE] Hold on just a second.  I think my phone has a timer.  I don't -- it doesn't look like it's done yet, but --
L:  Okay.  Maybe that was --
R:  But it's -- it's about -- I don't know.
L:  Well, now, for this Chinese thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you have a price limit as to what the guests --
R:  Yeah, I think they thought like a twenty five dollar price limit.
L:  Oh, it was that much?
R:  But -- but they -- these women get vicious about the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- gifts that they want.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and, I mean, you know, th- -- 'cause they go out to dinner beforehand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so it's quite friendly and really casual, and the moment --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that, you know, anything --
L:  Gets --
R:  Like that it -- it becomes -- it's funny because, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they walk in leaving -- like, they walk in laughing and -- and then the gift exchange starts up and -- and they're, you know, giving each other these dirty looks and everything, and then it ends and they're friends again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but during that time where they're doing the gift exchange, it's -- it's heated. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my mom -- my mom always gets mad because she always gets to -- she always gets bad numbers.  I guess it works through, like, drawing numbers?  I don't know exactly how it works.
L:  Well, I've never actually been part of it either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, my sister in law is gonna be hosting one this -- this coming weekend.
R:  Oh, well, prepare yourself. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean, I'm not gonna go.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  It's -- it's for, uh, some of her special friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she was telling me about it and she said what they decided to do was set the limit at five dollars.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Like, you know, that's hard to find something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- decent for five dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And one of the things they're going to do, and it concerns, like you said, that you want a certain gift --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, everybody's gonna bring something little dinky, you know, for five dollars.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Well, they have a turkey.  I mean --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- a regular big turkey.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
