R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]  Um, how do you feel about Iraq?
R:  How do I feel about Iraq?  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I think it's a messy situation.  I don't -- I don't think we [SIGH] should be going to war but I think, ah, it's not something that we can just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sit by and watch unfold.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I feel kind of ambivalent at this point.  What do yo- how about you?
L:  Um, I personally feel really uncomfortable with the idea of bombing the country, um, because we disagree with the leader.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I feel like it's the job that the UN should handle, as opposed to the United States.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I feel like the UN has done an adequate jobs of -- an adequate job of arms inspections in the past.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we should [NOISE] just turn it over to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, um [MN] I've actually, like, not really read a lot about this but I've -- I've had a couple of discussions about it, and it seems like they -- they interviewed, um, an -- an arms inspector from the past who has actually gone and checked and he says that there's really no way that Iraq can have all of the weapons that we think it can have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the rest of the world would have known about it because they would've had to purchase things somewhere and --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  So, I -- I feel really uncomfortable with all this, you know, "We should just go in and, like, dethrone Saddam Hussein" --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because I feel like that's putting us in a position that we don't necessarily want to be in.
R:  Right.  Well, I don't want to be in that position [LAUGH].  I don't know if our current administration feels the same way.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I mean, I guess I agree with you that, um [LIPSMACK] at least for the time being it's more appropriate for the UN to be calling the shots, so to speak, and figuring out what needs to be done.  And, I mean, I think we need to give the arms inspections an adequate opportunity to work, before we decide what might come next.  And I feel like the Bush administration isn't really doing that.  I feel like they're, you know, jumping the gun --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as it were, um.
L:  I definitely agree with that and I -- I feel like the media is trying to, um, kind of turn the whole, like, Iraq as an entire entity into something that's bad.  Whereas in -- we may not -- like, I'd probably -- I don't know, like, Saddam Hussein personally obviously, but I'm -- I'm guessing that I would not agree with him or support any of his policies, but it's -- it's really different than, like, bombing a country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we don't like one person.
R:  Sure.  I mean, I think -- I think it's mo- a little more [SIGH] deeply rooted than just him.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I think the administration as a whole is evil --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and doing horrible things to oppress the citizens of the country.  And I --
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  I think that the nat- the, uh, world needs to respond to that in some way.  I mean, it seems like sanctions are ineffective, just because they're doing more harm than good for the citizens --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of the nation.  And I -- but I don't know what the solution is.  I mean, I think the arms inspections is -- I think that's a really good idea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I'm glad to see that happening and, you know, I think it needs to -- we just need to kind of hold our horses for the time being and -- and wait and see what the results of that are.  But what happens when -- you know, let's assume that the worst comes true and the arms inspectors come back and say, "Okay, well, there are all these --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dangerous things going on" what should the response of the world be at that point?  I mean, that's what makes me really nervous.  Um, and I also don't trust the Bush administration to accept what the --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- arms inspectors come back with as the final -- the final say on the matter.  Like if the arms inspectors come back and say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Okay, well, it looks pretty clean and --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, there was this suspicious stuff and we destroyed it but everything else looks good" I think the Bush administration is going to come forth at that point and say, "Yeah, but we have evidence that you don't have access to" and --
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, I mean, it's a messy situation and I don't think there's a clean -- a clean solution.
L:  I -- I definitely agree that I would not trust the Bush administration, um, very far at all, um, simply because -- I -- yo- I never know exactly what they're telling us and the whole precedent set by -- I don't know.  The -- I -- this is -- it's a very different situation with the whole bombing of Afghanistan.  I feel like that was, again, kind of like the Bush administration taking on powers that it -- it didn't necessarily have in the world community.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  You know, everyo- everyone's against terrorists --
R:  True.
L:  -- but it's -- it's very different to go in and say, "We think there are terrorists here and therefore we're going to drop a bomb".
R:  So, what's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What is the appropriate response in that kind of situation?
L:  Again, I would go to the UN and world community as a whole and attempt to, you know, isolate A- Al Qaeda, as opposed to, um, bombing -- I don't know.  I'm kind of a -- a pacifist, I guess.  I don't believe that the war -- war is answer to any of our questions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about what's going on.  I think that everything -- not ev- like, I understand that negotiations can only go so far --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But honestly, like, negotiation should always be the first step.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I --
R:  So, what do you do?  [LAUGH]  I mean, I agree with you essentially.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think negotiations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- need to be given quite a long time to work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it doesn't always work.  And, I mean, what do you do with a nutca- I think Saddam H- Hussein is a nutcase.  I think he's a complete --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, power hungry, um, whatever.  I think he's crazy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I think he's doing horrible, horrible things to the citizens of his country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think he's, you know, trampling over human rights at every turn.  And I th- you know, ideally the United States should use its power and influence to [SIGH] somehow improve the -- the life, you know, the quality of life of people around the world.  And if -- if getting rid of that guy is the way to do it, then super.  But, I mean, how do you do that without inflicting more harm on people than -- than bringing about positive change, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, what do you do when negotiations fail?
L:  Um.  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause they're not going to work with a guy like that.
L:  That's true and that's a very valid point.  But, um, I -- I guess it would -- we would have another Desert Storm where, um, it's kind of a US led attack but again it's the UN.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel like anything that's purely US --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is kind of a power trip and anything [NOISE] that -- I mean, even if it's -- even if everyone agrees with it I think everyone needs to get behind it and not just have the US be a police force type thing.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it seems like the Bush administration is at least, for the time being, going to sh- you know, wait things out with the arms inspections.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, who knows what's going to happen after that point?  Like, I really don't think the -- I mean, this is sad to say but I don't really think the final answer of the arms inspectors is going to matter a bit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in what Bush, um, decides to go ahead and do w-
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at that point and that's concerning.
L:  Um, my concern is that, um, Europe -- or at least before the, um, arms inspection were going in, when the US was talking about attacking it in October.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, Europe had kind of said as a whole [NOISE] that they would not support an invasion of Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  And that it would be a US led attack.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that kind of gets me concerned about, um, you know, whether or not that this is really a -- a legitimate thing.  If -- if other, you know, world powers are not willing to step in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is this just us saying, "We want oil", you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, but come on.
L:  Right.
R:  Europe wants oil too.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know?  Like, I don't think that's a -- I think that's a western concern --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not specifically a US concern.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know.  I -- I -- I don't know exactly know what Bush's motivation is.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um [MN] yeah.  No, I think oil is a part of it for sure but I don't think that saying it's oil is adequate because certainly all western nations have an interest in -- in access to cheap oil.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Then why do we feel the need to step in when Europe doesn't?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I mean, I think Europe probably has more to lose, being in the same continent as [LAUGH] as Iraq.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  You know, I think they're probably more c- more, ah, cautious and also, you know, have fewer financial resources to devote to a -- a prolonged, ugly, dirty war.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I think probably the US has [MN] I -- I don't know.  I don't know.  It's just a messy, ugly, scary, depressing [LAUGH] situation.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  No matter how you look at it. 
L:  I agree.
R:  And, I mean, I -- I've -- I agree with you essentially that the arms inspections are a good idea and necessary and should be given every opportunity to work, but I -- I honestly don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- believe that the arms inspections are going to un- unveil everything that's going on inside of Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Like there's got to be stuff that's happening that we're never going to have access to.  And I'm sure that's true within the US as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And so, ugh.
L:  Iraq does not have nuclear capabilities, is that correct?  It's just germ and biological warfare that --
R:  Well, as far as people know, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think that's -- that's true, yeah.
L:  [MN] you know, and atomic we- when you start talking about atomic weapons, that's where it get really scary.  And that's when I would, you know, want people to go in and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, obviously, like, biological warfare is -- is a pretty scary thing.
R:  Yeah, I think the biochemical thing is terrifying.  I mean, did you see Tariq Aziz on Nightline the other night?
L:  No.
R:  Well, they found mustard gas.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, it's, um, plant.  And Ted Koppel's like, "Well, you know, what about the mustard gas?"  And Tariq Aziz said, "Oh, that's so eighties".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A -- [MN] okay, yeah, but it still kills people.
L:  Right, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  [LAUGH]  I mean, I think this stuff is pretty scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, okay, so, you know, they don't have the -- the atom bomb, but [MN] mustard gas is going to do some serious damage.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know.  I don't know.  I don't -- I have a hard time balancing my -- my general tendencies to say, you know, "War is bad and do what you can to avoid it and try everything else first" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- with my other sense that the Iraqi administration is truly evil.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, really doing horrible, horrible things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- what do you do?
L:  Yeah, I -- I totally agree with that.  It's just I -- I feel, um -- you know in the cold war when it was just reaching that point when we had the bomb and they had the bomb --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we're both threatening to -- and it's -- it's -- it's one of those things where if they threaten to use biological warfare --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well, we have theoretically an atomic weapon at our easy disposal --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- that's just -- and that's incredibly frightening to me that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- like war in this age would necessarily involve, like, very schem- scary chemicals and very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, explosive things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I'm a chemistry major and I know, like, all these things that it can do to you and that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not pleasant.
R:  No.
L:  So --
R:  That's pretty terrifying.  I mean, if you think about it in -- you know, without just like a passing thought.  If you actually dwell on it --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, why get out of bed?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  It's, like, too darn depressing.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, I -- I have [MN] I wish there was an easy solution for the people in Iraq.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, it makes you wonder whether -- I wonder personally whether or not they like Saddam or whether they don't.
R:  [MN]  Well, I guess it's impossible to know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because the citizens are -- at least if you believe what you hear, the citizens live in fear of any repercussions of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of speaking their minds.  But just knowing what the party line of -- of Saddam's administration is, how could people feel happy [LAUGH] and comfortable and accept
