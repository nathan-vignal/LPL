L:  Hi, I'm Erica.
R:  Uh, hi, my name is Bill.
L:  Hi, Bill.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you have a favorite holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... I don't know.  I mean, I guess, uh, I think Thanksgiving might be my favorite holiday.  How 'bout --
L:  And why is that?
R:  Well, um, I think because of all of the food and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and also Thanksgiving is like a very, um, kind of low key --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and relaxing holiday for me.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Whereas Christmas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is a little bit more hectic because you kinda --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to give presents and stuff.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And so Thanksgiving I just sort of -- it's like -- it's -- it's nice 'cause it's cold out and you get to hang out --
L:  Mhm.  Very cozy.
R:  -- go to my parents and they -- you know, my mom cooks all this food and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get to, like, lie around all day and it's --
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  I wonder if --
R:  -- nothing --
L:  -- Thanksgiving is your mom's favorite holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I don't know about that.
L:  Not so relaxing for her. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.  But for me, nothing is required of me, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's your favorite holiday?
L:  Um, well, I don't know.  I really like Thanksgiving, too, for a lot of reasons you're talking about.  I think Christmas has become so overwhelming and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there's -- there's more stress involved than -- than really visiting sometimes and relaxing and -- and enjoying what, you know, the meaning of the holiday is supposed to be.
R:  Right.
L:  And the other thing that I think is nice about Thanksgiving, especially these days, is -- is that it's a very inclusive holiday.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, ev- everybody is, I think, in the United States feels comfortable being a part of those kinds of celebrations, whereas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, the religious holidays in a way can be kind of divisive in -- in -- in some respects, you know.
R:  Yeah, I can see that. [NOISE]
L:  But I do love Christmas, too.  I love the anticipation of it, the feeling of, you know, walking around, shopping, and hearing bells and everybody gets excited thinking about what they're gonna get for people.  You know, that part of it is -- is fun if you have the time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, you know, don't get me wrong, I really -- I really love Christmas and, you know, there's all kinds of unique stuff about Christmas, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess it's not -- it's not quite as relaxing as Thanksgiving, so ...
L:  Right, I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you -- are you ready for Christmas this year?
R:  No, no, not really.  I haven't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- actually done any shopping yet, but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but [LAUGH] how 'bout you?
L:  Well, um, yeah, I'm not ready at all. [LAUGH] I got one gift, which is tickets to a show.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  For my brother and some other friends, so that should be fun, but other than that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not doing anything because I'm [MN] -- I'm in school, you know, I'm still finishing up the semester.
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.
L:  So, what's your excuse? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I -- it's [LAUGH] I don't know.  I haven't gotten on to it.  Thanksgiving and everything and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, I've got, uh -- I'm also -- I've also got school all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm --
L:  Are you a last minute shopper?
R:  Yeah.  I usually don't, uh, do my Christmas shopping until pretty late anyway.
L:  Christmas Eve? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, sometimes, yeah, sometimes.  Last year I actually -- last year I had all my Christmas shopping done before I went home to visit my family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but that was probably the only -- the only year I've ever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually been prepared for Christmas, was last year.
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  And I think this year's not gonna be like that [LAUGH], so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  I used to be someone who would get it all done, like, a month ahead of time, and it seems like every year now I get closer and closer to getting my presents, you know, close to Christmas --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- 'cause [SIGH] don't have time.  And I don't care that much about the whole presents side of it any more.  You know, in a way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wish you could just get rid of that part of Christmas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and just get together and have fun and, you know, play games and talk and [SIGH] I don't know.  I think the presents have -- have become too big a deal in a way.
R:  Yeah, there's sort of like too many, uh, expectations, it seems like.
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, I mean, I think the gift giving is really nice, but it -- it can sorta get, like, out of hand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially when, you know, you're expected to give a gift to everybody or -- or --
L:  Right.
R:  It's because of the expectations, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  And you -- and then you end up, I end up anyway, going through all these fights with myself about who -- you know, who I should get gifts for, and I cannot afford all this stuff.  I mean, I just can't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a student, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm old enough that I feel like I should be getting gifts, you know, for all the kids in the family and all this stuff, and I just -- you know, it's making me broke. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah. [MN]
L:  It's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have to come up with --
R:  But it's sort of like -- oh, go ahead.
L:  I was just gonna say I have to come up with creative ways of, you know, making gifts for people or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But I haven't done that yet.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's more -- obviously more time consuming, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like dilemma for somebody, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands.
L:  I know.  What were you gonna say?
R:  Oh, I was gonna say that, uh, what was I gonna say?  Oh, well, I mean, like, I like just on the, uh, really into the fact that I like the idea of giving presents, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Um, because I think, you know, it could be like a -- it should be like a really, um, [LIPSMACK] kind of joyful thing, you know, to give --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody gifts or receive gifts from people.
L:  And it is, yeah.  It is.
R:  Yeah.  When you -- when so much is expected, though, then it's like, you know, when you're ex- -- when it's -- then it's like it's less of a gift and more of an obligation, and then it sort of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is not as, uh, much of a happy thing, but sort of just a regular thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just that it's -- instead of being extra happy when you get a gift, it's like you're pleased to get a gift but you would be upset if you didn't get one, you know, and that kind of thing, so ...
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm.  And also the -- I mean, what's really fun about giving gifts is when you have -- when you think about something that you think is really gonna make that person happy or, you know, something personal that is meaningful to the two of you, but I -- I feel like with -- with so many gifts that I feel I should buy these days I don't even have time to think about that aspect of it.  It's just, like, get the list done.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's a checklist to get through and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I guess a lot of that is your -- your personal attitude.  You just have to [SIGH] remember to -- to keep the -- the meaning in mind and not -- not get all caught up with just a checklist of obligations. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, if you could, uh, design your own holiday, what [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  What would you -- what would you do if you could ...?
L:  Oh, jeeze, that's a tough question. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how to answer [LAUGH] that question either.
L:  You know, but I think what I -- what I would love is the kind of holiday where everybody in the whole world stops for, like, a week.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I know this is impossible, but we're just playing a game here, right, so [LAUGH]  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where everybody could just take time to be together and that's it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And -- and do fun things together and nobody has all these pressures pulling them away or, you know, obligations of things to do and everybody could just truly enjoy the moment for a little while with each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  How 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I don't know.  That would be nice if there was just, like, not -- you know, if you could have, like, a true holiday where you could just relax and not really have a lot of obligations.  But I guess, like, I don't know.  I -- I guess I'd still be worried that even in that case, um, you know, like even if you didn't have to do anything for a whole week, you know, and everybody could just hang out together, well, then, like, I'd -- you know, everybody would want me to hang out with them, you know, like my family and --
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  -- and my fiancee's family, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And my --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Right.
R:  And we'd all have to figure out, like, when we could spend time together, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And my aunts and my uncles and my cousins --
L:  And no matter what you do, somebody's gonna be mad at you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, somebody's gonna feel --
L:  It's true.  There's no escaping the guilt. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, somebody will feel left out if you don't -- if you don't hang out with them, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Well, this is a pretty depressing conclusion that we're coming to. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There is no ideal. [LAUGH]
R:  Not that it wouldn't be -- not that it wouldn't be fun, but I don't know if the pressure could come into this, but ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if I would really design a holiday.  I -- I think I'm pretty satisfied with the holidays that already exist.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I can't really think of how to create an -- like, a new holiday or anything.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [SIGH] Yeah.  Maybe the one thing that I think doesn't exist that would be nice is something, like, that everybody would really share, you know, instead of national holidays and religious holidays and just with how, um, strained tensions are between people these days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  It's interesting to think about if there was a holiday where really everybody in the world could reflect on that, on our common, you know, [SIGH] status as inhabitants of this planet. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess every holiday is supposed to have some meaning to it, so --
L:  Mhm, well --
R:  -- if there was a holiday that was -- meaning was just being a person [LAUGH] --
L:  But I mean being --
R:  -- would be nice.
L:  -- being -- yeah, our shared humanity, I think that's meaningful.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Like to transcend -- I mean, there are all these differences and I -- I -- I mean, by no means do I think difference is bad, always bad, but [SIGH] we should think some -- once in a while, I think, about what we all have in common, too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Would be nice.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Very peaceful and very --
L:  How long does this thing go on?
R:  I don't know.  I -- I think -- well, it seems like we've already been talking for ten minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I didn't know if it was gonna cut us off when our ten minutes was up or ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well --
R:  I kinda think that it might.
L:  Okay, how 'bout this?  I'll ask you another question.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you have plans for New Years Eve?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm going to be, uh, visiting with, uh, my fiancee's family, that's what ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Where are they?
R:  In Youngstown, Ohio, so ...
L:  Okay.  Looking forward to it?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  That's what I've done past two New Years Eves, I've spent with them.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  That sounds nice.
R:  Uh, yeah, so I think I'll probably just be relaxing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think I'm gonna like, uh, necessarily go out or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It sorta depends on what they're doing, but ...
L:  Mhm.  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have any New Years Eve plans?
L:  Um, yeah.  Remember I said I got tickets to a show?
R:  Oh.
L:  That's for New Years Eve.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, my fiance and my brother and his girlfriend are gonna go to Philadelphia and see The Full Monty --
R:  Oh.
L:  And then go out on the town, so ...
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  That should be fun.  I've never done anything like that on New Years Eve so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, that'll be nice.
L:  I'm looking forward to having an activity, kinda.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I saw the, um --
L:  When are you guys -- oh.
R:  No, I was gonna say that I saw The Full Monty in New York when it was, like --
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah, it was about a year and a half ago.
L:  Was it good?
R:  Oh, yeah, it was very entertaining.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Good.
R:  I really enjoyed it.
L:  Yeah, should be fun.  So, when are you guys getting married?
R:  Um, next August, on, uh, August ninth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
L:  June fourteenth.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  If, uh, if we get it together.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's still a lot of work --
