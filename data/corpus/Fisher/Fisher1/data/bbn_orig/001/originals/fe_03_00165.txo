L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, hello.  I'm -- my name is Ricky.
L:  Hi, I'm David.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I guess we're talking about holidays.
R:  Right.  And, uh, [LAUGH] I'm not sure, I guess we all enjoy holidays, but, uh, I'm not sure I have specific ones that I particularly enjoy more than any others.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  Is there a type of holiday that you like more than any others?
R:  Um, basically long holidays. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, vacation holidays?
R:  Defin- definitely catching a week -- a weekend or two on either end.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's funny.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, I think the holidays -- I think if I -- the one that came to mind for me [MN] was Thanksgiving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, not because of the length, but I lo- -- you know, I've had good experiences with, um, reuniting year after year with a group of friends and family and dining together.  I -- I always like, you know, when -- when the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- event itself is pleasant, you know, it just builds up a lot of positive associations.  And I also like the idea of giving thanks and, uh, appreciating community spirit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even though there's been all the -- the unpleasant side to Thanksgiving of, you know, knowing what happened to the Native Americans.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you -- are there any holidays you like like that?
R:  Yes, I suppose that I have similar feelings about Thanksgiving be- especially because it's not as commercialized as Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, New Years always seems to mean to me sales, big sal- -- New Year sales and so forth, and everyone goes frantic about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I'm not sure about some of the, uh, more, uh, political ones, although I sort of approve of the idea.  Martin Luther King days --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is a good idea, you know, except a lot of people pay no attention to who it's for or -- or what underlies it, but it's simply a day off of work.  But -- but --
L:  Yeah, I agree with you.  I -- I -- I think that, uh, I -- that was the other one I was thinking of, but I -- you know, to be honest, I don't have the warmth be- bec- -- you know, quite likely because I didn't grow up having a delicious meal with beloved, you know, [LAUGH] companions on Martin Luther King day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I had of, then I would -- I would -- it'd be -- it'd be very similar to me, you know --
R:  Well, I have some good, uh, recollections 'cause I -- there are some -- I have in the past, uh, marched in a parade, in a sort of Martin Luther King's day parade.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, sort of meet -- meet people, sort of like Thanksgiving, you know, uh, people you saw last year and you ask 'em what -- what was happening and -- and so forth.  And it's a very, uh, mixed race kind of thing.  It's a way of sort of getting together with people I don't always get a -- together with as much as I'd like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that -- that definitely has, uh, some plus --
L:  Oh, that sounds great, yeah.
R:  -- pluses to it.
L:  So far I just take the day -- you know, I try to take the day off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I -- I haven't, you know, tried to make it into a social, uh, you know, any sort of gathering type of occasion, but that's a good idea.  I'd have to think about it.
R:  B-
L:  So, if you had to create one, what would it be?
R:  Yes, I don't know.  Well, I was just remembering the ones that, uh, school systems created, you know, snow days.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  W- which when you were in school was just wonderful.  You just call up and, uh, they're -- there you'd be.  Oh, you don't have to go in.  You can sleep in later.  You can -- and you have this, uh, it's a surprise day in a way so that you just have this whole day free.  It's not something you were thinking you were gonna get and, therefore, you've made some plans about, so it's a kind of luxury --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a way to know you've got all that, uh, extra -- extra time that you haven't, uh, made any provision for.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I can't help asking this, but are you from -- I know this is a -- a linguistic research project.  Are you from a background where a holiday is often used for vacation?
R:  Yes.
L:  Like, I'm going on holiday?
R:  Yes, I'm from London.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  So that --
L:  I figured because I -- I can tell your association is much more towards vacation than -- you know, hearing the word "holiday" perhaps th- than mine is.  I'm -- I'm --
R:  Right.  Vacation is not a word that we generally use at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, so it covers both holy days, which is the origin of it, I guess, and, uh, the -- the break from -- for other purposes.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, I think -- yeah, when -- I always think when I was trying to create a holiday of doing the, um -- of -- of sort of revamping a lot of the holidays so that they're not po- -- as politically and nationalistically determined, but much more based on ideals.  So, you know, like, uh, community and things like that, so, um ...
R:  Yeah, but that sounds like a great idea, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, except -- you know, but, of course, someone doing that with -- without the rest of the culture doing that, you know, it -- it's -- you're kind of out of step.  It's a kind of non conformist thing to do, but I -- you know, some holidays about, you know, like -- and the things that -- like Earth Day, for example --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has been -- you know, has some form of recognition, but it -- it just isn't, um, you know, sometimes on the anniversaries people ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- acknowledge it more, but it's a -- it's a pretty lonely holiday [LAUGH], you know, in terms of, you know, like once every ten or twenty years people might really stop to observe it.  But I like the idea of ear- -- you know, days, too.
R:  I think you celebrate yourself in a way and I think that's a -- a nice idea if it makes you look back on what you've, uh, been doing and, uh, what your life is like, and thinking about whether you want it to be of a peace.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what follows.  But the best days are generally, uh, tend not to be on days when you still have to work.
L:  [LAUGH] Unless, uh, you determine it yourself. [LAUGH]
R:  Unless you determine it yourself, and, uh, you know, I'm always sick on my birthday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and so forth.  But [LAUGH] I don't know how often you can get away with that.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  But -- but anyway, that, uh -- yeah, I've always en- enjoyed, uh, you know, going to other people's eightieths or ninetieths sometimes and talking with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, anyway, uh, I can't think of any special kind of holiday that -- that's needed.  I -- I think, uh, basically if I make this, uh, blend between a holiday and vacation, one thing I notice about the United States and England is that the amount of vacation is, uh, cons- considerably less than in most of Europe, of -- of Continental Europe, and that there's much more of a -- a work ethic in the anglo countries, which means that you spend most of your -- most of your life when you're younger at work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you -- you don't have that sort of -- you know, the month of Au- -- whole month of August that the French have, for example --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in which you can sort of do things and plan things and do various kinds of things, not occupy the whole -- the whole time with -- with just one particular thing that you enjoy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ...
L:  Even, um, Australia has, uh, a month, or at least every several years, right, people -- Australians get to take a long holiday.
R:  And academics get a --
L:  Well, I think they get a year.  They get a year off, and they do a lot of major travelling.  And academics get sabbaticals.
R:  Sabbaticals, right.  Then those are nice.  Like, what are they?  They're years at, uh, full pay or half a year -- a full year at half pay, I think, in most places, and some are more generous than that.  And you're supposed to -- I suppose you're supposed to sort of do things that you're interested in and, uh, will help you from -- not to perish.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If -- if it's a publish or perish thing.  Uh, actually I guess that isn't relevant 'cause you will already have to have tenure when you -- wh- -- uh, when you take a sabbatical.
L:  Although there are cases where people get sabbaticals before that.  Like, uh, there's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know definitely some universities, uh, which is a very con- considerate, you know, allows people who are preparing for tenure to take a sabbatical so they -- they use that time to write books or try --
R:  Yeah, that's a -- that's a wonderful way to do it.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], going back to the publish or perish, uh, concept.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, I always think that for holidays, you know, something like I guess there is an Earth Day, but I don't think there's a Peace Day or at least not one that is, uh --
R:  No, there isn't [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, not one that's widely -- you know, I'm -- you know, there -- there must be some Peace Days somehow, you know, like a UN thing or whatever, but I -- I'm not familiar with one.
R:  Yeah, there is a United Nations Day.  It's not usually a -- a holiday.  Probably would be, uh, politically unacceptable to some groups.
L:  Mm.
R:  Who regard the, uh, UN as a kind of left wing conspiracy.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But, you know, it would be interesting, you know, uh, if -- if the calendar were really constructed around -- I mean, I think originally holidays -- or in many cases holidays were, you know, very much tied to, um, you know, harvests and all sorts of --
R:  The seasons.
L:  -- natural phenomenon or, you know, efforts between nature and people, uh, you know, the cycles of the month, maybe, and the seasons changing and all of that and, uh, the -- the -- the number of political holidays that a country celebrates --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, just, uh, they -- they -- they're --
R:  They're just breaks.
L:  They're not as unifying I -- I -- I think in a lot of ways.  You know, in the short run they might be unifying when -- when people still h- have strong feelings about them, but over time they often lose value.
R:  They just take 'em for granted.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  But I suppose that, well, Christmas and, uh, Easter and so forth are all, uh -- are actually, uh, seasonal things that the Christianity and, uh, Judaism adopted.  Like, Judaism adopted, what, the Easter kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think the timing -- I don't know when Jesus was supposed to have died.  Someone told me it was September.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But, uh, they --
L:  Well, I --
R:  They wanted to re- recruit the pagans who celebrate the winter festival, so that's how it got to be in December.  And Easter was named after Aester[?] or something, some pagan festival and, uh --
L:  But, yeah.
R:  So, the resurrection was conveniently dated at that -- at that time.  I guess it's a way of sort of, uh, taking over a holiday and, uh, pushing the other group out.
L:  Yeah.  I think that the, uh, in the case of Easter, I think it's still -- if the last supper was a, um -- a sater --
