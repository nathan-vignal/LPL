R:  Hi, I'm Shannon.
L:   Hi, this is Cindy.
R:   Hi, Cindy.
L:   [LIPSMACK]  Well, do you have any strong feelings on the topic?
R:   [NOISE]  Um, I -- on the whole I think the economy would have a hard time withstanding, um, a war with Iraq.
L:   Mhm.
R:   Which [LAUGH] of course is one of the possible outcomes of the arms inspection.
L:   Yeah.
R:   But I also think that [NOISE] it's really important to make critical decisions when critical decisions are called for, you know?
L:  Right, yeah.  And it's -- it's so hard to know, you know, where that line is between it being necessary or not, you know?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And I think none of us really have the whole story, you know, and I wonder whether governments do either, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I kind of doubt it.
R:  [MN]  Yeah. 
L:  But ...
R:  Um, my husband was actually [NOISE] -- just finished reading a book on revolutions --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he said -- he said that one of the things that he noticed in it [MN] is that, um, leaders who -- who, when the time to make decisions is there, leaders who do not make a decision [NOISE] end up costing a lot of lives.  He gave the example of French revolution, where King Louis whatever -- [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know what number.  He, um [MN] there was a -- there was a -- there was an uprising and th- the -- well, the -- the gu- or the Swiss guard put down the uprising, came to the King and told him what had happened.  They said [NOISE] um, "We've put it down and there's been a -- a group of them, a large group that has fled.  Do you want us to -- to follow them and -- and take care of it and just end this now?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the King's like, "I won't kill my own people".
L:  Right.
R:  Which --
L:  But that inaction resulted in all kinds of problems.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It made for a lot more loss of blood.
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah.  Gosh, it's interesting.  Yeah, it's hard.  I have real mixed feelings too.  My husband is in the Air Force, he's in Air Force pilot training right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um -- so, yeah, war doesn't seem like a great idea to m-
R:  No.
L:  You know.  But, ah, you know, going into the Air Force you can't expect that nothing will ever happen, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  And I saw some interesting things about it on TV too.  I saw a news commentator who was saying that, like, President Bush's real motivation for wanting to eliminate problems in Ira- in Iraq, um, was because Iraq, um, trains a lot of the suicide bombers and the people who cause problems in Israel and Palestine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just fueling that conflict.  And because of that there's a lot of anti American sentiment, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it helps Al Qaeda and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the other groups.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so if, you know, we get Saddam out of power he won't be able to help fuel that fire or whatever.  So, I thought that was interesting.  But, I don't know, you know, if it's really accurate or just, you know, his thoughts.
R:  Yeah.  And you wonder too if Saddam, I mean, is as charismatic as he may be, you know?  I wonder how much is really all of his fault for fueling misunderstandings and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and false representations.  I think that there's ignorance on both sides.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Tons of it.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Like, e- even my parents.  My parents are from -- are from Idaho and really ve- very conservative.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, they just have completely different perceptions of what -- what it is to be Arab and -- and what the people are like really.  I spent a little bit of time in Israel myself and --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- and I loved the Muslim people there.  They were so kind and generous.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you'd see them with their families and they're so family oriented.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- you never get anything, ah, like that off of the, um, media, you know?
L:  The TV news, yeah, definitely.
R:  And I can only imagine what they get -- what they understand about Americans from the media, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure.  You know, I've also had -- I -- I'm an ESL teacher --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I've had a lot of positive experiences with students from the Middle East that are studying over here.  So ...
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  They're wonderful people.  I mean, the people that I've met.
L:  Right.
R:  In fact I -- [NOISE] just this weekend we happened to -- [LIPSMACK] my husband is studying Middle Eastern --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  He's doing Middle Eastern studies.
L:  Yeah, so he's an expert, huh?
R:  Well [LAUGH] getting there.  He's trying to be [NOISE] learning to be.  And we went to a mosque this Fri- or Saturday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just to watch some prayer callers and stuff.
L:  Cool.
R:  And after -- after the prayers were over several people came up to us and shook our hands and, you know --
L:  Were welcoming and kind.
R:  -- introduced themselves.  They were really welcoming and very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very cordial.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  So, it's interesting, yeah.  [MN]  But it's really tough to know about Iraq.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean -- and -- you know, I've seen things on TV too that talk about the, you know, human rights violations and all the, you know, horrible things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  People being killed over there and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I'm sure some of that stuff is going on [MN].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, that's not right but it's where do you draw that line of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- force becoming necessary to take over?  And I don't know about the inspections themselves and whether they really are going to do anything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, like if they'll be able to uncover weapons that are there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I kind of suspect that, you know, Saddam is one step ahead of the inspectors as far as hiding that he wouldn't want them to find, you know?
R:  I would imagine so.  I, um, I just saw an article not too long ago about, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  A woman who's the head of the biological warfare in Iraq.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  And she was just a -- a really small woman and looked really nice actually.  And it talked about her personal life --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- how she was a mother and she had a six month old baby and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she had been educated at Cambridge in -- in England and --
L:  Wow.
R:  And really in her class she never really stood out in her class but she's manufactured enough, um, chemicals to kill the world twice with smallpox.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  And she's just a really unassuming woman but -- and yet she has this incredible killing power.  [LAUGH]
L:   Right.  Wow.
R:  And you wonder just what kind of stuff that he has, if he has, you know, enough germ warfare to do that.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, that's pretty serious.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well [LIPSMACK] but --
R:  So, what does your husband think of it?
L:  Um, h- you know, he doesn't really know either.  That's a -- that's a good question.  You know, I've kind of asked him a little bit and he's like, "Well, you know, we should go to war if it's necessary".
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  But, like -- I'm like, "Well, is it?"  You know?  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's not s- he's not sure, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I think he has some confidence in President Bush, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, as far as, like, trusting him.
R:  Mhm
L:  But, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK]  Neither of us are really sure about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, what is it about President Bush that makes him trust him?
L:  Oh, that's a good question.  I --
R:  Or do you think that he would have trusted a previous President as much?
L:  [MN]  You know, I don't think he had very much confidence in President Clinton as far the way that he, um, he demonstrated, you know, dishonestly in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on a couple of acc- accounts and things like that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he felt like President Bush was, you know, more honest.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, and, you know, has a little more similar values.  And of course, you know, President -- President Bush's support of the military is something that he felt was important and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, agreed with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um [LIPSMACK] but, yeah -- but I'm not -- I'm not real sure.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Excuse me.
L:  Oh, bless you.  Are you all right?
R:  [LAUGH]  I just put cayenne in my potatoes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh [LAUGH] that's serious.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so, anyway -- so, when you were in -- you went to Israel, you said?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Were you there for an extended period or time or just a short trip?
R:  I was just there on a study abroad for six weeks.
L:  For six weeks?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, did you ever have any, like, negative experiences with any of the people?
R:  I was actually there on, um, Israel's fiftieth birthday.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, ther- there was a bit of, um --
L:  Like protests and demonstrations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that time?
R:  Yeah.  In fact we were on a bus on our way back to where we were staying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, one night and [NOISE] um, on the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in the road to where we were going there was a protest set up and a bunch of tires out in the road.  And the Palestinian groups were, um -- had a bonfire and were protesting and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.  And there was a murder --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- near the Dome of the Rock while I was there.
L:  Wow.  But that wasn't necessarily, like, anti American, it was more anti Israeli?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  But the prob- problem is that [COUGH] excuse me [LIPSMACK] that the Palestinians associate Americans with the Israelis --
L:  With always supporting them.
R:  -- because they've funded so much, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Huh.  Well, that's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, like, yesterday or last week I was listening to a -- a talk radio host and he was talking about how [LAUGH] the Palestinians and the Arabs were so awful because they couldn't [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] have a well developed country like Israel could.  You know [LAUGH] he's like --
L:  What?
R:  Yeah, he said --
L:  What did he mean?
R:  [COUGH]  The guy was just ignorant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He, um -- he talked about how going to Tel Aviv is just like going to some places in California.  Which is true, Tel Aviv is a really modern city.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he comp- compared it [COUGH] sorry, to, um -- to the, um, Palestinian camps --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which are really are not in good condition.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, definitely not up to first world stan- standards.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was just saying that that reflects on the character of the people, which is ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Because the Israelis have had [COUGH] I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  The Israelis have had so much American funding.
L:  Mhm, yeah, definitely.  So much support.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  It wasn't just them.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  Well, that's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think there are so many misconceptions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  On both sides, I guess, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really sad wh- you know, after September eleventh and an- and everything, um, some of the Arab students that I had, like, they really had a hard time by, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just rude American students, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who were just totally ignorant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, saying things to them and ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Hm.
L:  So it was really a shame.
R:  [MN]  I can't even -- [LAUGH] that's just inconceivable to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how people can just generalize like that.  But, well, I probably do it and don't even know it.  But ...
L:  It's -- yeah, I -- it is unconscious for them, you know, so yeah, I'm sure there are things that we do t
