L:  Hi, I'm Peter.
R:  Ah, this is Moile[?].
L:  Hi, how're you doing?
R:  Hi, how're you doing?
L:  Okay, well, this is the first time I'm doing this, so, have you done this before?
R:  Ah, yes, but, ah, it's never been a political topic.
L:  Okay.
R:  I actually hung up for -- I dismissed the first call and the second call but it keeps on ringing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, like, I'm going to take this.
L:  [COUGH] All right.  Well, the topic was just the Iran's weapon inspection and everything. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, Iraq, yeah.
L:  Iraq, sorry.  [LAUGH] And, um, what's --
R:  What --
L:  -- your stand on that?
R:  Well, I'd like to know what has happened in the past couple of days because I have not been -- I usually get information over the internet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I haven't checked.  But the last thing that I was, um, signing petition for [LAUGH] was, um, that if it goes, um, according to -- they have, um -- when I read, they -- Iraq has not yet, um, done any resistance against, ah, proper inspections.
L:  Mhm. [COUGH]
R:  And in that case, um, you know, he should proceed and, um -- it -- it sounded as if --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- President was, ah, making more issues and pushing more towards war basically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I get the feeling --
R:  So ...
L:  -- even though if send people [NOISE] to inspect, ah, you know, that they could easily just hide everything and then your inspection will go fine.  Because they have plenty of time to prepare.  And that's what a lot of radio talk shows have been saying as well. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I think the point is if -- if the inspection is being done and if all these things -- if, um, if there's mistrust --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in -- in the inspection and if they're using that as the reason --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for war then I -- I don't know if it's a good enough reason because this mistrust might be -- it's not -- maybe it's not rooted -- maybe it's rooted on something else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe whatever it is that Iraq does it's going to be the same thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, if -- if United States wants war then it's going to find whatever reason, I think.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  I hope we don't go to war though.  But this may be something that will cause it.  [COUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So we'll see.
R:  So, what is your [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm?
R:  Any more thoughts on ...?
L:  Not really 'cause, um -- [COUGH] I don't know, I just -- I just hope we don't because whenever there's a conflict we're always the first ones to get involved.  I wish, like -- I know, like, other countries are helping as well, but I wish it more involvement instead of just the US. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mea- -- what, ah -- in this case, if they go ahead, if the US --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- goes ahead, then ther- -- there's n- -- there's nobody backing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or very few.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in -- in Europe it's -- they're, um -- I don't know.  I'm from Japan I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know the view from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, from there either.  But I know in European newspapers and things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um, it's a very different kind of a viewpoint.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, so that's pretty much it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, [inaudible] it's -- I'm curious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, um -- because I -- I feel that a lot of these things come out because of few individuals --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who, for some reason, they're driven to -- to aggress.
L:  Mhm. [COUGH]
R:  And usually it's not the whole nation --
L:  I see.
R:  -- who are -- and it's -- I -- I -- that's how I feel.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- I don't know in this case.  Ah, [MN] but there's human nature. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Well, no one really is going to know the answer to that unless they're, you know, very high up.  [LAUGH] 'Cause I'm sure --
R:  [inaudible] they are.
L:  -- a lot of things happen that we don't know, you know? [COUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.  And also, I mean, just ki- -- I'm always -- I can't even imagine the mind of the politicians who --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their whole life is this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Their whole life is like this.  And, um, they -- it's easy to think a certain way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, th- -- it's just going to, um, hope -- I don't know how to explain.  Um --
L:  Yeah, [COUGH] okay.
R:  Um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm trying to formulate.
L:  Mm. [MN]
R:  Um ...
L:  So, is there like a time limit to this call or d- do they just ...?
R:  It's ten -- it's ten minutes, yeah.
L:  Oh, it is?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they tell you it's over?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, right. [MN]
R:  I don't know actually.  I think they -- yeah, I'm -- they usually give certain topic and you --
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess they -- they want you to stick to it but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  P- p- politically it is a difficult topic.
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  Politics and religion are very tough. [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  Religion, I think it's -- there's more, ah -- yeah, that's -- yeah, I wo- -- I agree actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, maybe religion it's easier to talk on a personal basis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Politics, er, has so much information involved.
L:  Sure.
R:  And also my -- always my fear about a lot of these issues is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know which information is accurate.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's true too.
R:  And, ah, yeah, yeah.  And what's on the media is usually what, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wh- wh- who's -- whose putting money wh- -- into --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the media is going to be the ones who basically, I mean, do control the media [LAUGH] information.
L:  Mhm, [COUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if we do go to war then, the economy's not going to do too well either. [MN]
R:  No, no.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  There's too many people dying already.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- I -- ah, all this effort and money, if it could be put into something else --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- then that would be very, very nice.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But, um --
L:  So, we'll have to wait and see then. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Did you see the new- -- the car- -- ah, this image that was in Mad Magazine?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  They -- I heard they were getting emails, a lot of the images of [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  There's, ah -- actually, I don't know.  It was designed like a poster --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- of a movie --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- an upcoming movie.  And it says, "Gulf War Two --"
L:  Oh, shh.
R:  "-- coming soon".
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] "Starring Cl- -- ah, the Bush ad- administration -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- Hussein, Saddam Hussein".
L:  Mm.
R:  Ah, very clever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very clever, yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, um, what, do we wai- -- do we just wait for them to give us the okay to hang up or what? [LAUGH]
R:  They give you, ah, time when it's going to say, "Your time is over".
L:  Okay.
R:  And then they say, "You've got thirty seconds to say goodbye".
L:  Okay.
R:  And then they -- yeah, that's it, yeah.
L:  Okay.  You know --
R:  How did you find out?
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  S- -- ah, +someone sent me email said, "Go in and sign up" so I signed up.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Now, you say you're from Japan, but I detect a French accent. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, no, not really but ...
L:  No, no.
R:  Ah, well, I did grow up in Canada and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, but, I don't think that's --
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anything to do with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where -- are you from America or ...?
L:  Ah, yeah, I live in the United States but I'm from Taiwan myself.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have any accent.
L:  No, I -- I grew up here pretty much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what is the view in China?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  We're getting off the topic.
L:  I'm in the -- I'm in the US, so I don't really know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Whatever I see I read off Washington Post dot com. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's where I get I all my news from.  Like you said, I get it off the internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And tha- that's the climate here, I think, that, er, we don't really feel it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so not many people will get involved.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Actually, I -- I do feel a little bit because I am in the military myself.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I just talked to a friend of mine a- and he's -- he may even get orders to be deployed next week, [MN] you know.
R:  Whoa, so he's --
L:  So I can kinda -- it is kinda close.
R:  You're in the military?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you might get -- once this starts they don't know where they're going to go.
L:  Exactly.  So ...
R:  How does -- how does your parents feel or family feel about [inaudible]?
L:  Oh, well, you know, they definitely don't want me to be deployed.  [NOISE] So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm [COUGH] -- so we're going to have to see 'cause, ah, I -- I'm one of the -- the last ones 'cause I'm not active, you know, I'm -- I'm more of a reserve component so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they really call me up then it's really for something major.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you don't get to hear?  No information comes down from above or ...?
L:  Um, no, no.  You know, I guess I -- you must be very high up to find out. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  So, everyone just waits.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we'll see. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you -- what kind of -- what part of -- what section are you?
L:  Mm?
R:  What section are you?  Is- -- are there sections within, ah, the army?
L:  Yeah.  Basically I'm just like in -- in the reserve --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in the reserve duty so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not really active.
R:  But y- you must be tr- -- they're all trained in -- in a specific field or I- in generally and then when you have to go --
L:  [COUGH] Well, I -- I'm very new.  I only started like, um, in November.
R:  Oh.
L:  So -- and then I'm doing something [NOISE] a little bit different, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure the [MN] -- yeah.  There must be a feeling of, ah, a little unstable --
L:  Mhm, yeah, definitely.
R:  -- with all this going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we'll see what happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hopefully it's not going to be another Vietnam.
L:  Yeah, mhm. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We have to wait for the time. [LAUGH]
L:  You do, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] And of course all this is recorded so whoever's reco- -- looking over this must be thinking, "Hm, now what are they talking about?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They -- they are taking people of all nationalities, I think.
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They must be.
R:  'Cause I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Also because the -- I -- I guess people have such different views --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or -- because of where they're coming from.
L:  Mhm, sure.
R:  Yeah.  But I mostly -- I think I'm pretty much Americanized.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not so -- not so well informed in politics.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, me neither.
R:  Um --
L:  That was one of my, um, [MN] least favorite subjects in school.  [LAUGH] More of a science person. [LAUGH]
R:  My -- my -- yeah.  [LAUGH] More and more as I grew up I became more aware because it was -- I realized politics is politics but it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when you come down to it, it's actually very -- it is about so- social things that -- it's embedded in the individual.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And, ah, it's more palpable now--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in how it's affecting us.  But the system of it is so beyond me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and the system of how i- it gets activated, how --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it works, how things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- happen.  Yeah.  It's -- it's a huge network --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of [inaudible].
L:  But you're right about not hearing too much about what's happening, 'cause I'm sure a lot is happening, you know, as we speak --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- but we don't know.
R:  I mean -- and we heard a lot when -- when the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nine eleven happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because there were a lot of peace -- ah, four peace people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who tried to get s- -- a lot of the information out about what the US Army has done in the past.
L:  Mhm.
