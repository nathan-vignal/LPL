R:  Hi, my name's Mike.
L:  Hi, Mike.  My name's Craig.
R:  Hi, Craig, how're you?
L:  Good thanks.
R:  So, are you a hawk or a dove?
L:  What's that? [MN]
R:  S- I wanted to cut right to the chase so I said, "Are you a hawk or a dove?"
L:  [LAUGH] A hawk or a dove.  Ah, I would have to label myself a dove, given those two choices, I guess.
R:  Yeah, those are, ah, [NOISE] those are pretty weak, ah -- they don't really fit a lot of people these days, I think.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  It's not a black and white world much anymore.
L:  And it's definitely not a black and white problem over there either.
R:  No.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I th- -- I like -- I like the fact that if any -- any country in the world is actually e- enough of a threat to justify a preemptive strike, it's clearly America.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, clearly, clearly we have more weapons, we have a bigger [LAUGH] army.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And we have -- and we've aggressed quite recently [LAUGH] against others in the world.  [MN] It's not hypothetical.  It's -- it's very clear, it's very well documented.  It's, ah -- it's -- it's very sad but, you know, if there were [COUGH] anyone that needs to, ah, to be knocked down and [MN] back to the stone age --
L:  [NOISE] Or th-
R:  -- fo- for the world's safety of course, only --
L:  Oh, yes, of course.
R:  -- then I would have to say it would be, ah, [LIPSMACK] America.
L:  Well, it might be nice if we were taken down a peg.  I -- I don't know what -- I -- I personally don't want to live in the stone age.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah ...
R:  Well, [COUGH] I was thinking about that today because, um, I was, um, volunteering at a [NOISE] high school in preparation for my teaching certification.  [MN] And I was looking around.  It's a pretty wealthy district and most of these kids -- I -- I was just sort of doing my, um -- at the same time I was sort of meditating on my Buddhist stuff and, ah, thinking about the kind of suffering that's going on in this classroom.  And the difference between the kind of suffering that they're going through and the kind of suffering that people who are starving or don't have a place to live or are ill, are going through.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, from a Buddhist perspective and -- in an -- I b- -- fully believe this, there is no fundamental difference in the suffering.  But it's almost like, and I don't know, maybe I'm way off on this, but it's almost like these, um, more abstract kinds of suffering, these more refined forms of suffering like socializing and, ah, dealing with information and -- and a- -- learning to live with a weird ego in a weird society that's very ego driven, that's more complicated and torturous [LAUGH] than the simple fact of physical needs that need to be met.
L:  [MN] Hm, like you almost paint it out like it's a choice between the two.  I mean ...
R:  Well, it's -- it's -- that's -- it almost seems --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like we've progressed from one to another.
L:  I think it's -- I think it's, um, [LIPSMACK] fair to say that physical need probably trumps the abstract ones.  But I don't think people who are wondering around with a lot of physical need are, you know, blissfully relieved of all the -- [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  -- all the suffering that the kids in your class go through.
R:  No, no, I -- yeah, it's not that --
L:  They just probably have a very different perspective on it.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Well, the thing about it is I guess I see  people are more willing to work together on those simple basic --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- needs.  They -- it brings a -- seeing people in that situation, [NOISE] seeing that kind of suffering brings out, ah, a reaction in a lot of people that's much more compassionate, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  And it seems like we've -- we've pretty clearly, ah, mastered most of that.  And if we really, really wanted to as a -- as a species, I think we could do a pretty good job of -- of more or less eradicating that on the planet. [MN]
L:  You mean eradicating famine and --
R:  Yeah, famine and housing.
L:  -- housing problems.
R:  Just that.  Just basically those two needs essentially and maybe, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- start to work on the health one.  But the funny thing is, instead of doing that we've gone on to this whole other complicated, ah, mess of, like [NOISE] how -- how titillated can we make our senses and how complicated can we make our social interactions?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And how much sooner can we get kids to start thinking about breeding?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I couldn't believe what I saw on campus today.  These little girls are, you know, between I suppose thirteen and seventeen and they all look like they're what I would have to say is nubile dressed.
L:  Right.
R:  This dress says -- well, not dress.  I mean, it's all shrink wrapped clothing with various parts exposed.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [NOISE] Extremely tight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And very exposed.  It was a cold --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rainy day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, cold for the Bay area.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah -- I mean, and they're not even conscious that they're more or less just hawking themselves.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  And -- and [COUGH] the guys, I mean, what are they going to do?  They're -- they're mostly testosterone.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's a crazy, crazy thing.
L:  It makes me wonder how much, ah, my parents might have, ah, looked at us, ah, you know, ah, ah, looked at me in that way or ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, I -- I -- I wonder.  'Cause I had the same experience.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I'm, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm thirty six and I look at girls in high school and college now and I think, "Good gosh, would you put some clothes on".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I think terribly old thinking that.  And I'm not very --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I'm not very old to be thinking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be feeling old for some thoughts.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I wonder is it really my age or is it that our culture has shifted so quickly?  Is it, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is it really that they're that, ah -- that it's -- that it's that, ah [MN] --
R:  It's like --
L:  You know.  I'm -- i- i-
R:  I have to say, I think it's -- I mean, I know exactly what you're saying 'cause I'm thirty five and -- but I don't feel that way because, I mean, the -- in terms of the, ah, questioning I have no doubts.  Because I [NOISE] -- I lived in a pretty, ah, [MN] pretty radical subculture for quite a while.  I was a punk rocker and a gothic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've been to a lot of S and M stuff and [NOISE] I've seen some pretty extreme examples of what can happen in our society.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But now, I mean, this is -- this is not a subculture, this is the mainstream.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  And it's being promoted by Britney Spears and that other s- [NOISE] Christine Aguilera.
L:  Well, being promoted by Pepsi Cola and [inaudible] Records.
R:  Oh, e- everybody.  Well, they're --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But the- -- it's not like the ar- -- the artists aren't making money off of it too.  [NOISE] Yes, the media's and the advertising, ah, industry --
L:  I just --
R:  -- is certainly --
L:  You know, I don't -- I didn't think -- I don't think the driving force behind it is Britney Spears.  I don't think she's sitting at home thinking, "Oh, okay, what kind of image should I push?"  You know?
R:  [MN] I -- you know, but I --
L:  [LAUGH]  Sh- --
R:  -- really wonder about Christine Aguilera.
L:  -- she's sitting at home thinking -- what's that?
R:  [NOISE] I really wonder -- okay, with Britney Spears I could because she's fairly talented.
L:  Right.
R:  But with Christine Aguilera it really seems like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- she's just blatantly pushing that envelope because it's there.  And that may not be because she wants to portray a pu- -- a certain image.  Maybe she just wants to be recognized and get more attention.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  But [MN] I de- -- it's really strange.  I mean, okay, w- -- now we're marketing to -- to more or less children, you know, elementary school children [MN] the kinds of, like -- the, um -- Abercrombie and Fitch got busted for selling G string thong underwear.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They did.
L:  They did?
R:  They -- they had to take it off their shelves.
L:  No kidding?
R:  They were selling it to nine and ten year olds.  No, they -- they --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- marketed it.  And that's a major --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- preppy chain.
L:  Right.
R:  These are not freaks and weirdoes and counter culture people who are experimenting with odd [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- lifestyles.
L:  Right.
R:  These are people who are basically preparing kids for their sexuality way before their body's even ready.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] And, I mean, in some respects I could see that American society is a little distant and removed from our biology.  Because let's face it, by eighteen it's been a couple years of -- of things lying fallow if nobody's breeding.  [LAUGH]
L:  What's that?
R:  I said [LAUGH] by -- by eighteen years old [MN] it's been a couple of years of things lying fallow if --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- if there's been no breeding.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that's a ripe, ripe breeding time.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And if we were really needing to be a robust species --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we would be taking full advantage of that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, we have all kind of +augmented --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or augmented, ah, aspects of our -- our society to take care of those --
L:  Right.
R:  -- needs like hospitals and all the modern ...
L:  Right.  Well, I've heard it argued though, that our -- our, you know, our minds and our culture have [COUGH] evolved much faster than our bodies have and that, you know, part of the psychological dilemma comes from bodies that just haven't -- haven't changed in -- all that much in a thousand years.  You know, and a thousand years ago, [MN] you know, eighteen was a good time to be breeding 'cause you weren't going to live past thirty.
R:  True, true.  Yeah, I -- I actually think it's -- it -- I think it's not that our minds have evolved, it's that [LIPSMACK] -- because I don't really see any fundamental change in our psychology and I see no fundamental understanding of our psychology.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I don't see that there's any improvement over the basic principle of human suffering.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And th- that technology has been around for thousands of years, in my opinion.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so there are principles by which people could live their lives.  And th- they do, you know, they do function in societies on rather large scales that, ah, allow a more -- more or less, um, [LIPSMACK] a society that's geared more towards the improvement of the human condition and less towards the pavement of the planetary condition.
L:  [MN] Right.  [LAUGH] So --
R:  And I -- I -- I mean, we have -- so now we have opportunities and we have complications that present, you know, more complicated, ah, mental situations.  But I don't see us responding to them any differently.  I mean, we still work on very basic territorial principles.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  A lot of biological principles --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, basically permeate politics.
L:  Yeah, I was just going to say.  So, speaking of which, ah, what should the [LAUGH] United States do about Iraq?
R:  What should they do about Iraq.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Well, I don't actually think it's about Iraq.  I think what the States should do is spend all their time and energy trying to fix -- get a separate state for Palestine.
L:  The Palestinian problem --
R:  An- and Israel.
L:  -- I was just going to say.
R:  And ge- -- and stop -- stop making money off selling weapons to Israel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And stop allowing them to behave in ways that o-
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other countries would never allow.
L:  I -- I think it's a -- I think it's a -- it's, ah, ah, sh- -- a sad and almost a crime that the media have -- have skirted around the Palestinian issue --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- completely.  Ah, first, you know, as we sent troops to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Afghanistan and now it seems likely we send troops to Iraq, they'll still ignore the Palestinian issue that's behind it all.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's very, very skewed and it's really hard for people, ah, to get a view of it.
L:  And it's ironic that, you know, when the -- when there were, ah, during, you know, the troubles in Northern Ireland --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there was plenty of American press coverage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and we knew everything that was going on in Belfast and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we had plenty of people sending money to the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, to the -- to, ah, IRA and other operatives because there were Irish here and in the United States we felt, you know, that that should be a separate state.
R:  Clearly, yeah.
L:  And people were engaged in it politically.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But the Palestinian issue which is, to my mind, has a lot of big similarities, ah, people A don't want to hear about it, B they don't want to think about it, C they don't want their money involved.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Except unless they're, um, Jewish or Israeli, yeah.
L:  Right.  Or Palestinian. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, Palestinians, there just aren't that many, I mean ...
L:  Yeah, I know, right.  They're badly outnumbered.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  It's a shame.  It is a shame and then -- and it's -- it's not like, ah -- I mean, actually I've seen some -- some reasonable -- reasonable, um, coverage.  But it's just the extent, you know.  And that's what -- I have a really good friend from, ah, Riad.  We, ah, we were in -- in school in Boulder together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And -- and it was [NOISE] really hard sometimes because there's this cultural gap where he really is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, just -- like he's been -- he's been d- -- indoctrinated to believe that there's a Zionist conspiracy against the Arab countries.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And, I mean, it's just a matter of, you know, seeing things from that bizarre perspective long enough and then you -- then you see everything from that bizarre perspective.  But on the other hand [COUGH] how can it b
