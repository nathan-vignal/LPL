R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, hi. [LAUGH]
R:  H- hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.  Happy holidays.
R:  And to you, too.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Uh, my name's Erin.
L:  My name is Sherrie.
R:  Sherrie.  Where -- I'm in California.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, wow.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh.  Cool.
L:  So, I guess this is long distance on someone else's penny. [LAUGH]
R:  Great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, I don't know if I have a favorite holiday, but since Christmas is coming I'm excited about Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I like ... I think one of the thi- -- the -- my favorite thing about Christmas is that, um, family -- my family always gets together.  Uh, we're kinda spread out, but we usually try to get together for Christmas.  And if not us then my husband's family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, that's probably my favorite thing about Christmas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And plus we always eat good food.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it's hard --
L:  That's always important.
R:  It's hard to complain about eating good food.
L:  Right.  And some time off from work, right?
R:  Right, definitely.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Well, actually, I'm -- I've just been finishing up my masters thesis and so I'm not working because I'm expecting a baby on Friday. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  Thanks.  Yeah.
L:  Is this your first?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Wow.  So, it's gonna be a -- it could be a Christmas baby.
R:  Yeah, it could be a Christmas baby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'll be our present.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what about you?  Did you -- do you have a favorite holiday or ...?
L:  Uh, you know what?  I never even gave it a thought, uh, [LAUGH] you know.  Um, I don't think I do.  Uh ... uh, I'm Jewish, so Hannukah doesn't sorta jump out.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so, no.  I -- I just look forward to the time off from work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so --
R:  And what do you do?
L:  I'm a dentist.
R:  Oh.  Wow.  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Do you have your own practice or ...?
L:  Mhm, yeah, in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, cool.  Um, and what was that other question?  If you could create a holiday, when and why and what for?
L:  Yeah.  They didn't give us much time to think about that one. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I've -- I've never thought of creating a holiday.  But it does seem like in the fall there -- there's an abundance, like from -- like September to December it seems like there's almost always a party going on or ... and I'm okay with that.
L:  [LAUGH] You're pro p- -- you're pro party. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, the winter, I guess the beginning part of the year doesn't -- although I guess we do have long weekends like for, uh, Human Rights Day and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it seems like right there in February or March there could be something.
L:  Right.  I think there's Presidents Day, but it's not a day off.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But I'm learning to look forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas more.  Usually I close the office down between, um, for that Friday after Thanksgiving.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that's a nice break.  Four days is, uh, a nice -- nice time, nice length of time to recharge your battery.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  And do you travel on your vacations or just, like, stay home, catch up on sleep?
L:  Uh --
R:  All those other things that need to be paid attention to?
L:  Usually I, uh, stay around and organize and catch up on things.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, not necessarily so much sleep, but there's always something to do.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, so there's always something on my list and I just started a practice three years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, it's still relatively new, uh, very busy, so -- in fact, at, uh -- like, this vacation I'm gonna touch up on the paint on the walls. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know, little things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Tighten screws on the dental chairs that are a little loose, you know.
R:  So, when you -- well, I guess this isn't necessarily about holidays, but when you started your practice did you have to come up with everything to get going or, like, did you have a -- a partner that went in on it with you or ...?
L:  No, it was just me.
R:  Wow.
L:  Just me.
R:  So, you had to have, like, start up and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- buy everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [SIGH] wow.
L:  Yeah.  But banks are always anxious to loan money at the --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- at the right rate.
R:  Especially -- especially, I'm sure, to -- I mean, being a dentist doesn't sound like too risky of a business venture.
L:  Well, actually, it's very expensive.  That's one of the most expensive ventures that you can go into.
R:  Really?
L:  Because of all the equipment.
R:  That's true.
L:  For example, for a physician, what do they st- -- need?  A stethoscope and an examining table, not much equipment.
R:  True.  That's true, but you guys have to be ready to scrape plaque and fill cavities and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whiten teeth and anything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, but --
R:  Are -- are we just supposed to keep talking until they interrupt us or ...?
L:  Yeah, it's ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they'll give us, like, a thirty second warning to say goodbye.
R:  So, is this just more than -- this is not your first call, I'm guessing?
L:  This is my second call.
R:  Second call.
L:  I had one last night, so I have one more.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, how did you get involved in the study?
R:  Um, my husband's in linguistics at, um, USC and he got an email about it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And he, um, kind of follows the -- I mean, he had heard of, uh, the -- is it Fisher?  I can't remember.  He had heard of the group that was doing the research.
L:  Right.
R:  And that --
L:  Yeah, this is -- I -- a friend of mine is, uh, doing this research.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, uh, that's how I got involved.
R:  Oh, right, you can --
L:  And so every -- every person at that place needs thirty people.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I spoke to someone yesterday.  I can't remember where she was from.  Um, the suburbs of Philadelphia, so that's why I -- I'm surprised that -- from California.  But, you know, it's amazing.  This study ten years ago wouldn't have such diversity in terms of location.
R:  Oh, no, not at all.  I think --
L:  You know?  Isn't that amazing?
R:  -- the Internet has done amazing things for getting -- just spreading the word of ...
L:  Right.
R:  Stuff.
L:  It has.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, but -- but, uh, as far as holidays, uh --
R:  I know, it's like holidays?
L:  Uh, I guess we can stick to that topic.  Um ... er, so --
R:  We have --
L:  I think there's too many holidays that are -- that lose their meaning.
R:  Oh, I agree with you entirely.  Like, it's all turned into another excuse to shop.
L:  Right, and cards and ...
R:  Or to advertise or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Hallmark or ...
L:  Yeah, right.  And everyone has the same complaint.  You know, in fact -- you know, especially Veterans Day and Memorial Day, I tend to wanna always stop and -- and pause and think and reflect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, you know, even though it is a -- well, Memorial Day at least is a day off, but, uh, it is, you know, definitely a more somber serious holiday.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder if they're gonna do something with, um, September eleventh.  I mean, it hasn't -- I mean, holiday kind of to me implies, you know, m- more festive, more fun times, but I know that they do have [NOISE] more -- the more commemorative holidays like Memorial Day and ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, on the calendar --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they always have Pearl Harbor Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess this would fall under that same category.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, who knows what will be with, uh, future calendars.  I think it would have to be something from the President to say this is now a h- -- I wouldn't want a day off.
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't wanna see that marred by, you know, people shopping and ...
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Plus you sorta just get back to work and school, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't really need that day off.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it -- and it's right after, uh -- is it right -- it's right after Labor Day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just a week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  We have -- we have a holiday that we celebrate just at my house.  It's not a real holiday, but it's, like, the day that my car broke that prevented me from moving and my husband and I ended up, uh, getting together, but I wouldn't want that to be a national holiday by any means. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, your car -- and that's how you met him?
R:  Well, no, we had known each other for several years, and we had actually dated previously, but I was moving out of town to start a new job, um, and my car had actually just come out of the shop and then it broke again.  And it wasn't like a -- a horrible car or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was just -- so I ended up staying a couple of days longer and we spent those couple of days together and --
L:  Oh, wow.  And that cemented the relationship.
R:  And -- yeah, and then we got married a couple of months later. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Wow.  So, I just came back.  I just walked in -- in fact, I'm still defrosting from, uh, our winter weather -- from dropping my car off at the shop.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, maybe there is someone ...
R:  Yeah, who knows? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But he's not preventing me from doing anything. [LAUGH] But, uh, who knows?
R:  So, did you guys get that humongous storm?
L:  Yeah, last -- last Wednesday?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We got, uh, hit pretty hard.  We got around seven or eight inches here in the city and, uh, it's still -- now it's all icy and chunky and ugly, but it was pretty and that was a day off.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In fact, I went -- actually I went in, but I didn't have any patients and I did paperwork.  And before I knew it was seven o'clock and dark out. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm a workaholic.
R:  Well, I -- I think that's okay.  [SIGH] It's okay to work hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's good to work hard.  Unless you don't want to.
L:  No, I don't mind it, but I have to learn how to stop and smell the roses, I guess, as everyone tells me.
R:  Yeah.  Now, are you from Philadelphia?
L:  The suburbs.
R:  The suburbs.
L:  Uh, just in between New York and Philadelphia, the suburbs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Hm.
L:  And how 'bout you?  Are you originally from California?
R:  No, actually, um, I grew up in Minnesota, then I went to school in Utah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's where I met my husband and then he's b- -- doing more school out here.  And he's from Texas, so ...
L:  Oh, wow.  So, you don't even st- -- even touch the East Coast.
R:  No.  But we did -- we did visit out there, uh, about a year, two -- a year and a half ago.  We loved it.  It was beautiful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We came --
L:  Where did you go?
R:  Um, we spent a couple of days in Washington D.C. [MN] and then we came -- we went to, uh -- we were in Pennsylvania for a little while.  Where did we go?  Did we go to Pittsburgh?  We went to Pittsburgh.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, we thought about coming to Philadelphia --
L:  That's -- Pennsylvania's a huge state, so --
R:  -- but we didn't make it.
L:  No?
R:  No.  Can't do everything.
L:  Yeah, and it's a huge state, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's on the other side.
R:  But it was beautiful.
L:  It is a pretty area.  I have no complaints.
R:  Green --
L:  Where in California are you?
R:  We are right outside of L.A., so, uh, the city itself I'm not too fond of, but I really enjoy the mild weather.
L:  Mhm.  Especially being from where you're from, jeeze.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] All I picture is Fargo [LAUGH], that movie.
R:  Oh, well, it's not that bad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm actually from Southern Minnesota, not that that makes a huge difference, but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right.  That's all the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But it -- it's green and hilly there and ...
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty.
L:  I've been to California and I've been to -- I've been skiing to Jackson Hole.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, so that's beautiful.
R:  Yeah, mountains and ...
L:  Yeah, so -- but that's as far as -- I've been to California several times but, uh, never actually to L.A.  I've been to San Jose and Anaheim.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
