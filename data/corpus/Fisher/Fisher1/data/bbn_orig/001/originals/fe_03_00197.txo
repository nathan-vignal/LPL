R:  Hi, my name is Gina.
L:  Hi, my name is Sheila.
R:  Hi, how are you doing tonight?
L:  I'm good.  How 'bout you?
R:  All right.
L:  Do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Um, I think it'd probably be a toss up between Halloween and Christmas.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Me too.  I like Halloween.
R:  I like Halloween 'cause it's a -- a very Celtic holiday and I like Christmas 'cause of all the giving gifts routine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not so much the getting, but I like the giving.
L:  Yeah, I do, too.  Although I was thinking when -- when the -- the phone call first came, when I was younger I thought Christmas was so commercial that I -- I rallied against it, but now that I'm older I don't seem to mind.
R:  I don't know, I think there's a little nostalgia in with the commercialism, you know?  You -- you -- yeah, the -- there's a lot of, um, selling you things, but at the same time you sort of -- I don't know, it doesn't look so bad [LAUGH] as you get older. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I -- I like, uh --
R:  Like, the garish light displays start to soften a little.  I -- I'm seeing them the same way I did when I was five.  They're just neat.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm running the electricity tally in the back of my mind, but I'm telling it to shut up, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  I enjoy how things look.  I like things that are pretty and colorful and, you know, it's the only time of year that [MN] sort of there's across the board attempt to make things look nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like offices and stores and people try to be cheerful and people try to be friendly.
R:  Sort of like there's two holidays in a way.  I mean, you have sort of this holiday of generosity and -- and good feeling and -- and the religious overtones, and then there's sort of the commercial holiday.  And I just kinda tell myself there's two holidays on the same day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  And -- and I like the one and -- and the other one is -- yeah, I could do without some of the, you know, gee, it's -- it's October first, time for Christmas.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  My -- my husband pitches a fit when that happens.
L:  Mine, too.
R:  [LAUGH] He can't stand it.
L:  I spotted some, uh, Christmas decorations in a store in July and I had to rush home to tell him that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's already started.
R:  He's pretty sure that the -- by -- by the time he's in his, like, seventies it'll be like December twenty seventh when they put them out for next year, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Like, three hundred and sixty three more shopping days.
L:  Right.  I think that's why I like Halloween.  It's because they don't -- there's no sort of other thing going on.  It's just really a good reason to have fun and people dress up and that's fun and ... I don't know, I think that, uh, it's all so colorful, like the orange and black.
R:  Lots of candy can't be beat either.  Any ex- --
L:  Yeah, although, I mean, that's a tough one to, like, have to eat, you know -- like, the candy's here so you end up eating --
R:  See, I just buy candy I don't like for the kids.
L:  That's what I did this year. [LAUGH]
R:  I either buy stuff I can't -- hate or stuff like Twizzlers, individually wrapped Twizlers.
L:  Right, I bought --
R:  How much trouble can you get in? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, I think they liked it better.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they seem to and ...
L:  The variety, like, I bought a big bag of all these assorted sweet things, like sour balls and gum and sweet tarts, and I don't like those things, but they -- they seem to be pretty happy.
R:  This year I didn't get any trick or treaters, but I give all the candy to my mom to take to her Sunday school class the next week, and they all were quite thrilled, so ...
L:  I didn't get any trick or treaters either, like five groups and I was really disappointed.  Where do you live?
R:  Uh, I live in a little community in Delaware, and -- and usually we get a few, but this year we had that whole sniper thing.
L:  Right. [COUGH]
R:  And, um, actually the -- the guy who -- who, like, gave the tip to catch the sniper was, like, from the area, so everybody --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- was sort of in a tizzy.
L:  That was frightening.
R:  And they had, um -- uh, we had, like, a couple of community parties, and I think most of the kids went to the community parties instead.
L:  Right.
R:  Although we normally get a handful or two, um, being a small -- small town with -- or village with walkways and parkways and, I mean, you can pretty much get to almost all the village with only crossing a, uh, like a road road once or twice, you know.  But --
L:  Right.  Do you have children yourself?
R:  No, no, just the cats, but ...
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I know if I'd had children and lived out there, I'd have probably been so freaked out --
R:  Well, I figured the chances that they were gonna be up in our little, tiny, little hamlet were pretty slim --
L:  Pretty slim, [COUGH] yeah.
R:  But, you know, people will -- I -- I didn't see as many people with their lights on either this year.  It just seemed a -- a little subdued, but hopefully people will be a little more Christmasy now that things have calmed down just a little.
L:  Right.
R:  Although there's that whole war thing, but, you know --
L:  You have to ignore it.
R:  People tend to ignore that at Christmas. [LAUGH]
L:  And so many people have been shipped out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hear there's a lot of military people and -- and a lot of my students actually are in the National Guard and -- and since the whole nine eleven thing that [COUGH] many people have gotten called up and it was -- it's very stressful for people.
R:  Yeah.  We've -- uh, around here there's a lot of drives to send stuff over to the troops, cards, uh, coupons for the wives, candy bars for the single soldiers, that kind of stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  But then again, being -- being in Delaware, we're not too far from Do- Dover Air Force Base and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, you have a pretty good, uh, troop contingency in the area.  So, what type of holiday would you like to create?
L:  Well, that's a good one.  I -- when -- when the question was asked, I thought, "Well, none, because we have too many already". [LAUGH] That's my feeling.  What's your feeling?
R:  I -- I wish we could [SIGH] -- I'd like to create a holiday that they couldn't commercialize if they tried, but I'm not sure how you'd pull it off.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  National stay home and bake cookies day, and they'd figure out a way to sell you cookie mixes, uh ...
L:  Right.
R:  Ah ...
L:  I heard about a -- a -- a -- I guess, um, a plan or it was a bumper sticker or something about a -- a day where you don't consume or you don't buy anything or you don't consume anything.  You know, sort of a non commercial day, just don't buy anything.
R:  That would actually be a kind of a nice holiday.  A whole -- a whole day with your family and nobody goes shopping.
L:  Right, right, and --
R:  And you can't give anything for it either.
L:  Right.
R:  You just sort of make do with things around the house.  It'd be kind of nice, but I don't think you'd get too many people to celebrate it. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  But ...
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  People are all into the -- the commercial side of Christmas.  Like, last year we decided to go to, uh, Bethlehem, P.A., for Christmas.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And the, uh, Christmas market was fabulous and all the lights and all that, and they were all j- -- you know, just like you expect.  You know, the tour groups all go up there.  But it was a big, massive thing, but in the end we found this little, tiny -- they have a custom of these little creches they do there, like the churches decorate them, the Moravian churches.
L:  Wow.
R:  And they tell the story of Christmas in these little, tiny creches.  And we found one -- we found out about one that was going to be in the back part of town, and we went and they were showing it for, like, three nights every weekend for the whole month.  They show it off to groups, and there were only four people in our group and yet, you know, like five or six people, all these kids and stuff, did the whole presentation just for us for free.
L:  Wow.
R:  And you're sitting there in these little folding chairs in this little, tiny basement and looking at this panorama that was easily, I'd say, twenty feet long by fifteen feet tall.  They had decorated the whole end of one room, and they had running water and little animals and lights and music and they would come out and recite things, and then the lights would flash on like this one little, tiny diorama scene and they'd read something and then they'd go to the next bit.  And there's just my mother, my husband, myself and, like, maybe one or two other people --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they're doing it all with the same passion that they'd do it for a hundred.
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  And when you're done, you can leave a donation if you want and they have a little, tiny room where they laid -- you -- they had baked cookies and you could buy a couple of cookies on your way out or a handmade candle.  And it was just sort of -- it was like the anti Christmas.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was nice.  It was my favorite part of the whole trip, even after doing the huge craft bazaar --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and the tour of the town with the costumed guide and the -- everything, you know, you're supposed to do, it was, like, yes, there you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  They -- they -- the -- you bought something --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- but you bought something that, you know, "I baked these cookies yesterday.  We hope you like them".
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  And it was -- it was -- it was kind of nice to see the holiday being celebrated on this small scale.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it was a big diorama, but it was very personal, and I don't know, most of the holidays -- like, Valentine's isn't even personal any more.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know how they've managed to pull that off.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You'd think, uh, they could keep Valentine's Day personal, but even it's turned into this ... I don't know.  My h- -- my husband thinks Hallmark Cards is behind all of them.
L:  Yes. [COUGH] They're very [LAUGH] -- very huge industry.  And I think, uh, you know, there's a certain amount of, uh, I don't know, trying to do the right thing, you know, feel like, well, I've gotta do something for Valentine's Day and then what is it gonna be and does it measure up?  And is it the kind of thing that, you know, you see on TV?  And, you know, it -- it's a lot of pressure [LAUGH] for people.  You -- there's no -- there's a sense you can't really be authentic and do your own thing.
R:  Nah.  I think I liked Valentine's Day better when I was, I don't know, five through about ten.  I had a -- we had family friends that had a son about the same age as I and every year we'd send each other one of those big Russell Stover hearts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, we started out with the small ones, but by the h- time we hit ten we were doing, like, the two pounders --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with the five pounds of lace on it and --
L:  Those are pretty.
R:  You know.  And I still have them.  I still have the empty boxes because the candy stunk --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and -- and we weren't in love, but the sentiment was pure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Happy Valentine's Day in shaky hand lettering and -- and a -- and the drug store candy.  It -- it wasn't [inaudible] and it wasn't a diamond and it was quite a bit nicer than both, you know.
L:  Yeah, I remember being very little and, you know, filling out the little, tiny Valentines to all your classmates and then on Valentine's Day everybody would, you know, come home with as many as you made from all your classmates.  That was nice.  That --
R:  And the decorating the Valentine's Day box usually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I liked that.  That was -- that was fun.  Nowadays, I don't know.  A lot of the schools around here, they don't do, like, a class Valentine Day swap.  You're l- -- 'cause I don't know, people were getting excluded or they were --
L:  Right.
R:  -- afraid they'd be excluded or ...
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I know I never quite received as many Valentines as I gave, but that's life.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Might as well learn that when you're seven. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's -- it's tough when you figure that out when you're, like, in your twenties.  It's a little more traumatic, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  It's very traumatic when [inaudible] not everybody's nice.  Not everybody's on the same page.
R:  That's one nice thing about the Christmas, though, is people do try to -- even if only for appearance's sake be nice for a little.
L:  Right.  I noticed that in the store the other day, that the sales people were just making an effort to be very friendly, and it was a stark contrast because [LAUGH] basically they're kinda not, but I liked it.  I thought, "I like it, even though it's fake and it's contrived, it's -- I like it".
R:  Well, the -- there -- there -- there's  a charm they have in -- in, uh -- or I've heard it when I went to Iowa and it's called the sincere con.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's when somebody's conning you but they're doing it with sincerity, and you can appreciate it.
L:  That's a good expression.  I'll remember that.
