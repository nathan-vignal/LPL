R:  Hi, my name's Joanne.
L:  Hi, my name is Sharon.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  I am in Boston. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you're in Boston?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I love Boston.  It's my favorite place sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But not in the wintertime. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  No, it's not so nice here now. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- I teach at the University of Pennsylvania here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, we are looking forward to an icy rainy day tomorrow, so ...
R:  Yup, same here.
L:  Oh, wouldn't it be nice if it just happened at the right time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] I wouldn't mind.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about holidays, huh?
L:  Yes, we are supposed to talk about holidays according to the instructions and creating a holiday, which I haven't thought about at all.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  Do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  I think that my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.
L:  Mine too.
R:  And why? [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Well, because it's not a religious holiday primarily.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think it's a great holiday 'cause it lets everybody participate.
R:  Hm.
L:  I like that part of it a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and it just doesn't seem to have quite the emotional baggage that some other holidays have, like Christmas.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But then I guess Thanksgiving and Christmas are about the only two I celebrate, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- [LAUGH] it's hard to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Yeah.  I think for me it would be Thanksgiving.  Um, I'm Jewish, so I don't have the Christmas thing to compare with.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, um, [MN] so it's really -- I -- I do that and I do, um, Passover with my family, but that is more, uh -- can get boring sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And Thank- -- I just really like to, uh, [MN] get together with my family, so I like that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I lived in Japan for six years and I, um, [LIPSMACK] learned about celebrating New Years, which I had never celebrated before.
R:  In Jap- -- a Japanese New Year?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Is it the same New Years as ours or ...?
L:  Well, no -- well, it's the same date.  It's the same calendar date.
R:  Yeah, so -- so what do they do in Japan?
L:  Well, they take off the first four days of the year, for one thing, and it's a time at the end of the year for deep house cleaning and --
R:  For what -- what cleaning?
L:  Deep house cleaning.
R:  Okay.
L:  And a lot of, uh, food preparation because you don't really do anything except eat and drink and talk to people for the first four days.  It's a very, very --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- very relaxing holiday. [LAUGH]
R:  Eat and drink [LAUGH] for four days?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's not constant eating and drinking, it's just that the food's all prepared.
R:  And the families all stay together?
L:  And they do.
R:  I mean, they all get together?
L:  No, they visit other people and visit other families.
R:  Oh.  I have never heard of that.
L:  Yeah, it's great.
R:  Huh.
L:  It's a very wonderful way to spend a four day period.
R:  Un- unlike our wonderful New Years here. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, it's very different because it's -- it's kinda more [PAUSE] I don't know.  I don't wanna say spiritual, but it -- it has -- it's a bit more serious as a holiday.  You know, people really --
R:  Oh, so New --
L:  -- do think about it.
R:  Yeah, and here New Years, I mean it's certainly not a family thing or anything that --
L:  No, not -- definitely not a family thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except maybe watching the rose parade or something.
R:  Right.  So, this other question about what -- what was it?  What holiday would you --
L:  Create.
R:  Oh, my goodness, gracious.
L:  [SIGH] [COUGH]
R:  I always think of solstice things.  I mean, for me it's like things that are sort of honoring the -- I don't know about honoring the seasons, but something kinda connected with nature.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, that seems like a reasonable kind of holidays.  We have some that are, um, connected with nature but very indirectly [inaudible], I suppose.  But, um, what time of year do you like?  Uh, if I had a holiday, I'd certainly like to have an earlier autumn holiday.
R:  Autumn?  I love -- autumn is my favorite.
L:  I wouldn't mind having a -- an Indian summer holiday.
R:  [LAUGH] I wouldn't mind having a thank God it's not hot any more --
L:  Yeah, that's a good one.
R:  And thank God I feel invigorated. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  But just -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well, something naturish and something in the right time of year, I think that would be nice.
R:  And it would have to involve people that I was close to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Either family or maybe friends, because there are all -- you have all these holidays that sort of you're supposed to be with your family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there's nothing that's really about being with friends.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, that might be cool.
L:  So, we could have it a -- a friendly autumn solstice midsummer -- I mean, uh, whatever.
R:  With -- with -- with, you know, I don't know, harvesting vegetables or something or ...
L:  With kind of a Thanksgiving idea but I like the friends part.
R:  But with friends, with friends, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like the friends part.
R:  'Cause the family stuff gets so loaded for so many people, it's such an intense heavy holiday.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So ...
L:  That's really true.  I wouldn't mind having a, um, hm, maybe a mental health holiday.
R:  A mental [LAUGH] -- and what would -- and what would that be?
L:  An official mental health holiday. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Tell me about that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, it could just be sort of a personal holiday, but a- an official one.  Everyone could just stay home.
R:  M- -- a mental health -- the mental health holiday.
L:  Yeah.  You w- -- you didn't have to do anything.  You don't have to cook a dinner.  You don't have to buy a present.  You don't have to be with anybody.  You can just, you know, check out.
R:  That's a -- that's a inter- -- I work -- for my work I work with, um -- I work with psychiatric patients, so --
L:  Oh, you do?  Wow.
R:  So, now you're giving me an idea --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] of asking people if you could have a mental health holiday what would it look like? [LAUGH]
L:  I think a mental health holiday would be just dandy.
R:  What would that -- what would that mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, it wouldn't mean work is that's what it wouldn't mean. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  I wouldn't mind.  What b- -- what -- are you associated with the hospital?
R:  I -- I work -- I work in -- in a hospital.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  North of Boston.
L:  Oh, north Boston?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I spent a couple of summers working at Harvard, teaching at Harvard.
R:  What did you teach?
L:  English as a second language.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I mean, I think having a -- a holiday where everybody sat at the -- you know, at a table outside and drink coffee and read the newspaper and just didn't have to do anything much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that would be pretty cool.  I wouldn't mind that at all.
R:  [LAUGH] The l-
L:  But, um, I don't know.  I like a nature holiday.  'Spose we should have a -- I don't want any winter holidays.
R:  No winter holiday.  Although there should be -- I -- I absolutely hate winter.  I am having such a hard time with this, and so if there was something --
L:  Maybe that's when we need the mental health?
R:  Well, or something.  And something that has fires and candles and [SIGH] oh, I don't know, anything to -- it's such a hard time of year, so anything to -- to reinvigorate me.
L:  Mm.
R:  Or -- or make me enjoy the winter.
L:  [MN] That's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- pretty hard to do, I'd say.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  I wouldn't mind, um, let's see.  Yeah, fires.
R:  [LAUGH] A- a- and as long as I didn't have to go -- that it wasn't hard to -- to get to whatever it was, that I didn't have to schlep around to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but that would be good 'cause there's nothing really.  There's nothing.  There's no cool holi- --
L:  I suppose the question would be do we need -- do we need any more holidays?
R:  Do we need any more holidays?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think we need meaningful holidays.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, I think a lot of the holidays we have aren't -- you know, they're days off but they don't really mean anything to most people.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I think.  I mean, at least to me.
L:  I've thought about that, too, because really we don't celebrate Labor Day.  I mean --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- I suppose about ninety nine percent of the people don't celebrate Labor Day or --
R:  Or Veterans Day or ...
L:  I suppose more people probably celebrate Veterans Day and Memorial Day.
R:  Yeah, I [MN] -- I -- you know, I think the only ones that I think I ever do are probably like the Thanksgiving and the other ones are just like days off from work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, and that's awful to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, some of the Jewish holidays are, but not many of them either, so ...
L:  Yeah, I think that's right.  I would like to have a ... hm.
R:  Hm. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe I just wanna retire. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you sound like you're kinda tired [LAUGH] like you need to relax.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't mind just retiring, maybe that's nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, that would be good.
R:  That's dangerous for me to even say.
L:  Yeah, well, especially, um ... [COUGH] yeah, I was gonna say especially with your work.  We don't want people like you to retire.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We need people. [LAUGH] Really, you need the work.  I don't need the work. [LAUGH] There's nothing life or death about my work.
R:  Do you work -- do you teach the English as the second language?
L:  Mhm, uh, y- yeah.  I'm -- I have a -- a position at Penn in the English language programs --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- which is, uh, just for international students who wanna study English.
R:  Oh, that sounds won- -- that's something I would love to do so much.
L:  Yeah, it's nice.
R:  I've thought about going back to school for it, but, uh --
L:  That's very nice.
R:  -- kinda late now, but, uh --
L:  Well, and -- and you wouldn't make any money compared with what you do, so ...
R:  That's what -- that's the other thing is, like, yeah, to go back to school and then not have a good income, but, uh ...
L:  Right.  Yeah, we definitely have to have a holiday where you don't have to give presents.
R:  Uh-huh, no presents.  N- no --
L:  I think -- I think presents are kind of loaded, too.
R:  No -- no presents, no pressure.
L:  No presents, no pressure.
R:  Other people, but just very s- --
L:  Only friends.
R:  Only friends, but very simple.
L:  Although a lot of people have friends in their family.  I mean, you know, they really like their families.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Right.  And that -- that's fine if it works, but, uh ...
L:  But for most people it's kind of difficult.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, friends are good.  Of course, that would really be troublesome for people who didn't have any friends, wouldn't it?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, yeah.  I mean, definitely.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um, it could be an optional -- an optional holiday.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Wouldn't it be nice to have a really meaningful national holiday?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I would like that.  We had in Philadelphia a -- I don't remember if it was one day or more than one day -- a volunteer day when --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- there was quite a lot of national attention on -- I don't know if it was Phila- Philadelphia only or se- several places, but it was really kind of very inspiring.
R:  Was that, uh, before or after September eleventh?
L:  Oh, much before.
R:  Yeah.  That's great.
L:  Some years before.
R:  That's -- that's a good idea.
L:  Yeah.  I like the idea of having --
R:  A holiday of, like, giving or something.  I mean, that's --
L:  Yeah, a whole national day of volunteering and we just stop every business --
R:  That's ...
L:  We turn off the clocks, and we go outside and do something nice.
R:  That's -- that's good.  Sort of a humanitarian give back to the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- holiday or something like that.
L:  Yeah, a day of giving back.  Although that's getting a little cliched.
R:  Right, right.  But you have --
L:  And a lot of people volunteer all the time, but it would be nice to do the whole country --
R:  Okay.  I like -- I like that idea.
L:  -- doing it all on one day.  How much could you get done if every single person didn't work and went out and did something good? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's -- that's a good idea.  You -- you should -- you should work on that one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You're in a university setting. [LAUGH] You can kind of [LAUGH] -- I like that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I'm -- I'm h- --
R:  That -- that's good.
L:  [NOISE] -- hearing my telephone. [NOISE] J- just one second.  I don't have any idea -- whoops.  Oh, yeah, okay.  I don't have to worry about it.  I just wanted to see who it was.
R:  I -- I -- I told my children there's no way they can interrupt me during this conversation. [LAUGH]
L:  I forgot how long this conversation is.
R:  Supposed to be ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes?  I don't -- I -- I think it m- must be coming to an end then -- then pretty soon.  Have you done this one before?
R:  I didn't -- I
