ALL RIGHT UH WHAT IS IT ARMS INSPECT- WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT  (fe_03_02616-A-0010)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02616-A-0011)
RIGHT BUT I THINK THAT'S THE THING IT'S THE WHOLE PREMISE OF GOING INTO IRAQ IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND THEY HAVEN'T PROVED THAT THERE ARE ANY AND THEY WERE IN THERE AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE CONTROL OVER IT  (fe_03_02616-A-0012)
AND IF THEY DON'T FIND ANY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN YOU KNOW WORLD OPINION IS STILL GONNA BE AGAINST THEM  (fe_03_02616-A-0013)
[SIGH] SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T DO YOU THINK THERE WERE EVER ANY IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_02616-A-0014)

SUPPORTIVE EVERYONE IS I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT WE GET FROM THE MEDIA IS TRUE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GONNA SHOW PEOPLE CELEBRATING AND BEING HAPPY  (fe_03_02616-A-0023)
THAT WE WON BUT UM  (fe_03_02616-A-0024)
WELL I GUESS THE THING WAS THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE U._N. INSPECTIONS  (fe_03_02616-A-0027)
AND THE U._S. CLAIMED TO KNOW MORE THAN THE U._N. DID AND MORE THAN THE U._N. COULD FIND SO THEY AGREED TO SEND IN THESE INSPECTORS AND THEN THOUGHT THAT THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING THEY DIDN'T FIND ENOUGH IN TIME OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_02616-A-0028)
AND THEN THEY WENT OKAY FORGET IT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WE DON'T NEED THE U._N. TO TELL US THAT AND IT'S TAKING TOO LONG AND THEY'RE NOT DISARMING SO WE'RE JUST GONNA GO IN BUT I THINK THE THING IS  (fe_03_02616-A-0029)
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BECAUSE  (fe_03_02616-A-0030)
THE U._S. HASN'T PROVIDED ANY SORT OF CONCRETE PROOF  (fe_03_02616-A-0031)
RIGHT AND I GUESS  (fe_03_02616-A-0032)
SINCE THE FIRST YOU KNOW IRAQ WAR WHATEVER IN NINETY ONE  (fe_03_02616-A-0033)
UM  (fe_03_02616-A-0034)
PART OF THE DEAL WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE WAS THAT IRAQ WAS SUPPOSED TO LET IN WEAPONS INSPECTORS AND THEN THEY KICKED THEM OUT LIKE AFTER FOUR YEARS  (fe_03_02616-A-0035)
SO IT'S STILL PART OF THE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0036)
AGREEMENT AT THE END OF THAT WAR THAT INSPECTIONS SHOULD GO AHEAD SO I GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE WAS A WAR NOW IN IN THE TERMS OF NINETY ONE  (fe_03_02616-A-0037)
THEY'RE STILL SUPPOSED TO GO IN SO I GUESS THEY SHOULD GO IN  (fe_03_02616-A-0038)
BUT IT'S JUST GONNA BE INTERESTING TO SEE [NOISE]  (fe_03_02616-A-0039)
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T FIND ANYTHING  (fe_03_02616-A-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_02616-A-0042)
I I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS SO YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVE THESE WEAPONS SO YOU WANNA PREEMPTIVELY MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING YOURSELF AGAINST THESE WEAPONS THAT YOU'RE CLAIMING THAT THEY HAVE  (fe_03_02616-A-0043)
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU START A WAR WHICH IS GONNA  (fe_03_02616-A-0044)
I I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S INTERESTING I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE I STAND  (fe_03_02616-A-0045)
I DON'T KNOW HI SORRY I GUESS UM  (fe_03_02616-A-0047)
[NOISE] I DON'T KNOW THEY THEY THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE THEY HAVE CHATTER FROM THE C._I._A. AND  (fe_03_02616-A-0048)
THIS AND THAT BUT I MEAN ACTUAL U._N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS SINCE THEY WENT IN AGAIN  (fe_03_02616-A-0049)
AFTER THE U._N. DECIDED SOMETIME YOU KNOW LAST YEAR TO SEND THEM IN THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE U._S. IS DOING IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHAT THEY'VE FOUND BUT AND I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0050)
WHY THAT BECAME SUCH AN ISSUE TODAY LIKE  (fe_03_02616-A-0051)
WAS IT SOMETHING THAT THEY  (fe_03_02616-A-0052)
FOUND AFTER TEN YEARS OR LIKE NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WEAPONS BUT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT BEFORE I REALLY I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THEY HAVE TO GO IN  (fe_03_02616-A-0053)
AND IT'S NEVER A BAD THING FOR THEM TO GO IN AND CHECK WHAT'S GOING ON  (fe_03_02616-A-0054)
AND I I THINK THAT THE THE U._S. HAS TO LET THEM IN HAS TO WANT THEM TO GO IN BECAUSE  (fe_03_02616-A-0055)
IF THEY DON'T THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE IT GOES AGAINST THEIR WHOLE CAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEY REALLY MUST WANT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING 'CAUSE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY'LL FOREVER BE WRONG EVEN THOUGH THEY LIBERATED THESE PEOPLE  (fe_03_02616-A-0056)
KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0058)
DOES DOES THE U._S. STILL HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION LIKE AREN'T THEY WE HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS RIGHT  (fe_03_02616-A-0059)
YEAH  (fe_03_02616-A-0060)
I DON'T KNOW I WISH I I REALLY I'M NOT CLEAR ON IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SO I READ SOMEWHERE THAT THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO THEN IT BECOMES YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0061)
IRAQ AND THIS DICTATOR AND WHATEVER CAN'T HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHILE THE COUNTRY THAT IS DISARMING THEM DOES  (fe_03_02616-A-0062)
BUT IT'S JUST THAT SORT OF WE TRUST OURSELVES NOT TO USE THEM BUT DON'T TRUST THEM LIKE WITH THE  (fe_03_02616-A-0063)
RIGHT WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE WESTERN COUNTRIES AND WE DON'T CARE AND I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0065)
IT COULD STILL ALL BE ABOUT OIL  (fe_03_02616-A-0066)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02616-A-0067)
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS NOW ARE THEY SENDING PEOPLE IN HAVE THEY STARTED  (fe_03_02616-A-0068)
I DON'T KNOW I REALLY DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0069)
I THINK THINGS WILL START NOW THAT THE WAR IS OVER  (fe_03_02616-A-0070)
BECAUSE THE WAR ACCOMPLISHED  (fe_03_02616-A-0071)
I DON'T KNOW GETTING YOU KNOW LIBERATING PEOPLE AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BUT THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY WEAPONS  (fe_03_02616-A-0072)
MHM  (fe_03_02616-A-0073)
AND I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS NOW THAT THERE ARE THESE EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS AND STUFF THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THESE SUPPOSED PROGRAMS BEFORE WHO ARE TURNING THEMSELVES IN  (fe_03_02616-A-0074)
SO THEY'RE GETTING MORE INTELLIGENCE FROM  (fe_03_02616-A-0075)
UM YOU KNOW THE EXPERTS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO TRACK DOWN BEFORE  (fe_03_02616-A-0076)
BUT I THINK THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE  (fe_03_02616-A-0077)
NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEY THINK SYRIA IS PROTECTING THEM AND MAYBE KNOWS SOMETHING ELSE SO  (fe_03_02616-A-0078)
IT'S SORT OF LIKE THEY'VE STARTED SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO FINISH IT  (fe_03_02616-A-0079)
SO  (fe_03_02616-A-0080)
I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0081)
[LAUGHTER] A WHILE I THINK I MEAN IF THEY FIND ONE THING IT'S JUSTIFIED IN ALL OF IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING WE NEVER HOPE  (fe_03_02616-A-0082)
I GUESS LIKE BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS NERVE GAS THEY SAID THEY HAD V._X. AND I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0083)

THAT TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THERE WAS A LOT OF YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE  (fe_03_02616-A-0087)
I GUESS ANYTHING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL WARFARE IT'S MASS DESTRUCTION YOU CAN YOU KNOW WIPE OUT A WHOLE POPULATION  (fe_03_02616-A-0088)
AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TOO I GUESS  (fe_03_02616-A-0089)
THAT'S THE ONE I'M KIND OF HAZY ABOUT 'CAUSE I BUT THE THING IS I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF THE U._S. HAS CHEMICAL WEAPONS  (fe_03_02616-A-0090)
YOU KNOW NERVE GAS AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF BUT I MEAN HELLO WE DID USE A NUCLEAR BOMB ON YOU KNOW JAPAN IN WORLD WAR TWO  (fe_03_02616-A-0092)
AND IT'S NOT GONNA GO AWAY SO I'M SURE THEY'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE I DON'T KNOW I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS I WISH I HAD MORE OF AN OPINION  (fe_03_02616-A-0093)
I THINK THE WHOLE DEAL IS THE WEAPONS INSPECTION NOTION CAME FROM THE FIRST IR- IRAQ WAR THE GULF WAR  (fe_03_02616-A-0094)
AND NO ONE ELSE IS BEING INSPECTED IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IRAQ WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE THESE WEAPONS AND AFTER THE WAR PART OF THE AGREEMENT YOU KNOW WAR IS OVER HERE IS THE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02616-A-0095)
TREATY AND THE AGREEMENT OF PEACE PART OF IT WAS LET WEAPONS INSPECTORS IN AND I THINK THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE TOO BECAUSE THEY LET THEM IN THEY STARTED DOING THEIR WORK THEN THEY KICKED THEM OUT LIKE  (fe_03_02616-A-0096)
