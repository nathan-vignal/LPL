OUR PRESENCE RIGHT  (fe_03_02633-B-0010)
I DON'T THINK WE NEEDED TO DO ALL THAT WE'VE DONE  (fe_03_02633-B-0013)
I MEAN WE HAVE A WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE GOVERNMENT WITH  (fe_03_02633-B-0015)
WITH A LOT OF RESOURCES I DON'T THINK IT WOULD I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN AS MUCH AS WHAT IT DID TO AH  (fe_03_02633-B-0016)
TO RESOLVE I MEAN THEY STILL HAVEN'T RESOLVED IT BUT TO AH TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION AN- AND YET THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND ANY  (fe_03_02633-B-0017)
ANY NUCLEAR WARHEADS  (fe_03_02633-B-0018)
SO  (fe_03_02633-B-0019)
RIGHT RIGHT SO I GUESS MY POINT IS AS FAR AS OUR INVOLVEMENT OVER THERE I I I I THINK IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE TO  (fe_03_02633-B-0020)
BE INVOLVED BUT NOT TO THIS EXTENT THAT WE HAD TO GO TO WAR AND EVERYTHING I MEAN  (fe_03_02633-B-0021)
WE SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND AH  (fe_03_02633-B-0022)
YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEEDED TO PROVE THAT WITHOUT GOING TO WAR [NOISE] AN- AND OBVIOUSLY GOING TO WAR STILL HASN'T [SIGH]  (fe_03_02633-B-0023)

I'M NOT I'M NOT AH I'M NOT ANTI WAR BUT I'M JUST SAYING IT'S IT'S IT'S A GOOD THING BUT THE PROBLEM I FEEL  (fe_03_02633-B-0028)
IS THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO GO TO WAR OR IF WE WERE GOING TO GO OVER THERE TO TAKE CARE OF TERRORISTS WELL THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE OBJECTIVE AND THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN A GOOD REASON FOR THAT WE WENT OVER THERE TO BECAUSE  (fe_03_02633-B-0029)
THERE WAS NO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WITH THE SITUATION OF THE AH OF THE MASS DESTRUCTION WEAPONS  (fe_03_02633-B-0030)
AND IN THE PROCESS WE DID WE'VE ELIMINATED TERRORISTS BUT IT'S THE WHOLE IDEA THAT WE WENT OVER THERE FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE  (fe_03_02633-B-0031)
ON PAP- [NOISE]  (fe_03_02633-B-0032)
SET OUT TO BE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DIDN'T  (fe_03_02633-B-0033)
I I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  (fe_03_02633-B-0034)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02633-B-0035)
HONESTLY WANTED IT US TO GO OVER THERE TO TO JUST CRACK DOWN ON TERRORISM BECAUSE IRAQ HASN'T BEEN A TERRORISTIC THREAT TO US  (fe_03_02633-B-0036)

I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR WHAT WE INTEND TO DO  (fe_03_02633-B-0044)
BEFORE WE SEND THAT KIND OF MONEY AND THAT KIND OF FIRE POWER AND MANPOWER INTO A COUNTRY ALL BECAUSE  (fe_03_02633-B-0045)

WE SAY THAT THE THESE THESE WEAPONS EXIST  (fe_03_02633-B-0047)
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THEM AND THAT'S PRETTY UNCONVINCING TO HAVE SPENT AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE AND TO HAVE SPENT SPEND THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN SHORT IT'S  (fe_03_02633-B-0048)
IT'S JUST RATHER UNCONVINCING THOUGH IF YOU ASK ME  (fe_03_02633-B-0049)
