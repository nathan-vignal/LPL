I HATE THEM GROWING UP IN A WORLD THAT'S SO SCREWED UP  (fe_03_02637-A-0040)
I KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD'S HAPPENED SOMEWHERE ANOTHER  (fe_03_02637-A-0042)
I THINK IT BOILS DOWN TO WHERE THEY KICKED IN THE CHILD ABUSE LAWS AND ALL THAT WE'VE LOST CONTROL OF OUR KIDS  (fe_03_02637-A-0043)
YEAH  (fe_03_02637-A-0044)

YEAH  (fe_03_02637-A-0047)
NO IT'S NOT  (fe_03_02637-A-0049)
BUT IF THEY DON'T TAKE HIM OUT OF POWER THEY'RE SET DOWN THERE AND BUILD ALL THESE WEAPONS AGAINST US THAT ARE  (fe_03_02637-A-0050)
THEY COULD JUST TOTALLY WIPE US OUT WITH ONE BLOW  (fe_03_02637-A-0051)
WELL I THINK THEY SAID THEY FOUND A FEW THE FIRST COUPLE OF NIGHTS THE WAR HAD STARTED STARTED THAT THEY HAD SHOT A FEW OF 'EM  (fe_03_02637-A-0052)
ACTUALLY LAUNCHED THEM BUT  (fe_03_02637-A-0053)
ALL THESE ONES THAT THEY SAY HE HAS SITTING BACK READY TO USE ON US IT'S FUNNY WE CAN'T FIND 'EM  (fe_03_02637-A-0054)
YEAH IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME  (fe_03_02637-A-0057)
AND WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST ABOUT ALL THAT  (fe_03_02637-A-0058)
IS THE MORE WE GO TO WAR WHICH IS LIKE THE THIRD WAR  (fe_03_02637-A-0059)
SINCE I'VE HAD MY KIDS  (fe_03_02637-A-0060)
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WANT TO RUN TO WAR  (fe_03_02637-A-0061)
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE IS THAT SENDING TO OUR KIDS BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET OLDER THEY'LL ALL BECOME DICTATORS LIKE SADDAM AND THINK WELL WAR'S THE ONLY ANSWER  (fe_03_02637-A-0062)

AND HE BROUGHT UP THE WHOLE NINE ELEVEN THING  (fe_03_02637-A-0066)
I THINK HE DONE THAT JUST TO GET ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND GET THE WAR STARTED  (fe_03_02637-A-0067)
AND ONCE THE WAR HAD STARTED HE DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE HELL WE FEEL  (fe_03_02637-A-0068)
WHICH MAKES US JUST AS BAD AS THEM  (fe_03_02637-A-0069)
