BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE POOR AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD GIFTS  (fe_03_02646-A-0069)
SO [SIGH]  (fe_03_02646-A-0070)
IT THE MEANING OF THE HOLIDAY BECOMES COMPLETELY DIFFERENT I WOULD SAY  (fe_03_02646-A-0071)
AS OPPOSED [SIGH]  (fe_03_02646-A-0072)

A LOT OF GOODS ARE MARKED DOWN  (fe_03_02646-A-0098)
I- IMMEDIATELY AFTER CHRISTMAS  (fe_03_02646-A-0099)
BECAUSE IT'S THE END OF THE ECONOMIC YEAR  (fe_03_02646-A-0100)
[NOISE] SO THEIR THEIR PRICES THEY THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ALL THEIR STOCK IN THE AND AND SO THEY USE  (fe_03_02646-A-0101)
THEY USE THE HOLIDAY AS A MEANS OF MARKETING THE REST OF WHAT'S LEFT ON THEIR SHELVES [SIGH] AND IT KINDA IT'S KIND OF CONTORTED BECAUSE PEOPLE [SIGH] ARE TRYING TO GO OUT AND BUY THEIR FAMILY GIFTS BUT UM IN ACTUALITY I MEAN  (fe_03_02646-A-0102)
