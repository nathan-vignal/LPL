OH ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I UH HAVE FOLLOWED IS FOR THE LAST UH  (fe_03_02608-A-0006)
YEARS EVER SINCE THE G- FIRST GULF WAR WE'VE CONTINUED TO BOMB THERE AND MOST OF THE U._S. POPULACE HAS BEEN UNAWARE THAT WE'VE BEEN BOMBING THE WHOLE TIME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02608-A-0007)
SO  (fe_03_02608-A-0008)
IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE NEWS ONCE IN A WHILE WOULD CARRY IT AND THEY UM  (fe_03_02608-A-0009)
UH IT WAS JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_02608-A-0010)

AND UH THAT WAS ONE REASON I WAS NOT REALLY SURPRISED BY THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH ATTACKS AS WE  (fe_03_02608-A-0012)
OUR GOVERNMENT WAS CONTINUING TO BOMB FOR YOU KNOW A DOZEN YEARS OR SO  (fe_03_02608-A-0013)
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S MADE OUR SOCIETY A LOT MORE STABLE IS THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD  (fe_03_02608-A-0015)
THE BROAD DISPARITIES YES WE'VE HAD A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE AND WE'VE HAD POOR PEOPLE BUT OVERALL UH WE'VE HAD MOBILITY THAT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02608-A-0016)
JUST GETTING OUT OF SCHOOL IS IN THE LOWEST TWENTY PERCENT OF INCOME AND THEN AS THEY WORK THEY MOVE UP AND WHEN THEY RETIRE OFTEN THEY'RE BACK DOWN  (fe_03_02608-A-0017)
AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE MOVE BACK AND FORTH SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UH  (fe_03_02608-A-0018)

UH YOU DON'T HAVE THE MOBILITY YOU'RE BORN IN THE LOWER CLASS YOU STAY IN THE LOWER CLASS YOU'RE BORN RICH YOU STAY RICH  (fe_03_02608-A-0021)
THAT'S BEEN A REAL DIFFERENCE HERE I THINK UM  (fe_03_02608-A-0022)

AND EVEN AS THE TROOPS WENT IN THERE AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY'D COME ACROSS SOMETHING AND UH THEY WERE  (fe_03_02608-A-0030)
OVERLY THEY WERE VERY CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT PEOPLE TO BE HURT  (fe_03_02608-A-0031)
UH IF THEY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WAS DANGEROUS SO THEY'D GET A LOT OF FALSE POSITIVES AND THAT WOULD GET REPORTED IN THE MEDIA AND THEN LATER YOU'D HEAR NO IT REALLY WASN'T  (fe_03_02608-A-0032)
YOU KNOW THEY LIKE ONE OF THE LATEST ONES WAS A BARREL OF STUFF THAT THEY SAID OH THIS MIGHT BE NERVE GAS OR MUSTARD GAS OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_02608-A-0033)
AND UH ESPECIALLY THERE'S MISSILES AROUND IT AND AS THEY  (fe_03_02608-A-0034)

ANY EVIDENCE YET OF THE WHOLE  (fe_03_02608-A-0038)
RATIONALE GIVEN FOR THE WAR  (fe_03_02608-A-0039)
WHICH UH TO ME IS DISTURBING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_02608-A-0040)
WENT AFTER THIS WITHOUT THAT  (fe_03_02608-A-0041)
