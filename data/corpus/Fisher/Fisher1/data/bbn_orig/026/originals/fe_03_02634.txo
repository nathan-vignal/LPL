L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Um, my name is Andrew. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Tiffany.
L:  Tiffany, nice to meet you.
R:  To meet you.
L:  Um, okay.  It's the first time you've done this?  It's not -- this is the second time for me.
R:  This is the second time for me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well the first one was really awkward.  It was like, "Oh, hello this is weird".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  So, ah, what was th- the topic?  Wh- w- -- should Iraq be -- should we be dealing with Iraq?  Is it a priority?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, that sort of thing.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  What is your opinion on it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I used to be totally against it [SIGH] but now I'm -- I'm ah, [SIGH] I'm mixed and I get really mixed feelings about it.
R:  [SIGH] I'm kind of the same way.  I -- I was really against it when we were first going in and I thought it was really kinda stupid that we told them our entire plan of action and -- [LAUGH]  Like, "We're going to go in and do this, and then this, and then this".
L:  Ri- --Right.  Yeah.  I -- I just was [SIGH] -- I was like, "Wait a minute, what's -- this is just" -- I -- I just thought it was so absurd, it was just so obvious that they're doing it for [PAUSE] ulterior motives an- -- and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- this whole thing about like chemical weapons was just a big facade, which it probably still is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah, -- um, I don't know.  I just -- I'm just glad it was over as fast as it was and, you know, not as many people got hurt.  I thought it was going to be like another Vietnam times ten.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I was like -- you know, "Oh, this is going to be -- this is going to be a nightmare, everyone's -- like everyone's going to hate us.  Like they already hate Americans, now they're going to really hate us".
R:  Yep, that's exactly how I felt.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was just like, "Why are we even going in here?"
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  "Why are we sending our people out to -- to do some personal vendetta [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- against them?"
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it almost was like a personal -- like, you know, "Daddy, I'm gonna --"
R:  It was like Bush was just going to go --
L:  Ye- -- yeah.
R:  -- and do what he wanted to do and here we go.  And I've never been a very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- political person.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Like I'm very apolitical --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't vote.  I don't [SIGH] usually keep up on politics.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's kind of a matter of, "Why are we doin' this?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah, I just thought that -- I also -- like I had -- I'd gotten laid off and I we- -- I was just thinking, "This is just a -- just -- just a big distraction from the real issues that are going on here".  [SIGH]  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was just like -- well you plug all that money when they -- you know when they said it was going cost [NOISE] like seventy billion dollars, like, seventy to ninety billion.  [SIGH]  Like, you know, if you spent -- I guess they did a study if you spent, I don't know, how many billions of dollars, like even half of that much, you'd be able to give everyone in this country health care.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was like, "Come on" you know -- an- -- an- -- and you could -- you know , re-stimulate jobs or create, um, you know, ah -- you kn- --I mean educate poor people.  It's just -- it's just so -- look th- -- to me it's like such an absurd thing in the big -- in the long run, like in the big picture.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  [NOISE]
R:  Why -- why spend all that money to go to [NOISE] war --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- instead of -- and I -- I mean it very well could have and still could, I think, turn into a World War Three, I mean -- we --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought that too.  I thought we're -- well, it's going to be kind of -- maybe beginning of World War Three, with like Russia and -- and France against us --
R:  We've got so many countries pissed with us [LAUGH] because of this.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I guess we just kind of muscled our way -- you know, it's just so funny how we ended up with just muscling our way through again and everyone just being so kind of, um, you know, non -- non violent, but you know, it's almost like violence, [NOISE] you know, wins in the end --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in -- in some weird way.  At least now, I mean in the -- [SIGH] you know -- I think in -- in the other world -- after world or whatever there is [SIGH] I think we're [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think [LAUGH] there's going to be -- people are going to be paying for their deeds.  I -- I -- I truly do.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- an- and, um, so  [NOISE]  I don't know, ah, that's my take.  [LAUGH]  I can't even talk -- you know, it's like you can only talk -- I really talked about this thing so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my own head -- in my own -- like I had the conversation with myself for so long now that [NOISE] now I -- I'm just -- like I just want to move on and not want to think about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, when it first started, like everybody I met was against it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were all against the war and I just said, [SIGH] "I don't know anybody who is for this war".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I said that to my mom and she was like, "Well, I think it's a really good thing and we're going in there.  We need to support the troops" and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think once it became -- like once the troops were in and -- an' like all these people got behind it but before that -- like what -- if you asked a normal -- like a person who had any intelligence, you know, like, "Why are we going to war?"  [SIGH]  I -- I -- I mean I can't imagine, ah -- like -- like Americans going, "Well, um, because -- 'cause of terrorism.  We need to get rid of those guys".  And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean it was really -- they really -- there was no rea- -- I mean really was no good reason --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- this whole chemical weapons thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if they don't find them now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- an- -- and then if they're get in the hands of someone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who k- -- who's like really -- like willing to use them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, on the terror- -- terrorist kind of level that I think we're just going to be in deep shit.  We're going to look like buffoons an- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like as if we already haven't but, you know, um --  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think -- I -- I don't know.  I think if we were gonna do the war we probably [NOISE] shouldn't have given him as much warning as we did.  [SIGH]  It should be like, "Okay, you can leave now".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  They gave them --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- kind of, ah, time they -- to -- to get ready to get out an' -- [SIGH] but it's weird -- did you hear about like -- then I -- I hear these weird things, like, ah, you know, they were bad guys, I mean -- like hi -- his son was this total freak -- he like, when they -- like when they [MN] went into one of his palaces they found a bunch of heroin with all these needles --
R:  Um.
L:  -- all this pornography.
R:  I didn't hear that one.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I heard it on like the, ah, NTR -- like -- like two weeks ago --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, like three weeks ago.  They -- it was like the -- one of the first things they said and, um, with all this money like stuffed in walls and he was -- they were just total -- just -- ah, just, players, like --
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- players.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Huge players you know, like you won't believe.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, they just -- were just fucked up.  I mean it started -- it started first they stole, you know, all the money from the people and they were doing this sort of thing.  [SIGH]  But I don't know if it's our business to go in there [NOISE] and y'know straighten them out.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know why we think it's automatically us that's gotta [SIGH] -- you know, people in favor of the war all the -- all along were saying, "Well, we've gotta protect ourselves".
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH]  Like, how are we protecting ourselves?  They're half way around the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're not really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, yeah they might have the nuclear weapons but, ah, we gave them enough warning that if they had them they took them somewhere else.
L:  Right.
R:  Or hid them --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that we couldn't find them.  I mean -- well, I don't -- I don't know.  It was funny, you know, we -- we said, "Get out of the country or we're gonna attack".  Well, [SIGH] we're attacking on the basis that this guy was so horrible to his own people [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that he, you know, tortured them and raped them and this and that and the other thing.  Why did we think that he was gonna leave the country to save the destruction?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I --
R:  I mean we were kind of aiding him in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- killing his people and --
L:  Yeah, we gave him --
R:  -- making their life miserable.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- funny when you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there you look at like right back in the eighties and Donald Rumsfeld meeting personally with Saddam Hussein, like shaking his hand and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- do -- do you know about that story -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the back story of this?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He actually, yeah, wh- -- when they were in the Iraq Iran war we were supporting Iraq and Donald Rumsfeld, like, there's pictures of him shaking Saddam Hussein's hand --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like in nineteen eighty four.  No, ser -- and it's like -- it's -- seriously.  People just [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these people have such a short term memory --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, ah, [NOISE] and we -- we actually gav- [NOISE] I mean, this has never really made the mainstream media but we actually [SIGH] -- we gave Saddam Hussein chemical weapons.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we actually did.  We sold him chemical weapons.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's not surprising in the least.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  And the- -- then I mean the bottom line is, I think actually they [NOISE] forgot about, um, Israel and how they were really, really, really for us going in there.  [NOISE]  They really wanted it.  They were like -- that was -- I think that was one of the main reasons why we went in there -- we went in there and no one really talks about.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  It --it was an Israel, like, factor -- the fact that they, um [NOISE].  It's -- it's kinda like [NOISE] it's going to create a balance in their favor when we're there, like [NOISE] dominating Iraq and, you know, occupying them.  [SIGH]  So  [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you know, no one ever talks about that.  [NOISE]  Yeah, talks about -- everyone talks about oil --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but no one [NOISE] talks about like the whole geopolitical strategy.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, there's -- you know, we never -- we're [LAUGH], "What's on TV tonight?"  [SIGH]  So, 
R:  Yeah.  I pretty much gave up reading about it in the paper after the --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- second day and --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's like, "Oh, more war stuff".  All right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's sad [NOISE] you know people are like -- an- -- and it's so weird -- p- -- part of me is like when you hear all these people [NOISE] you know, we live like -- you know, they're like -- they're even- -- and someone's like, we went in there and we liberated them from this ruler but now they're all, "Get the fuck out of our country".  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They really are now, "Come on.  We hate you".  It's so weird, it's such a -- like, all right you -- you're never going to make -- these people are never going to be happy, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  No.  I mean we came in and we said that, "This is not a war against you.  We were just --you know, we're just hunting your ruler" now an -- [LAUGH] but wh- -- who -- I mean who was it against if it wasn't against them?  We're in there killing them, you know, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether we wanted to or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're in there bombing their buildings.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  We're in there distrup-
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- disrupting their lives completely but, "Don't take it personally".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would they -- one person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, or, you know, a bunch of people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lay a bomb on us and it's the end of the world.
L:  [NOISE].  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But we go into some country and cause mass destruction and it's just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- us doing justice to the rest of the world.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right. [NOISE]
R:  It just baffles me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's strange.  Are you calling from the West Coast, or ?  [NOISE]
R:  I'm actually in Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, Wisconsin.  Okay.  All right.  [NOISE]  It's kind of late for -- it's not too late for you guys.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, yeah, I notice a tin- -- I actually kind of noticed a tinge of [PAUSE] Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Are you from Madison?
R:  [SIGH]  Ah -- actually, I'm from near Green Bay.
L:  Green Bay.  Wow.  P- -- Packers?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Where are you from?
L:  [LAUGH]  Go Packers!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, you're not -- are you a Packer?  You watch football?  You don't sound like someone who's a Packer.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Oh, you --
