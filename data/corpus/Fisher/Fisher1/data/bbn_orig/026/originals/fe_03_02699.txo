R:  Ah, Yolanda.
L:  Patricia.
R:  Um, [LAUGH] if I have a favorite holiday? [NOISE] It would probably Christmas. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Mine too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It could have. [COUGH]
R:  Wha- -- what -- why is that?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, just -- it's so spiritual, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just you get together as a family, and you feel just the holiness of it and everything an- -- and, um, the presents and the trees and the decorations--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] everything, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what about you?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, I feel that way too.  Um, I think for the most part of Christmas has always been special 'cause it's probably one time a year everybody can get together and celebrate.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Celebrate the -- the holiday, and basically celebrate ourselves as family and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- spirituality of it all.  And you know, where I live it snows, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, you get the whole white Christmas 
L:  Right.
R:  -- scenario [LAUGH] and you know, and I've got kids so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just that, you know, this is the tree and the presents and trying to get them to go to bed on time.  Oh, it's just -- it's funny.
L:  Oh, and Santa Claus makes it nice too.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  If -- if he's Santa Claus and --
R:  And -- and you know, it -- it's probably the one time a year that you're able to get a -- I think, you know rec- -- if you haven't recognized anybody for something they've done, or this is that, you know, I appreciate you, that's -- I guess the best time to do it if you haven't done it.  You should do it everyday, I think, but that's the best time, I think.
L:  It's also a time where, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you talk to people, or you've kind of like +keep -- keep contact with people you don't normally, like you know, you send Christmas cards to somebody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you wouldn't normally -- that you don't see everyday, or talk to everyday.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Whatever, and [NOISE] it's just a good way to let people know you care about 'em, you know 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's the one chance you get to buy somebody something if they want, you know, I wanna get 'em something and that. [NOISE]
R:  That's true, that's true.  I -- I'd do that as well if --you know, i- -- if, you know, you may not talk to that person for most of the year, and yet you know, I need to send 'em a card, let 'em know I'm still alive [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm still here and I'm thinking about 'em.  So, yeah, that is a good way.  If you could think of a holiday, what -- what kind of holiday would you create? [NOISE]
L:  Um, it's a tough one, I really [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I know, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know.  What 'bout you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Me, uh, I don't know.  It's kind of hard to say if -- well, we've got Arbor Day and Earth Day, and we've got all of --
L:  I know that's hard, there's so many of them.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, I don't think we -- you know, other than -- it -- it -- I wouldn't necessarily recreate a holiday, but I would like more -- you know, like I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Christmas is my favorite holiday.  [NOISE] I think I'd like more to happen with the holiday, like you know, you -- you have times that people are still warring or fighting at Christmas.  That might be the one time they might decide not to, or they might decide to kind of tone it down a little bit, you know?  I think that would be a time I would -- I think I would -- I would like to see true peace on Earth where -- you know, there weren't a lot of conflicts, where -- where people could actually sit down and think about what they're doing, you know?  So, I -- I guess I would -- I f- -- I would try to find a way to increase it, not necessarily create another day for it 'cause, believe me, I think we have days for everything. [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just -- you know, it's a difficult thing.  I just think I would take a holiday, or like Mother's Day or something.  Take a holiday and kind of, um, do a little more to it, something that we have never fully achieved, and try to achieve for that, I guess. [NOISE]
L:  And then Easter is a good holiday, too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, right, right.
L:  Easter's really nice.
R:  Easter's very nice.  It's a very -- that is, um, in my opinion, I -- I think [NOISE] more --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- people are, um, uh, it's more spiritual to me in that realm, you know.  I know it's spring and --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- Easter bunnies, all that's all well and good 
L:  It -- it's nice if the weather's nice, too. [LAUGH] We have the spring weather --
R:  Well, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] it doesn't really work when there's like still snowing out and --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- the spring's that --
R:  Well, yeah, well you know this -- this year it didn't do that.  It -- it actually got warm and stayed warm and 
L:  Yeah.  Nice.
R:  -- that was nice, but usually it's -- you know, you're thinking, "Oh, it's going to be nice.  The trees are starting to try to come out a little bit" then all of a sudden you get this six -- six foot snow storm blowing through, so [LAUGH] that kind of kills everything out but --
L:  What do you think of like, um, Halloween and holidays like that?
R:  Um, Halloween, well, I know with my family, I try to make -- it's -- I think it -- I don't try to touch on more or less a horror theme or anything like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause especially 'cause I do have a younger child, and you know, for the older kids, you know, they like the harum scarum and all that, you know, [LIPSMACK] but for me, I think -- I keep it on a theme of like a costume party --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think in -- in my neighborhood we have a lot of little kids, and so the parents go out with the kids, they dress them up in not -- not scary costumes and -- but they go and it's a good way to meet your neighbors, you know?  So, um, I th- -- I think of it more as like a costume party type theme.  I don't -- I don't, uh, address the horror part -- part of it like we use to when we were kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's just -- that's just too much.  You know.
L:  I think a lot of -- it's gotten out of hand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whereas it -- it can be a -- a cute holiday, you know, with the pumpkins and stuff but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's gotten -- it's gotten so it -- it's created much violence and people are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think some people think it's this bad holiday, and -- and some people won't celebrate it, you know.
R:  Right, but y- -- yeah 'cause I -- it can be really sc- -- you know, scary for the kids and they may not want to participate with --
L:  Then you got to worry 'bout the -- the violence too.
R:  Right, you do, you have to wo- -- uh --
L:  Kids [inaudible].
R:  -- you know, 'cause -- and -- and worry about what people are doing, like you know, where I grew up, there were people that would put tricks and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like needles and stuff in candy.  You got to watch that.  You got to watch if anybody's doing anything in the neighborhood, or like, you know, the peeping in the house, throwing eggs on cars and rocks and things like that, so you -- you know, you got to think of the violence and the cruelty along with that, and that's -- that's not a good idea.  And I'm thinking a lot of people realize that too, especially once you get in young -- you get young children, and they want to steer away from that.  I know a lot of my neighbors have just -- you know, gotten away from a lot of that, and they're trying to make it more of like a family orientated, kind of get together, kind of -- you know, meet the -- you know, make it fun for the kids but also make it a safe time, and a good time to get to know your neighbors, you know, you know, "Who's that person next door that, you know, you don't see very often?"  It's a good way to get to know who they are.  So, I -- as far as the violence, yeah, that's -- that's the big thing that scares me, but I do think another holiday that's really cool -- good, as far as getting together is Thanksgiving.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I --
L:  And the turkey.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Do you usually have turkey?
R:  Oh [LAUGH] yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Ahem.
R:  We -- we invite a lot of friends over that, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we -- that -- lot of times we'll have places to go, and everybody, in my opinion, everybody should have a place to go for Thanksgiving.  That's just a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hard n' fast rule --
L:  And Macey's Day parade.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely the parade and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of course, that's the time of year where the first Christmas trees are coming out, so you get to see those.
L:  Right.  Mm, yeah.
R:  And -- and the --
L:  And the -- the --the, um, celebrities like come in and they sing, you know, and you see 'em come down the parade and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's always nice.  It'd be nicer if I could actually be there but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I know, that's true, that's true.
L:  See it live, but --
R:  Yeah, that's true but it's really not.  Another good holiday I haven't thought about is the Fourth of July.
L:  Uh-huh, the fireworks, yeah.
R:  'Cause I love fireworks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I love fireworks.  But that's a good -- that's a good time of year too.  Oh well, I -- I think any holiday in the summer from Memorial day all the way down to Labor Day is -- it's fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Summer time is just cool.
L:  Th- -- the fireworks would be better if they would -- well, it depends.  Sometimes you can go and there can be like really nice fireworks, and they can be like -- like the last year we went to one and it was like the best fireworks ever.  They were like grand finale all the way through for --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like the whole hour --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- but other times you go and they'll be like one -- okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a minute later --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- beep, another one, boom! 
R:  Oh look there's another one! [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Yeah. Like, "Oh!  Nice firework!"  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  And you're like -- you're like is that -- yeah, you're like "Oh!  Is that it?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know where, uh --
L:  I like the one's that just go, "Go, go, go, go, go!" and, you know like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- non stop and exciting, and I think they all should be that way, you know?  It's like a lot more enjoyable.
R:  Mhm.  I --
L:  The only bad part is all the traffic afterwards. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, tell me about it!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  That -- I hate th- -- well, with us, um, a lot of the towns around have carnivals throughout the summer, and so you'll have one with ea- -- and it's -- a lot of times it's like one weekend it's another --one town, another weekend it's another town and -- [COUGH] excuse me, depending on where you are, I don't necessarily like to go out and watch the fireworks way over at some other town because you got to get there, and then you got to fight to get back ... [COUGH]  Ours in particular, I can see the fireworks from the front door step, so all I got to do is stand on the porch, so it --
L:  Oh, that looks nice.
R:  -- that's cool!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's real cool.
L:  I used to live where we could --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- do that, just go outside but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  I'd -- I'd tried it two years ago taking my kids, and I'm like, "We're not doing this again".  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  But if we're like, um, if we're creating a holiday, it
