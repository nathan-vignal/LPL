L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE]  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Felicia in Los Angeles.
R:  [NOISE]  What was your name?
L:  Felicia.
R:  Felicia.  My name's Melissa and I'm in Iowa.
L:  Melissa, hi.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's what, about ten oh clock there now?
R:  Um, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  I think so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Shh.
L:  So, we're talking about disarming Iraq.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, do you think that, ah, we should make that a top priority [LAUGH] for the United States?  [SIGH]
R:  I do.
L:  Really?
R:  Personally.
L:  Why, you sound like you have a -- have a very strong opinion about it.
R:  I do.
L:  Why's that?
R:  Why is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Just because of the danger to the entire world, you know.  I don't [NOISE] think that it's in anybody's interests for us not to be aggressive 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about it, really.  How do you --
L:  Well --
R:  -- feel about it?
L:  -- I guess [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I guess because there are dangers all over the world.  There are many dangers that we should -- could make priority.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, ah, I guess I -- I have kind of mixed feelings about it.  I think that there are other motives for [SIGH] going -- for Iraq as opposed to other [SIGH] nations and -- and other -- even internal threats here in the United States.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- I'm not sure that I think that our government is -- is --is always looking out for the best interests of the majority of the people in the United States when it chooses these [SIGH] um, targets.
R:  [NOISE] I guess I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a -- it's probably just a hope or a belief that it would be for the right reasons [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I guess I take that for granted.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, I do ha- -- I do have those concerns also. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I think, personally I'm still more, um, [PAUSE] for it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- definitely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, do you think that after this war we should go after other nations that have, um, probably been develop -- developing [SIGH] ah, weapons of mass destruction or other arms that could be nuclear weapons, other -- other -- other, um --
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  -- threats --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the -- the world?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um, I'm not sure about that.
L:  Yeah.  See, that's sort of the question for me, "Why stop?"  Why stop at Iraq?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Is there a -- is there a -- a -- a -- reasoned difference?
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  Is there a -- a difference that has some logic behind it?
R:  [NOISE] One big difference is all of the -- all the chances he was given, you know, just a flat out, um, defiance and just the way he was to his own people, that's what sticks out in my mind more than anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What he did to all those people.  [NOISE]  The families.  The -- I mean, I can't -- I don't even know the numbers.  I don't remember but I know it was outrageous.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that -- I mean I -- I -- I agree with you there were atrocities there in Ir- --in Iraq and -- and -- and elsewhere in the world.  Unquestionably -- unquestionably, things go on that [SIGH] would horrify us probably if we knew the extent of it.  But I think, by the same token, there are things going on within our own borders that would horrify us if we really knew.
R:  [NOISE] There are what?
L:  There -- there -- there are -- are horrors happening here in the US that would --
R:  True.
L:  -- that would -- that w- -- if we really knew [LAUGH] the things that are going on here --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and if we were really aware of [SIGH] --
R:  And I do --
L:  -- of ourselves and if we were a more peaceful nation, I think -- I think we'd be more justified in being the world's policeman, but I -- I just don't -- I don't think we're a peace loving people [LAUGH] frankly.  I'm not sure --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- we're in the best position to -- to be the -- the decision makers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the world, especially when there's so much opposition from other nations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the UN to us going forward [SIGH].  I -- I don't think that we have any great moral authority ah, any -- any greater moral [NOISE] authority than any other country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we [NOISE] haven't demonstrated, I think, to the world that we [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are the best -- n- -- nation to decide [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, what's -- how much is enough.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, because it -- it -- I -- it was, hm, I'm sorry I -- I'm dominating [LAUGH] the conversation I think.
R:  No, I'm listening.  No.
L:  Because I -- it was a UN -- it was UN sort of [SIGH] [NOISE] um  ah, deman- -- demand, ah, the disarmament initially was, and [NOISE] the UN, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was inspecting [NOISE] for the arms and [SIGH] the UN just didn't really back this effort of ours to enforce the disarming [NOISE] requirement.  So, I just think we should have stepped out an- -- and -- and I want -- I just suspect the motive.
R:  What, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what I always think of when I [LAUGH] hear the UN is my husband told me that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we actually started the UN --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the United States. [PAUSE]  I didn't know that.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I mean --
R:  [NOISE] And I just can't believe now that the -- the UN is not in agreement at all with us.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean it's -- it's a group of -- of [NOISE] independent nations like any other group of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] So, what --
L:  Who --who have -- each have their own opinions and justifications and rationales [NOISE] for things that they do [NOISE] and their own perspective [NOISE].  So, I mean it's -- it's a world body as opposed to a -- a single --
R:  Right.
L:  -- country decision.
R:  I do know that I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess if you had to choose between like Iraq --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an- -- being a priority --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and our own hungry people being a priority --
L:  Or South Korea?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Or Syria?  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE] Or, you know, any -- any other hot spot in the world.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Or Israel and Palestine.  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Right.  That's -- oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we've been [NOISE] how many years have you been hearing on the news about Palestinian and Israelis killing each other?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  How -- how many years -- how many years have you been hearing about that?  And [LIPSMACK] we really haven't, I think, [NOISE] done a lot [NOISE] to really help bring peace to that region.
R:  [NOISE] There was, um, a lady that made a statement after nine eleven about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "This has happened in our country every day of our lives --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- for -- you know, like you were just saying -- "
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and nobody ever made a big deal out of it -- "
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and now you lose this many people and, you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you expect everybody to feel this way, or "
L:  [NOISE].  Right.
R:  I mean.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- I -- you know, actually [NOISE] thinking back on it, I hadn't really thought about that for a long time, but I think [NOISE] I did kind of feel the same way [NOISE].  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I didn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I forgot about that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- myself.  I was guilty of it, you know, myself not -- you forget.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We are so fortunate here.  I do -- I do like it that Bush wants --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other people to have what we have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the freedoms that we have.
L:  But, I mean, does he really want that?  I mean. does -- do you really -- do you --
R:  I hope that he does.
L:  -- do you see him as a compassionate person who --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really wants -- who really cares --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about the freedom of Iraqis to choose their own leaders?  I mean when you -- when you watch him on television and listen to his addresses --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you really get that feeling from him? [SIGH] [NOISE]  That that's what he cares about?
R:  I do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Well, it's good to have that confidence in your leaders --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I know my mom does not like him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't ask me where I -- give it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, you're an adult, you know, you can -- you can watch the news, you know what's going on and you form your own opinions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As we all do, of course.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes I wonder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how naive I am in my thinking, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know it's more about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hope.
L:  Yeah, I mean you know --
R:  I pray.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's -- I think -- that's a good way to feel [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- respect your country [NOISE] and to believe that your leaders are gonna do what's in the best [NOISE] interests of everyone [SIGH], um --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]  And I kind of -- I guess [NOISE] I kind of want that for my children.  I want them to feel that way --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though I don't necessarily feel it myself. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't want them to become cynical, I guess.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] You don't want --
L:  You can be -- I don't want them to be cynical.  I -- I think being cynical is not [NOISE] particularly [NOISE] um -- it's not a happy state and certainly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unhappiness I think [NOISE] leads to unhealth.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [NOISE] I want them to be happy and [NOISE] [SIGH] I think feeling [NOISE] good about where you [NOISE] live and your government is -- is, [NOISE] ah, a part of that.
R:  A big thing?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.  What was the other issue?
L:  Um, I think that was [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- I -- ah, I don't know [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's the only thing I recall her talking about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or recall her recording --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether it should be a top priority for the US to disarm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Iraq.
R:  You don't think it should be any more?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I have very mixed feelings about it.  I don't -- I frankly don't think it should be.
R:  No?
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  No, I -- I've -- I really believe that we should get or own house in order before trying to be the world's policeman.
R:  True.  I do understand that.
L:  Yeah.  I think we have so much [LIPSMACK] um, mental unhealth and emotional instability here in --
R:  We do that.
L:  -- our own country.
