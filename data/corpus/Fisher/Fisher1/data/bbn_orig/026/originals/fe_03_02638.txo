L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  Hey --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how're you doing?
L:  [NOISE]  Good, how are you.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm good.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Marianna?
L:  Marianna?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Hi, my name's Kelly.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Um, in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Wha-
R:  What about you?
L:  Tennessee.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah, I grew up in -- near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, so --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I've been to Philly.  [SIGH]  Okay.  Have you ever done this before?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] I did this the other day --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the first time.
L:  [MN]
R:  What about you?
L:  Ah, this is my second time.  I did it a couple of weeks ago so, it's you know, [SIGH] and I think the subject then was like, family.  What was your subject?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] habits [PAUSE] of people.
L:  Yes.  Okay.  [SIGH]  So, what do you think about our -- our subject tonight?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I guess it's fitting for the -- the time period.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess I have kind of mixed opinions about it.  Um [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it was -- you know, interesting to I guess watch it kind of all unfold --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the TV.  [SIGH]  However, I think that -- ah, the media really only provided [SIGH] half of really a -- a pretty biased view of what was go- -- really going on over there.
L:  Right, 'cause how do we really know?
R:  Right.
L:  We're going by their version.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And it's very like Hollywood with, like, you know, you're watching Friends or whatever and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you get breaking up dates --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff but I think -- I think kind of [LIPSMACK] the US -- we kind of [SIGH] set ourselves up for this --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- with kind of stuff that happened in the past with the Gulf War and [SIGH] we really never finished what we were supposed to do then and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's kind of like we had to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of [NOISE] do what we did now because it was almost like push came to shove and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I don't think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, Bush wanted to be pushed around any more .  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So  [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK]  So, I don't know.  What do you think about it?
L:  Oh, I agree with -- you know, what you're saying, it's just, you know, I mean just the whole subject of war isn't a good subject to begin with, you know, I mean it's just [MN] and it's funny because I'm married and my husband is ex military so, you know, he's like, "Oh yeah, let's go in there.  Let's kick butt" blah, blah, blah an- -- and I'm just the opposite.  I'm like, "Well, I mean I know it needs to be done but " you know, I mean I still can't help but think, you know, all those lives that are lost, [SIGH] you know, and I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I mean we have to -- now that we're in there we have to disarm 'em and we have to do -- you know, being that we're already there we gotta to do what needs to be done.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I mean as far as [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going there in the first place I -- I don't know.  I mean, it would have had to be done eventually, I feel.
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't think now was the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  And I mean that's just my opinion but, you know?
R:  Mm.  It just seemed like with the whole Afghanistan thing, like we had so much stuff going on.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But it's like how do you [SIGH] you know, put all your effort -- I mean I know our military is huge and everything -- but like [SIGH] put all those people over there when we're still fighting the war in Afghanistan --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then the whole North Korea thing --
L:  Ex- -- yes, see that's the -- yeah, that's the way I feel.  [NOISE] I'm like, you know, come on here --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, a -- I mean, I think we're just fortunate that nothing serious -- we didn't get another major attack over here while [SIGH] --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- half of our troops are over there in Iraq.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  Yeah.  And I just think, like, the ramifications --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of this is we haven't even really seen it, like.
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  Also the fact that our economy is like, crap, going into the war --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and it -- it's --
L:  Oh, but they're saying it's fine, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] in the news media, "Oh, we're fine.  We're fine" you know?
R:  Mm. [SIGH]  Yeah, I have a hard time with the whole, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- war thing -- like I'm -- us -- I'm going to school to be a social worker right now, so like, you know, I -- I work in the medical field and I just see how much m- -- money isn't given to that and health care and everything like that and then it [SIGH] you hear like them like [SIGH] each missile cost like three million dollars.  And each plane is like [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, it's just -- [NOISE]
R:  -- ten million dollars and it's like --
L:  Yeah, and we've got people that are starving on the streets and, you know, go figure.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean I understand that we have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, defend our country.  We don't want anything to happen.  And the fact that [PAUSE] they were supposedly hiding these +nuclear --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or weapons of mass destruction --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, it's just interesting that we ha- haven't found anything yet.
L:  Ah -- ah, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, whether or not they're still hidden or if they're in [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's that country right above it?
L:  Ah.
R:  Libya or --
L:  [MN]  I think --
R:  -- I forget where they were trying to hide everything there.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, wherever area --
L:  In where Saddam is supposed to be?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, so that's -- you know, I think it's also pretty scary that we don't even know where Saddam [LAUGH] is right now.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know?
L:  We assume he's dead but, you know, then he was +sighted and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, that's crazy.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That's just -- I mean [NOISE] like you said, I mean we're there, you know, we've gotta do what we've gotta do but it's just war and al- -- in general.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Just like the whole thing, I mean the cost, the lives --
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  --  it's just, you know?
R:  Uh-hum.  I never realized how many -- like how young the people are that are fighting over there --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like, you know, you always here about the military this, the military that.  Like I've a lot of family members that were [SIGH] in the military but are not -- are not in it any more and I was like on the TV they're, like, nineteen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're, like, kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're like carrying these like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- huge guns and everything and it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [LIPSMACK] it's terrible.
L:  [NOISE] I know I'm just -- you see I have a -- I have a son he -- he's gonna be five and I'm just [SIGH] you know, I just think, "Oh, my gosh, what's -- what are things going to be like whenever you know, he gets to be old enough and will he decide to go in?" and you know, I mean all these thoughts are running through my head and like, "Gosh, what's gonna?" You know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I would- -- I don't want him to be [LAUGH] in the military.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I -- I can't stop him but it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  just a simple fact.  It's like, "Oh, my gosh".
R:  Right.
L:  And I mean -- and I know that -- that's another thing that I -- I don't know why it bugs me but I mean that's -- that's their job when you're in the military.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean everybody -- I -- I support our troops and I think they're doing a wonderful job and stuff but that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they knew what they were getting into.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, I mean that's part of their job.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  You know, I mean just because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I mean if you're in law enforcement you risk your life every day.  If -- you know, if you're in the medical -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just a whole bunch of things that most people, you know, don't even think about.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, so I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]  I think it's just -- it's -- you know, you're -- you're always -- I mean I -- I remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in high school and everything you just -- you hear about World War Two and you hear about all this stuff but, like, how much [NOISE] -- like we're k- -- we're living in -- like major history right now you know, with the whole [SIGH] you know, unfortunately, September eleven then --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, this war.  [SIGH]  You know, we -- we had the Gulf War and now we have this war --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and it's like all these major things that have happened --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE]  That it'll be interesting, like, you know, our kids or our grand kids are going to be like, [SIGH] "Wow, you lived in the war?" you know.
L:  Yeah, it's --  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  Kind of like --
L:  I know.  What -- what do they call it -- what is the media calling it now days -- I -- I lose track?  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, Operation something.
L:  Yeah -- lib- --
R:  Free Iraq or liberate or something like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know and [LAUGH] isn't it -- I think it's funny that they have ta call it something, you know.  I mean back in the days, like you're saying, in history, you know, they called it a war.
R:  Right.
L:  They called it what it was, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now they have to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, Desert Storm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now [LAUGH] whatever this is.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Defence of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like Hollywood.
L:  Yeah.  It's like you said, it's Hollywood --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's just, ah -- you know, and it's -- and another thing that worries me is -- I mean how much is -- you know, how much is garbage what they're feeding the American public, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, do we really know?  We don't and we n- never will.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have some friends from another country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, we talk on email and everything and they just think the Amer- -- like our -- like Bush is the dumbest thing and, [SIGH] "How can you go into a war?" and, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, Americans are just, you know, stuffy people --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all this -- like, it's interesting to see how we're viewed in other countries.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  You know, about this [SIGH] you know, Bush just got a little, you know, trigger happy 'cause his dad didn't finish it -- what had -- what needed to be done last time --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so he's gonna be the big man [SIGH] and how it's like, you know, this is like real.  Like this --
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, you turn on the TV [SIGH] and there it -- you know, like he had no idea that it was on the TV like twenty four seven.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh.
R:  And I was like, "Yeah.  It's like real war going on".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, this is it.  I mean it's just shh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's amazing.
R:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  So --
L:  But, I know it's crazy.
R:  It's kind of died down a little bit though.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  It has -- well 'cause -- d- -- didn't Bush announce that we kind of sort of won?  Or --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, kind -- he said --
L:  -- in so many words.  That was kind of Thursday.
R:  -- and then they have like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] the whole deck of cards.  Sort of like they've got -- like each [SIGH] Iraqi person -- like the high profile government leaders are like [SIGH] they named them like a deck of cards.  So, like the Ace of Spades is somebody.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, it's ridiculous the way they have, you know, how they keep catching all these people.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Like the big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the big wigs and everything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then the whole -- like he landed I think yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he landed on that -- a- -at -- big ship in the ocean --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and he was the first president ever -- you know, it was like, "Come on!" 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, again.  I mean I -- I watched like the -- like the last ten minutes -- or I try to just catch the highlights of the news 'cause it's just like, "Gosh" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, you just -- you just see it so much and this is like, "Okay, I need a break from this.  I can't --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- I can't handle watching any more of this", an' -- [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we also wh- -- where I live in Tennessee, it's close to a military base, so [MN] this is like, jeeze.  [LIPSMACK]  It's pretty crazy.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  Pretty crazy.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, yeah.
