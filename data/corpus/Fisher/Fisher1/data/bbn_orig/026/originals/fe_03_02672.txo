L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is, uh, Daniel Misherry.
L:  Hi, my name is Krystal.
R:  Hey, Krystal.  How's it going?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Oh, excellent.
L:  Good, good, good.
R:  Do you, uh, do you have a favorite holiday?
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  I would have to say probably Christmas.  How about you?
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] They're all pretty good.  I -- I, uh, I in fact enjoy any holiday.
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, I think we should have more.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, yeah, they're each so distinctly good in their own way, I probably couldn't pick a favorite, you know?
L:  Yeah? [MN]
R:  Why is Christmas your favorite?
L:  Um, just because I think in our family it's -- we celebrate it, um, more than any hol- other holiday.  So, we make sure that we all get together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] it's more of a family -- family thing than anything else, I would say.
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  I live in Phoenix.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does it even get cold there? [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, not very cold, no. [LAUGH]
R:  It's not a White Christmas?
L:  Um, I would say the coldest is, um, maybe in the fifties where I am.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, where do you live?
R:  I'm in San Diego.
L:  Oh, okay.  What part?
R:  Well, not -- not too far -- oh, you know San Diego well?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I grew up there, actually.
R:  Oh, really?  Crazy.  Me too.  Right now I'm kinda in, like, on Adams Avenue by the Stadium, kinda.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I grew up in Saramisa[?] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so that's not very far from the Stadium.
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  Okay.
R:  How funny. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it doesn't get very cold there either.
R:  No, it doesn't get cold there.  I think -- I think if it got colder Christmas would be, I think, so much more of an intense ordeal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  'Cause, ah, [MN] I think when you'd, like, get in the house and get everyone around the table, you know, and you probably have a fire going or something --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  -- it'd probably have, like, an extra bonding kinda feel to it.
L:  I w- I agree, yeah.  I've spent some Christmases in Colorado and it's definitely different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah.  And I think, um, we have young kids in our family too --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, it's like, so special for them when they wake up on Christmas morning.
R:  Yeah, they go nuts. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, when it's all adults it's not quite the same feeling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Hey, if you could -- if you could create a holiday --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what would it be?
L:  I don't know, what about you?
R:  Um, [MN] I think -- I think it would have like, I think it would be kind of a relaxed fun day without the social pressures [LAUGH] of any other holiday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, maybe, like, uh, Relaxation Day?
L:  Yeah.  Maybe without the financial burdens, too.  You wouldn't have to buy anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  Everyone stays home and relaxes for a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  Except I'd, uh, I'd impose like a strict, uh, alcohol ban on Relaxation Day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I'd like it -- I'd like it to be strictly relaxation. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, nothing else. [LAUGH]
R:  No -- no rowdiness. [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  No -- no public fights breaking out on Relaxation Day.
L:  Right.  Everyone just stays home and relaxes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Good.
R:  Or goes out.  It would be -- it'd be like a Utopian Day.  It would be like paradise.  You'd just --
L:  That's a good idea.  
R:  Everyone --
L:  You have --
R:  -- wanders --
L:  You could --
R:  -- around.
L:  You could cook your meals the day before and [LAUGH] so you wouldn't have to cook or anything that day, just relax.
R:  [LAUGH] Just relax and eat and go to your neighbors' house and eat some of their food.
L:  Yeah, there you go.
R:  Everyone just hangs around.
L:  Oh, we need that.  Definitely.
R:  [MN] Mm.
L:  You know, 'cause at Christmas, I mean, a lot of holidays get to be stressful with cooking a huge meal and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So, yeah.  I know, I think there's a lot of holidays like Memorial Day and those kind of holidays end up just being big party days.
R:  True.
L:  [MN]
R:  I never -- they never seem like legitimate holidays [LAUGH] to me, though. [LAUGH]
L:  No, not at all.  And I think they used to be like, um, my family's from Montana and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- still in Montana on Memorial Day people go and leave flowers on the graves of their families.  I mean --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- they really take it seriously.  But, like, down here everybody just goes to the lake and, you know, has barbecues and stuff.  So, it's totally different.
R:  Yeah, I think, some of the others like Memorial Day or Labor Day or Veterans' Day or anything like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything where you get, like, a day off work, I just remember, it'd be like, you know, someone would be, like, "Hey it's, you know, whatever day on Monday, no work" I'd be like, "Really?" and just kind of scramble for some plans.
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  Kind of, like, last minute it'd be, like, "Ooh, well, let's drive out to" you know, wherever.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but yeah, I don't think -- I never remember, like, um, you know, pooling family members together for any kind of [LAUGH] bonding on the holiday.
L:  No, it's kind of just a three day weekend.
R:  Yeah, that's funny.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  I didn't realise that till now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean, some places they take it really seriously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know about Labor Day though, I don't think anybody does anything on Labor Day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think it's just a -- a -- a day away from labor, kinda like your holiday. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  No laboring on that day.
R:  Except the shopping.  No --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, there's huge Labor Day sales.  That's right. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I think that's what I'm realising --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is the, um, like, the women in my family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they like to shop.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And so anytime there'd be, like, a holiday or that, there's initially, you know, these sales and stuff.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And so I remember when I was a kid being, like, dragged along with my mom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and stuff while they're like scouring the town.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Looking for deals.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  But you got, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know, for me, you got, like, Thanksgiving and you got Easter and, um, Christmas and not New Years so much but those are, like, your big family, kinda, coagulating days. 
L:  Yeah, and, um, [NOISE] my husband is from South America and down there New Years is a huge family day.
R:  Really?
L:  Everyone stays home and, like, eats a big meal and it's a really -- a family day.  And he said actually down there on Christmas, a lot of times people spend time with their friends and hang out with their friends and ...  But New Years is like a huge day to be with your family.  Which is kind of the opposite of here.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's remarkable.  What -- what country is he from?
L:  He's from Panama.  But, um, we also have a friend that's from Venezuela --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's the same for him there.  So, I think it's most of South America. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah, so, it's -- it's totally different.  I mean, here, y- I would never even think of spending New Years with my family.  You g- always just go out with your friends and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's not really a family day at all.  I mean, when I was a kid we always had a babysitter on New Years' Eve and my parents went out, you know?  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda different. 
R:  Funny.  Like, my -- my -- my family, um, is Catholic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we grew up and I remember, like, being a teenager and, like, a Jewish friend would call me up on Christmas Day and be like, "Hey, wanna hang out?"  [LAUGH] I'd be like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- "What are you talking about?  This is Christmas".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he was just like, "It's just another day to me". [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I could never get my head around that.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Yeah, because, I mean, for most people Christmas y- you'd -- I mean, you're just home all day with your family, you don't really see your friends at all.
R:  Yeah.  And it's such a production.  And it's, like, presents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, like, you know, the full -- it's the full deal [MN] and it was just -- 
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- it was such, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a shock to my world.  [LAUGH] And I was like --
L:  Yeah, that there are people that didn't celebrate Christmas. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's funny.  [MN] I guess -- 
L:  That's kinda too bad for those kids though, [LAUGH] if most of their friends aren't Jewish they wouldn't have anyone to play with that day.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think they have their alternate, you know, experience.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  I'm su- --
L:  At least Hanukkah's around the same time of year, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that makes it a little bit easier.
R:  They get the Yuletide cheer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, um -- [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] [inaudible] so, it- it's kinda funny 'cause as I've been talking to you, I've been kinda realising what elements constitute, like, proper holiday in my mind.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's definitely like -- like, some kind of, like, family gathering --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- makes it like a more legitimate holiday.
L:  I think so, too.  For me also.  If -- if my family takes it really seriously and puts importance on it then it seems like a real holiday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.  So, ah, um, d- do most of your family live in San Diego?
R:  All of them.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's good then. 
R:  Yeah.  So, it's like a massive ordeal.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  And, uh, when -- when everyone gets together it's always a holiday.  And we try to as much as we can [MN] but, ah, throughout the year, [MN] I mean, you can get a proper, like, you know, like fifty of us together on, like --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- Christmas and Easter and [MN] and -- and whatever.  And the holiday makes it so essential 'cause wi- without the working, ah, you know, without people going to work on that day --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know everyone's kinda free and, you know, so, we kinda keep it in the back of your mind of that like you're gonna be over at, like, an auntie's house or a cousin's house.
L:  Right.  Oh, that's great.
R:  Like, you know, on that day.  Yeah.
L:  Good, good.
R:  Yeah, so it's definitely a lot of fun.  It's really, kinda, you know, nurturing.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  That's great.  Um, most of my family -- we're all pretty much on the west side --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's not too bad.  My parents still live in San Diego and I have an uncle in LA, so, you know, we're only five hours away, so it's not too hard to get together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I spent some time in Florida and so I was so far away from my family that, you know, it was hard to get together, even for holidays.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, you have to buy a plane ticket and, you know, have all that time off of work to make --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it worthwhile to go all the way out there and so it's kinda hard.
R:  Yeah.  I was, um, I was living in New York for a while [MN] and I -- and I flew out here for Thanksgiving 'cause the whole family was getting together, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just really wanted to -- you know, it'd been like a year and I really wanted to do it.  But it was so, I mean, [MN] it was so financially burdensome.  'Cause it --
L:  Oh I bet.
R:  -- it was, like, get a ticket and everything.  And of course I couldn't work, you know, for that week and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- got back and it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just like, "Oh my gosh" like, that was like, you know, whatever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  An eight hundred dollar week.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] Stressful.
L:  Yeah, it makes you think that, you know, it's important to be close to your family. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely been, uh, something.
L:  [MN]
R:  So -- so I usually try to, uh, you know, I usually just conserve it to Christmas now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And try and stay between, like, Christmas and New Years wherever I am and, like, you know, fly here for that time and --
