R:  Hi, I'm Alicia.
L:  Hi, Alicia, I'm Lynn.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE] And, um, what to --
L:  Jay?
R: What topic do you have?
L:  Holidays.
R:  Okay, okay.  'Cause the last time I did this we had two different topics.  But I have the same one. [MN] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's, ah, what's your favorite holiday, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  And -- and if were going to create a holiday, what would it be?
R:  [NOISE] So what is your favorite holiday?
L:  My holi- my favorite one has to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Christmas.
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's pretty high on my list, too. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Christmas because everybody gets presents.  But I like my birthday too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, [NOISE] does it has to be a -- a holiday that everyone celebrates?
L:  I think that the holiday is whatever is a special day to you, don't you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Besides the public holidays.  'Cause we have religious holidays and we have public holidays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have seasonal holidays.  And, you know, and then personal holidays [LAUGH] like birthdays and anniversaries and --
R:  Yeah, I think I like Christmas, too.  [NOISE] 'Cause I get the longest break, there we go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  From school.  [MN] Well, I like that and then [NOISE] I get to see all my family, you know?
L:  Do you -- do yo- do y- does your whole family get together for Christmas?
R:  Um, yeah, actually, [NOISE] I think every Christmas we have an -- in some sort of form at least, some people.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.  Ours --
R:  Christmas is like --
L:  -- our family usually does it for Thanksgiving first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then Christmas.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we do Thanksgiving but it's gotten a little less every year. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  'Cause no one wants to cook the humongous dinner. [MN]
L:  Really?  That's my favorite thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do.  Is make a turkey and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all kinds of salads and --
R:  Well, I'm not the one who does the cooking.  [NOISE] I'm probably -- wait, how old are you?
L:  I'm forty seven.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm only nineteen, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my mom does it.  I -- she makes me help. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She -- last Easter I had to peel potatoes, like, a million of them.
L:  Oh, bummer. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's okay, I just sat there and peeled them and --
L:  All the grunt work.
R:  Yeah, well I got --
L:  That's not that much fun.
R:  -- some good food out of it, so ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was okay with me.
L:  Well, at least you can -- you know what's fun about it though, is being in the kitchen and talking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I think that's the good thing about cooking together, is that you catch up with everyth- everybody and everything and you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get to just talk and nibble as well as, you know, put your -- put your feelings into the food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then you know what you're eating. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, usually I think I entertain the kids though, so ...
L:  [NOISE] That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  Like, all the cousins and stuff and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I'm one of the oldest of all the cousins, so ...
L:  Oh, so you get to take care of the littler ones?
R:  Yeah, yup, yup.  It's not that bad. [NOISE]
L:  I was -- I was also the oldest growing up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I always got to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, basically run the show with the -- with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- little younger brothers and sisters and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cousins and nieces and nephews and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and everybody else and their friends that always wanted to eat with us.
R:  Well, I don't have any nieces and nephews yet 'cause I'm -- I'm one [NOISE] of the oldest and the one of the only girls. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, my sister and I are the two only girls.
L:  So, you have more responsibility than most. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, basically.  But, um, back to holidays.
L:  It's good training though, you know?  It's really good tr- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause then you get to -- you'll be eventually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the matriarch of your family. [NOISE]
R:  Ye- yeah, eventually.  I'll get my own place and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- everybody over for Christmas. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you know --
R:  Ah, it's too --
L:  I -- I guess I should probably tell you, one of the reasons I like Christmas so much.  It's not just so much the families and the food --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the -- and the guests.  It's like, it's more sacred to me.  It's the most sacred and -- and spiritual of all the holidays.
R:  Oh, so you're very religious?
L:  Well, no.  I'm not really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- religious, but I would say I'm spiritual.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Because, um, you know, what a- i- ah, there's a huge difference to me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, th- all the imagery with, ah, Christmas, you know, with the tree and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seven branches of the tree corresponding to the seven seals in the bo- -- in the human body --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the seven planes.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But --
R:  Oh, are you more of a holistic person?
L:  Yeah, definitely holistic.
R:  Oh, my dad's a chiropractor, so I know all about that.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  My -- I'm a lifestyle therapist, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, and I do a lot of holistic stuff.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  So -- so, t- for me, besides being the -- the Winter Solstice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and the whole pagan celebration of -- of the changing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the seasons and Christmas and the time to dream.  You know, to be quiet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and dream -- dream a New Year into being for Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, to me, that's really [MN] that's the most profound --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- moment is -- that's -- we're at our greatest creative moment --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because we're dreaming a whole new year into being at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Christmas.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.  Christmas is definitely the end of the year and time for celebration. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and you know, people just generally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are happier and their -- they're more generous and more --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- considerate and more thoughtful and more joyful.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, especially in the city.  I live in the city and I saw Christmas and everyone is definitely a little bit nicer here. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's good.
L:  It is.
R:  But, um [NOISE] if you --
L:  People are in a better mood.
R:  Yeah, they are.  They are, definitely.  [NOISE] So, if you could create a holiday, what would you do? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Well, you know, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I really like Earth Day but --
R:  Yeah, so do I.
L:  -- a lot of people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a lot of people forget about it until it's, you know, April twenty second., you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and then, well, usually for me, I hear about a concert that celebrates Earth Day.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And I usually take my kids out and, you know, and -- and we kinda do stuff and -- and that's really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we really -- I enjoy that because I wanna instill in them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a respect for nature and an acknowledgement of the changing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the seasons and [MN]  -- and so I really like Earth Day, you know?
R:  Yeah, I think -- yeah, I think for me I think one day during the spring.  That is, okay, recorded for the last fifteen years nice all the time, everybody should just have off from work. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like everybody.  And you c- you have --
L:  Like a play day? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, just a play day.  Kinda like --
L:  A world play day.
R:  Yeah, it'd be fun, why not? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If everybody it, except there would be no, [NOISE] like, post office and stuff and no -- I mean, of course there'd have to be like police and everything, but they have to work on Christmas as well.
L:  Well, that's kinda like what May Day is supposed to be, you know?
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  Everybody's supposed to just celebrate --
R:  Yeah, my mom --
L:  -- the first day of spring and go play --
R:  My mom was --
L:  -- outside.
R:  -- um, the -- the flower child.  Yeah, um, you know, [inaudible], so we had it when I was younger, the May pole and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And Old Man Winter.  [NOISE] So, I know all about that.  And, yeah, that is a nice day.
L:  Yeah, my daughter's birthday is May first, so, you know, I've -- I've taught her all the old traditions of --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, the May pole and -- and --
R:  Oh yeah, wasn't it just -- 
L:  -- the pagan holiday of -- of the rites of spring.
R:  -- wasn't it just recently? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Aw, I haven't been home.  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm away at college, so ... Oh, I -- now I --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's -- I mean, I'm sure there's [inaudible] universal societies here but I more, like, liked it for the community and stuff. [NOISE]
L:  You know, that would be the other holiday that I would create, is like a Community Day --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- so that everybody in the community gets together and they get to know each other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they get to share food, you know --
R:  You mean, like everybody --
L:  -- and everybody would like --
R:  -- in your block or something? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well -- well, see, I- I grew up in a small town in Wyoming and I live in a fairly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- small town in Washington State.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, you know, you could do it -- you could do neighborhoods or you could do sections --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of town if you're in the big city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But for me --
R:  Yeah, that would be nice.  And it --
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  It would have to be like volunteer, you know, like you don't have to go.  'Cause, I mean, people that go and p- -- you make somebody do something that they don't want do it's never a good thing.
L:  Yeah, it'd definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be volunteer.  But it'd be so much fun that who would want to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- miss it?
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that would be fun.  Oh, I --
L:  [MN] I think so because --
R:  -- want to do that now. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, we used to do it when I was a kid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We'd get together in the summer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, not Fourth of July but later on in the middle of the summer, like usually a couple of weeks later.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all the community, we'd bring pies and --
R:  Yeah, I like --
L:  -- salads and --
R:  -- big barbecues. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And then everybody -- the kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would play games outdoors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause we had an island in between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two rivers that went through the town.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, and so everybody would come to the island.  And you could come and go all day long.  
R:  That's cool.
L:  You know, so people would come in, leave, come back.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And we just -- e- and, you know, we'd just have food and games for the kids and all th- -- you know, everybody would talk and people you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hadn't seen, you know, all year, you'd get to see 'em again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And renew old friendships and -- and meet relatives and ...  It was really special so I'd -- I'd like that holiday too, I think.
R:  Yeah, I like barbecues, just like, you eat and you enjoy [NOISE] and we used to have campfires 'cause it would get darker and colder [NOISE] and everyone would sit around and roast marshmallows.  It'd be fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then I had some with my friends too [NOISE] and we were swimming and stuff.  It -- it'd have to be when it was warm.
L:  Oh, definitely.  That's the best.
R:  [MN] Like maybe --
L:  That's -- that's definitely the best.
R:  Maybe in late May?
L:  'Cause then you don't have to worry about all the challenges that go with weird weather.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, like, late May 'cause June it gets a little bit warm to be outside.  Well, [MN] it all depends on if it's like a swimming pool party. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, our holiday would be a big giant barbecue slash swimming slash community fun day. [LAUGH]
L:  Food Fest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Fun Day or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] Food Fest.
L:  Community Fun Day. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  And maybe we should celebrate it once a month? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, once a month would be good.
L:  Instead of just once a year? [LAUGH] 
R:  We need one big giant arena or something for everybody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to come or a big tent.
L:  Oh, that would be great.  A big huge white tent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And little tents, like, you know, with special things for the kids or for the older --
R:  Yeah, they should have a w- --
L:  -- that need a place to sit down. 
R:  We should just throw in a carnival too though, while we're at it, you know? 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  A free one though, it has to be free.
L:  You could have a parade and then the Food Fest and then the games.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE] That'd be fun.
L:  And light candles at night to close, you know, to close the day and --
R:  [MN] And it'd be in celebration of life.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Life?
L:  Life, yeah
