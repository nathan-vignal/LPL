R:  Hello, my name is Bilal.
L:  Hi, Bilal, my name's Jennifer.
R:  Jennifer.  Where you calling from Jennifer?
L:  Um, out of the Montgomery County area.
R:  Ah, where -- California?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no, no, I'm in -- outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, Philadelphia [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where the big money people come from.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, is that it?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, well --
L:  Now, wh- -- where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from South -- I'm in South Carolina.
L:  Oh, you see I just assumed that all these people were from Philly.
R:  No, no, no -- I was, ah, I was raised in the Bronx.  I've been in the south now for about twenty years.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, tell me something -- again, the subject matter is what again?  I didn't hear her very clear.
L:  It's I -- Iraq stuff.
R:  Iraq stuff. [NOISE]
L:  Do you think we should be, um, doing anything about Iraq?
R:  Like what?
L:  It seems like it's an old question.
R:  Ah?
L:  It seems like it's an old question, like should we go to war with Iraq?
R:  No.
L:  Which I mean --
R:  I thought -- I thought -- well, I didn't hear her very pl- -- clear -- ah, plainly.  I thought she mentioned should the inspectors or something be going in from the UN?
L:  Oh, okay.  No, I missed that part.
R:  Oh, well, anyway I think that's a sad situation there anyway, period.
L:  Yeah, it sure is.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, what -- my problem with the whole conflict was that [COUGH] ah, I -- I'm not doubting that, ah, Hussein was a thug.  [NOISE]  And he was a thug when the CIA helped him to, ah, occupy that position that he's holding -- that he was holding in Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they helped him to get there.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And not only did they help him to get there, they gave him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the -- the West [NOISE] gave him all the weapons --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of what they call "mass destruction" that he had.
L:  Right.
R:  He would've never had've if they wouldn't have given it to them -- him.  [SIGH]  And Rumsfeld he was in, ah, Iraq in nineteen eighty three when, ah, Saddam Hussein was poisoning the Kurds and the -- fighting Iran and he was using poison gas with [SIGH] all -- all those folks dead and -- and Rumsfeld there shaking his hand.
L:  Right.
R:  He was -- he was a thug then.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  And he still is, isn't he?
R:  Well, I mean -- yeah, he was -- he was a thug but I consider them to also be thugs because they had association with a thug.
L:  Right.
R:  And once they got angry with the thug they came to us, the American masses, and lied to us so they could go there and do their thing.
L:  So, do you think we're -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing the right thing by being at war?
R:  No, I don't think we're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't never think we're doing the right thing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- going -- going to war unless we have, ah -- ah -- unless we have people who are really threatening the good of the whole humanity.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  You understand?  But I don't think you should --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- use the military to fight your own personal conflicts.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  That's my opinion.
L:  No, I -- I agree with that.
R:  That's my --
L:  [NOISE]  It's, um, you know, putting all these people at risk and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- number one, our military people, both men and women.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, not only them but, you know, the innocent people in Iraq.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, an -- you know, getting caught in the cross fire and --
R:  A lot of --
L:  -- by mistake, you know -- 
R:  A lot --
L:  -- areas are getting bombed that shouldn't.
R:  Right.  A lotta innocent people lost their lives.  People lost their whole families in this conflict.
L:  Right.
R:  And the thing about it, it could have been avoided [SIGH] because I am totally convinced from everything that I read, and I don't get my news from the med- -- to --from the controlled media.
L:  Okay.
R:  I go on the Internet and read, ah --
L:  Okay.  The -- then that's really cool because I -- I think that -- I mean, I saw this whole thing where we'd only, you know, on our TV, we only see what they want us to see.
R:  Of course -- of course --
L:  You know and --
R:  -- of course.
L:  -- it's -- that just totally blows me away that they can completely control what they want to show us.
R:  Right.  Well, like I say the Amer- -- you know, there was a writer called David Icke.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  You ever heard of Icke?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Are you -- are you on the Internet?
L:  I am.
R:  Well, give me your email address I'll -- and -- and I'll give you and I'll -- when I send ya, I'll send ya my -- I'm sixty years old.  You seem to be a young lady.  How old are you?
L:  Yeah.  I'm thirty two almost.
R:  Oh, I thought you was a youngster.  I have about three or four daughters your age. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, there you go.
R:  Yeah, okay -- what's your -- what's your name again?
L:  It -- my name's Jennifer.
R:  Oh, Jennifer.  J.E.N.N.?
L:  J.E.N.N. -- well, here, let me give you my email: J.E.N.N.
R:  Okay.
L:  J.O.E.
R:  Okay.
L:  Eight.
R:  Eight?
L:  Yeah, at AOL dotcom.
R:  AOL dotcom.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I'd love to -- to see some things that [PAUSE] you know, they haven't want us --
R:  That's -- that's -- that's J.E.N.N.J.- J.O.E. eight --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at AOL dot com?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, ah, we've been hoodwinked.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you ever heard the term, "hoodwinked"?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  It's been a while, but yeah.
R:  Ha?
L:  [NOISE]  I said it's been a while but, yeah, I've heard that.
R:  Yeah, they hoodwinked the hell out of the American masses.  See they know that we love --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our country.
L:  Right.
R:  And these people lie to us twenty four seven.  Hey, Jennifer, will you hold on one minute please?
L:  Sure, sure.  [NOISE]
R:  Let me get something.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
L:  [NOISE]  That's okay.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, but, ah, they -- they lie to us constantly.  [SIGH]  And, ah, they don't tell us the truth ever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's too bad that we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there're too -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wish the American masses 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would wake up.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE].  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Because that's what's so amazing to me that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, don't these people realise what's going on, you know?
R:  No, they -- they don't realise what's going on.  [SIGH]  They really don't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  If they realised what was going on they would tear up this country -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they knew.  [SIGH]  But they don't know.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't know what's going on at all.  [SIGH] But that's a terrible situation over there in Iraq.  [SIGH]  And it's not over till it's over.
L:  [NOISE]  Right, you know --
R:  You know, it's not over -- it's not over yet.
L:  Did you catch, ah, the President o- -- on the news last night?
R:  I'm so disappointed with him I don't even watch him anymore.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  It was, ah -- it was -- it was-- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, him trying ta, you know, he flew in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- on the SS Abraham Lincoln an --
R:  I know, yes -- I know about the publicity stunt.
L:  Exactly, and that's all it is --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- an -- and it's amazing that, you know, it -- it -- you know, he's in his little Marine gear or whatever it is --
R:  Yeah, he is, yeah.
L:  -- an -- and trying to look like he's one of the military guys --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, not that he's the guy saying, "Hey, go risk your life" for whatever it is --
R:  Yeah, they playing -- 
L:  -- you're risking.
R:  -- theater -- they're playing theater with the mind of the masses.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so now I don't watch him and, believe it or not, I voted for the fellow.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Did you?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  I'm so disappointed with him I don't even look at him.
L:  [LAUGH]  Now, did you vote for his father?
R:  [SIGH]  Yes, I did.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I tend to vote Republican --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a lot of issues, but I did not know the man --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would turn -- I did not know that --that he had -- I did not realise that he had -- I knew about his, ah -- ah, see, ah, the Bush and the Bush family -- press caught --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- his uncles, they supported the -- the German war.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, are you aware of that, right?
L:  You know what, I -- I don't know a -- a whole lot of politics.  [NOISE]
R:  Well -- well, I -- I -- I -- I -- I have a -- I have a Political Science degree.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm a school teacher by profession.
L:  [NOISE]  All right.
R:  And, ah, ah, the press caught Bush -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all of those guys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they -- they -- they -- they bought off for the German war --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were heavily involved in that.  [SIGH]  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these guys -- these guys in the White House now they -- I'm convinced --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they have Communist -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- leaning.  What they're doing to the country is just [SIGH] -- I mean it's just totally madness.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  What they're doing to the country is madness I mean, you know, for us to go in another country and -- they -- go into another country, eh, th- -- you know, ah, talking of.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  At one time we were going there because he had weapons of mass destruction.  [SIGH]  The next thing we know we're going there to free the Iraqi people.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, so I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- constantly every -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every ten mi- -- every -- every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two or three days the reason that we were going into Iraq changed.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  You understand.  So, I'm not --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, all of my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people are military people, you know, and if it was not, ah, for the military a lot of African Americans would never be able to see anything in the world.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, the military's a good thing.  It's been a excellent, ah -- ah -- ah -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's been a excellent thing for the African --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- American community --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --  and mostly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all -- all -- all the [SIGH] -- all the min- -- so called minority groups in the military have been excellent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, great access --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the- them, as well as corporate learning --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and matter of fact a better life.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  You understand?  And all of my people are military.  I have a brother right now that went to Vietnam and got totally messed up.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I can imagine.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so -- so, ah, I -- I -- I, you know, I love the military --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I hate seeing the military --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- manipulated by these -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these scoundrels who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are supposed to be our leaders for their own personal gain.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  And believe it or not, I'm convinced that, ah, a whole lot of the things that, [SIGH] if the American probably just would [SIGH] use their freedom to -- to read and do research, you'd be surprised at what you would uncover.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  And once you uncover enough about the people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the people need to really wake up, man.  These people really taken us down a bad road.  They've taken --
