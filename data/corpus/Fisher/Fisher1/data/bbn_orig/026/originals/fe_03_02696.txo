R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.  Hi.  Rosemary Murphy.
R:  Hi.  I'm Carrie Shamway[?].  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you doing? [NOISE] 
R:  Pretty good.  H- H- -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yes, holidays, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  I guess my -- actually, my favorite holiday is actually Christmas.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Why is that?
L:  Um, I just love the whole -- the whole spirit of Christmas and -- at one point for years, I used to actually take all of my living room furniture out and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- put it into my dining room, and redo my entire -- my entire house was like a little Christmas.
R:  Are you serious?  That's so cute.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah it was really cool.
R:  Like a whole Christmas decoration for the whole living room.
L:  Yeah, everything -- everything was decorated.  Every room had decorations, including the bathroom.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:   So, it's just a cool holiday, it just -- you know, it's a very hu- hu- -- the hustle and bustle is great.
R:  Mhm.  Are they --
L:  But, if I had to come up with a holiday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  Friendship Day.
R:  [LAUGH]  Friendship Day.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, because you don't -- you don't d- give your friends enough, uh, enough credit and you don't spend enough time with them.  A day just to spend with your friends, not with your family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, where you're -- you know, with your family sometimes, you have thrills with your family, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you spend time with them --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the holidays.
R:  Yeah, there's -- and I mean there's -- there's Mother's Day, there's Father's day --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sometimes there's Children's Sunday, like there's a lot of different things for family but not much for friends to, uh, enjoy together.
L:  Right.  And some -- and friends are important because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they give you the -- the respite from your family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In some cases.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I think I probably would pick Christmas as well.  My -- my family always --you know, like --we all get together.  My grandparents come, we -- we all, um, spend Christmas together.  And I -- I'm from Maine so, you know, the picturesque snow and everything, and we all go get the Christmas tree together, and so all the traditions are all there, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, we really enjoy Christmas together. 
L:  Yeah, we, um --
R:  Um.
L:  -- um, I'm -- I live in the north east and -- and now I live in Pennsylvania.  I used to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- live in New York.  And it -- it's cool with the snow and -- I just can't picture going down to Florida -- 
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  -- at Christmas time.
R:  Ooh, I couldn't -- I don't think -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I could get into the spirit, like I'm --I'm -- I go to school in New York City right now --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, I mean it snows sometimes, [LAUGH] but it -- it's not -- it doesn't feel like -- mm -- like Christmas at all until I get home and until the snow's falling, until it's freezing cold and you know.
L:  That's right, I mean how can you go s- Christmas shopping without it snowing and freezing, and having all those packages?  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like about the holiday.  You know, the holiday is an important -- you know those are part of the holiday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, what do you decorate?  A palm tree with some -- with some Christmas lights on it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and go shopping in shorts?  I --
R:  I think I'd -- I'd feel silly doing it, like I'd feel completely out of place. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly, it -- it's -- it's just not the -- it's just not the traditional thing that you'll expect to have, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, you know it's just -- you know and it's the for kids, and you know it, and even adults and you just bring in new traditions every year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we added -- this year we added from -- it was my family, we added a secret Santa.
R:  [LAUGH] We did that on --
L:  And --
R:  -- uh, we do that among my roommates as well.  We all come together and we do a secret Santa.  We went out for the, uh, Christmas dinner this year right before we went home for a -- for break.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we all, you know, exchanged gifts and had a nice dinner together, and it was a lot of fun.  Like it was a good bonding experience [LAUGH] and we're all, you know we -- we all like enjoyed the -- the whole night so.
L:  Right, exactly.  I mean, you know that's -- that's the fun of it, you know?  Getting together with people and -- and -- and you know, family, friends, and it's not just a gift, that's -- you know, in some cases that's important but that's not the key.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The key is -- is actually setting the time and saying, you know, "This has to be done because it's the holiday times that we have to get together".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you don't set enough time during the rest of the year.  You think you're too busy, or you just -- you know, you just don't set --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the time to do all of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's -- to me that -- you know, that's important, um, you know, to just -- you know, to spend time with the people that you want to spend time with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And, um, and, you know, you sometimes don't get to see people unless it's the holidays.
R:  Yeah, exactly, and like with this -- on a school schedule as well, like Christmas is the home coming, like you get to -- you get to go home for a long period of time and see old friends if -- you know, if they're coming home as well, and see family that you've been away from for four or five months, you know.
L:  Exactly.  That's -- that's --
R:  It -- it's the kids' break and --
L:  -- a definite, you know, that's definitely true.  [NOISE] In my family, my cousin has six children and I spend my holidays with them.  And they're spread around.  At one point, they were spread around four -- three different states.  [NOISE] The only holiday everybody came home for was Christmas Eve.
R:  Yeah.  And that -- I mean that just adds a lot more -- like it -- it's a lot more special if everybody -- you know, 'cause everybody -- everybody has to make the effort to come together, and people will do it for Christmas so.  You know, it's everybody's joint effort to get together.  It just makes it that much more --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- meaningful.
L:  -- and even some of the kids are divorced, you know, and their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the rule is that -- that they -- the -- the grandchildren are with them Christmas Eve.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that all of the kids are together, all the grandchildren, everybody gets to see everybody at that time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And that's important.  That's important for -- you know, for -- for everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] you just --you know, you buil- buil- -- and you build on traditions and that's -- I think it's important to have some sort of tradition.
R:  Yeah, I mean, even if it's not a strong religious tradition as well, like just to have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, the whole coming together and just spending time together.  Like I know my -- my family has a pretty strong Christian background.  My Dad's a -- a minister. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so we do all of the, you know, the religious aspect of it as well, but just -- just the tradition of being together and spending the time together, I think, is --
L:  Right, I mean what we --
R:  -- right up there, so.
L:  -- and we're very -- we're very big on singing Christmas carols.
R:  Yeah.  We always have Christmas carols [LAUGH] --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- around my neighborhood.  Yeah.
L: -- and what we -- while well, we do it within the family 'cause there's like thirty people at -- at the Christmas Eve.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And what we end up having is, um, the newest person, you know, like who brought their new boyfriend or new girlfriend or whatever, they have to be the partridge in the pear tree.
R:  Oh, God. [LAUGH]
L:  When we do the twelve days of Christmas, so every time we get to a partridge, they gotta stand up and say that, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and a partridge in a pear tree.
R:  Initiation by humiliation, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.  Actually, we did find one guy -- my cousin's boyfriend -- who actually thought this was cool, and he --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he wanted to do it again next year. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no! [LAUGH]  And -- but he can't, 'cause he's not the new person. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well, we didn't have another new person, so we said, "Go ahead.  You like it, do it."
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, but it's fun.  It's fun to get -- you know, to -- to just do those -- the --you know, to do all the different things, and you know, and to see everybody and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and see what -- what's happening, you know?
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I love -- Christmas is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- definitely the top of the list, and I -- I mean, I like the -- a lot of the culture, like the -- the different ethnic holidays as well.  Like I really -- I love St Patrick's Day --
L:  Oh, I love St. Patrick.
R:  -- I enjoy like -- just to see -- like here in New York City this weekend, there's the Puerto Rican Day Parade -- like I just love to go to all the festivals.
L:  Yes, 'cause it's Cinco de Mayo [inaudible] tomorrow.  What is the -- no, Monday is Cinco de Maya [inaudible], right?
R:  Yeah, so is Mexico.  I like -- I just -- I love going to all the festivals, and [inaudible] New York just makes it that much more like --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- out of -- out there.  Like [NOISE] to have so many different cultures all in one place, and to be able to experience it [several inaudible words].  And in the summer there's the Caribbean, um, carnival, like everything is like to the extreme, and it's -- I -- I just love being here to experience all of the different -- you know, the different holidays.
L:  And you also have all of the Italian feasts in the summer, we're told, the end of the summer?
R:  E- E- -- exactly.  So I've -- also [inaudible]  have -- actually, here in -- I -- I -- [NOISE] I go to school in the Bronx, so it's in the Belmont community --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [NOISE] and they have the big [NOISE] Fere[?] Gosta[?] [inaudible] festival in August.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, it just -- it's -- it's great.  It's so -- it's so good to see everybody in their element and doing their -- their thing, and to be exposed to all the different holidays that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- people celebrate all over the world --
L:  I mean, I --
R:  -- right here in New York. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I mean, I do like Thanksgiving though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, Thanksgiving's good because you don't have the gift giving thing, and you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is like your start to -- we actually use that as our jump off to discuss menus for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and finalize what we're going to do when, so that we can -- you know, we don't have duplicated food.  We hate having duplicated food.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  And you know, and we like to keep to a theme, and you know, um, each year, you know, to have something different.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, so we use that as our ju- ju- -- our ju- ju- -- our jumping point, and we also pick names on Thanksgiving, so that not every --
R:  So that you can pick a Santa.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's cool, you know, and that makes it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- n- n- -- that makes it good.  You have a little time to shop.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Yeah.  'Cause in our family, we have more of just like our immediate family that has Thanksgiving together, and it's -- it's just time for just us.  An' then when we get to Christmas, everybody comes together, like all of the aunts and uncles --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and grandparents and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I wish -- we -- we kind of live far away from the rest of the family, so we're -- we're alone on Thanksgiving and they're all together, but then we join them for Christmas, so.
L:  Right, well.  You --
R:  You know, it's a good thing.
L:  Yeah, that's -- you know that's -- that's okay too, yo- yo- -- you know to have -- that -- that gives you the -- those memories and those things that you have to build on for later, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  And --
R:  -- no I lo- lo- -- I -- I love it there.  It's just our family is as-- well, [NOISE] it gives us more, -- you know, time because my sister has graduated from college and my brother is in college now, I'm in college, so it's a -- it's the only time that we get [NOISE] together as a -- like a [NOISE] nuclear family too.
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's --
R:  [several inaudible words] Just do whatever to --
L:  You know, that's, um, you know, and then you have -- of course, you have your summer holidays.  You know, where --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- where you know, your barbeque holidays, you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Fourth of July.
L:  You know, you got your Memorial Day, your Fourth of July and your Labor Day, which -- you know, we've actually -- you know -- actually, we've kept away from family holi- -- we've kept them away from family holidays.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  We haven't made them family holidays that -- because we have so many other things that we do.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's like we -- we got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and this year we have like too many family things coming up that we'd all like, "No. I don't wanna see you guys on holidays, on a -- on -- in the summer holidays too".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but, um --
R:  [LAUGH] Go away.
L:  You know, I -- I have weddings too many holiday weekends this year.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I have a wedding --
R:  Yeah, I wish people wouldn't do that.  I wish people wouldn't put their hol- hol- -- their weddings on -- like we ha- ha- -- we have friends who had their wedding on New Years Eve of two thousand.  Like, [NOISE] you -- it was hard to make that decision. [LAUGH] Like, you know --
L:  Yes, like -- mhm.
R:  -- the wedding, or do you celebrate New Year's Eve with your friends, or what do you do?  It's just sort of quite a -- it's [inaudible] a controversy. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I have a wedding Memorial Day.  That's Sunday of Memorial Day this year.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean, it's the middle of the weekend.
R:  It -- it kind of feels selfish to me. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it's like, "Well, you know, people "
