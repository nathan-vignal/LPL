R:  [NOISE] Hi. I'm --  
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Charlesetta. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Charles.
R:  I'm Charlesetta. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Charles.
R:  Oh, you're Charles?  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm calling from Savannah, Georgia.  Where you calling from? [NOISE]
L:  Up in Oregon, up here in Portland.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  And is this your first call?
L:  It is actually.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Mine too.  So, how do we start this?
L:  Well, we're supposed to be talking about holidays, and if we could create one --
R:  [NOISE] What would --
L:  What we would do?  And how we'd celebrate it, so 
R:  [NOISE] Would you create one if you could? [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  [MN] Most of the holidays that we have 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tend to be over commercialized anyway, so I'm not sure that creating a new one would necessarily do any good.
R:  [NOISE] You -- you think so?  But how did you feel about the creation of Martin Luther King's holiday? [NOISE]
L:  Mm  [SIGH]  I don't know.  It has a lot of meaning behind it -- a lot of holidays do.  Um, the holidays that we've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- created as a nation to be able to celebrate people who've done great things for the country --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- tend to actually have a little bit more meaning behind them than holidays that have a religious backing.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.  Um, and I think that particular holiday is under celebrated because, as time goes on, the newer generations don't remember the struggles that we older generations went through to get to this point --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- um, and like Christmas used to be, um, a holiday of reflection.  Now, it's more of a commercial holiday.  "What can I buy?"  You know.  The stores are, "How many people can we get into the -- to the store?  How many sales can we make?"  Um, we've commercialized so much that creating a holiday -- another holiday wouldn't benefit the -- beneficia- -- beneficial to us spiritually, but only monetarily, I think.  How do you feel? [NOISE]
L:  Well, if I did create a holiday, it would have absolutely nothing to do with giving anybody anything --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- other than time and attention.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  [MN] Um, wha- --
L:  And it wouldn't even be like how Valentines Day is, how supposedly you're supposed to be spending time with the person you love --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- uh, at this point it's, "Oh, gee!  What can I buy them?"
R:  I know.  Let -- let me get some candy or some flowers, but ev- -- everybody's standing on the corner selling something for a holiday.
L:  Uh --
R:  I will -- I would like to see, um, September eleventh celebrated or recognized in some kind of way.  What do you think?
L:  [SIGH] I think that that would kind of spur things on, on both positive and a negative side though, 'cause you have -- usually you have some people that would be very violent about saying, [NOISE] "All that that's doing is celebrating terrorist attacks" instead of saying, "Celebrated how a nation got together to stand together after attacks". [NOISE]
R:  Right.  [NOISE] Um, we come from a military background, so for us, it would be more of a reflection of how, like you said, a -- a nation coming together and reflecting, um, on such a devastation, and --and it, I feel it's one day we could all, as a nation say, "We -- it happened to all of us".  It wasn't just a particular group.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, this was a mass destruction.  It -- it'd -- it even affected other countries, and those countries +rallied, um, together as well with the US.  I -- I think that's why we're now in Afghanistan, and, um, Iraq, because of those attacks.  Don't you? [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I think that there's a lot of miscommunication between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- officials and general public as to reasons to have been there, from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what it seems now versus when we first started going in there but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that was motivation behind being there in the first place. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Um, I remember the first attack on Iraq.  Um, the reasoning behind it was to get them out of Kuwait, um, and that's all we did, was liberate Kuwait.  If we would've gone in and taken out the regime, maybe we wouldn't be in a situation that we're in today.  Um, it's like fighting the battle twice.  What do you think? [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think that we could do a lot that would be positive and good in -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- starting a new holiday for celebrating September eleventh overall.
R:  I -- I -- I would love to see some kind of celebration.  I know the first anniversary was done very tasteful.  Um, I sat and watched every memorial I could on it, and I cried --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- um, I just felt so proud to be an American that day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To see those celebrations and people honored, um, so many volunteers, firemen and policemen lost their lives trying to help others --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and that's something to be proud of.  People actually came to each other's aid without regard to their own lives, and tha- -- and that's something Americans have always fought for in the modern generation, and I -- I just so -- feel so proud to be an American.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, like the Fourth of July is a big celebration for all of us, and we tend to forget why we celebrate it but we just celebrate it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I- -- it's a day of re- -- just being together, proud to be an American.  
L:  [NOISE] What about you?
R:  [NOISE] I really --
L:  What would you create for a holiday?
R:  Um, [NOISE] maybe a national day of mourning [NOISE] for so many other things that have [NOISE] happened as well.  Just set aside a national day of [NOISE] mourning, for prayer, for everyone.  [NOISE] That would be my way of -- of creating a holiday. [NOISE] And it wouldn't be any particular event.  It would just [NOISE] be to celeb- -- to reflect on everything we've struggled to get through.  What do you think?  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.  [SIGH] I'd do probably -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, I'm not sure.  In m- -- my -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my ideas behind holidays generally tend to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have them be more uplifting topics than mourning. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Well, not mourning.  It's a celebration of life, of what we've done for each other, um, reflection.  Reflection means so much that passes on history.  That's how I see it.  Um, after serving so many years with the government, it -- it's just a [NOISE] remembrance, a day of remembrance.  And I -- [NOISE] I maybe I'm old fashioned. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I'm forty six and I'm -- I'm starting [several inaudible words] -stead.  How old are you? [NOISE]
L:  I'm twenty two.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay, so you haven't gotten to that point yet?
L:  Not quite.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I -- I'm -- I'm just really proud of what our country has gone through [NOISE] as a nation.  Um, that everything we -- we do, is a celebration for me.  Every time we take a stand to help another country is a -- is a celebration for me.  Um, I've had siblings that have gone into active service.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I know people that have lost their lives in battle, and not just from September eleventh, you know, just ordinary little things that have happened, and so I just wanna celebrate our greatness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And -- and that's how I -- I don't see that as a day of mourning.  Like the, um, I think if the World War Two veterans have a --have never had a monument put up for them, and they're finally putting one up, [NOISE] and that's all they're asking, [NOISE] is a day of reflection, a day of remembrance.  [NOISE] "Recognize me, um, I was there".  [NOISE] I went, um, walking through DC the other day and what -- went [NOISE] through the Vietnam wall, because I'm in that era, of the Vietnam era [NOISE] and it -- it -- it was so proud [NOISE] to see people stand there and just touch the names on the wall, and [NOISE] I -- well, it -- like I said, just a day of reflection, of p- -- being proud to be who you are.  Now, do you ever think you'll do government service?  [NOISE] Just in military? [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, 'cause right now I'm doing stuff for a college in -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing, um, hopefully starting graduate work in the fall.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  And me and my fiancee --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have plans to travel to Japan to teach English --
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- as a foreign language --
R:  As a [NOISE] --
L:  --in Japan.
R:  [NOISE] Oh okay.  Not [NOISE] --
L:  And so I'm not sure that I would --
R:  [NOISE] You -- you would think about such a service?  [NOISE] Well, in a way, y- -- you're still serving your country, um, going over doing something like that.  That's broadening your horizons, that's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And I -- I see it as a service.  Everything I -- that we do with another country, I see as a service to our country, I really do.  [NOISE] Um, I hope we'd -- in your era, you won't face some of the devastation and wars that we've had to go through. [NOISE]
