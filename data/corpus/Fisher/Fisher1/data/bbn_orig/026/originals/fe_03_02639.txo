R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi, I'm Mike.
L:  Oh, I -- I'm Mike as well.
R:  [SIGH]  All right.  Well, at least --
L:  Mike, where -- where -- 
R:  We will -- at least we will --
L:  -- are you located?
R:  Mm?
L:  Where are you located?
R:  Ah, near Chicago.
L:  Okay, I'm in, ah, I'm in Evansville, Indiana.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, so -- 
L:  We -- [NOISE]
R:  -- just about three hundred miles south?  [SIGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Well, the -- the topic's a little outdated, isn't it?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I'd say it's a -- a little outdated, ah, we sort of --
L:  I thought we already disarmed 'em?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, we sort of know how this came out.  [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] so, um, [SIGH] I'm a little surprised 'cause I thought I was only gonna be -- -e called three times and this is already my fourth, so  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, we've been called quite a few times, actually.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, so -- ah, may be they're getting a little out of control here.
L:  [NOISE]  Well --
R:  And --
L:  -- like -- [NOISE] I mean -- I don't ha- have a problem. I guess we can do a precursor discussion abou it.  If -- if you're into that, if you want to discuss it?
R:  Yeah, sure.  Um, you know, I -- I don't really know that the topics have anything to do with anything, other than, ah, [SIGH] I think it's a linguistic study.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, so they just want people to talk and they need to have them talk about something.  [SIGH]
L:  All right.  Then do you want to change the topic?
R:  Um, do you have a topic handy or we can talk about Iraq now, what they should do, ah, either one.  [MN]
L:  Well, I -- I'm comfortable with -- with either if you want to stay on the same, ah -- if you want to stay on the topic that they already introduced?  [SIGH]  I'm comfortable with that if you want to begin the conversation. [SIGH] What -- what's your opinion?  What do you think should happen with the government in Iraq?
R:  Well, I think, ah, that they're gonna need to get out of there as soon as possible, 'cause, ah, [SIGH] I don't know exactly how they're going to set up some kind of stable government but, [SIGH] I'm afraid we're [SIGH] likely to be suicide bombed and demonstrated to death.  [SIGH]  You know, what happened the other day with the thirteen, ah, people who, ah, were [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] ah, well either accidentally killed or killed on purpose, or we were responding to people shooting -- you know, in -- in any kind of crowd situation, it's really kind of hard to tell what really went on.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I -- I agree with you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm -- I'm a little concerned with -- I -- I understand your point of, you know, our number one concern should be the Americans and the welfare of the Americans being over there, [SIGH] um, but then I guess you had to look at the point of -- and it's surreal to me the -- the realism of it is kind of hard for me to grasp, because I'm not there and I've never been there so, it's -- it's really something that I can't really put in -- in realistic perspective.  But I will say [SIGH] we -- we did go over, we did what needed to be done to take care of Mr Saddam Hussein [SIGH] and now we -- not that they were in a good position to begin with, but we've disrupted life in Iraq and I think that we do have some --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- some sort of responsibility to help rebuild.  Not all the responsibility, but I do think we have to contribute to it.  Does that mean that we should put American lives at risk?  I guess that's -- that's the major question.  And --
R:  Yeah, and the p- -- part of the question is how the heck we get out of there with -- I mean, [MN] you don't want to leave chaos, you -- you're absolutely right, [SIGH] ah, but w- -- you know, the longer we're in there the more, you know, risky it is and the more likely that, ah, you know, the troops will be a target and, [SIGH] you know, these are -- [SIGH] I mean -- I -- I -- you know, they're highly trained military guys on the one hand.  [SIGH]  On the other hand, you know, my neighbor's kid is over there and he's like, you know, nineteen, um, and, you know, I still think of him as like a nineteen year old kid.  [LIPSMACK]  Except --
L:  That's a perspective I can't have.  I don't -- I don't know anyone that's over there so it's hard for me to put it in that of [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, I don't know anyone so it's hard for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to say that but [COUGH] I do I -- I agree with you I -- I think we have to be careful of [PAUSE] American lives and that -- that should be our number one concern.  That's why we went over there to straighten things out.  [MN]  Um, but what -- what's going to happen to the government?  Of course you hear all the rumors that -- an -- an -- and I'm tired of hearing the, "Oh, we just went over to take over the oil".  Um, [LAUGH] obviously that's the -- that mentality I -- I don't agree with.  But I do think that [COUGH] you know, we -- we got to be careful because now Iran wants to go in there and take over [inaudible] -- or Iran, however you want to pronounce it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they want to go in and take over.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I think there is a -- a bigger picture than what's really been drawn and now -- now does this leads us into Syria?  Now, we're going to have to go over there and -- and put our -- our military force on them next?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I don't think it's going to stop with this.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And, you know, that's kind of unfortunate.  It's kind of hard to figure out how [SIGH] you know, how y- -- you know, we had Afghanistan this year and -- I mean last year, [SIGH] and Iraq this year and, ah, you know, it gets a little thinner all the time.
L:  I mean -- and the Middle East has been a mess for a while [SIGH] and it -- we've pretty much stayed out of it and we've tried to keep it in check but, I mean, let's be quite honest, nine eleven is when they invited us over.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And if they wouldn't have -- if they -- if that didn't happen -- and anybody who tells me that there's not more involved than just, um, Osama Bin Laden and Afghanistan, then I -- I don't if I can agree with that because I do think there's -- there's a lot more going on over there.  I think there is a conspiracy [SIGH] in the Middle East against the West.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, there's a lot of frustration.  You know, they, ah, [SIGH] we're an easy target 'cause, you know, i- it's easy to blame them -- the countries that are materially more successful.  [SIGH]  Ah, it does seem like, you know, considering how much oil wealth they have, they haven't really [SIGH] um, you know, succeeded in building, ah -- or, you know, a modern society as much as you might think given the -- you know, the amount of money they've -- you know, they've had to play around with over there. [SIGH]  So 
L:  Ah, that's -- that's -- that's definitely true.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] so I think, you know, blaming it on the US is more convenient than trying to, um, [SIGH] you know, figure out well, what's wrong with the overall society and -- and, ah, you know, how can they get, you know, get their own society moving.  You know, we're a nice target.  [MN]
L:  And they're not going to be able to do it, that's -- [SIGH] that's why I think maybe we -- we can help 'em but I do -- I do expect us to benefit from it, from the oil.  We should benefit from it if we're going over there [SIGH] and trying to fix the problems that they have.
R:  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE] So -- [LIPSMACK]  So, we're kind of in violent agreement here.
L:  Yeah.  And so it -- it would be better I guess if we disagreed because then the conversation could really get heated.
R:  Yeah.  We'd have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a more heated conversation.  [SIGH]  Ah --
L:  Okay, so let's disagree about something.  Are you a baseball fan?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, well, a little bit -- a little bit, you know --
L:  Okay, so --
R:  -- more so in the spring than any other time 'cause th- -- the Cubs haven't, you know, gone down to the last place yet.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, yeah, the Cubs are playing real well right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See my wife's from Chicago and her family's from Chicago so [SIGH] I -- and I -- I'm an Atlanta Braves fan so I like to razz them a little bit about it but -- hey, Dusty Baker's doing a great job for the Cubs right now.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, but you know, they -- they often start off good in the spring and then just kind of fade away.  So --
L:  Then how long have you been in Chicago?
R:  Ah, since seventy eight -- so, about twenty five years.
L:  So, you -- you -- you, yeah, you've definitely experienced all the ups and downs?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you -- you never -- you never went to the other side and watched the White Socks though?
R:  Ah, yeah -- I -- I been, you know [LIPSMACK] I used to go to the old Socks park but they built a new one, ah, I've never actually, you know, gone to a Socks game since then, even though that's been, oh, ten years anyway.  I guess, [SIGH] you know, the -- the ball park gets kind of negative reviews.  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] you know, in a way the Socks aren't, you know, as interesting and it's hard to say exactly why, yeah -- you know, I don't -- I don't really know why.
L:  Well, I think it's because the Cubs have so much character.
R:  Yeah and they got -- you know, they got the cute little ball park and they got the Ivy there and, you know, it's right stuck in the neighborhood so, ah, you know, that's kinda neat.  So, how long have you been in Evansville?
L:  Ah, just, ah, eight weeks now, actually.
R:  Eight weeks, huh.
L:  Uh-hum.  I'm an a -- I'm an executive chef at a country club here.
R:  Oh, so you've been -- been in the chef, ah, business for a while?
L:  Ah, eleven years.
R:  Eleven years, huh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a pretty good -- pretty good stint.
L:  And yourself?
R:  Ah, I'm, ah, a statistician with a marketing research firm.
L:  Oh, no kidding?
R:  Yeah, so I push numbers around all -- all day.
L:  Well, being a baseball fan I definitely respect your job.  [SIGH]  A statistician is a, um -- that's -- that's, um, I love numbers.  I mean it's a -- it's another language.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what kind of a -- status -- stats that you take, or that you keep?  What i- -- what is it for?
R:  Ah, basically, we -- the company I work for, we buy receipts from about, ah, twenty thousand stores in the United Sates, mostly grocery stores, drug stores, discount stores [SIGH] and then we analyze those and sell 'em to, ah, manufacturers so they can track their own sales and their competitors' sales.  [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, it's -- yeah that's a pretty important thing to do.
R:  Yeah.  So, data come in, data come out [SIGH] and, ah, you know, in between they go through the computers.  [LIPSMACK]  So 
L:  And -- do -- do you have certain times of year when it's crazier for you?
R:  Ah 
L:  Or it is pretty much an even keel situations?
R:  No, it's pretty much an even thing, we -- you know, most of our reporting we do, you know, either every week or every four weeks [SIGH] and so, that aspect of the work is pretty steady.  [SIGH]  Ah, I basically do product development.  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] and so that kind of -- you know, that -- that has -- either nothing's going on or usually it's kind of backed up with more projects than there are to do, so   [SIGH]  Um, actually, this week I've been working a lotta twelve and thirteen hours days but, you know, [SIGH] that's -- that's why I love getting the call -- the ca-
