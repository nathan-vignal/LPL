L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Liz.  I'm from New York.
R:  Hey, my name's Brett.  I'm fr- -- I'm from Philly.
L:  Oh, Philadelphia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what do you feel about this?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, are we only allowed to talk about this, do you think?  I guess -- I guess that would be --
L:  Yeah, I guess it means disarming, you have to talk about disarming Iraq --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and how we feel about it and should that be our main objective.
R:  Right.  How --
L:  I -- I -- I think we should.  That should be our main objective.  Especially being from New York.  I mean, you're from the East Coast as well.
R:  Right.
L:  And being close to what happened, I think that should be their major concern.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I g- -- I mean, obviously if -- considering the fact that that's, like, I don't know, the only -- if -- in -- with regards to what's a call it, um, [LIPSMACK] if you -- if -- if they have nuclear weapons and all that stuff, um ... [LAUGH] I -- I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not into this.
L:  Oh, my -- my motto is get them before they get us.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Like, the preemptive strike thing?  But I don't --
L:  You know, and I'm not for going there and killing innocent lives, but, you know, I have to look out for my own as well.
R:  Right.  But every -- all the money spent, like, on the military and all that can be spent in other ways also.  But then again, if they are gonna be using nuclear weapons, it doesn't matter what the hell we -- you know what I mean, like we have --
L:  That's true, but our -- our government spends money --
R:  No matter what.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  On craziness.
L:  So, if they're -- if they're not spending it on military, I'm sure they're spending it on other unnecessary things.
R:  Something wasteful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I try not to follow it too much because I get too aggravated and, you know, like I said, I'm not pro war, but I don't think people should be parading in the streets saying that we shouldn't go and fight for our country 'cause that's basically what we're doing.
R:  Right.  Well, they're talk- -- the people who are -- are you talking about the, um, protestors and everything?  They're -- they're not against our troops, they're just against violence in general because they think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- violence begets violence and all that stuff.  But --
L:  I would say, I guess they have a point, but ...
R:  But like, they're thinking idealistically and the world is practical, it's not idealistic, so ...
L:  But they wouldn't be saying that if it happened to them.
R:  Um --
L:  You know, I witnessed firsthand.  I -- you know, I've lost neighbors to the World Trade Center and I almost lost three family members who were supposed to be there that -- that day, so I -- I kinda think [SIGH] we should go get them, but then again -- you know, I'm confused. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't think, um ... it -- I think that a p- -- if someone was pers- personally affected by it and still has that mentality of the peace thing, then, like, I respect that, actually, but like I said, it's an idealistic thing and the world -- like, if you're idealistic, usually, like, the world, like, you know, bites you in the ass or whatever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because --
L:  I've been bitten many times. [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  I said I've been bitten many times.  It's true.
R:  Yeah, there you go.
L:  You -- you can't have one without the other.  You know, you can't say I want peace but [SIGH] you can't have -- you -- you can't live in peace if -- if --
R:  That's that thing, in order to have peace one must prepare for war or whatever.
L:  Right, and I don't think we should sit back and wait for something else to happen.
R:  Right.
L:  I think Bush number one, Bush senior, should have done this a long time ago.
R:  Right.  And that's why -- that's one of the, like, real reasons that we're -- that they probably went to war, huh, like, the fact that he wanted to, like, make up for his dad's failures, um, the fact that there's, like, oil involved, all that other stuff.  I don't know.
L:  I could care less about the oil.  I think that's fair --
R:  Well, you could, but I mean the United States is --
L:  No, right, mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  You're right.
R:  Their self interest and I don't know.  And --
L:  I -- I think whatever -- we -- our concern should be just about protecting ourselves, not taking from another country.
R:  Yeah, but if --
L:  I don't even think we should go there and free their country, you know.  That's up to their people.
R:  Right, like, they -- the way they spun it, the Operation Iraqi Freedom, it -- it should have been called o- operation we don't get bombed or we don't get gassed or whatever --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, obviously that's not a very catchy title, but I'm saying if -- if --
L:  Exactly.  No, you're -- you're a hundred percent right.  I agree with that.
R:  Right, 'cause that's all spin, Iraqi Freedom.  Like, the United States is the babysitter of democracy or whatever, but there -- there's a -- the United States has to go to twenty or thirty -- they have to go to China now.  They have to go to tons of places now if they -- if they really, like, practice what they preach, like, they believe in everyone having freedom.  It just so happens that we go to a country that's, like, rich in oil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that also the father of the president, like, failed to beat the guy last -- I don't know.  It's kinda cyn- -- I don't know.  I mean, I'm cynical about all this crap, but --
L:  You're right.  I -- I never thought of -- thought of it like that, but you're right.  Yeah, exactly.  We shouldn't be -- we should be worried about ourselves --
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  -- rather than -- I mean, I think it's -- I don't agree with how they treat women and kids and [SIGH] -- and I don't agree with what they do, but I think that's up to their own people.
R:  Right, and that's their culture.  Like, we're not really able to understand -- not -- I don't think it's right either, but, um, you know, a large part of the world looks at a lot of those things a lot differently than we do.  Like, I mean, not -- I -- I think it's wrong, obviously, to, um, you know, take away people's, like, basic human rights or whatever.  I mean, that's an obvious thing, but --
L:  We could be spending it --
R:  -- they wouldn't see it because the way that they were raised and the -- their world view is so much different than ours.  Like, they -- they look at it as like they -- they're happy to give up those things.  At least some people do.
L:  We're -- we're the bad guys.
R:  What's that?
L:  They look at us like the bad guys.
R:  Right.
L:  We're the sinners.  We're -- we're going to hell.
R:  Right.
L:  We have television and our women don't wear burkhas and --
R:  All that stuff.
L:  Men control them.  I just -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, obviously it's -- it's kinda ridiculous.
L:  But like you said, they can -- they'll have to do that in China also, you know.
R:  They'll have to do it everywhere.  There's no -- there's tons.
L:  Africa, Thailand[?], yeah.
R:  There's a lot -- yeah, there's a lot of places in Africa.  There's -- yeah.  Like, in the past, um, well, they did -- they did help out with some of that, like, Milosevic stuff that was going on and everything, but --
L:  Well, that's true.  They're doing that in China with the -- the, uh, sterilization laws and the forced abortions and --
R:  But this is -- the difference is this was an all out war that cost, like, billions of dollars that, like, they were willing to, like, have many European nations, like, disagree with them.  Like, the only country that supported them was England.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I didn't follow it very much either, but I know -- I know that England's one of the only countries that supported them.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's probably due to the fact that they w- -- that has to do with trading and stuff, I would think.  Like, you have --
L:  Of course.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Of course.  Oil.
R:  Yeah, and -- and just --
L:  And Russia -- Russia, too.  Russia traded them oil for, uh, I believe, anthrax and --
R:  Weapons and stuff.
L:  -- nuclear weapons and stuff, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Smallpox.
R:  Is your -- is your participation in this through University of Pennsylvania?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I guess yours is also, right?
R:  Yeah, but I didn't know that they, like -- they must have done this all throughout a lot of -- I didn't realize they went -- they even would go outside of the city or whatever to do it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  They go to, uh, Texas, I believe, also.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Which I -- this is the first time I've done this.
R:  And they listen to this stuff?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I guess they wanna get your views on [SIGH] the topics and what's going on in the world.
R:  I guess that's what it is.
L:  I think it's kinda cool, though, too, because you get to speak with other people about different issues and ...
R:  Right, like some of the stuff -- yeah, they said some example of some of the topics or whatever on the voice message or whatever.  Did you hear it when you called -- or -- or no, I read it or something, I forget now.
L:  No, I didn't hear it.  They just said something about Iraq and disarmament and ...
R:  Right, but I meant, like, in -- I heard something else that, like, talked about just general what the topics would be like.
L:  No, I didn't hear that.
R:  Anyway, um, is there supposed to be, like, a beep that goes off or whatever or ...?
L:  I think so.  Has it been ten minutes?
R:  Uh, probably close to it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If, um, let me think about -- like, it's weird 'cause, like, the topic just came on, the person's voice or whatever, and then --
L:  It doesn't give you enough time to think.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, obviously that's why I felt, like, retarded [LAUGH] trying to, like, trying to talk about it at first because -- I don't know, but I'm a teacher also, so ...
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you teach?
R:  I teach, um -- I teach high school to kids that, like, dropped out of school.
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, I do occupational therapy.
R:  All right.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm a student as well. [LAUGH] It's probably why I don't have no time to watch the news or read the newspapers and ...
R:  Right.
L:  Sometimes it -- it's better not knowing.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you're basically just being fed whatever spin the company that owns the newspaper or the TV station wants you to be fed anyway.
L:  That's true.  Whatever -- whatever they feel would make you read it more or they turn it towards their views and ...
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think we ever get the whole truth anyway.
R:  Right, I don't think so either.
L:  You know, I don't think we see, like, the casualties --
