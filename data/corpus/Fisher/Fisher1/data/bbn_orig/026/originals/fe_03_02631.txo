L:  Hello?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, hi.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  My name's Phyllis, what's yours?
L:  I'm Cassandra.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.  This topic's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, bu- because it's such a controversy.
L:  [SIGH]  I know and I'm just, you know, [SIGH] I've kind of just [PAUSE] hidden away from it, like I haven't -- oh, gotten too involved in -- in it.  Like I normally get pretty involved in what's going on around me but I've kind of just not really watched too much of the news and kind of -- 'cause it's upsetting to me.  So, I kind of just avoid it a little bit.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And do you know my sister and different people I talk to they feel the same way, you know?
L:  Really?
R:  My sister said, "Can't look at it.  I get too nervous and everything".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  But it doesn't bother me at all.
L:  Really?
R:  It doesn't bother me at all.
L:  I get really -- you know, I get [PAUSE] -- it scares me and I think it scares me because [SIGH] with like the terrorists -- in which people hating America and I feel like [PAUSE] this encourages more of that and then I feel like there could be more people retaliating and coming through and trying to do these little suicide things and stuff.  And it's just -- I don't know.  It's just a scary idea.
R:  Right.
L:  Scary.
R:  And I heard too, give time, time and eventually you are gonna see that go on here in the States with those suicide bombers and all [SIGH] but I don't -- for some reason I have a lot of faith in Bush --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because he gung ho, you know.
L:  I know.
R:  Well, he just doesn't talk about it, he goes and he does it.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  And I like the way -- I don't know if you like the way he handles everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I do.  Be--
L:  Well, he seems pretty, ah, focused and, ah, he goes after what he wants.  Like he's not wishy washy at all and so, I mean, you just have to trust him.  I mean, I --I honestly like the fact th- -- that I know that he tries -- I mean -- I mean, I think he tries to get direction from God and spend time in prayer and that makes me feel a little more confident.  Just because of how I feel about that, but I guess that helps me be somewhat confident in him, but it's just -- I don't know, it's just so scary and I think I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  And, ah, he's not afraid either to show his faith, you know, where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the different ones said, "Oh, he's trying to mix religion and all" but he isn't.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  He -- he just feels this country was really [SIGH] ah, brought together by faith in God that's why the [SIGH] ah, words are even on the money and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "In God we trust".
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So --
L:  So.
R:  -- but, ah, I like the way he did it as far as he waited and waited and everybody was saying, "Oh, what's he waiting for?"  
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Either go or not go". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he -- I think what he was doing was he was just giving time.
L:  Uh-hum...
R:  You know, so that we could go in there.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And all that time that he was taking, he was taking the chance ta [SIGH] ah, really decide, ah, should we go after them with war?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Should we continue talking?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What should we do?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  But as far as us disarming them, um, it's a catch twenty two too.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  You don't know should we -- now that, ah, you know, they more or less have their country back again, should we just, you know, forget about their arms, or what, except if they have the chemicals?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Ah, I, ah, [SIGH] -- I mean I guess that was [MN] part of the, ah, you know, with Saddam not doing what he agreed to do with the United Nations and getting rid of his weapons of mass destruction, or whatever, I mean the whole plan was to go in there and -- and get rid of that and check out for chemical warfare and make sure he was going by the agreement.  But [SIGH] I don't know.  I mean, I'm glad it's coming to an end and I -- I just -- I hope that they get the right leadership and the ri- -- I mean th- -- I don't know, it just seems like the country's probably pretty much [PAUSE] really in a bad state right now.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So 
R:  And the thing that bothers me too is, ah, you have the people there that are all happy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like they're able to have their freedom back again and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they've never seen this in years and years and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- all of a sudden they're getting their country back again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But yet you see those, ah, what we really call them as cells --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where they're still behind Saddam.
L:  Yeah, they're extremist or, you know -- I -- it's just scary because [PAUSE] it seems [SIGH] like I don't -- I don't really like to think about it too much because it seems they're so desperate that they're willing to kill themselves for their cause [SIGH] and that they hate Americans and they -- [SIGH] for whatever reason, you know, it -- it seems so easy that they could just come here and, you know, do something.  An- -- and it's just -- I don't know it's just a scary idea to me [PAUSE] that, you know, these people are out there that are willing to kind of sacrifice everything to [PAUSE] make a statement or, you know, [SIGH] do something against Americans.  I think that's why I don't watch the news, or I try to avoid it 'cause I [LAUGH] it's like -- it just seems like a scary time to me.
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think what, ah, makes me so it doesn't bother me is just like Bush is always talking about faith --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I haven't got a faith.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I always feel from the moment we're born we're really born to die.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I think that part of living is all part of a school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And part of a scheme --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- getting our spirit ready to go to the other side.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I think once you feel in your mind that you're ready to go, which I am.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm one of those people.  I'm, ah, called the re-entry, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm part of a source at university.  I don't even go up there.  I'm in the archives up there.
L:  In the what?
R:  [SIGH]  In the archives, you know, where people can look up my name --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and get in touch with me and everything.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because I'm a re-entry and that's a person that had the life death experience.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  You know, where you die and you come back again.
L:  What did you -- ah, what did you experience?
R:  Oh, God, you -- I even go to these Bible studies now and the fellow there he always says, "Oh, Phyllis, tell your story".
L:  Did you see heaven?
R:  Yes.  And what --
L:  Did you see Jesus?
R:  -- what happened, it just changed my whole life --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and the one thing that we do have in common, you know, when I used to go to those meetings --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is we're all looking forward to dying and I can't wait.
L:  So, it was beautiful?  It was wonderful?
R:  It was.  And what happened --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Amazing.
R:  -- when I first, ah --
L:  I totally believe in that.
R:  -- when I -- when I first, ah, had the experience I wound up in pitch blackness.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was so black black --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that if you put your hand in front of you, because I remember I tried doing that, you couldn't even see your hand --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and instead of all the creatures like they say is in the other side --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there wasn't any of that -- there wasn't any voices.  There was just me --
L:  Darkness.
R:  -- and myself
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's what scared me knowing that I'd be in all eternity in just that black pit --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  And no -- at least if you heard creatures, or something, you'd know somebody's in the darkness, but there was nothing.  [SIGH]
L:  Then what happened?
R:  And then all of a sudden I saw a little, little tiny light like a -- a pin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the head of a pin and, um, [LIPSMACK] I had -- I headed toward the light --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and all of a sudden I was in that, ah -- that, ah, tube they talk about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I saw my -- there was different people and they -- on each side of that tube that you go through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I saw my aunt there and she was like, in a ghostly figure, you know -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- somebody you could look through?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But I recognized her and I was so happy and I started [SIGH] to go toward her --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and all of a sudden I zoomed through and shot out the other end.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And at the other end I was before this light.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And the light had all [SIGH] like the colors of a rainbow.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And all the sparkles were falling all down upon you.  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] when -- when I thought to myself, "Oh, my God, I'm with God" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like I just knew it.  I knew it, ah, within my heart that that's where I was.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And you were just bathed in this love and it was a love --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I never experienced here.
L:  Like indescribable.
R:  And I've never experienced it here, whether it be with a new house, a new car, the birth of a child, a marriage.  Anything that excites a person.
L:  Incredible love.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I felt that -- well, I went to heaven too, but that's a -- but I want to hear more of yours, okay, so then tell me.
R:  You did too?
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've had -- I was about eight years old.  So, tell me m- -- tell me more.  Tell me more.
R:  And so, then what happened --
