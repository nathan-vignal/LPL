L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Melissa.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] My name's Eileen.
L:  Hi.  Where do you live?
R:  Uh, New York City.
L:  Ho shh!  I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. [NOISE]
R:  Really, wow! [LAUGH] That's a far distance.
L:  [NOISE] It is. What time is it where you are?
R:  Um, it's about nine fifteen --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- nine twenty.
L:  [LAUGH] It's dinnertime where I live. [LAUGH]
R:  It's what?
L:  It's dinnertime. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I guess we're supposed to talk about holidays?
R:  Yes.  [NOISE] Um, you can start?
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Well, my favorite holiday is Easter.
R:  Yeah, and why?
L:  Well, the main reason is because I am a Christian and I believe in the basic meaning of the holiday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about the risen Savior.  And my other reason is because it's the start of spring, and [NOISE] spring is my favorite season.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE] So how 'bout you, do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] New Year's Eve.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, the reason why I like New Year's Eve is that everyone celebrates it of all nationalities.
L:  Uh, okay.
R:  You know, you can be French and you can be Irish, and you can be Protestant and you could be Catholic and you could be Jewish, and I think that's really something special. [SIGH] And, um, it comes once a year, and it seems to make everybody happy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, you do- -- you usually don't see that many depressed people on New Year's Eve.  People are usually happy, which is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- nice, right?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  A- -- and no gifts are expected, it's just whatever.
L:  [NOISE]  Right. 
R:  Um, and it can be celebrated by all ages as people.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Are you on a speakerphone?
L:  I am.  Does that bother you?
R:  Yeah, it's hard for me to hear you.
L:  [NOISE] Is that better?
R:  Yes, that's much better 
L:  Okay.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Okay, sure.
R:  I felt like you were screaming. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, okay, it's okay. 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like I just feel like New Year's Eve could be celebrated by a big party, or a small one, or just --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- at home --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- with who ever you like and --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just an easy sort of thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's my favorite. 
L:  Good.  [NOISE] So, I guess we're supposed to talk about creating a holiday?
R:  Yes.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, let's see, what would we create?  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, um, well I would, uh, celebrate New Year's Eve Two. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um, half a year, instead of like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you waiting a whole year?
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  You wait a half a year.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  So, let's see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  January, February, March, April, May and June.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I think I'd make New Year's Eve, uh, Two. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a- -- and just kind of, uh, celebrate it the same way.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  And, um, I don't know, since it's warm, I guess, uh, you could celebrate it outside or whatever.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Well, I think I would -- along the same lines -- I would create a half birthday. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause my birthday's in November --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and Christmas is in December, so --
R:  R- -- right.
L:  -- you know, they're both winter months, and so [NOISE] you know, I get my stock of winter clothes in, you know, at Christmas from my family --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I need a half birthday in, um, let's see, what would it be  May? [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
L:  -- to get summer clothes. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, my -- we actually have a lot of family birthdays in the fall and around [NOISE] Christmas time.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I know a lot of them would appreciate having them, uh, six months later. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, right. [LAUGH] Yeah, it would be nice to have two birthdays.
L:  Yeah, and actually, um, it's funny, my, um, my in laws do this tradition with us --
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, they spend half of the money that they're going to spend on our birthdays [NOISE] at the half birthday [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:   And the rest of it on our actual birthday. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's really good.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [MN] But it's not official, you know, so. [NOISE]
R:   Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  But that's like --
L:  Well.
R:  -- a really good idea.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  You know, that way you get two presents.
L:  Of course.
R:  Yeah, and two birthday cakes.
L:  [NOISE] Well, we actually don't do two birthday cakes, but that would be a great idea. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because birthday cakes are so much fun.
L:  Well, you know, the -- the kids can have two birthday parties a year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so that like, if their birthday's in the summer, and their friends are on vacation --
R:  Right.  They can have --
L:  -- they can have a half birthday later, and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it's a -- it's --
L:  -- their friends can come. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's really only fair, if you think about it.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] This is like a really cute idea for a children's book, too.
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You know, you know the child who had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two birthdays because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, h- -- her birthday was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in like, August?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, she couldn't see her friends, and so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.
L:  Do you write children's books?
R:  Uh, no, but I used to teach --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- little children.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  So, you know that's something they'd be interested in.
L:  Do you have little children?
R:  No, unfortunately I don't.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  How many children do you have?
L:  I'm sure you can hear mine crying. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I hear someone.
L:  He's ten months old.
R:  Oh, how cute. [NOISE]
L:  And then I have a two and a half year old daughter.
R:  Oh.  
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
R:  So, they must keep you very busy.
L:  [NOISE] They do, they do.  [NOISE]  Hi Sweetie!  Well, I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I don't know.  Um, so what else do you do on your birthday?
L:  Well, my, uh -- our tradition with my in laws is they take us on a birthday shopping trip.
R:  Really.
L:  And we can buy whatever we want.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they take us out to a [NOISE] special birthday lunch.
R:  Oh.
L:  We can pick whatever restaurant we want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if we want a homemade cake, or if we want, um, [NOISE] -- if we want, um, you know, a store bought cake or if we just want desert at the restaurant, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I, of course, always pick chocolate. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  I like chocolate too.
L:  [NOISE] So, uh --
R:  So, you definitely would be, um, wanting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two birthdays?
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --of course. [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  And now we live so far away from them, that they're probably gonna have to stop the tradition, because [LAUGH] --
R:  Where do they live?
L:  Well, they live in Sacramento, California.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  And we used to live in San Jose, California, and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we were pretty close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we just moved here, so --
R:  Mhm.  Do you like living there?
L:  [NOISE] I'm not sure yet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We just moved here in January, so --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  My friend has a sister who lives in Las Vegas.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does she like it?
R:  Mm, I think so but I've never been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there personally.
L:  You've never been to Las Vegas?
R:  No.
L:  Well, I've -- I've never been to New York either. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  My -- my Dad's family lives in Pennsylvania, so we've -- we've been back east, but we haven't actually been to --
R:  To New York?
L:  -- New York City, so, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  But ye- -- a friend of mine lives near there.  I can't think of what city they live in.  Um, [LIPSMACK] uh, I wish I could remember.  My, uh, step cousin lives there.  They -- he -- her husband's going to school.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I cannot think -- it's kind of a strange name.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like "Habitat", or --
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  No?  It doesn't ring a bell, huh?  
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  Is it Long Island?
L:  No. [PAUSE]
R:  Mm.
L:  I cannot think. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Do you ever want to come to New York?
L:  [MN] Uh, I'm not opposed to it if we have a reason, I mean, a --
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, someone we knew lived there that we wanted to visit or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  It wouldn't be a spot I'd necessarily pick for a vacation, I'm more of a Hawaii type --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've lived near the beach my whole life, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Does Las Vegas have a beach?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, no, Las Vegas does not.
R:  Oh.
L:  No.
R:  So, how come you moved there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] My husband's job.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.
L:  He's in the computer business and --
R:  Mm mhm.
L:  -- he, uh -- 
R:  Oh, you're lucky to have always lived near the beach.
L:  Yeah, I really liked it.  I'm kinda sad to be kinda isolated out here but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's all right.  So, have you lived in New York your whole life?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not isolated.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I bet not. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's very busy here.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
R:  You know, lots of --
L:  Does your family --
R:  Mhm?
L:  Does your family live there?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's very noisy and very busy all the time.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Even at night.
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  Yeah, th- -- there's no rest here.
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's kind of that way too, in Las Vegas.
R:  Really?
L:  Because the Casinos -- really, their -- their main stuff is later in the evening.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they --
R:  Do you ever go?
L:  We go to Casinos for shows, like magic shows, like Penn and Teller?
R:  Oh, oh.  Mhm.
L:  Um, or like Siegfried and Roy.
R:  Mhm.
