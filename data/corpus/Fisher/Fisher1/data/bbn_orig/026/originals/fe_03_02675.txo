L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  So, um, let's see, I --
L:   [NOISE] 
R:  -- grew up in this, um --
L:  Sh, mom.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm sorry, that was my mother.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, well speaking -- well, my mother was a lapsed, um, or is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sort of this lapsed Catholic so I grew up going to, I guess, Midnight Mass and, um, you know, Easter sunrise service, but there really wasn't anything else.  Mostly my upbringing was more secular.  Like, in terms of holidays.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah.
R:  Hm, um, but I remember, I think holidays for us seemed to be more fun when I was older more -- I mean, when I was younger, as opposed to, sort of, when I was, like, in childhood.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think, like, neighborhood Fourth of July or October Fest. [PAUSE]
L:  I think so too.  Once I got older holidays were not that fun anymore.
R:  Um, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you were younger though, why were they fun?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, when I was younger my mom would i- invite other people to come over and visit with us and we'd have parties and we moved to in here all the things changed a lot.  [NOISE] We have hardly no company [MN] over on Easter or Christmas or ... [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I miss parties, like I miss -- I miss the days of, um -- [MN] actually, no, I guess it's more fun to kind of like throw your own parties.  But -- but, um, [MN] I never, um -- [MN] but isn't that neat though, like c- do you like cooking?  Like I used -- I -- I -- I can cook, I just, um, and I grew up in Virginia and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- went to school at UVA, so I -- I sort of learnt to cook, um, [MN] it's strange 'cause I learnt to cook soul food, although I'm not sure why because I'm not black and I'm not white. [LAUGH]  But, um, I'm Asian, which doesn't fit in, but, um, [MN] I don't know, do you -- do you like to cook before parties or holidays?  Like -- or do you have, like, holiday feasts that you have?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, I really can't cook.
R:  Oh.  Well, that's --
L:  I can only cook sandwiches, uh, like, deviled eggs, stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.  I love deviled eggs.  Um, I used to ask for them, um, on holidays too.  Um, and I would make them with, um, mustard and paprika, is that how you do them?
L:  Um, yeah, except I like pickle relish in mine.
R:  Yeah, I like pickle relish too.  Um, well, for Easter, did you dye eggs this year?
L:  No, we didn't.
R:  You -- oh, yeah, like, no.  Oh.  Did you ever dye eggs?  Or are you --
L:  Yeah, we have.
R:  Oh, you have?  Did you use PAAS, like that P.A.A.S., like that box, or did you do something else?
L:  Yes, we did do that one time. [MN]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Huh.  Um, what -- what do you think of, like, minor holidays?  Like, [MN] holidays that aren't Christmas or Easter or the Fourth of July or Halloween?  Like -- l- like Arbor Day or ...
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Uh, Arbor Day is -- is okay to me because they're trying to, oh, [NOISE] how do I say it?  They're trying to -- to honor people who work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it -- I appreciate that.
R:  What is Arbor Day about?  Honoring people who work?
L:  That and their --
R:  Oh, you're talking about Labor Day, or do you mean Arbor Day?  [PAUSE] Like, Labor Day is for people who work and Arbor Day is trees.
L:  Oh, you mean Arbor Day?
R:  But like, Labor Day, we can talk about Labor Day.  That's an important holiday.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why?  No.  Maybe I'm, um -- um, so Labor Day is important because it honors people who work instead of, say, being on Wall Street or -- honors people who are actually working.
L:  Really? [NOISE]
R:  Right?
L:  Right.
R:  That's what you mean? [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  Um [MN] ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I think that I also used to think of Labor Day, um, not because I wasn't deep at the time, although maybe I'm deeper now, but I used to think of it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as the end of summer vacation.  Like, well, school had kicked in and so, uh, I mean, school was about to kick in.  So, I was thinking of knee socks and I was thinking of -- I was thinking of, I don't know, like a new plaid skirt or something like that.  And I -- and thought of August going away.  [MN] And, um, [MN] I don't know.  But, so, Labor Day, I mean, so ho- that holiday for me was less about -- it should have been about what it means but instead it was that I could fun. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like the way Chri- -- like Christmas.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like Christmas wasn't so much about Jesus or Bethlehem for me.  It was more about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um ...  And now I get like a stuffed bunny in the basket of my bicycle when I'm six years old.  And it's like, it's -- it's sort of, like, it's going to be the -- the family bicycle.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.  That's neat.  [PAUSE] Ah, can we talk a little bit about Arbor Day?
R:  Yeah, let's talk about Arbor Day.  What would you like to talk about?
L:  Well, Arbor Day, I like it a lot because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're planting trees and they're helping our environment [NOISE] a lot when they plant trees and I respect that a lot.  I love Arbor Day.  I'd plant a tree at home e- except that our soil is so alkaline that I'm afraid it would die.
R:  So y- [MN] d- so you have -- you know about the land?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  I live in New York and nobody knows about the land but you know about the land.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That -- what kind of tree would you plant if you could?
L:  I would plant a Japanese Cyprus.
R:  Why?  Why would you plant a Japanese Cyprus?
L:  [NOISE] I like things that come from Japan, they're like, really cool to me.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, may I -- do you -- do you live on a ranch or a -- you live in the country?
L:  We live in the country on about five acres and right next to us is a ranch.  But we don't own it.  Somebody else owns it.
R:  My sister lived in North Carolina with -- in the country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Although now she lives in the south west, near ranches.  But I -- I've never even been to a ranch.  But -- so, a Jap- your -- Japanese Cyprus.  I don't know Japanese holidays, I wish I did.  But you're fas- [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm, Japanese Cyprus, cool.  Are there any holidays where you are that I might not know about?
L:  No, there isn't.  See, we're living in Tyrell, that's in Texas.
R:  You live in Texas?
L:  Yes.
R:  I was -- oh, I spent, like, the first five years of my life in Oklahoma.  My father was in the army and so I, um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] I wonder, hm -- in Texas.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [PAUSE] Fort Sough, Oklahoma, Texas.  I haven't spent a lot of time in Texas.  Let's see, okay, but I'm supposed to talk about holidays.  [MN] Um, a good friend from college married -- married, um, somebody named Patricia who wa- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was raised in Waco --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and she was trying to teach me.  Her mother was Mexican and her father was a professor at Baylor.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they were trying to teach me how to make chili but, um, and it was really tomatoey but you don't like to cook.  Let's see, Japanese Cyprus.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, Arbor Day, um. [MN]
L:  [PAUSE] Yes, I can't really cook very well and when I do cook it sometimes I [MN] -- the one time I did try to make something was oatmeal and I put too much salt in it so now I just cook it but [NOISE] cook it with hot water and I -- I let the people who want salt and stuff like that, I let them put it in.  [NOISE] But I do put -- I would put powdered sugar in it if I was able to make oatmeal.
