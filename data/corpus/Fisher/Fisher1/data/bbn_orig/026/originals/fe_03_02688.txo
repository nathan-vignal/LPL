R:  That's interesting.  Um, what is your favorite holiday?
L:  Uh, excuse me?
R:  What is your favorite holiday?
L:  My favorite holiday is, uh -- uh, I think it's New Year, like the first of January, thirty first of December.
R:  Uh-huh, New Year?
L:  Yep.
R:  New Year's Day?  New Year's Eve?
L:  New Year's -- New Year's Eve, yeah, because people usually get together and they, uh, celebrate and you know, they drink alcohol, stuff like that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Um, so are you -- uh, are you, um, what -- what religion do you worship in Russia?
L:  Actually like the general religion is like, um, Orthodox Christians, uh, but --
R:  Like Catholic Orthodox?  Catholic?
L:  No, like it's -- it's like -- it's Greek Orthodox, I think, but it's little bit different I think.  I think it's like Russian Orthodox actually.  Uh --
R:  So are you -- do you believe in God?
L:  Uh, yes but I'm a Methodist, so of course I do.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I switched. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, um, my favorite holiday is Christmas.
L:  [NOISE] Christmas.  Why?
R:  Chris -- because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the time of the year when people feel in their hearts that they -- if they can give --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and receive and feel happy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, it -- it gives me a warm feeling --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- inside --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- that it's a time when people come together and learn and love their families --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and be with their families and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's important to me -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause my family is so small.
L:  I see.  Well, like first of New Year is also like when you gather, like together with your family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But -- and then like, you know, you have good food, and like you -- like each year and stuff, so that you can say that that's like a family holiday. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  So, if you could create a holiday, what -- what holiday would you create?
L:  Uh, I don't [NOISE] know, like there are like -- just used to be a lot of holidays, like these days, I mean, there is like Students' -- Students' Day, and, uh, other [NOISE] day like Mum -- Mother's Day and there is like, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Military Day, uh, [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  I think I would make like -- I don't know, maybe -- maybe Charity Day or something like this, you know?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like where -- like you know, we would celebrate, uh, like humanity --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and like people who try to help -- like to people who are like less fortunate, stuff like this, I guess.
R:  Charity Day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about you?
R:  [MN] I don't know, I'm thinking on that.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If I could make a holiday, um, [LIPSMACK] I could create a holiday  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I [SIGH] -- I just am not sure what I would create.  You --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mentioned a couple of good ones that would be interesting.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Student Day would be fun.  I think students should have a day off just -- just be out of school for no particular reason. [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Nature Day -- we have a Nature Day?
L:  I'm not sure, I mean, I'm pretty s- -- like maybe not.  [NOISE] Uh --
R:  [MN] have President's Day, and Valentine's and Easter.  Memorial Day, Fourth of July, hm, Martin Luther King, um, Thanksgiving, Halloween, mm, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK].  If I could create one, I [SIGH] -- I just can't think of a good -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good one that I would -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- create.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, so but anyway, if you created it like would you make it like national holiday?  Or just like, um -- I mean, would it be like national holiday or like -- would you like people not to go to work and stuff like that?
R:  Sure, any time they can get out of going to work is a good thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think actually like in Russia like they have like more holidays tha- than in the States.
R:  They have more what? [NOISE]
L:  More holidays, I mean --
R:  More -- oh, do they?
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Wha- -- what do you have in Russia that we don't have here?
L:  Um, like Students' Day they have that, uh, so like if -- not like very -- it's -- it's like official.  They have like, um, Computer Programmers' Day, like I mean, everybody who works with computers, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they also have like, uh, I mean, some like religious holidays -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they are like official holidays too.  I mean, religious holidays that are part of like Orthodox Church because like, uh -- so stuff like that, I guess.  So, um, I don't know.  Are there like any like specific holidays in like -- in where you live?  I mean, just like local holidays?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like festivals, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff like this?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just can't think of any off hand, um, you know, I've -- I've mentioned the national holidays an -- and of course, you know, we have, uh, um, you know, holidays for the church, you know, uh, during Easter time like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, Ash Wednesday and, um, I'm Catholic --
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, you know, we have a p- probably similar holidays to what you have in the church.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] I -- my -- my mind is just blank --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- though.  I just cannot think of, um, of cre- -- what I would do to create a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- holiday, and would I make it a national holiday?  I think so.
L:  Okay, uh --
R:  I think I would like to have every --
L:  In my -- yeah -- in a si- -- in my home town they have like a -- because there's like fishing industries -- very important.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, they have like the Fishers' Day.  And like if --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, well, that's interesting. [COUGH]
L:  -- yeah, that's s- like celebrated like -- very like, you know -- I mean, more than anyb- -- anybody, anything else except for like New Year, so, and like thousands of peoples on the streets and, uh, there are like vendors everywhere, and people having fun.  There are like shows and you know, stuff like this, so it's, uh -- and I think in different cities like if they have like a coalmining industry, they might have like, you know, the miners' day or something like this when --
R:  In -- in Russia, is there mines?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I- -- in Russia, are there mines?
L:  Mines?
R:  Goldmines?
L:  Yeah, sure, coal -- coalmines, yeah, like, I mean, uh, actually like in Ukraine they have them too, so I'm from both countries, like Russia and Ukraine, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, like in Ukraine they have many coalmines, so --
R:  That movie that was out years and years ago called The +Russians -- Russians Are Coming --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I thought it was absolutely hysterical, I loved it.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, I've never seen it but like -- the -- the phrase is really popular.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It was a good movie, I really enjoyed it.  It -- oh, it's about, uh, some Russians that were on a submarine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was funny.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I like the song by Beatles, Russian Submarine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't know what cele- -- what -- what they celebrated.  I think they just celebrate like good spirit with this, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's a part of the world I would love to go to.
L:  Oh, you shou-
R:  I would -- I would love to go to Russia and -- and -- and see how, uh, the culture is there, and see the climate and the people, and course my life long dream is to travel and see the world but I'm not too sure if I'll ever get there.
L:  Oh well, if you're dream about it, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it will eventually happen.  That's how it works over there, I guess.
R:  So, how long have you been in America?
L:  Uh, I've been here for four years.
R:  Four years.
L:  Yeah, just going to school.
R:  Is it, uh --

L:  I mean, I like people a lot, I mean, I -- I like it here, you know?  It's -- it's really nice, uh, people are nice, and like you know, and there are opportunities over there, so just like you know, for the --
R:  So, what did -- why -- what possessed you to come to America to go to school?
