R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Rhonda.
L:  I'm sorry I didn't ca- --
R:  My name is Rhonda.
L:  Okay.  My name is David.
R:  Hi, David. [NOISE]
L:  I guess we talk about holidays right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, do you have a fav- favorite holiday?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm -- it's really kind of a toss up between Christmas and Easter for me.
L:  Yeah, I, um, I don't know.  Sometimes I think Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is too [PAUSE] commercialized, shall we say?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You know, people are so worried about getting gifts anymore they don't -- forget the actual sentiment involved behind it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but ... so, if you could --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if you could create one, what would you say?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, in other words, if you could get a holiday or make a holiday, what would you make up?  And how would you have people do it?
R:  That's what I'm trying to decide.  I mean, it seems like they have all, you know --
L:  Well, I don't know.  Sometimes, uh, I'm a veteran myself.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you know, I've never been to war or anything, but I'm a Vietnam air veteran myself, and sometimes I think we outta have a -- a holiday for the people that have been forgotten about the wars, you know?  Not the people that are, you know, that everybody recognizes, but the people that went over there, did their job but [MN] had no recognition.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, and just have them just be on something similar to the regular old Veterans' Day, except maybe call it Regular Soldiers' Day, or something, you know? [LAUGH] But that's what's the Veterans' Day, I guess, is supposed to be about but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't seem to be anymore, does it?
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  You know --
R:  -- I -- it -- it really depends on where -- on your area that you're from.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't think -- until nine eleven, I think, Veterans' Day was starting to become a lost holiday.
L:  Yeah, I think you're right.
R:  But --
L:  It was.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nowadays everybody flies flags. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's become the big thing. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, yeah, but how many people are doing it 'cause they want to or think it's necessary and how many people are doing it because they just wanna get on the bandwagon?
R:  Yeah.  But, see, I have a -- I have a two and a half year old --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and --
L:  I didn't want to take --
R:  -- we always had flags anyway because my dad is a Veteran of the Korean War.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Yeah, I know what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's like. 
R:  [LAUGH] He, uh, was very adamant that we always put out flags for every holiday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, Veterans' Day, Armistice Day, Ve- -- uh, Memorial Day, Flag Day.
L:  I know all --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all -- all them good days th- that veterans consider good days.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I -- I understand that, you know, um, I'd -- I -- I don't know, sometimes I think I'm guilty of not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- following through just as much as anybody else, you know what I'm saying?  But at least I'm not, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L: -- like some of these dudes lately, you know, uh, they're so worried about, you know, like, this -- this war thing that we just had, you know, they were so darn worried about protesting the war that they're forgetting m- -- about the rest of the stuff, you know?  The thing is, is these, you know, you've gotta support 'em and one way you can support them I -- I guess, is with these holiday things, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, uh, you know, like I say, you know, if you've got a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- got a holiday, you know, at least you -- you're being recognized --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  And --
L:  -- for y- -- for your contributions to your own country, for God's sakes, you know?
R:  And it just -- it seems so strange to me that they would protest and then they would get upset if people were against them because of their protesting.  Let's see, where they have the right to protest --
L:  That's -- isn't it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- isn't I don't -- I don't -- don't -- don't remember right, but isn't that what the Fourth of July is supposed to be about?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?  Their right and my right and your right to be able to stand up in front of a crowd of people and say what we want?
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, and if they have the right to protest, I have the right to be upset because they protest.
L:  You have a right to be a counter protest.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- you -- oh, you know, it gets me, these -- these dudes they're sitting there and they're saying, "Oh, jeeze, you know, this is wro-" well, maybe it is wrong, you know?  I'm not -- I didn't agree with Bush and the way he did things.
R:  Not totally, but ...
L:  Uh, but the thing is, is --
R:  You don't take it out --
L:  Y- -- one -- one thing is, is, he's the President, he's the one that has to make that decision.  I don't know enough about it to make that decision.
R:  I don't want to know enough about it.
L:  And I -- I -- you so -- you got that right.  Who want to have to make a decision that's gonna send hundreds, if not thousands, of guys out to get killed?
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  And then -- and then, like I say, you know, n- now they went over there and they've got all the problems associated with the war and we'll probably bring 'em back over here and they won't even be recognized as decent --
R:  Oh, I don't th- --
L:  -- individuals.
R:  You know, I --
L:  Except for us people that, you know, that care.  Uh, but most of the people would just ignore 'em.
R:  Here in this area, in the Kansas City area, and I'm not for sure if it's because we have, uh [PAUSE] --
L:  I think --
R:  -- an airforce base here, you know, close by.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We have lightning where the, uh, stealth bombers take off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, jeeze, you guys would be a nice terrorist target. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  They hate them things. [LAUGH] Uh --
R:  But --  
L:  -- nah, I understand.  You guys -- you guys are probably more -- have -- have more recognition in that area.  See, I'm from down here in North Central Arkansas, where the only --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thing we have basically, uh -- see we used to have a base at Blytheville[?], but it's gone now.  He was strategic air command base.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The only base we've got in Arkansas now is a fighter base down there in, uh, Little Rock and it's basically just for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- er, uh, reserves now.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so, we -- you know, the only thing we have is the veterans of foreign wars and the recognitions that they get, you know, for the various, um, [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know the vari- -- the various things that the veterans get, you know --
R:  And you know, I -- I will agree with you.
L:  -- because nobody's willing to -- you know, nobody's willing to come forward and say, "Hey, let's recognize these dudes that just got called up last month at our local national guard, and got called in to go to war", you know?  Maybe they're over there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the Middle East and yet those guys will come back and they -- some of them won't even get their jobs back.
R:  You know, I [inaudible] --
L:  And some of them, you know, there are the people down the road who have to say, "Oh, you shouldn't have gone 'cause you ... " you -- you know, why?  You know?  It's not fair.
R:  Well, my brother was -- was in the army for four years.  And most of that time, three years of that time, he was sitting on a wall twenty four hours on, twenty four hours off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just staring over at people that were very hostile towards him.
L:  Must have been Korea.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I've been in the military, I was in the airforce.
R:  But yet, he comes home and less than a year later, um, Kuwait was attacked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, so, my father is a member of the VSW --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, my brother's wife actually, can be a member of the VSW because she was in the Navy when --
L:  I understand --
R:  -- that started.
L:  -- she was in the Navy in the war -- Second World War probably.  Or in the Korean one.
R:  Ah, no, my brother's wife.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well that leaves Vietnam, then, probably. [LAUGH]
R:  She was --
L:  Oh -- or, you know, whatever, anyway -- I understand what you're saying.  She's a mem- -- she can be a member.
R:  Right.  My brother can't.
L:  That stinks.
R:  Because, we were --
L:  He's not --
R:  -- supposedly at a time of peace. [LAUGH] 
L:  I, suppo- -- yeah, supposedly that's not recognized as a war but yet, look how much destruction there was and how much killing there was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how much other stuff, you know, much like this go -- thing going on.  It's not really a declared war but yet that's the only kind of wars we're gonna get any more is, you know, why shouldn't these guys that go fight be recognized?  You know --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- if -- if nothing else, let's give 'em their own holiday, for God's sakes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Uh -- uh, Veterans Who Have Been Forgotten Day.  You know?
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  There's a lot of 'em.  You know, your brother.  You know me, I was a Vietnam era veteran, whoopee, alls that does in Texas is get me an extra piece of land.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know? [LAUGH] That's the only thing it does.  You know?  They don't even -- [MN] you know, until the last few years they really haven't even recognized these guys and --
R:  Yeah, if you go to Golden Coral where they get you a free dinner on, uh, Veterans' Day, too.
L:  Yeah, if you -- if you let 'em know in advance you're there and kiss their you know what.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  That's about the only way you're gonna get the free meal, otherwise they want to charge you double for it.  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's just not fair, you know?  Those guys, the veterans and, you know, they -- they just haven't been treated right.  You know, especially for the -- literally some of them put it all on the line and died for the country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and what do their family get out of it?  Well, yeah, they get an American flag.  Whoopee.  That's not a whole lot of consideration for a mother that raised her kid to eighteen years and maybe he got married and had his own little child and now his child's not gonna see him the rest of its life, you know?  That's not, you know, five thousand [MN] bucks in cash and a flag just doesn't seem to be right --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know, they need to recognize at least his contributions to the country.
R:  One of my friends, her son was killed in the Pentagon the day of the attack.
L:  Oh, that stinks.
R:  And he's the only one that they cannot find e- any DNA evidence on.
L:  Mm.
R:  He was basically --
L:  He was vaporized.
R:  -- [MN] probably inside the window where the plane hit.
