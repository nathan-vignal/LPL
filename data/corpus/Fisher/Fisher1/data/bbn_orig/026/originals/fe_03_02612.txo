L:  Hello.
R:  Um, hi, my name's Nancy. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Martha.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where you from?
R:  I'm from New York City.
L:  Oh, I'm from Youngstown, Ohio.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess you signed up to participate in this, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Now, we're supposed to talk about Iraq, right?  What do we think the ...
R:  Yeah, we are.
L:  [NOISE] Okay. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Um, okay, I do think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's kinda cool that we helped to end suffering for some people, but I think there's a lot of priorities here in this country that need to be worked on, and there's people here that need help, too.
L:  I think so, too.  I agree with you.
R:  Um, I don't know about where you live, but I live in an area that's pretty high in poverty and there's a lot of unemployment here. [LAUGH] And one of the members of my very own family has been unemployed for almost two years, and it's not for lack of trying.  So, I think we need to get more programs here, help train people.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Get things going on.  Tell me what it's like where you are. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, it's not much different.  There's a lot of unemployment here.  You can't get a decent job.  It's all, you know, McDonald's or something, you know. [LAUGH] Most everything is part time, even for older people, and no benefits.
R:  Definitely true.  I had a job for fourteen years, which I'm no longer with, no medical, no overtime. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Which is not exactly helpful.
L:  No.
R:  And actually I'm going on a job assignment and I'm leaving for another state for two months to do that assignment.
L:  Are you?  Where you going?
R:  California.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, it's a nice assignment, but I can't find the line I'm in where I am most of the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I work in wild -- with wildlife [LAUGH] and it's --
L:  You what?
R:  With wildlife, and I live in New York City. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What do you do?
L:  Uh, I'm retired.  I worked for General Electric for thirty six years.
R:  Did you see lots of changes in the work environment where you were?
L:  Oh, there's been so many changes since I left.
R:  See, I -- I know we're supposed to be talking about what we can do in other places, but I really think they have to focus on here first. [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Hm.  Okay, I guess we're supposed to come up with more to talk about 'cause we gotta keep this going for ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes, yeah.  So ...
R:  Well, I also think some of the people there are waiting for us to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pick up the pieces and I don't think they quite understand that they're not under dictatorship any more.  We're not gonna tell them what to do.  They have to work to fix their own future now and kinda tell us what they want and maybe we can give them an idea.
L:  Right.
R:  Or steer 'em in the right direction, but we can't do it for them.  Then we're just gonna be like dictators over them, maybe not abusing them, but still not giving them the freedom, which is supposed to be what we helped end.
L:  Yeah.  Those -- those people, yeah, they -- they -- they weren't allowed to do anything for themselves, you know.  They were even afraid to go outside a lot.
R:  Well, they've gotta take a chance and learn and experience it.
L:  I don't really think they know how to take care of themselves now.
R:  Some --
L:  Or else they're afraid. [NOISE]
R:  I'm sure they are, but our country had roots where we had people that didn't know what to do, and they had to be willing to stick their necks out to build the type of world we have now. [LAUGH] And some of those areas are developed, 'cause they showed the inside of some of the stores and things, and they look comparative to what we have.  I mean, I know a lot of it's not like that, but ...
L:  The buildings are beautiful.  That's a beautiful city, Baghdad.
R:  And I know --
L:  Beautiful.
R:  They have a rich culture, so they definitely have things to base things on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, like, their own people getting up and looting their museums and things and destroying them in retaliation was not cool --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause all they're doing is hurting their own history.
L:  You're right.
R:  And taking it from their own children and future generations who maybe won't get a chance to see it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But we can real- -- we can't be responsible to protect that 'cause, [LAUGH] you know, that would -- that would just end by people reacting badly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sort of like riots used to happen here more -- more before I was born, but like in the sixties and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when attitudes were changing and stuff.  I can't remember that 'cause I wasn't born yet, but I've seen footage and stuff on it, and there was a lot of civil unrest here, too, at points when things changed.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE] How close were you to those towers that day?
R:  Pardon?
L:  [NOISE] How close were you to the towers in New York City?  Are you in New York City or ...?
R:  I'm actually in Queens, which is, um, one of the boroughs.
L:  Okay, uh-huh.
R:  But it's on the end closer to Manhattan, and I was on my way to work, which is going in the opposite direction.  So, I didn't really realize it until people started --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming back that were on their way to work in Manhattan and saying that the trains and stuff were being stopped, 'cause at that point I had changed to a bus and the buses in Queens weren't affected.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then I got to work and found out. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  But I couldn't really see anything from where I was, but later, coming back home, we could see the smoke and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And fortunately I didn't know anybody that -- personally that got hurt --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I know people that know people that got killed.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  It's kind of like a gruesome tourist site right now.
L:  Really? [PAUSE] I don't know, the people in Iraq, some of them want us to leave now, you know.  Really our job isn't done.
R:  Yeah, we can't do all of it, though.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, they have to be willing to pitch in.  I can see, like, having people say, "Hey, this is a plan.  What do you people think?"  "Okay.  You know, we have three of our guys to help show you this.  Get a hundred of your people".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Let's work together". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "We'll show you how to, you know, build a proper system for this or how to clean this up" or something like that, but they can't just sit back and watch us fix it.
L:  Mm.
R:  We can't be the fixers of everything.
L:  No, we can't. [NOISE] Look what it's costing us. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know how our country's ever gonna recover financially from this.  People have to pay, uh, [LAUGH] taxes.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what they'll do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They'll raise the taxes, but since unemployment's high it's not much of a help.  I don't -- I don't know about where you are, but since we also have all the disaster relief from [MN] the buildings here, our city's really messed up budget wise, so they're trying to balance the budget by closing other things and by -- and they just laid off a slew of city employees.
L:  Hm.
R:  Which doesn't help because then all those families are gonna have to go on assistance and they're gonna have to probably go on medical care, which is just more money coming out of the government just from a different pocket.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  [SIGH] How many phone calls is this for you?
R:  This is the first one.
L:  Oh, this is my third one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't get one for a couple of days, so I called them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I just registered for it yesterday.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I was kinda surprised --
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I told my friends, "If it comes through, if it's real, I'll give you the information I got".
L:  Yeah, you'll probably get one about the same time tomorrow.
R:  Cool.  It --
L:  Yeah, mine came, like, the first one right after eight o'clock, just a couple of minutes after eight, and, um, I had telezapper.  You know what that is?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this is a robot generated call, and it zapped it as soon as I, uh, picked it up, so I called them back and she says, "Oh, don't worry about it".  So, I unplugged my telezapper and the next night I got a call at the very same time, three or four minutes after eight.  Then I didn't get any the next night, so I called in for my second one, and then I called in tonight for this one.  This is my third one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if you don't get one for a couple of days, call. [NOISE]
R:  I don't think I have a phone number.  I answered an ad on the web for it.
L:  Oh, I'll give it to you.  One, eight, six, six ...
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  One, eight, six, six, six, eight, seven, four, seven, five, eight.
R:  Five, eight, okay.  I'll --
L:  And do you have a PIN?
R:  Yeah, I wrote it down already.
L:  Then you have to, uh, give them your PIN number and press pound when they ask for it, and that's it.
R:  Okay, thank you. [NOISE] I photoco-
