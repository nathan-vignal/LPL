L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  What's your name?
L:  My name's Donna.
R:  Donna?
L:  Yeah.
R:  My name's Danny.
L:  Hi.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from upstate New York.  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm from downstate New York.  I'm from Long Island.
L:  Oh, Long Island, oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm up near Syracuse.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I got a -- a link from my friend about this, uh --
L:  Yeah, me too.  I just signed up for it --
R:  And I was like, "Ah, whatever".
L:  Uh, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I need thirty dollars, so, hey, I'll do it.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  I hear ya. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just signed up about an hour ago, actually --
R:  Yeah, me too --
L:  -- whoa, what's this?
R:  -- about an hour ago.
L:  Yeah, really?  Wow.
R:  Wow, that's pretty fast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess they need people for this, yeah.  So, we're -- what are we supposed to -- we're supposed to talk about a specific thing, right?  I couldn't really hear what they said.
L:  Um, I think it was what the US should do about Iraq.
R:  Right, right, right, right, right.  Okay.
L:  Huh. [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  Uh --
R:  Well, um, I haven't been watching the news too much lately.
L:  Me too, but --
R:  I kn- -- I know that, uh, they, um -- Bush made some kind of speech yesterday or something.
L:  Yeah, he was on a aircraft carrier apparently.  He, uh -- my, um, nephew's in the Navy.  He's, um, actually going to mil- -- um, the military, uh, academy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it was kinda interesting 'cause [SIGH] I can't believe they just land those things on a ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- on a deck like they seem to.  I don't know. [LAUGH] He didn't -- I didn't see it, but they strapped Bush into one of those fighter planes and ...
R:  Right.  So, um, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I -- I mean, I -- I take it we're not really bombing over there any more?
L:  I guess we're all done, from what I understand, but I think what they wanted us to do is sh- should we [SIGH] -- I don't know.  Are we supposed to subsidize them or what are we supposed to do with Iraq now?  Are we obligated to do anything, I guess?
R:  I mean, I guess we sorta are 'cause we -- we wrecked it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we did. [LAUGH]
R:  And now, you know, our tax dollars are gonna go into rebuilding the -- the nation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- that's not cool either, but --
L:  I -- I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It isn't really.  Of course, I didn't really -- well, they had to do something about Saddam but --
R:  Yeah, I mean, he's -- he's a cruel, like, uh, dictator and all, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, uh, was it our responsibility? [LIPSMACK]
L:  [SIGH] Hm, I don't know.
R:  No, I don't really think it was our responsibility.
L:  I don't think so, but I think --
R:  The UN didn't -- didn't approve it and for a good reason.
L:  No, I think that we need to take care of people here before we take care of people overseas.
R:  Oh, definitely.  But, you know, we don't have a pipeline that's untapped here. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I'm not really against helping 'em, you know, if they need help.
R:  Yeah.  It's, like, yeah, there -- there's other nations out there that are -- that are, you know, suffering and -- and -- and there's other nations with more of a nuclear weapon threat like, you know, North Korea and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, that's not our priority because, you know, they don't have oil reserves. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that's what it all boils down to, you know.  They've got assets. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And no matter how many times they say, "Oh, it's not about oil" it is too about oil.
L:  Well, yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is, I think.  You know how high -- I don't know how high gas is down there, but it got up to --
R:  Well, it got up --
L:  -- a dollar eighty here.
R:  Yeah, it's about a dollar seventy something here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Dollar eighty.  Well, yeah, for regular unleaded it's, like, a dollar, yeah, seventy or so.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, like, about a month ago it was really high and now it's down to a dollar sixty something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now that -- that junk's all over with, but -- junk, you know, but ...
R:  But, yeah, I mean, [MN] it's, uh -- the gas thing, that sucks, but I heard it pretty much had -- that had nothing to do with, like, uh, [SIGH] -- it -- it -- it has nothing to do with the -- the war that was going on.  There was something else, with, uh, trade relations and stuff, another country?  I forgot, someone was telling me.
L:  No.
R:  But -- but then you think it's kinda like propaganda and stuff because then they'll get people pissed, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, man, we gotta get more -- more oil and more, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- petroleum and gas because, you know, 'cause of this war or whatever.  You know, it gets people like -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's a whole big game, if you ask me.
R:  Yeah, it's a whole big game.
L:  It's just control -- an under control thing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's all about money and whatever it's --
L:  Yeah, I guess everything is, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, it really sucks --
L:  I know it.
R:  -- but, you know, what are you gonna do?
L:  I don't know.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I mean, [MN] [NOISE] did we actually find Saddam or no?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  Well, we could've and they -- they might not have said anything. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- yeah, really.
R:  Who knows?
L:  I mean, who knows is right.  I don't think they officially did, but they probably did.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, this ...
L:  I don't know.
R:  This -- I don't know, this situation's not --
L:  He's got a lot of look-alikes, too, I guess, seems like.
R:  Yeah, and he could've went into plastic surgery real quick anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He could be walking in New York City right now.
L:  Who knows?
R:  Who knows?  But I mean, uh, [MN] I don't know.  [MN] The -- the way, like, the, uh, budget is for, like, uh, education and stuff like that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how they're making these tax cuts for the rich, like -- like, I don't know, whenever we fight a war in this country, like, you know, it's on the backs of -- of the poor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's because we're taxed more overall and, um, you know, somehow always the, uh, rich end up getting a -- a bigger tax break.
L:  Yeah, always.
R:  They could fix all our problems by not giving a tax break --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to -- to the rich and, you know, if they just had an equal way of taxing people in this country --
L:  Yeah.  But there never --
R:  -- which -- then a lot of our problems would be solved financially.  But that's all it would take, but they would never do that because they're the ones in control.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  So, why would they take money away from them?
L:  So, it wouldn't -- yeah.  They don't wanna do that.  They wanna, you know --
R:  They wanna, like, cut -- cut --
L:  -- give themselves the upper hand there.
R:  They wanna cut, like, after school programs and in school programs and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] about our school this, our school's that, but they're not, you know --
L:  I know, but there's --
R:  They're saying whatever to get elected and then -- then say no.
L:  Yeah, and then they do what they want basically.
R:  Yeah, and then they get -- they get campaign funding from these big corporations --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they say whatever, and even -- they say whatever just to get [LAUGH] -- just to get elected and when it comes down to it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're -- they're obliged to the, uh, corporations who funded them money, so they have to kinda do what they say or they're not getting any more money.
L:  Yeah, really, yeah.
R:  That's -- that's -- that's kinda like ... that's kinda how it goes, so it's like [inaudible].
L:  I agree.  You know, it's not right, but it's never been right and I don't think it ever will really.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It just won't.  But I -- I don't know about what we're supposed to do over there.  What's our obligation now that we blew 'em up?
R:  I don't know.  I think that, uh --
L:  I mean, yeah, f- feed 'em, that's okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, what -- you know, what happened throughout history is --
L:  Rebuild whatever they did.
R:  What happened throughout history was, uh, you know, like, this has happened before --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and we've just come in, you know, took over -- well, not taken over, set up a democracy, quote unquote --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, which is us basically putting someone in power and not creating a democracy.  'Cause, yeah, we'll create a democracy but we're gonna fund the candidate we want.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Such and such and millions and billions of dollars and no one else in that poor country will have the money to even compete or get their name out.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Therefore whoever we want to run the country --
L:  Mhm, will.
R:  -- will, and then we'll get a cut --
L:  Probably, or ...
R:  -- of, uh -- of the, you know, the oil proceeds.
L:  Some of the oil, yeah.
R:  And, you know, and everything will be, uh --
L:  The way it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically.  I mean, maybe not to such an extreme, hopefully, but --
R:  No, no, I mean, I don't think that things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- will be the way it was in that country.  People won't be suffering [inaudible] and that'll be the justification of everything.
L:  Right.
R:  But we're gonna benefit financially.  We're gonna get a piece of the pie, of course.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  And we're gonna -- we're gonna oversee everything and they're gonna be -- it's gonna be another US government puppet abroad, that's all it is.
L:  Yeah, that's why -- that's right.
R:  And -- and I think, um, just the way we are as a country, just I mean people in general are always hungry for more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like in our quality of life and what we need here in the States is -- is, like -- or what we think we need is ridiculous.  You know, the SUV [inaudible], everyone needs a SUV now.  Every company's making SUV and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's all V eight gas guzzling --
L:  Yeah, they are.
R:  -- like, whatever, and it's just like, you know, we need more and more as we consume more and more, so we're gonna need more and more oil and more and more gas.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And what's gonna happen when -- when all that crap is gone?
L:  That's right.  Then what?
R:  Well, then I think we're probably just gonna move to electric cars, like --
L:  Then -- oh, yeah, sure.  Sure we will.  But --
R:  That -- we have the technology and everything to have all the cars being electronic right now.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, think about it.  What --
L:  Oh, yeah.  But it doesn't benefit the oil companies.
R:  But doesn't -- right.  Doesn't benefit the big business, so ...
L:  Yeah, so they are gonna --
R:  Until we run everything dry, until it's not economical any more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's when we're gonna see the --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- changeover to electric, you know.  We got -- they got those hybrid cars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That Honda, I think it is.  I forgot what it is.
L:  Um, yeah, I think so, that they're part gas and part electric.
R:  Yeah.  But those cars are so --
L:  But they --
R:  They make 'em -- I don't know why they make 'em so ugly.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Why can't they make it look a little nicer? [LAUGH]
L:  They don't have to be ugly to run. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, right.  It's crazy.
L:  I know, they really are ugly, but --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I -- I don't know, I've never seen one in person, but [SIGH] I don't know how -- how good they work, actually.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  I don't either.
R:  This whole ... [NOISE] this whole thing is just crazy.
L:  Yeah.  Now, how long are we supposed to talk?
R:  Uh, ten minutes they said.
L:  Ten minutes?  Oh, is it -- did you hear a beep or something, an interruption or what?
R:  They'll probably just cut it off.
L:  Maybe.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I haven't done this.
R:  Well, it's been like, what, maybe like six minutes?
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  I didn't pay attention.  Wait, my phone tells me.  Let's see.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Eleven minutes and thirteen seconds.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's probably been --
L:  Probably from when the phone rang.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I had to listen to the ...
R:  And then you had -- yeah, and then you had to wait for me to pr- probably pick up or whatever.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Although I didn't have to wait at all.
R:  Oh.
