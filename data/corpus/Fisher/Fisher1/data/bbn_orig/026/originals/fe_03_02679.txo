L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Hazel.
L:  Hi, this is Jenny.
R:  Okay, favorite holiday. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Uh ... Hey, can Spring Break be considered a holiday?
R:  [NOISE] Sure. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think that would be mine. [MN]
R:  Okay.  I don't, uh, [LIPSMACK] probably Thanksgiving, I think, is my favorite --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's a really nice one.
R:  Yeah.  I [LAUGH] why is it my favorite?  I don't know, I guess probably 'cause family gets together.  That's probably why I like it best.  Why do you like Spring Break best?
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like Spring Break because, you know, you get to look forward to meeting new people, because wherever you go everyone's in that festive mood of just getting loud and crazy.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [LAUGH] and it's probably not a holiday.  I mean, if that's not considered a holiday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd go for Thanksgiving because, like, I mean, with Christmas you just have such high expectations.  Like, you're always disappointed in the end. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And with Thanksgiving, it's just -- it always amazes me with how many people come together and even if my family decides, like, my family rarely ever celebrates --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Thanksgiving.  Like, the only turkey they get there's, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one that somebody else gives us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for free.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, "Hey, you guys don't have a turkey".  Then it's, like, when it comes to my friends, they always invite me to their family things and I just feel the love.
R:  [MN] Yeah, we usually try to get the kids together and we always cook a huge meal. [MN] And then if it's just, um, my fiance and I, then we -- we still do a turkey.  Big turkey, the whole nine yards.  So, if we can't make it.  And I did get to travel back to see my family for Thanksgiving this year, so that was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- fun, so ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's really always a special time, so ... So, if you --
L:  [MN] Hu- --
R:  -- could create a holiday ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that question.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh.  You know what, are there any holidays that celebrate, you know, birth or children? [PAUSE]
R:  Uh --
L:  'Cause it [MN] --
R:  Not really.  Just [MN] individual birthdays I think, probably.  So ...
L:  Hm.  Maybe we need a holiday for the gift of life, or something? [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be a good one.
L:  That's the only one I can think of.  Or maybe, like, you know, another group --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's ignored, like pets.  A pet holiday. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Okay, I think if I created one it would be maybe a No Holiday holiday, or a --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- a no reason -- a no reason, everyone gets the day off work.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, you can't have that though, can you?  Certain --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Certain fields just -- it's twenty four seven forever. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... Like nursing and, um, uh, you know, medical in general, police.  Th- they -- someone's always gotta work.
L:  Yeah, that's definitely -- oh, well.
R:  Well, they can it, like, on the next available day. [LAUGH]
L: [LAUGH]
R:  And be paid for it.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  That's how I would celebrate it, and just, not have to do anything I think.  Just be a plain old day where you have the day off.  No obligations, no, [MN] you know, no need to cook huge meals [NOISE] or go anywhere [NOISE] or whatever.
L:  What do you think is an ideal length for a holiday?  I mean, would it be crazy to have a two week holiday [LAUGH] that we made? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, that would be wonderful.
L:  It would.
R:  I'd -- a [MN] -- are you from the United States or, um --
L:  Mhm.  I'm in California.
R:  Okay, 'cause, um, yeah, I'm in Washington and --
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I totally assumed that everybody -- 'cause I -- [MN] this is my third time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, like, the first two times they were from the East Coast so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- by now I don't even ask.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just assumed that they were recruiting people only over there.
R:  Yeah, I'd -- I -- we live so close to Canada that, um, Canada has a lot of holidays. [LAUGH] I don't know if you've ever noticed that, but they really do.  They go in for three day weekends all the time.
L:  No.
R:  So, they really got the holiday thing down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They have it down pat?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I went, um, to Europe, and I was just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I was -- I think that the whole work pace over there is completely different because I saw shops closing in the middle of the day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was, like, two PM.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and it -- and it -- it was, like, Italy and France.  The -- the shops are just closed in the middle of the day and I just thought, "That is so cool".  And I guess they open up maybe, like, it's from twelve to three or from twelve to four, they just close it for -- and, um, I just thought maybe we didn't -- we wouldn't need as many holidays if -- if we had a schedule like that?
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I don't know.
R:  That's true.
L:  We just focus --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- on sales and work becomes this really unhappy thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, [MN] in my experience I th- -- I think as you get out there and work, y- you buy more stuff and even if you get a raise, then you buy [NOISE] more stuff.  And you're --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- constantly going in circles. [LAUGH] And --
L:  Definitely.
R:  And I always just want more. [MN] And it doesn't seem to end.  And nowadays people don't even get to retire, not like they used to.  I -- I mean, they can't count on being able to retire, like, at fifty five, at, you know, or sixty five, even.  Some of them still have to work.  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  God.
R:  That's not fun to look forward to, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  No, it isn't. [LAUGH] I don't know. Oh, well.  So, what i- -- what was the last holiday that just passed?
R:  Um, [NOISE] Easter.
L:  Oh.  Did you -- did you, um, do anything?  Like, hide eggs? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I -- we don't have any young [NOISE] children and um, the grandkids are too far away.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, so we didn't really do -- I didn't even really cook a special dinner that day.  Now, in my family, had I been there, [MN] we always did big things for Easter.  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Always the Easter egg hunt and baskets and big meals and that whole deal.  So ...
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  Did you do anything special for it or ... ?
L:  Uh, no [LAUGH] I didn't.
R:  [LAUGH] No?
L:  I swear I don't celebrate any holidays.  So, whenever I just happen to be with a family that celebrates a holiday, I'm just completely excited.  I mean, everyone's just bored out of their minds, like, you know, just, "Oh God, I have to see this relative again" and I'm -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- like, "Wow!  What a tradition.  Look at this" [LAUGH] mm.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it's -- it's -- I [MN] -- I think -- I -- I'm not gonna say it's an eastern, western thing, but I grew up in the state of Michigan and all holidays, you -- you just, really, it was big family gatherings, big food feasts, you know, and all that stuff.  And [MN] since I -- I moved out here, [MN] I don't notice it quite so much.  I don't know, it's probably not east, west thing, it's maybe just the people I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  But it's different.
L:  Mothers' Day is coming up, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] Definitely gotta do a card thing and flowers or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Mothers' Day gifts.
L:  I noticed that all these ads are popping up, 'cause I was looking for a part time job, and there's so many ads from flo- flower companies that just need ten times more people than they normally need to take orders for flowers.
R:  Yup, it's a pretty big day.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My mom's going to Las Vegas to celebrate Mothers' Day. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh, yay mom!  Yeah, that sounds like fun.
L:  I told her, "I want to come, I want to come!" 'cause I got her a Mother's Day gift --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- already.  And she's, like, "No!  This day is all about me  --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and pampering me.  I don't need a daughter to take care while I was in Vegas" I was, like, "You've got to be kidding me!" my mom is crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] That's terrific. [PAUSE]
L:  Hm.  Loo loo loo. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, wow.  This is -- seems like a long ten minutes.  It was easier talking about, um, I don't know, did you get to do the one on reality TV?
L:  No!  Oh my God!  We should totally talk about that!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's so unfair!  That I didn't get that topic.  How sad.
R:  Oh, I got --
L:  Oh ...
R:  -- [inaudible] that one.  That was kind of fun.
L:  I have so much to say on that, I think I would just, like [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God.  I would just talk overboard. [MN] There has to be something about holidays.  I mean, I just can't think of anything because I don't even celebrate holidays.  It's just something that, you know, amuses me whenever I get the opportunity.  Hm.
R:  [MN] I -- I wonder a- as far as holidays and traditions, do you think people, [MN] um, are kinda losin- losing the, [MN] uh, you know, like, building the traditions or sticking with traditions or -- nowadays?  Or do you think people still kinda stick with those kinda [MN], I don't know [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] It -- it's different for me.  I -- I mean, I'm divorced --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm with my fiance out here, so far away from my family, that, um, I'm -- I'm just seeing a -- a different way people do things.
