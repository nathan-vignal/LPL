L:  Hi, my name is Jessica.
R:  Um, my name's Ashleigh.
L:  Hi, Ashleigh.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in Arizona.
L:  I --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Michigan.
R:  Yeah? [LAUGH] Is -- what's -- what's the weather like right now?
L:  Um, it's about fifty degrees.
R:  Oh, that -- that's nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's very comfortable.  And Arizona is warm, I assume?
R:  Yeah, it's eighty something right now.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what was our topic for today?  [inaudible]
R:  Um, what should America do about Iraq, I believe.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess my -- uh, my personal opinion is I'm -- I'm for the war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess we went in for reasons of, you know, liberating their people.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I guess, um, as far as disarming them, I guess we should make sure that they don't have any nuclear weapons but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they -- they have to be left with weapons to defend themselves against somebody else.
R:  Right.
L:  So, how do you feel?
R:  Well, I -- I agree.  I mean, I -- I -- I mean, I don't like war but I feel like it -- it's ne- -- it was necessary in this situation and, I mean, they're not -- there's no reasoning with, um, Iraq to, you know, get around it so that's, you -- pretty much what we had to do. [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, what -- let's see, what was, um ... part of [LAUGH] -- other part of our, um, question there?  I forget.
L:  I guess is the disarming.
R:  Oh, the disarming, yeah.  Um, well, yeah, I would, um, say that we should make sure that they -- they don't have the, you know, nuclear weapons or the -- the power to, you know, get us. [LAUGH]
L:  Get us.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm really -- I'm really disappointed with some of the -- the news coverage lately of -- of a lot of the people showing that they want us out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and then they -- you know, two weeks ago they were all happy that we were there and -- and, you know, I was happy.
R:  Right.
L:  And I thought, gosh, you know, they really -- they really wanted to be liberated and they really wanted to be free and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they were very, very afraid of Saddam and his regime and, you know, here we are, and I felt like [LAUGH], you know, way to go US.  And now I'm just kinda like, now they don't want us there and it's like, [SIGH] I don't know whether they're afraid that we're gonna take over or whether they're still really scared of the regime that's left.
R:  Yeah, uh, I -- I don't know either.  Um, maybe they're just, um, against our -- our way of life or our -- our ideas, I don't know.
L:  I think it goes back to a religion thing.
R:  Yeah, religion is a big -- big part of that country, I know that.  And maybe while they're over there they're trying to convert or I don't know what they're -- I mean, I wouldn't think they would be but it's probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably a lot to do with that.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] Well, I -- I'm kinda -- I'm glad that it's mostly over now.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm getting worried with -- with North Korea, though.  That makes me nervous.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I just, um, I'm glad it didn't come to the chemical warfare or the biological [SIGH] ...
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  Over here.
L:  They -- they had made some comments on the news that if we never find biological weapons, um, would you feel like it was a waste?  And I -- and I -- you know, I thought to myself, I thought, you know, at first I would think that I thought it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then I thought I still think that liberating their -- those people was the most important thing.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't think that that was portrayed so much in the very beginning of the war.  I think it was portrayed more that we're going in to just get Saddam.
R:  Right.
L:  Not so much free the people.
R:  Right, yeah, that's definitely what they've made --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the most, um, emphasis on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So a lot of, you know, a lot of people who were against it just don't really know the whole situation.
L:  Right.
R:  I think.  But I mean, they have other, you know -- even if there's no biological weapons, there's -- you know, they have other means of, um, attacking us.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And so ...
L:  I guess I never really thought there was much of a correlation between Iraq and Afghanistan until we really went over there.  I -- I don't know, I guess I was just kind of oblivious to the whole thing.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Never really thought much about the fact that Saddam would have anything to do with Osama bin Laden but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now -- now they're showing all these [NOISE] links and I was really surprised.
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's just [SIGH] -- it's pretty much all a big mess over there. [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, I just -- I'm just surprised that a lot of it just goes back because the United States --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is mostly Christianity based --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all these things are over religion still.  That just surprises me that that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- still is something that the world fights over.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's been going on since [NOISE], you know, the beginning.
L:  Day one.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [SIGH]
R:  Religion and politics, the whole, you know ...
L:  The evolution of the world. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [LAUGH] Hasn't -- doesn't seem like it's evolved all that much. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] Not in that sort of situation.
L:  Now, is this your first phone call or second or third from Fisher or what?
R:  It's the second.
L:  This is your second?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I actually called in tonight because I --
R:  Yeah, I did too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I hadn't -- I hadn't gotten a phone call from them in a long time.
R:  Right, that's --
L:  I thought, gosh, you know, I'm just gonna call in.
R:  That's how -- yeah, that's what I did, too, because of -- for the same reason, and the last phone call I got, we just talked, you know, for I think fifteen or more minutes and, you know, nobody ever broke in and said, "Okay, your time is up" and, you know, "Do this or that".  So I wasn't even sure if that -- that call, you know, was a --
L:  Went through.  Did you have --
R:  Right.
L:  Did you end up receiving a check?
R:  No, not yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you haven't?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  [COUGH] I did -- I did one call before and I actually waited for the computer to call me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, it was typical ten minute phone call, ten, twelve minutes, I can't remember.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then the computer did break in and said, you know, "Say your goodbyes" and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and it just asked you to summarize afterwards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, what your -- what your conversation was about.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess I should -- we should have looked at our clock.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you look at your clock?
R:  Um, no, not really but --
L:  I didn't either. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's been I don't know how long. [SIGH] Probably five minutes.
L:  Okay, so let's go back to it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um ... whereabouts in Arizona are you then? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't think of anything more to talk about on the war.
R:  Um, Mesa[?].  It's -- it's by Phoenix.  It's, um, [LIPSMACK] mm, like southwest Mesa.  I mean Arizona.
L:  Okay.
R:  And --
L:  Are you anywhere near Reno or anything like that?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  The other side.
R:  So, what, um, what part of Michigan are you from?
L:  Pretty much in the center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, and it -- we get the extreme cold and extreme hot summers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Michigan, we -- we consider Michigan has two seasons, um, winter and road construction. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because if it's not winter they're always redoing the roads because everything crumbles in the wintertime.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, here it's pretty much extreme summer and the rest is pretty much, um, warm.  Doesn't ever really get to be, um, really winter here, I don't -- I mean, this winter got a little bit colder than usual but for us that's, like, fifty or forty. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, that would be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  We're used to, like, zero [LAUGH] in the winter.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Or less than zero.  It gets cold.
R:  Yeah.  I get really sick of the sun- sunny weather, though.  I --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- I'd like to get a break from it. [LAUGH]
L:  I like -- I like the -- the -- we have four defined seasons here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you -- and you do get that.
R:  Yeah, that would be nice.
L:  Mhm.  We had some family that just moved to Arizona last week, actually.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Mhm.  Where did Boyd move to?  Oh, we don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Arizona somewhere. [LAUGH] It's not like it's --
R:  Do they like it, do you know?
L:  -- a small state. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [COUGH] yeah, as far as I know.  You know, they moved from Michigan for a job out there.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'd like to eventually move out of here 'cause I -- I've lived here my whole life.  I was born here and I just, you know, I'd like to get a little different, you know, atmosphere. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Getting just tired of the -- the constant sunny, hot weather.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And everybody from Michigan goes to Florida. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  To get into the sunny, hot weather.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  All the old folks from Michigan go to Florida. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they come back. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- Florida's probably a lot nicer than Arizona, though.  I mean for the weather.
L:  Probably.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably.  I do- -- [MN] I just drove down there with my sister.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] It's a long trip from Michigan. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  To drive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Takes twenty three hours.
R:  My dad lives in -- in New York, in New York City.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I took a bus trip out there and it was four day- [LAUGH] -- four day trip.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Cross country because I'm afraid of planes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I am too a little bit but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I think I would have flown for that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] taken a bus.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, I haven't really kept up on the news all that much during the war either, so I don't really have a whole lot of input on that subject so ...
L:  N- not so much me either.  In the beginning I was glued to the TV, like the first two weeks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I --
