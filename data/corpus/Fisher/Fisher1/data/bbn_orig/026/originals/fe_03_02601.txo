R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] Hi --
R:  Hi.  My name's Tracey.
L:  Hi.  This is my first time doing this.  My name's Nina.
R:  Okay, this is my second time.  I did this yesterday --
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  -- matter of fact, yeah.
L:  They called me earlier and I wasn't home, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah --
L:  So --
R:  I'm -- I'm in LA.  Are you in LA?
L:  No, I'm actually in Massachusetts.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, right outside of Boston.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Okay, uh --
L:  This is weird.  All right.
R:  The topic has to do with arms in Iraq or something like that?
L:  I think, like, in general, like, what to -- like, what to do about the state of Iraq or, like, what should the US do or whatever?
R:  Yeah.  I'm not sure what the US should do, but I think it's North Korea we should be worried about actually.
L:  I know what you mean.  I know.  I just -- I mean, the whole thing, I mean, I supported the troops in the first place, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I worry more about sort of what goes on domestically than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sort of around the world, which I know is sorta bad but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, I don't wanna get, like, too involved with anything.  I just -- I don't know, being the world's policeman just sort of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unsettles me a little bit.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've been really neutral --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about the whole thing.  I -- I think that [NOISE] whatever's going on here is way more important, you know, with -- with, uh, [COUGH] you know, the county closing a lot of health, uh, places, a lot of hospitals are closing down for poor people and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, it's funny how they could come up with a billion dollars, you know, to fund the war, but they don't have a billion dollars to, you know, get -- help homeless people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- find a better place to live.
L:  [MN] I totally know what you mean.  Actually, uh, well, this guy that I was dating for six months -- I actually just broke up last week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which I'm totally bung- bumming about, but he was actually, um, in the first Gulf War, and we were watching the TV one time and he was, like, asking me my opinion.  And I'm like, "Well, you know, I think we have, like, a lot of starving children here --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the fact that we try to do all this stuff overseas, I don't know".  And, like, this wasn't even the reason why he broke up with me, but he was like, "You know, if you're really liberal, you know, I don't know if this is really gonna work, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I'm really not ..."  And I'm like, "Look, I'm not a bleeding liberal.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, obviously I think people should take responsibility", I said, you know, "But I just think it's weird".  And he said, "Well", he said, "The way it works there is ...", um, I guess as he put it, "The minority was ruling the majority".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that children, like, were homeless, like, not because, uh, like -- like here, like, a lot of the young children are -- like, basically he was sort of blaming it, like, not really on the system but, like, on the parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where there it was -- it's more like the system just really wasn't good.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's why.  So, but I know what you mean.  I just -- I don't really wanna get too -- too involved with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Iraq at this point.  I don't really see the point.
R:  There's a lot of people who are -- who are unusually patriotic at the moment, you know.
L:  I know.
R:  And I never have been.  I'm -- I'm just not like that.  I don't care where I'm living.  I'm -- I'm not likely to go around carrying a flag.  I'm just not in- -- that involved.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I don't get that emotionally caught up.
L:  Like for -- for, like, either way, I'm tot- -- I know, I know, that's why, like, this is so weird.  I'm like, "I have to talk about my opinion?  Like, what if I don't really have one?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right.  And I was thinking, "This is a [inaudible] issue.  What am I gonna say?" you know.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know.
R:  Because, I mean, ev- even celebrities get on TV and all of a sudden, you know, they have something to say and all of a sudden you -- you don't hear about them any more because they're, you know, against the war, whatever.
L:  I know.
R:  And that's totally unfair.
L:  And so many of those celebrities, like, I mean, I -- I don't know, like, obviously what your educational background is, but, like, a lot of these people, like -- like, some of them, like, didn't, like, go to college or, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- really finish high school, so it's, like, okay, do they really have an educated opinion?
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, you know, I mean, not that I'm judging.  It's just I know what you mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know, so ...  I know --
R:  I was -- I was glad they got the POWs back.  That -- I lost interest after they came back, you know.
L:  Really?
R:  I was -- I was --
L:  I -- I was really glad about that.  I'm just glad it's, like, over basically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I don't know, I think, um, Bush gave a speech yesterday saying that it was -- like, he was basically calling an end to -- to everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, I'm glad about that.  I mean, I'd rather have it be quick and not so dirty, but the fact that anybody died is just rid- --
R:  It's awful.
L:  I don't know, it's just rid- -- it just -- it just, like, it nauseates me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess, you know, that's the way it is, I suppose, so ...
R:  The -- the most I was hoping for is that if, uh, if America really wanted to bring, you know, some sort of liberation to the, uh -- to Iraq, I'm just hoping that the women can finally walk around without being afraid that, uh, if they're not, you know, covered up that they're gonna get hurt or -- like --
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I was reading an article about an Iraqi woman who was, uh, a doctor or at least she's studying to be a doctor, and she was worried that if there's a new regime will they take that right away from her?
L:  Oh, my --
R:  Will she have to wear what they call a burkha --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something like that?  That's what I was conc- -- uh, concerned about as far as liberation, but I -- I don't feel the US is interested in that kind of liberation.  I think they're -- they wanna -- they want Iraq to get a dictator that won't stop the oil from coming over here.
L:  Right.  Well, I don't even think -- I don't really think they want a dictator.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.  Or, you know, someone -- some kind of --
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I totally know what you mean.  But, um, no, I mean, I guess -- as I said, I guess the minority was -- well, the majority was ruled by the minority.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, hopefully, like, if, you know, things turn around that that won't happen to that woman because the majority hopefully -- um, I think what -- what is -- what's the name of it?  Like, are they, like, um --
R:  The Shiite Muslims or something?
L:  Yes.  Thank you, yes, the Shiites.  Like, they're the majority and I don't know -- I don't think they, like, really practice, like, all that stuff, but, um --
R:  Real serious, yeah.
L:  I don't -- yeah, I know, I don't think they're as hard core, but, um, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm just -- I'm just sorta glad it's over.
R:  Because you know with the Taliban, when they got the Taliban out of Afghanistan, they changed things but from an article that I read not that long ago, not a whole lot has changed over there --
L:  Really?
R:  -- as far as that's concerned.  Yeah, it's -- it's not like the Taliban has come back, but the rules are still the same.  Women are still getting beat down in the streets.  There's still a lot of starvation.  Um, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You have to be, you know, really very pro Muslim to actually succeed or else, you know, it's just like being in Iraq and having Saddam there, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, who knows if they're ever going to find him?  One thing's for certain, he's probably not dead.
L:  I don't think he's -- uh, there's no way he's dead.
R:  No, uh, uh, just like Osama's not dead. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I think, like, it's funny when they show people that, like, they claim, like, are Saddam.  Like, actually they don't look like him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, they -- they -- they look like it could be, like, a decoy, but, like, I don't really think that means Saddam's dead.
R:  Right.
L:  So, but no, I mean, obviously, I mean, he's probably -- he's probably doing fine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I just -- I don't -- I don't know, I guess the whole thing just bothers me because it's, like, who's to keep them from coming over here or, like, send- -- you know, sending missiles over here?  Because obviously, like, they've sent scud mis- -- you know, they basically, like, they did use scud missiles and technically they weren't supposed to have those.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, when they sit there and say, "Oh, no, we don't have weapons of mass destruction" it's like, hello, you just used scud missiles.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, I don't know.  It'll -- it'll be interesting to see what happens, but ...
R:  Yeah.  Because somebody told me that half the stuff they have the US gave them when they were fighting Iran.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, uh-huh, yes, that's why the US wants to know where that stuff is.  They want it back. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because they want -- they want it back.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they -- half the stuff they're looking for they handed over to 'em.
L:  Indian givers. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Now they're saying, "Well, that stuff you had, can you give that back to us because we need that now?"
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God.
R:  Yes.  See, it wasn't illegal for them to have what they're hiding because it was given to them to fight, uh, Iran when Iran was paired up with Russia and a couple of other people, but now that that's over it's suddenly illegal for them to have the very thing that they received from us.
L:  Oh, my God.  That -- that is really -- it -- I mean, it's funny, but it's sad. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I believe it.  I totally believe it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  So -- so, you know, of course they're gonna hide that stuff.  They're thinking, well, as long as Korea has, you know, nuclear this and that and -- and everybody else has got their stuff, they're gonna keep theirs, you know.
L:  I know.  I just always feel like it's like one thing after another, and it's like I don't really think they concentrate on, like, what's going on over here.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, people are starving here.  People are homeless here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, people -- you know, I don't even think here can -- I mean, yeah, they feel free to -- you know, they have their religious beliefs and they're free to some extent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I mean, I don't know, I just don't think there's enough being done for the -- the crap that goes on here.
R:  I'm wondering if the -- if the taxes are gonna go up, you know, uh --
L:  Oh, probably.
R:  -- to -- to pay for all this.
L:  I know.  I know.  There's probably so much waste anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.  Yeah, they probably will and I don't even wanna think about that.
R:  And see, living over -- I -- I live in LA so I'm on the West Coast and with that North Korean thing going on over there, that guy's thinking about sending missiles to Hawaii.
L:  Oy.
R:  Yeah, and Hawaii is close to here, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God.
R:  You know, he wants to start another Pearl Harbor because they said he's -- he's very, uh -- their leader is very paranoid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and he doesn't want the US telling him what they can and cannot do.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, that -- that's the next thing.  It's like the guys may have come home today, but they might as well keep their uniforms on because they're probably gonna have to go [LAUGH] to North Korea now.
L:  Right.  I don't blame that guy.  I don't like -- I don't think we should be telling -- I mean, I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, I just -- I mean, [inaudible] about World War Two and all the stuff that happened then, and it's like, you know, we should have gotten involved earlier.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because that was just wrong, but I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it's hard to say, you know, every -- every -- every -- every situation is so different.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  And, like, here in LA there's quite a few hospitals that are -- that are gonna close if they don't get, uh, federal funding.  One in particular that I had to go to a long time ago is called Rancho Los Amigos, and it's a hospital for people with spinal injuries.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And, uh, it's a county run hospital but, you know, they also get money from other sources and now all of a sudden they're talking about closing it.  And people are trying to rally to keep it open and trying to get celebrities and anybody that might wanna, uh --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- take it over.  And I'd hate to see it go, too, because, like, I'm -- I'm walking and talking now, but when I was there it was really iffy as to whether or not I was gonna be able to.
L:  Right.  Do you mind if I ask what happened?
R:  Yeah, I was in a car accident and --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- I was a passenger and I wound up with, uh, a fracture in my spine.
L:  [MN] Aye yay yay.
R:  So, I had to be sent there to -- for rehabilitation and they had to operate and do all that stuff.  But my situation turned out a lot better than some.  Some people wind up in that halo traction, you know.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  And even if they heal they may not walk.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  So, it's kind of like that.  They should be putting money into that.  I mean, if they can give billions of dollars to Iraq, they can keep some of these hospitals open.
L:  I -- I agree.  I agree.
R:  You know.
L:  I totally agree.
R:  And the homelessness here as well as here, San Francisco, it's kind of out of control around the summer time --
