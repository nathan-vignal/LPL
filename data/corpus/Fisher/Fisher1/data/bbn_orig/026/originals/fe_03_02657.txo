R:  Hi, my name is Tim.
L:  Hi, my name is Sabrina.
R:  Sabrina, how are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  I'm pretty well, thank you.
L:  That's good.
R:  Well, where is it you live?
L:  Los Angeles.
R:  L.A.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  Outside of San Francisco.
L:  Oh, okay.  I lived up there for a while.
R:  Ah, I'm -- I mean, I'm in Concord, in the East Bay.
L:  Oh, okay.  My roommate in th- um, college was from there.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a good place.
L:  Okay.  Uh, what's your favorite holiday?
R:  I like Thanksgiving.
L:  Oh, okay.  Why is that?
R:  I, um, for example, like, Christmas, is -- is a good holiday, I can't -- I don't have anything against Christmas.  But in fact there is a lot of pressure cos you gotta do all the shopping beforehand and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's the pressure of, you know, if I buy Uncle Bill a present, will Uncle Bill like the present?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then after you get all your presents, if you don't like them, at least what I do is I return the ones I don't like, so then you have to deal with all that.  And it's almost as much hassle as it is fun.
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  Where -- whe- where as for me, Thanksgiving, it's just kind of like, uh, you know, you go and -- I guess in my family it's not very good 'cause my mother does all the cooking, so all I do is, I just show up, eat, you know, help her clean up and then leave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's -- like, I don't have much of the work to do, but I get to do all of the eating.  Plus I like turkey.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Wh- what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Um, Halloween.  [NOISE] Um, I just, kinda -- I never really dress up, but I just really enjoy seeing other people dress up.  But mostly, I just like seeing the kids.  And it kinda -- the last couple of years there hasn't really been as many trick or treaters, since September eleven, which, ki- you know, I don't like it 'cause, you know, we bought all this candy hoping that, you know, that first, um, October [NOISE] in two thousand and one there would be a lot of kids, but there wasn't any 'cause most people just kept their kids at home or had small parties.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm
L:  So, that kind of makes me sad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't know, it just makes me happy to see all the -- the kids really happy and -- the -- the kids can't go to school in costumes anymore either in L.A.
R:  You're kidding?
L:  No.  Because, um, well, they have to wear uniforms all the time so that, I think, for Halloween they get to have a free dress day.
R:  So --
L:  As opposed to costumes.
R:  So, like on Halloween they just get to dress up like they -- in their normal street clothes?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  But, I don't know, it's still -- it's still pretty cool though, like, you know?  I'm hoping that this year I'll probably go to San Diego where my family is and hang out with the kids in my family and watch them get dressed up.
R:  You know what happened, um -- basically where I am, I think my neighbourhood is kinda like a more mature neighbor- you know, like people who are retired and older people.  So, there aren't a lot of kids in my neighborhood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, this year I got no trick or treaters.  I have a coworker though who lives in kind of a neighborhood where, you know, there are younger families so there are a lot of kids.  And she said she got a lot of trick or treaters.  So, I think, the amount of trick or treaters one gets depends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, a lot on what --
L:  I live --
R:  -- what kind of neighbourhood you live in.
L:  Yeah.  I lived in a -- a kind of a poor neighborhood where there usually are lots of trick or treaters , you know?
R:  Mm hmm.
L:  And there was a ton of kids and we didn't get any trick or treaters .
R:  Hm.
L:  They just didn't -- they didn't come.  And we had, like, our gates open and, you know, we put the dog in the house.
R:  Lights on.
L:  Yeah, lights on.  We had to, like, yell out to the few kids who did come, to make 'em come over.  I don't know, it's really strange.
R:  Hm.  Now the other thing, I have a -- another coworker who has -- she's like six years old --
L:  Mm hmm.
R:  -- and one thing that they did this year, you know, I asked them, "Are you going to take your kid trick or treating ?" and he said, "No, we're not going do -- we're not going to go for, like, from house to house".  And I said, "Well, what are you going to do?" and he said, "Well, we're going to take the kid, the child, to the mall".  I said, "Really?" --
L:  Oh, they going from store to store?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  And --
L:  -- stores do give out candy.
R:  Y- exactly.  He said -- what he said is a -- it's, like, safer 'cause, you know, the chances of getting attacked or mugged in a shopping mall are like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- next to zero.  It's also safer that, you know, let's say you get this bag of candy and, you know, you got some cuckoo, you know, some kook in the neighborhood, he poisons the candy and kills the kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's probably not going to happen if you get all your candy at a store.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, from the different stores.  And the third thing he said was, [LAUGH] just efficiency sake, you know.  You can go from store one to store two pretty quickly.  If you're going from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one house to the next, you know, you have to walk up the walkway, ring the doorbell, wait for the person to answer, you know, the person answers, "Trick or Treat?" you get the candy, then you have to walk down the walkway, down the sidewalk to the next walkway, up the walkw- knock, answer, and it takes so much longer.  So, he said, "You know, you get --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- more candy when you go to the mall" and --
L:  Yeah, it's kind of unfortunate though 'cause I really, I don't know, I just like the old way of doing things, you know?
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Like, my -- yeah.  My last couple of Thanksgivings haven't even been as -- what they were before when I was a kid, you know?  'Cause, I don't know, it's just -- everything just gets a little bit different.
R:  I think --
L:  Maybe when I have kids I'll try and make it, kind of, the way it was [LAUGH], but probably not.
R:  Well, you know, holidays, they -- they all evolve.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See everything evolves constantly and maybe, like now, people are, like you said, a little bit more paranoid and a little bit more safety conscious so they don't want to go out but maybe, you know, little -- you know, ten years from now the trend will be the other way.  People will be a little bit more open and a little bit more community minded and will be more able to --
L:  Trust each other.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- or, you know, like, my first coworker, the one who actually lives in a neighborhood where there are a lot of kids, you know, I guess in some parts of the state, there are still neighborhoods like [MN] --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that'll do things.
L:  -- there are still some, yeah.  I think I'm just in Los Angeles, so ... And in San Francisco there was no trick or treaters  either 'cause, you know, the neighborhoods are so compact and all --
R:  Ye-
L:  -- the apartments are closed off from people, so ...
R:  Yeah, makes it hard.  Now, what part of L.A. are you in?
L:  Um, I live in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, like, in the Wilshire district.
R:  In the Wilshire, okay.
L:  Yeah, just south of Hollywood.
R:  Okay.
L:  What was -- what was the second question that I heard the machine ask?  I don't remember.
R:  If you were to make up your own holiday, what would it be?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Uh, do you have an answer for that?
R:  No [LAUGH].  You answer first, I'll think while you answer --
L:  Um --
R:  -- or do you have an answer?
L:  I don't know.  Probably just like a -- a -- a community day.  You know, where you kind of -- you know how they used to have block parties and stuff?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've never been to one of those.  So, I always wish there was a day where, you know, people celebrated community and just got together [NOISE] with their neighbors an- and, you know, celebrated together [NOISE] and maybe had a drink, potlucks or,  you know, and got to know each other.  Because a lot of people don't do that.  So, yeah -- I -- you know, as opposed to Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, like, Community Day.
R:  Tha- --
L:  I think that would be mine.  
R:  That's actually a very good idea.  'Cause I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those type of things make a community just, you know, it's so much nicer when you live --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a place where you know, you know, everybody around you.  I mean --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- even if it's just, kind of like a -- just a friendly first, you know, friendly basis.  You don't need --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to know, like, all their intimate details and whatnot.  But just, you know, "Hey, that guy there, the -- the guy's Fred, he's a- architect.  And that -- that lady there --"      
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- my neighbor, Sally, she's an accountant" that type of thing.
L:  Yeah.  That would be, I don't know, I think that would be a good idea.  Maybe I'll pitch it to someone.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Maybe I'll pitch it to the government?
R:  Yeah.
L:  To make a Community Day.
R:  Or, you know, even make it, like, er, maybe even start it, like, at the city level?  Just start --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at your, whatever ci-, well, LA's a big city, but if you lived in, like, a smaller city, you -- they -- they like that type of thing 'cause it helps.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Well, do you have any ideas for that or ...?
R:  Well, the idea that just popped into my head and, again, it just, kind of, popped into my head, is kind of, like, a -- like, an International Day.
L:  Ooh.
R:  A day where, you know --
L:  Celebrating other cultures kind of?
R:  Other cultures, yeah, and tolerance, basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, a day where, yeah, you're just supposed to learn about another culture.  You know, I think th- --
L:  That would be cool.
R:  -- the world's getting, obviously, smaller and smaller and smaller and we're all getting more -- you know, Americans are becoming more intertwined with the rest of the world as the rest of the world's getting more intertwined with everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's just a day where, I think, you take time out just to learn about other cultures, other lands, other peoples, other religions, that type of thing.
L:  Wow, that would be amazing.  Huh.
R:  Um, I don't know if it would actually work.  I think, actually, your idea is better 'cause really your idea could -- could, you know, really help communities come together whereas my idea, I think, would just be, kind of, like, oh, you go to a festival for a day or something, you think, "Wow", those people know -- those other countries --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- are neat but then you forget about it.
L:  Yeah.  That's a good idea too though, because, I mean, you know, we used to have, um, fairs in junior high, in high school, where it would be, like, you know, cultural -- different cultures and stuff.  And that --
R:  Oh, like -- like --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] We would just, like, have different foods and different musicians and stuff.  And I mean, you know, it's kind of like a day where you had to learn tolerance [NOISE] and take time out to, like, recognize other cultures.
R:  So, they'd pick, like, --
L:  So, it was --
R:  -- like, one other country or, like, today will be China Day?
L:  Yeah.  It would go on for, like, a week or something, and there'd be, like, different representatives of, like, Europe, Asia, and Africa and Latin American, so it was pretty cool.
