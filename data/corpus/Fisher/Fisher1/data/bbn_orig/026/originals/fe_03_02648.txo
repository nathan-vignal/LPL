R:  [MN]
L:  Hi, this is Alison.
R:  Hi, this is Frank.  [SIGH]  Ah, my -- my -- my favorite holiday is -- I haven't thought of this topic very much but I -- ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I -- I guess Memorial Day, [SIGH] because it's the first holiday of the summer season.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  I guess I would probably have to say mine is Christmas, just because [SIGH] it's like a special time of year.  [LIPSMACK]  And I guess it's the advertising, they start it so early any way.  You got -- it's in your face -- you know, by, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Thanksgiving.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah, ah, [COUGH] I -- I -- I don't like Christmas as much as you because as -- as you said it's too much hype in it.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  The advertising hype is started too early.  [COUGH]  I do like some aspects of the Christmas season, such as the Christmas lights and the Remembrance Day Parade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [COUGH]  Ah, but just the topic -- my favorite holiday is -- I -- I -- I obvi- I have to continue with Memorial Day because it's an entrance to the summer [SIGH] tourist season, and swimming season and it indicates the [SIGH] warmer season because I like warm weather and I dislike cold weather.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  How about you?
L:  Well, I -- in -- kind of the same thing.  The Fourth of July is really nice then too, because it's in the middle of th- the summer and hopefully it doesn't get too hot, you know, so you can still be outside and be  you know, not very uncomfortable in the heat.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And, um, it's really nice usually because every town has some kind of fireworks and people get together and have picnics --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so that I think that's nice too.
R:  Ah, I'm sorry what was your name again?  Karen?
L:  Alison.
R:  Oh, Alison, I'm sorry.  Oh, I think they want you to stay on the topic.  I was warned this -- so we have to stay on our favorite holiday --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- whatever your holiday is, I think.  Ah, so, why is Christmas your favorite holiday?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, just because, [SIGH] it's, ah, like a festive time of year and with my family we have a huge, um, dinner the night before.  [SIGH]  And then the next day we see each other on Christmas, then the next day, too.  So, [MN] I'm a college student so I don't see my family a lot.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, when I do go home for my winter break, and it's Christmas, that's probably again why I really like it.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Yes, it's a good family holiday and I can see why you -- you like it.
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH]  Ah, [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- again, now, ah, which holiday I would create?  They asked us to stay on the topic --
L:  Right.
R: -- so which, ah, new holiday I would create, I have to really [LAUGH] think hard about that.  [SIGH]  Ah, I'd have to say, "Welcome to Spring holiday".  I just had that creative insight, I hope.  [SIGH]  Ah, Welcome to Spring holiday where, ah, [COUGH] everyone would, ah, [SIGH] have a big, ah, outdoor party, ah, in center of city  ah, welcoming spring, having a few drinks and dancing and, ah, [SIGH] with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the mummers, ah, bands --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and al- all kinds of, ah, festivities because that's how much I hate the winter and love to welcome the spring.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]  So, ah, do you have a holiday you'd like to create, ah, Alison?  [SIGH]
L:  Well, kind of, um, working off of what you said, I think -- I don't like, um, winter either, I think it's a cold and  kind of bitter.  But maybe if there was some kind of like, Welcome to Winter, [SIGH] because a lot of people seem to not like winter that much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and if you were to get kind of every town having, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- kind of like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, hot chocolate and ice skating and then some kind of outdoor activities, people might be, um, you know, kind of like maybe [MN] like winter a little bit more, since a lot of people don't s- seem to like it as much as spring and summer and, I guess, fall.
R:  I agree with you.  So, I -- I'm -- I'm just taking it -- interpreting it, Alison, as you're saying you would have like a Welcome to Winter holiday?  [SIGH]
L:  Right, yes.
R:  That's a good idea and I would enjoy that too because, as much as I dislike the winter, [SIGH] I've heard in other countries, such as Iceland, they have ah [SIGH] thermal baths and, ah, people party in the winter --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and it's more pleasant than here.  So, I think that's a good idea.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Ah, make a winter festive holiday.  I think that's an excellent idea, Alison, ah 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, [COUGH] [SIGH] ah, so, you- your's is a Welcoming Winter holiday and mine's a Welcoming Spring holiday?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I think that's good.  [SIGH]  Ah, [COUGH] now getting back to my favorite holiday, Memorial Day.  Ah, again, it's coming up soon and, ah, sometimes it's too chilly to -- to swim on Memorial Day but, still, [SIGH] it, ah, [COUGH] it's a harbinger of -- of -- of the, ah, warmer weather, [SIGH] and, ah, [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like, ah -- ah, an indicator that t- the winter's over and we'll be -- soon be able to go swimming and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- picnicking and, ah, having a couple of beers outside and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I like to go to the beach [SIGH] in the summer and -- and there's a certain beach I like to go to in North Jersey.  So, Memorial Day, ah, is a harbinger of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  Would you agree with that?
L:  Yes.  Is, m- Memorial Day -- it's usually -- is there a specific date or is it the last weekend in May?  Is that what it is?
R:  Yes, I think it's the fourth Monday in May.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.
R:  I'm pretty sure.  [SIGH]  It's, ah, this month it's a one, two, three [SIGH]  Yeah, it's the fourth -- the Congress changed the holiday laws some years ago, probably, before you were born, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- making it on Mondays.
L:  All right.
R:  Making most of the holidays on Mondays.  [SIGH]  So, I think it's the fourth Monday of the month 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Of May.  [LIPSMACK]  So --
L:  That's it.
R:  Pardon me.
L:  I'm sorry.  And also it's good because, you know, you get a day off.  Summer holidays, like, um, [SIGH] Valentine's Day, you don't -- not as if that's a huge -- huge holiday but that's, um, something you don't get off.  So, it's nice to have, um, the Monday off on three day weekends.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, but, ah, in the interests of st- staying on the topic you -- you -- you do like -- you prefer Christmas you said, right?  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  [SIGH]  And -- an -- well, a lot of people probably prefer Christmas, ah, because -- do you enjoy seeing, ah, Christmas lights strung on trees and  Santa Clauses and reindeer etc?
L:  Yes.  Um, I really like that.  I think, um, [LIPSMACK] some houses at Christmas time will have very  just, you know, like a nice --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- nice wreath --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wreath or something and sometimes that is a nice -- that's a little nicer than, ah, really decked out houses --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that almost every town seems to have.  But sometimes it's nicer just to have  holly or something plain on the house where it's not very [SIGH] gaudy, but it's still festive.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I agree with you.  I agree with you a hundred percent, Alison.  I wouldn't like excessive gaudiness.  No, I don't.
L:  Right.
R:  In fact, in my neighborhood [SIGH], which is pretty rich [several inaudible words] a lot of people decorate [SIGH] their houses for d- different holidays, even Valentine's Day etc but I --.
L:  Yes.
R:  -- want to [SIGH] continue on with, ah, Memorial Day being my favorite holiday.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's difficult.  These topics are not easy but, ah, [COUGH] [SIGH] Memorial Day's coming soon and, of course, there's a patriotic element and I'm a veteran --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- of the Vietnam War --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I'm a patriotic person so, ah, Memorial Day honors, ah, our fallen dead servicemen and women [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH] and that's sort of important to remember don't you think?
L:  Yes, I think especially if you said this year it'll be, [SIGH] maybe a little closer.  Now I guess it has been for the last, maybe [SIGH] since nine eleven which is nice because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not even -- it's like a nice time to relax and I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but still you're able to appreciate the people that have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- served the country.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, you have to remember the significance of our holidays.  Ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like Christmas is Jesus' birthday.  Memorial Day is honoring our fallen, ah, armed services members [SIGH] and, ah, it -- it's -- it's -- it's fair -- let's remember they paid the price --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, they -- they're no long- -- no longer among the living on this earth and that's a pretty big price to pay, don't you think?  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  For freedom and liberty.  So, I think that's ah, another reason why Memorial Day is my [SIGH] favorite holiday --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as far as a holiday I'd create, again, I have to go back to, ah, Welcoming Spring Day which -- actually what day would I make it?  What date?  I -- I guess I would make it, ah, [SIGH] May first.  May Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And when -- when would you, ah, appoint -- what day -- date would you appoint for your, ah, holiday -- new holiday, Alison?
L:  Well, I think t- the first day of winter is the twenty first --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  --  usually the twentieth or twenty first.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  That's very close to Christmas, so I think maybe, with my holiday, people wouldn't really [NOISE] want -- they would be focusing on Christmas, as opposed to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some other different holiday.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, maybe I would say --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, December first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or it could just be not really a welcome to winter but more of a winter holiday and have it, maybe, February first, because February is such a kind of a dreary month and it's short but still [SIGH] very cold and my holiday would be able to  help people maybe be a little bit more happy and [SIGH] outgoing and meet with, um, neighbors and friends.
R:  Oh, I -- I couldn't agree with you more an -- and of course we have to [SIGH] you'd have to plan -- you'd have to start -- we'd have to start a holiday committee to plan these things --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as to the exact appropriate date, don't you think, Alison?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [SIGH]  So, this -- these aren't easy ideas to come up with right away but [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- continuing on, ah, I don't -- ah, trying to think of what other, ah, festivities we could have when they're welcoming -- my Welcome to Spring Day --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- which, ah, [SIGH] I would have, ah, scheduled on May first which used to be called May Day --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I guess it still is.  Ah, I guess we could have [COUGH] [SIGH] -- well I've seen a lot of people go to Old City in Philadelphia and, ah, party [SIGH] and that would be a good idea.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And maybe I would have a feature where [SIGH] ah, single people ah -- ah, should try to meet each other.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And everyone else, married people or people and couples should tr- try to be friendly and meet other people [SIGH] as friends [SIGH] because sometimes I think, ah, Americans don't meet each other enough and have enough friends.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, what do you think of that, Alison?
L:  Yeah, I think that's a good idea, especially since it's starting spring everyone's out more.  They're working on their lawn or they're out exercising, and people just want to get out and interact with more people, and your holiday would really help people maybe begin to do that for the season.
R:  Oh, I appreciate your input into that and that [SIGH] -- so, since Christmas is your favorite holiday [SIGH] do you stay in -- I assume you live in the Philadelphia area, do you stay in your home area, Alison, or do you t- travel to Miami or somewhere like that?
L:  Well, actually, I'm going to college here in Philadelphia.  I live in North Jersey so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I go home, um, usually my college we get out,  um, around like the fifteenth so I'm home able to start planning for Christmas and [SIGH] buy my gifts for everyone.
R:  Right.  Yeah, well, Christmas is a very popular holiday and ah -- ah -- ah -- ah, sort of an expensive holiday --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the United States as people -- most Americans spend a lot of money on gifts, although I don't spend a -- a lot of money on gifts because I just don't believe in it.  I just buy [SIGH] a gift for my girlfriend [LAUGH] and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- send cards to my family members.  That's all I do.  I put a wreath up on my door and candles on my -- in my --
L:  Right.
R:  -- windows etc.  Do you do any of those things, A- Alison?  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, like I -- I said, ah, I don't really like --
