L:  Hi, my name is May.
R:  [SIGH]  Hi, I'm Lisa.  [NOISE].
L:  Hi, Lisa, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  Where are you?
R:  [SIGH]  I'm in Staten Island, New York.
L:  Oh, and I'm in Greenville, South Carolina.
R:  Oh, wow!  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  How's it going there?  [MN]
R:  I- it's going well.  It's a beautiful day.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, good.
R:  So, yeah.  It -- it's a change.  It's kind of been  not so nice around here [LAUGH] lately.  So, 
L:  Yeah, we've had our share of some of the bad weather too, but, ah -- in fact we're -- we're expecting some severe thunderstorms today.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think, um, they're going to be heading our way.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well I hope not.  But, [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [SIGH]  So, um --
L:  Have you -- did you -- you heard the topic, huh?
R:  Yes, I did.  This is my first time I've done this actually.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, it -- this is my third call but, ah -- but it's always been a different topic.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  And as far as like, ah, this one I -- I didn't know they were going to ask us to create our own holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, [LAUGH] really know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Are we supposed to think of a holiday that doesn't already exist, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]  We-
R:  Well, we'll start out with what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Yeah, I've got to go for Christmas.
R:  Okay.  I -- I would have to agree.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And I think that the -- the -- the -- th --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- the, ah, question was, "What's your favorite holiday and why?"
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, well I -- I can say for, ah, -- ah, a lot of reasons.  One thing is because it's a family thing and it's -- there's always a lot of love and joy.  I love the music.  I love the lights, the -- the -- I love to go round look at the --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- Christmas decorations.  I [SIGH] -- I love to decorate my house and I absolutely obsess on my Christmas tree.  [SIGH]  It takes me hours to decorate that thing.  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  I enjoy the shopping and I enjoy  getting together and watching everybody open their presents and the -- you know, the big family dinner and [SIGH] the mu- -- all of it really.  I -- I love it all.
R:  I know.  [NOISE]
L:  What about you?
R:  [NOISE].  I -- I totally agree.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, everything you said is pretty much the reason.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But I like Christmas.  [SIGH]  Um 
L:  'Cause you're in New York too, so you probably get -- you have your share of white Christmases, right?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  This year was a white Christmas which was really nice.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I have never had one of those.
R:  Oh, no?
L:  No.  I'm originally from California.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, wow!
L:  So, I'm used to like  seventy five degrees.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I see -- I -- I can -- I can't even picture having Christmas in the warm weather.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's actually -- like one thing that's good about Christmas is I personally hate the cold weather.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I hate winter, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, the good thing about when Christmas falls, [SIGH] is that it's just getting so cold and like  miserable --
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's such a happy --
L:  [LAUGH]  It's a happy season.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's such a happy time.
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it falls [LAUGH] in such a perfect -- like perfect time, but then when Christmas is over --
L:  Um.
R:  -- then we just have to deal with like  the winter.
L:  Then you're down in the doldrums huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like when Christmas is over it is pretty anti climatic.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. Exactly.
L:  It's like the big let down.
R:  Exactly.  Like at least you have New Years'.
L:  Right.  You got that week --
R:  So, it lets you down slowly.  You still have something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to look forward to, but then after that January comes --
L:  Boom.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's just -- it's miserable.  [LAUGH]
L:  And January is really, when you think about it, is really one of the ugliest months of the year.  [LAUGH]
R:  It really is.
L:  I think anywhere in the country January's that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I really do.  [SIGH]  But, yeah, I can see your point.  If you really hate the winter then it is a good thing that Christmas comes in, because it takes your mind off of it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it is beautiful.  It really is beautiful.
R:  It is.  And when it snows and th- the lights and everything.  It's so beautiful.
L:  I've only seen pictures, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I always imagined it and always wanted to -- to at least once, ah, have that whole thing with the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the snow and the snow fall and [SIGH] to see the lights and everything with the -- ah, reflecting on the snow.  I just think it would be absolutely beautiful.
R:  Yeah.  It is
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But that is definitely [NOISE] like the good parts.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And being in New York it's really nice too just because the city's always so festive.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And  that's what I love and I love when the stores are festive and like everyone's just so happy and like --
L:  I know.
R:  -- the music is just the best.  [LAUGH]  And it's --
L:  And don't you just wish it could be like that all the time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't mean with the decorations and everything but it's funny what you said about everybody is so happy --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's a shame that it's only that way for such a short time [NOISE] --
R:  I know.
L:  -- during the year.  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Maybe that's the day we should create?  A Let's Everyone be Happy Day.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That is -- that is a good holiday.
L:  For no particular reason.  [LAUGH]
R:  Just a day of joy.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Which I suppose you could kinda --
R:  A day of joy and family.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- which I guess has probably already been invented, it's called Thanksgiving.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  True.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I don't know.  We could -- we could invent and celebrate our country day, but that would be Fourth of July.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's true.  [LAUGH]  All -- all these are there already.
L:  [LAUGH]  Or we could honor our -- our President, but that would be President's Day.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  Let's see, um --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- how -- how 'bout Bill Clinton's birthday?  I don't think that will ever be, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think anybody will create that holiday.  That would be original.
R:  Oh, that's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, but I don't know how many people would want to celebrate it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well 
L:  Well, it would give us an excuse for a day off.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's -- the best holidays are the ones that you get days off.
L:  Absolutely!  [LAUGH]
R:  So, the holiday that I would create would definitely be a national --
L:  On a Monday.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- holiday that -- yeah, yeah, a Monday --
L:  [LAUGH]  It's got to be a Monday.
R:  -- that everyone has off.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's a national holiday because the religious holidays are a little  fuzzy because not everyone celebrates.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's always good when there's like Thanksgiving so you always know to like, you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- wish somebody like a happy Thanksgiving when  around Christmas --
L:  Th -- that's true during Christmas you don't -- you don't -- that's true you don't know what to say.
R:  -- you don't know who's -- feel like saying -- it's always, "Happy holidays" you have to say to everyone.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  Because you don't know what holiday anyone's celebrating.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's very true.  That's very true.  It could be a holiday called, you know, ah, Just for the Heck of It Holiday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what we should call it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Just for the Heck of It Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And it would always have to be on a Monday, or a Friday.
R:  That's true.
L:  I -- I'd settle for a Friday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Friday's are good too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Long weekends are always good.
L:  [SIGH]  And I guess it should be the time of the year when there are no other holidays --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, anywhere nearby.  I wonder what month that would be?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  August?  [LAUGH]
L:  Let's see?
R:  Actually, no, August is Labor Day.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, then --
R:  [SIGH]  Or, August September [SIGH] that is Labor Day.
L:  Yeah, September is, ah, Memorial Day.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE].  N- no, Memorial Day's in May.  Labor Day.
L:  H- how about April?
R:  April doesn't have one I don't think.
L:  Yeah!
R:  Sometimes it has Easter.
L:  Oh, that's right.  We just --
R:  But that's only sometimes [LIPSMACK] and not everyone celebrates those, so -- [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that could be a good month?
L:  Yeah.  Or June.  June would be a good one.
R:  [SIGH]  That's true.
L:  Yeah!  It's just -- like the beginning of summer and you've got, you know, all the way till July Fourth to, you know, w- with nothing going on.
R:  And it's always nice to have three day weekends in the summer.  [SIGH]
L:  I absolutely agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  I feel like they're a waste when they're in the winter.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you -- are you married?
R:  No, I'm not.  I'm single.  [MN]  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  And how did you find this, um, [SIGH] you know, this  thing that we doing?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it -- it's pretty interesting.  I --
L:  I mean how did you locate it?  How did you --
R:  I found it on the internet actually.
L:  Yeah.  So, did I.  Did you find it on a web site?
R:  I found it on, um, Craigslist.
L:  Craigslist?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is that?
R:  It's, um, [SIGH] it's a -- it's a web site that has classified ads.  It's  -- and it's free classified ads -- so someone just [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put the ad on.  I guess it was like their way of [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting  their, ah, referrals.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  So, that's how I found it.
L:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] that's cool.  [SIGH]  It's kind of fun too.  This is -- like I said this is my third call.  I guess you get to make three.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And, you know, I've had a lot of fun doing it.  You don't know who you're going to talk to, and you don't know what you're going to talk about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it's painless.
R:  I know.  Definitely.  [NOISE]
L:  It really is.
R:  And this is an interesting [LAUGH] topic.
L:  Yeah, it is.  I -- I -- this is an easy topic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The one that I talked about yesterday was, ah, "How do you feel about the war in Iraq?"
R:  I know.  I -- actually they called me for that but I couldn't take it a the time that they -- that they called.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I was happy that I couldn't take it 'cause [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I really didn't want to talk about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like this topic.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I love holidays.  But I -- I was glad th- [COUGH] --
R:  I know.
L:  -- to hear this because I love Christmas.  I love Thanksgiving too.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you -- you know --
R:  Any family holiday is fun.
L:  I -- I agree.  But Christmas just -- ah, to me it's [SIGH] I don't know if we lose sight of the -- of the reason for Christmas, but whatever the reason is it does seem to bring a lot of people together --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and there's a lot of good will [SIGH] at that time --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- of the year and that's a good thing, you know?
R:  And I find that everyone loves -- loves Christmas time even if they don't actually celebrate Christmas.
L:  I -- I think I agree too.  You know a lot of people won't -- won't admit it.
R:  Because I have a lot of -- I have a lot of Jewish friends.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, so do I.
R:  And -- and they love Christmas time just because  they love to -- the music.  They love like the lights and like the --
L:  It's beautiful.
R:  -- just the whole festivity of it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- even though, you know, they don't celebrate it.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think that really matters that much.  It -- it is the -- the -- the beauty of it as well --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- not just the day itself.  It's the whole season.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was in Vancouver a -- a couple of years ago for Christmas an- and th- that's such a beautiful city and I [SIGH] I thought they would just go crazy  decorating the place for Christmas.  So, I was really happy to be in that city at Christmas time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They didn't do anything.  I -- I could not believe --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yo- -- I -- I just couldn't believe that -- you'd have hardly known it was Christmas if you were to drive through the streets of Vancouver.  [SIGH]
R:  Really?
L:  It -- it's surprising, isn't it?
R:  [NOISE]  That's very surprising.
L:  Yeah, I was very surprised too.  [MN]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Here it's like crazy with lights.  I feel like people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] people like compete with the other houses on the block. --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [LAUGH] who has the nicest  Christmas set up.
L:  And then in your shopping districts and everything too it's all --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It wasn't like that.  I mean, I'm not just talking about th- the residents, I'm talking about --
R:  Really?
L:  -- down town and the businesses and --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's surprising!
L:  It was amazing.  I was shocked.  I was very, very disappointed.
R:  And you were there  right at the end of the summer?
L:  I was there be- before Thanksgiving.
R:  Really?
L:  And, ah, all the way through January so I -- it didn't happen.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  It didn't happen.  [SIGH]
R:  That's very surprising.  I didn't even realize.  I just figured it was like [SIGH] th- the way it is here all over the country.
L:  Well, I think it is in  that way in a lot of other parts of Canada.
