R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Liz.  I'm from New York.
L:  Hi.  [NOISE] I'm CC from DC.
R:  DC from DC?
L:  CC.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] From DC.
R:  Okay, sorry [LAUGH].  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Christmas.
R:  Mine too.  Do you have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a reason for that? 
L:  I just like to be with my family and that's when we get together.
R:  Yeah, we do.  Do you have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- children? 
L:  [NOISE]  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm married with --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- three kids, so I would have to say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --Christmas as well. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Basically for the kids, they like to -- you know, the presents and --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Both of us. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wouldn't trade it for another holiday, I just love Christmas.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah I -- I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too but I think a lot of holidays, like they take the religious aspect out of it.
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that -- that's true too.
R:  I mean, not that I'm highly religious but I think, you know, Christmas is when Jesus was born, and --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- and people tend to focus on Christmas trees and reindeers and --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- Santa Claus --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --and -- which is fine for children but I think they should be taught both ways.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] That's true too.  I agree what you say. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Easter also they do that with the Easter bunnies and --
L:  [NOISE] No, I don't do that Easter bunny, I don't do the [NOISE] -- I do the Easter bunnies but I don't do like the hunt -- egg hunts and stuff like that.  I don't [NOISE] do all that stuff.
R:  We do.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm hm. [NOISE]
R:  So, I guess we're feeding into that also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you know, we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do go to church as well, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we do all the other commercialized stuff.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what was the other question?  If you could create a holiday, what would it be and why?
L:  No.  It's like if --
R:  Don't think so?
L:  -- you would trade it, I think it was like if you could trade a holiday, what would you trade it?  And my answer was, "No".
R:  No.  I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wouldn't trade a holiday.  
L:  [MN]
R:  If I could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- create one, I think I would create Mother's Day off.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Instead of Mother's Day. [LAUGH]
L:  That should be every day though, every day.
R:  Yeah, but it's not.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible].
R:  Eve- -- even in -- even the -- you know, the days off is not.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  What would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you create if you could create a holiday?
L:  Uh, I have no idea.  I don't know, Children's Day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but that's every day to me too, so I don't know.
R:  What do you do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a living?
L:  Oh, I'm a full time student.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] College student. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, what are you majoring?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I major in Biology.
R:  Wow!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm in school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also, studying occupational therapy.  I think they --
L:  Uh. [NOISE]
R:  -- should maybe have a patient's day.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Or -- or elderly day, do something with the elderly.
L:  Yeah, that's tru- -- [NOISE]
R:  I work with the elderly.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I like holidays but I think they tend to be very stressful too.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  All the shopping [NOISE] and stuff like that.  [NOISE]
R:  And the cooking and -- it's nice to have family but sometimes it's just -- overbearing to have everybody over.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how do you --
L:  Drama. [NOISE]
R:  -- how do you celebrate holidays?  Do you have family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- come over and ?
L:  Mhm.  We all just come over and have a big party.
R:  Do you have a large family?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I do as well.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'd rather -- I'd rather things be intimate though, like just have close family members but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's kind of hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have like -- I have like six siblings.
L:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And they're married and they have children.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, to have something in -- in the house, it's too chaotic.
L:  Well, there's just me and my si- -- my older sister but, um, my Mom has like eight sisters and brothers.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then their kids, so -- [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  So, how did you [NOISE] celebrate your holidays growing up? [NOISE]
L:  The same way.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We just all got together [NOISE] and, um, just partied.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] It's been the same way.
R:  Well, it's a good excuse to party.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  It's a good excuse to shop as well.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] There's no problem.
R:  See, I like to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- shop and buy gifts.
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That sounds good to me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you like giving gifts or receiving them?
L:  Both.  If I know it's gonna make somebody happy I'll -- I do both. [NOISE]
R:  I find it's hard to shop for men, though.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that is, because my friend, [NOISE] my male friend, he just has everything.  [NOISE] So, it's hard to shop for him. [NOISE]
R:  And -- and men aren't like women, that -- like women will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- appreciate anything.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Clothing.
L:  And men, they're like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Ew".  They'll give you that look like, "Eew".  [NOISE]
R:  An- -- and they wear the same thing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all the time, so it's like you can buy them a shirt and tie and they'll just tuck it away and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wear the same thing.  Women --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- women it's easier to shop for.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] That's true.  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause we're more appreciative. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R: Well, that is true because my husband, he's like -- no matter what you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- give him, it's never enough.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  Or it's not what he expected or wanted.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  So, I just give -- I just give my boyfriend, I usually just give him a -- um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- a gift certificate somewhere to his -- like his favorite store. [NOISE]
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] So, he can go get it himself. [LAUGH] And if he doesn't like it, he can just blame it on himself. [NOISE]
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I should start doing that.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  But then if I do, he'll probably say, "Well, I don't like that store".
L:  Why? [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not my fault.  Well see, I know most of the stores he shop at, so if ...
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  I just get him a [MN].  So --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- I just give him a certificate.  And --
R:  I --
L:  -- [NOISE] everything will be fine. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] That's a good idea, I'll have to try that.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, I think these holidays -- sometimes they're blown out of proportion.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE] They are.
R:  -- even in church, because we went to church for Easter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and uh, we went to a Catholic church --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I grew up Protestant, you know, in --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- a Baptist church.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And even the priest was talking to the kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about Easter bunnies, which I felt was really strange.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I think, you know people need to bring back the true meaning of holidays --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and stop commercializing everything.
L:  Mhm.  Which is true.
R:  You know, and celebrate --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like if they have President's Day, and Labor Day and Memorial Day, and people just look at that like a day off, they don't --
L:  Right.
R:  --look at the meaning of Martin Luther King Day.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  People don't know the history behind these days.  They just, "Oh!  We have a day off."
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  Yeah, I think that that should be looked into too.
L:  [NOISE] Everything is so commercialized.
R:  It's true.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know Memorial Day, that's to remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the past, the departed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the people who fought for us, and --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Now, it's just like party time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And Labor Day, what is that supposed to be for?
L:  [NOISE] I don't have no idea.
R:  Is that for people who work?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [NOISE] I don't know what that is. [NOISE]
R:  And President's Day, what are they celebrating?
L:  [NOISE] I don't know. [LAUGH] Some of these holidays, I just think they need to get rid of.
R:  Oh, Secretaries' Day, Nurses' Day.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think, I think that --
L:  [NOISE] They should make a Students' Day. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah they should.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause being a student is very stressful.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  They should have a Students' Day. [NOISE]
R:  But what would they do if they had a Students' Day?
L:  [NOISE] We'll have time off. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  No school work.
R:  [LAUGH]  They -- no, no, it should be Students' Week.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  Like spring, spring -- sort of like a spring break.
L:  Spring break.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Like especially like after a mid term or something --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- that would be good.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  That's excellent [LAUGH].
L:  That'd be perfect.  That'd be perfect. [NOISE]
R:  We should try to pass that law, that would be good.
L:  That would be. [NOISE]
R:  Yo- -- you go full time to school too, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yep.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Full time. [NOISE]
R:  That's hard.  It really is.
L:  [NOISE]  That'll -- that'll be wonderful for me. [NOISE]
R:  I wonder if -- I don't think they'd -- no, I don't think they have -- they have Teachers' Day too.
L:  [NOISE] So what?  See, that has nothing to do with the students though. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they should have Students' Day.  
L:  [NOISE] That's -- that's good.  And do it like right after like a stressful period, like mid terms.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  With finals, you know, you usually get a break in between anyway.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, because you'll be going, like, home for the summer.  I find that you go home for the summer.  [NOISE] So -- and our midterms would be just like go back like school. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  And you're already like pumped up with adrenalin and, you know, sick to your stomach taking all those tests.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] I know, I have a presentation due on Tuesday, and barely started it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  Tell you something.
L:  [NOISE] I have a lot of work to do.  I got a lot of extra credit work to do that I didn't start that's due this week.  'Cause our finals start soon. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, ours don't start for another few weeks.
L:  [NOISE] I think next week is our finals.  I think?  No, the week after next is our finals.  [NOISE] So, we get to go home for s- -- for summer, but then I'm taking
