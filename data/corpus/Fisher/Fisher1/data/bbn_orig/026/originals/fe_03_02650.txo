R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
L:  Hi, I'm Stacy, how are you?
R:  Ah -- hi, how are you?  [NOISE]
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE]  Um, I didn't quite catch the question -- the comment of the day.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  It's, um, we're talking about holidays.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, um, the question is if either of us have a favorite holiday.  [SIGH]  And also, if we could, um, create a holiday [SIGH] what would it be like?  How would we celebrate it?  Um, etc.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, I can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go first if you want?
R:  Oh, [SIGH] okay, you can go ahead.
L:  Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] my favorite holiday, [SIGH] I think is probably Christmas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But it's really not because of the gifts.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] actually I -- I'm Catholic so I -- I --
R:  So, am I.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  So, Christmas -- well, Christmas --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and Easter, actually, but Christmas is a big to do.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, other church services and, [NOISE] um, charity work and things like that.  [SIGH]  So, ah, I really enjoy that and [MN], um, the other part that I really like about Christmas is I actually like giving gifts.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I like, ah, you know, people's expression, [SIGH] um, when I know I've gotten them something that they can use, or that they like.  And, ah, I also have nephews.  [PAUSE]  And [SIGH] my favorite part of Christmas Day is the time I spend with them, because, you know, of course they just think everything's great.  And [LAUGH] -- um, it's just so much fun to, ah, to you know, see the joy on their faces.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so what -- what's your favorite holiday?
R:  Ah, actually mine is, ah, Christmas too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Ah, because -- yeah, ah, um -- um, partially that the main part of why Christmas is such a big thing is cause I live in New York.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And New York it's like always, ah, so lit up.  [SIGH]  And, ah, the -- the main event like of -- like Thanksgiving and Christmas is like the Thanksgiving Day Parade and then you see Santa Claus --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at the end and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- the Rockefeller, ah, Christmas tree lighting and -- [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  Oh, what else is there?  There's a main -- there's a big event, ah, the, ah, Christmas spectacular at Radio City Music Hall.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know what I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] just the different things.  Your different, um, different festivities of Christmas that are going on.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  I mean New -- New York is like big for that.
L:  Yeah, I've always wanted to see, um, the Rockefeller Christmas tree.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I live in Virginia --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, I'm -- I actually was in New York about a month ago but --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, other than that I've really never been there but I've always wanted to see the Rockefeller tree during Christmas but 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's something you wouldn't want to miss.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  May -- maybe sometime I can -- I can do it then.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, yeah, I mean I -- that's -- I -- I actually do like watching that on TV at Christmas time.  The whole parade.
R:  Well you know what?  Be lucky that you're home, [SIGH] because half the time these last couple of winters --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like when they had the lighting of the Christmas tree [SIGH] it was brutally cold.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  Yeah, I mean we've had brutally cold winters so far.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Like for the last two winters.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, well then maybe I don't want to.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um 
R:  So, maybe you'd better [LAUGH] still --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have a second guess about that, yeah?
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um, and then I guess -- so the other part of our question was, um, if we could create a holiday what would it be like and what would we celebrate?
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, I don't -- if you want to go first you can?  If not I'll go first.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know I was thinking like a soap opera holiday.  -- I'm-- I'm very into soap operas.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  And I thought it might -- I want some -- some type of soap opera holiday.
L:  [LAUGH]  Days of Our Lives?
R:  How did you guess?  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Ah, well that's my favorite.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Definitely.
L:  So, you would, um, watch your soaps all day?
R:  Oh, if I could, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and like especially old ones.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm a big Santa Barbara, Sunset Beach fan.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I know Santa Barbara too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Um, you know that's actually an interesting holiday.  Let's see.  If I could think of a holiday [NOISE] [SIGH] I would --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think it would be a chocolate holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, in celebration of chocolate I, um, [LAUGH] I really like chocolate.  I, um --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, you're not the only one.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- every time I'm out and about -- like when I was in New York I saw the Hershey store, I went in and bought a bunch of stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  Is there a Hershey store in New York?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's at Time Square.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah, it's kind of, ah,--
R:  Well, I've lived here all my life and I've never known there's a Hershey store in Ti- --
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's on the corner.  Like -- like I stayed, um, right by Broadway, ah, by the Majestic Theater [SIGH] and if I walked up towards Times Square and took a left towards the Olive Garden Restaurant it was down there right across from Olive garden.
R:  Oh, right across from Olive Garden?
L:  Uh-huh, the Olive Garden --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's kind of like in the middle of the street.
R:  Right.  Right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm aware of what -- and is that near the Crown Plaza Hotel?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is -- is that in the vic- -- I think it's in the vic- -- that's in the vicinity of -- ah, Olive Garden is in the vicinity of the, ah, [SIGH] the Crown Plaza Hotel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, my God, so you're kidding me it's Hershey -- it's called a Hershey store?
L:  Yeah, it's all Hersheys.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's so funny.  Th- oh, I've been here all my life --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I've never known that.  [SIGH]  Is it new?  Do you know if it's just opened or something?
L:  You know what I think -- I think it is new, um --
R:  Ah, maybe that's why?
L:  Yeah, I -- I mean I -- it definitely looked new but --
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I mean it, um -- you know, I've never heard of it being there before or anything and, um, [LIPSMACK] and it -- I -- I recently went to Hershey Park too --
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, which is -- which would [LAUGH] which would be part of my holiday chocolate festivities --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, it -- it was just like a little store from Hershey Park, so I wonder if they didn't recently --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  -- recently open it just because Hershey Park does so well?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  But, yeah, it's great so, you know, th- -- my day --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- would be spent in there, um, just eating all the chocolate.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  Um, and you know, ah, Hershey Park, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, like I said I just love chocolate so that would be my ideal -- may- maybe I could combine the soap opera with the chocolate holiday?  And --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH]  Eat the chocolate in front of the soap opera.  [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] but, ah, -- but yeah, I think the Hershey store is new, so it's -- it's right in Times Square.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, tha- thank you for informing me.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I had no idea.
L:  Yeah, you know what?  An- and actually right now I'm looking at my little souvenir from there.  I got a, um, -- [SIGH] it's like a silver, um, pail you know, like the old fashion milk pail?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And it says, um, Hersheys Times Square on it, and I got it filled with all different kinds of chocolate [SIGH] --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, so you know, maybe it is new because I've never seen this Hersheys Times Square before.
R:  [SIGH]  Huh, ah, okay, I'll have to keep that in mind.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, but -- yeah, that would be part of my ideal holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, and Hershey -- yeah, Hershey Park's great, actually if you -- if do like chocolate.  [SIGH]  But, um 
R:  Well, my only problem is I wouldn't like to go by myself.  I mean, I've always wanted to go there all my life, but I could never drag anybody with me.
L:  Yeah, um, [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that is hard but -- because I have nephews it makes it easier.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah, 'cause you know, they'll go anywhere.  [SIGH]  Ah, um [LAUGH] but I don't like the rides or anything you know, just the, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, no!  Oh, okay.
L:  No.  I don't -- I don't really -- the rides like you wait in line for hours before you get on the ride and it --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- just seems a waste of time.  [SIGH]  But, um, -- but the chocolate's great.  They actually [SIGH] -- they take you on a tour of the, um, of the ch- -- of the chocolate factory [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH].
L:  -- and, um, give out free samples and stuff.  And I -- I mean the whole place just smells like chocolate.  It -- it's really overload, but it's really nice.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH].  You should try to find a kid to take.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, that's not possible.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I understand.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE].  Wow!  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  So, I, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, yeah, anyway chocolate's my thing, so --
R:  So, like how far are you -- how far is Virginia from Pennsylvania?
L:  Oh, you know what it takes me about an hour and  fifteen minutes tops.
R:  Oh, I didn't know Virginia was so close to Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, where I'm --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- where I'm at in Virginia is actually right by the Pentagon.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, so it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- DC is within five miles; um, Maryland is within five miles; West Virginia's within [LIPSMACK] thirty five miles --
R:  Wow!  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Pennsylvania's like within sixty miles.
R:  So, you're like right in the middle?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- I mean it's a great location.  The only problem is, it's super expensive to live here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's -- it's -- it's hard to be single and live here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  But it -- I mean it's a great area.  Where in New York are you at?
R:  [NOISE]  Um, I'm in Queens.
L:  Okay.
R:  Queens that -- that's one of the five boroughs.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, I, um, I saw it on the map when I was there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  Wow!  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, our time [MN] should be up any moment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this -- is this the first call you've done?
R:  [NOISE]  No, second.
L:  Yeah, this is my second one too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, maybe the third will be tomorrow because my first was yesterday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, [SIGH] wouldn't that be great!
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yeah, I know it's a neat little program.
R:  [SIGH]  Because I didn't think I was going to get lucky.  [SIGH]  I thought that I would have -- 'cause they said if I get lucky, [MN] I might get one.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Or I might get two, but don't expect it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one yesterday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and we talked about the war in Iraq and, ah --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so when I got the call today I thought, "Well, maybe it'll be about the war again" but I was glad it was about --
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something fun like holidays.  [LAUGH]  Because I get tired of the war.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no!
L:  [LAUGH]  Ah, but, yeah, it's -- I -- I th- -- it's -- it's a neat little program.  I wish more places --
