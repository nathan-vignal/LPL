R:  My name is Pamela.
L:  Hi, Pamela, this is Robin.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, thanks.  Whe- -- where -- where am I calling today?  Where are we connected?
R:  This is New York.
L:  Oh, Los Angeles.
R:  Okay.
L:  The complete opposite.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  And so, what's our topic today?  Holidays?
R:  Holidays and if we have a favorite one, why and what is it, and why?  And if we could create one what would it be?
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, Pamela, you go first.
R:  Okay.  Um, my favorite holiday is Mothers' Day.
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  Then, [SIGH] I guess 'cause, um, the celebration of mothers and, um, I guess we do a lot of work and we -- a lot of hard work and we really don't get recognized for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to me --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that should be a day where you recognize all the mothers and the single mothers, if they're single mothers, and honor them for it.  For bringing up their kids, if -- if they did it in a right way. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, I agree.  So, when they said holidays for some reason I thought vacation.  [LAUGH] You know, I was going to say, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh, I'd love -- love to travel to France".  But okay, we -- they mean holidays, right?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  On the calender?
R:  I also found out who, um -- it turns out  that a woman, um, made up the holiday of Mothers' Day.  Her name was --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Anna Jarvis.
L:  Wow.  Hey, let me see wha- --
R:  And she was devoted to her mother and was concerned about the treatment the adult children gave to their elderly mothers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then her own mother died, she started writing letters to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- institute the celebration of mothers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in response to her request, it's Dr. Howard, a minister --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he dedicated a Sunday to mothers and specifically to Mrs. Jarvis.  And her favorite flower they said was carnations and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were supplied to the c- parishioners and that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what started the Mothers' Day practice.
L:  Wow, that's fascinating!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thanks for the information. [MN]
R:  Like, I was just curious, so I had a look. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, if I- -- if I'm curious for so- -- um, about something, I'll look it up as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess my favorite holiday would be ... hm ... Friendship Day.  You know, it's not celebrated as much as Christmas or New Years' Day.
R:  Right.
L:  And even New Years' Day, I like the renewal of friendships and the renewal of old friends and the gathering of new friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I just combined Friendship Day with New Years' Day.
R:  I never heard of that one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, Friendship Day is -- it's -- I don't -- I don't know what day it is, but I have a calender and it has all the holidays and I don't know if it's in March or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- April, but I've seen Friendship Day, Grandmas' Day, Secretaries' Day.  You know, the lesser known holidays.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'll -- I'll go for the underdog holidays.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Other than that, I -- I like Christmas.
R:  Right.
L:  And Easter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the usual holidays.
R:  Right.
L:  But if I had to create another holiday, I guess, it would just be -- it sounds almost sappish, but the day of love.  Where you give love to your fellow man.  'Cause I think --
R:  That sounds nice. [LAUGH]
L:  -- we have so much -- we have so much heartache in the world and -- and people need love.  They just need you to listen.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'd just create that, Love Day.
R:  Okay.  If I had to create one ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh boy. [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  [LAUGH] That's a tough one, isn't it?
R:  Well ... Oh no it's not!  No ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There would be a Deadbeat Dad Day.
L:  Oh!  Really?  How come we don't celebrate it? [LAUGH]
R:  That's what they should have, where they get all the deadbeat dads and place their pictures on the Internet --
L:  Okay, that's perfect.  
R: -- and on TV.
L:  We don't need to wait for a holiday for that one, Pamela, we should do that now.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Because my brother in law is a deadbeat dad --
R:  Well, that's what we have --
L:  -- he has three kids.
R:  -- that -- that -- that, they don't have a holiday for. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  They don't need to be celebrated but they just need to be caught.
R:  That's it.
L:  And they need to pay when they don't pay child support.
R:  They don't.
L:  You know?
R:  But, that's what we need --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a Deadbeat Dad holiday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm glad they're recording this, maybe they can put it into effect. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  We might want to say a few more things --
R:  Okay ...
L:  -- what else is on your mind, Pamela?
R:  Mhm.  No, that's about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I --
L:  W- --
R:  Well, there's other ones, I don't know if -- how they take too w- well. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's a study on the lingu- linguistics.  I think they're just listening for speech patterns, actually.
R:  Okay, um. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  There's -- there could be the, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] Biggest -- Biggest Bitch Day, which they don't have.
L:  [LAUGH] We can make up our own holiday --
R:  That's what I'm making u- --
L:  -- doesn't matter.
R:  No, it's what I'm making up.
L:  The sky is the limit. [LAUGH] So, dead --
R:  But I need a Deadbeat Dad Day, definitely.
L:  Deadbeat Dad Day, what else?
R:  Yeah.  I need a Biggest Bitch Day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That can be right after Mothers' Day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think we need a Childrens' Day, 'cause children need to be celebrated too.
R:  Yeah, they don't have a Childrens' Day, they need to have one of those.
L:  Yeah.  They need to celebrate children and to teach 'em that it's okay.  'Cause so many people -- so many children are missing as well. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  That's so sad, when children -- people steal other people's children [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just one of those thing, Pamela, what can I say?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  A No Homework Day.
L:  A No Homework Day!
R:  I need another one. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  If you have k- --
R:  I have a three and a thirteen year old, so, that would be very nice holiday to have.
L:  Yes, and homework is really for parents, isn't it?  It's not fair to kids.
R:  Terrible.
L:  [LAUGH] I think homework is designed so parents to spend more time with children, actually.
R:  Yeah, but it kills me [LAUGH] to be honest.
L:  [MN] I know, I have a sister who has three kids in school and she has to help them.  She's a single mother, she has to help them every night. 
R:  Yeah.
L:   She doesn't -- she never gets a break until I help her of course.  But it's terrible.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  You can't even plan anything if your kids have homework.
R:  No.
L:  You cannot go anywhere --
R:  'Cause you spend --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  But this year at leas- give -- give -- give us that one.
L:  Exactly, they should do something.  So, what else do you want to talk about, Pamela?  Hm ... holida- --
R:  Mm ... I'm thinking -- I'm trying to think here ... [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Okay, what about if you have to take a holiday, you know, go somewhere, where would you want to go?
R:  Where would I want to go on a holiday?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like to go and eat well, nah [MN] to me a holiday is when I get away from my kids, even if it's an hour or so.
L:  Well, that's good.  You know, a nice spa, a bubble bath.
R:  That's it.
L:  Uh, a makeover, makeup, hair, etcetera.  So, you don't get --
R:  That sounds good.
L:  -- you don't get time to do that, do you?
R:  Never, no.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, maybe if they're listening they'll send you a certificate to a spa!
R:  That would be nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Wouldn't that be great? [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, we just -- I'm -- I'm Jewish and my boyfriend's Catholic, so my second daughter who's three has to do the Easter eggs and I have to do the Passover, so it's very --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's tiring. [MN]
L:  You have to do -- yes, you have to do both of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know, I know what you mean.
R:  And then you have to try explain that, you know, what the eggs are for and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you have to try and explain Passover to them, which is even harder to me than to explain the, uh,  Easter [LAUGH] with the Easter eggs.
L:  Yes.  I know, I'm Catholic and my husband's Orthodoxy, so we celebrate two Easters as well.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause theirs is different.
R:  What's the --
L:  But it's --
R:  What's the difference?
L:  Um, well, they go for the Jul- -- go by the Julian calender and the Catholicism changed the calender from the days of Juliu- --
R:  Oh, so there -- there's two Easters?
L:  Yeah, there's two Easters.  One for Orthodox and one is for just the Christian.
R:  Right.
L:   Christian and Orthodox.  Which is a- actually very interesting.  I think Orthodoxy is a little more tradition than Catholicism, after growing up Catholic I can actually say that. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  But it's still the same thing, when Jesus was resurrected?
L:  Yeah, it's the same thing.  But it's just they have more of a show, more of a grandiose to it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Grandiosity to Orthodoxy.  It's -- it's actually interesting not knowing about it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- until I met him.  So, that's always fun.
R:  Well, at Passover we have to sit down at the table --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and there's this -- there's a big meal and you have to take -- eat, um, a- all the, uh, symbols of Passover meals that are told at the table.  Each of the foods they're symbolic.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like, there's bitter -- there's bitter herbs, they call that's the bitterness of slavery.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Matzah, which is the unleavened bread, 'cause they didn't have time to make leaven bread.  A bone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of lamb to show, um, some kind of a -- it's a sacrifice of a lamb.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have to have nuts and berries to represent mortar, greenery to represent life --
L:  Really?
R:  -- salty water to represent the slaves' tears.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you gotta eat the food in a certain order.
L:  Wow!
R:  And then you have to discuss the meaning of the food.
L:  Oh, that's interesting too!
R:  And pray, and pray.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And by the time you finish [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, you are tired [LAUGH].
L:  You're tired and stuffed?
R:  Yes.  And stuffed, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's always interesting, to learn about other cultures.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love that.  So, if you have your fantasy holiday, Pamela, where would you go?  Would you go to the old country, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- LA, California?  Where would you go?
R:  I would want to go to California.
L:  Really?
R:  I'm very, um, well, I want to go to see the -- I'm very into watching my, uh, Port Charles and General Hospital.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I'd like to see the studio tour.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's interesting.  I mean, I grew up in Los Angeles, been here all my life.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's -- people come here from all over the country, it's amazing.
R:  That's the only thing I want to go, just to see that -- to see General Hospital studio --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  and the Ge- -- and the Port Charles. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I haven't seen General Hospital in a couple of years.  What's happening now?  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I've taped it, but I haven't actu- -- it's on and off that I watch it.  They were all --
L:  [MN]
R:  --  getting boring --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't know.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I've been doing surveys --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and online stuff and trying to make money more than watching TV. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  When I was watching General Hospital they were on the -- Luke and Laura first got together and then I didn't watch it for years.  And now, I think they're back on, aren't they?
R:  They're back on, but she's in a mental institution.
L:  Really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, because she had a -- she wanted to quit, so then I guess --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they didn't know where to put her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But she's supposedly in a mental institution and not coming out.
L:  Wow!
R:  And that's it. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess they didn't know where to put her, like you said.
R:  That's it. [LAUGH] Nowhere to put her [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] Make her crazy --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- if you don't know what to do with a character, just make her crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds strange.
R:  Right.
L:  So, Pamela, how's your day going?
R:  Okay.  
L:  It's going okay?
R:  And I never knew that they had, uh, a holiday associated to the Last Supper.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do they?
R:  Yeah.
