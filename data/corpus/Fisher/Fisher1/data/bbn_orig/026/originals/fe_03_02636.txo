R:  [MN]  Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, hi.
R:  This is Dick.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Dick, this is Ryan.
R:  Ryan?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, I guess our topic is [PAUSE] should we disarm Iraq or not?
L:  [LAUGH]  Seems like, sort of, ah, a moot question at this point.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they have weapons but I don't think they have weapons of mass destruction.
L:  You don't think they do?
R:  No, I don't.  [SIGH]  They never found any, anyway.  
L:  Yeah, I just -- I guess I -- I still -- I still harbour th- -- the belief that they're -- that they're there somewhere and while --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we haven't found them yet I'm sure that now that we're in -- 
R:  Well, I think the only way --
L:  -- the active pitching phase --
R:  -- they're gonna be there is if we plant 'em there.
L:  You think that we would plant them there?
R:  We have to do something to justify ourself.
L:  So, you don't think we were justified going over there in the first place?
R:  Not for weapons of mass destruction.   [SIGH]  [PAUSE] 
L:  Be --
R:  Nobody's ever found any over there in the -- in the last recent years.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
L:  And [SIGH] -- well, I -- I -- I know they've certainly found evidence th- -- that, or certainly Iraq has not produced any that they've --
R:  -- they had 'em fifteen years ago.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they had 'em back then and they haven't produced any evidence to show that that they got rid of them.  So, I guess the assumption is that they -- that they still have 'em there but, you're right, they certainly haven't come up with the smoking gun per se that I think a lot of people have been [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- waiting and waiting and waiting for them to come up with.  They've found [SIGH] you know, it almost seems like every time they find --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- you hear on the news that they find something that may be -- something that may be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it turns out that it's not.  So, I can certainly understand why there are a lot of people who are saying, "Okay.  [LAUGH]  That's why we went over there.  How come you haven't found any yet?"
R:  [SIGH]  Well, that was a moot question right now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we've already conquered 'em.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  And I -- I know a- -- another question that I've her- -- heard come up is whether or not now --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that -- that we're there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if we should be the ones who are continuing the search or the UN --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- should be [SIGH] allowed ta -- to come in and continue the search for that.  What do you -- what do you think about that, or do you think since -- since you don't think they're there anyway, I guess it's [LAUGH] sort of a -- a [LAUGH] moot point that way too?
R:  I don't care who does it.  When they look for ma- -- weapons of mass destruction I don't care who does it.
L:  [SIGH]  Do you think that, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- -- based on the -- the initial reaction and some of the subsequent reaction of -- of the Iraqi people celebrating in the streets, welcoming the United States --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- knocking over the statue of Saddam --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that that was a good enough reason to go in there ta -- to liberate them from -- from --
R:  That would not have been a justifiable reason to start with.
L:  You don't think so?
R:  Just to go in to throw Saddam out?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  What about Syria where they got a [NOISE] damn -- a despot?
L:  [LAUGH]  Ye- --
R:  Are we going to go in there and throw him out too?
L:  It is -- it is kind of interesting where we -- we, ah, pick our dictators that we like and pick the ones that we don't like, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of strangely, because they do much the same stuff in Syria.  They do much the same stuff in North Korea.  They do much the same stuff in -- in China.  Yet, somehow --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it -- it's [LAUGH] this country that we've gone in to do it, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you -- you make a good point.
R:  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I was for peace but, ah, I -- I back the military.  [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  I'll back the military but I'm not going to back the politics of 'em.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I guess -- [SIGH]  I guess I'm -- I'm m- more along the lines of -- of after -- e- -- especially after hearing th- -- the terrible and awful things that -- that he did to the people of his country there and the way that he ruled them so mercilessly, it certainly make sense that he's gone but [SIGH] I think the people who raise the question then, "Why don't you take care of dictators everywhere?" certainly have a valid point, although [COUGH] I don't know, it seems like with some of the other nations, e- -- even though they -- they rule with an iron fist, there is a little bit -- [MN] I guess a little bit more of the regular diplomacy when they're dealing with the United States.
R:  That's what they said about Syria.  They said Syria is a -- is a dictatorship [PAUSE] --
L:  I guess that --  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, ah, they say that that's more -- more of a [PAUSE] um, um, ah -- now, how should I put it?  That's more of a, um, PG type thing compared to Iran.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] that's -- that's an excellent way to put it -- an excellent way to put it.  They're different -- dic- -- I guess there are nice dictators and there are mean dictators --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and because we go after the mean dictators an- -- and leave the nice dictators alone.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Do you have any concern that -- that now that we've gotten ourselves into Iraq an- -- and started looking there an --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and have -- have already mentioned that we're unhappy with -- with what Syria --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- is doing and that we think that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they have some weapons of mass destruction or, at least, were helping Iraq with theirs, or helping them get rid of theirs, do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have any concerns that we're just gonna keep on rolling and say, "Okay, what country is next?" and just -- just, ah, keep getting our country to -- 
R:  I don't know what's gonna happen, I tell ya.  I really don't.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [PAUSE]  I really don't know what's gonna happen.
L:  Well, it -- it -- it certainly --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it certainly is potentially a --
R:  [NOISE]  I think we have more concerns with our economy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- than we have with these d- -- dictators.
L:  That's -- that's very true -- it -- it certainly [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Now, they -- they ignored this North Korean thing and now that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a nuclear country.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Who knows, maybe they'll drop an +atomic bomb on San Francisco or so --
L:  [LAUGH]  Wow.  [LAUGH]  That would -- that would not be good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, well, I wouldn't -- that's something they probably would do.  Um, they're -- they're really crazy there.  They're almost as crazy as Bush.
L:  [LAUGH]  You think Bush is that crazy?  I -- I take it you didn't vote for him in the last election?
R:  I voted for him.  I supported him.
L:  Really?
R:  I was for him.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.
R:  [SIGH]  But, ah, he's come on here like, um, Hitler or something.  It's like he's lost his mind.
L:  Wow.
R:  I think anyway.
L:  Do you think that that's just -- that's just recently that, ah -- I mean --
R:  Just in the last year or so --
L:  -- just w- with his --
R:  -- yeah, after Afghanistan.
L:  After September eleventh almost?
R:  No, after Afghanistan.
L:  Ah.
R:  Afghanistan made sense to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because this Iraq thing doesn't make any sense.  But I -- I support the military.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't support the politics of it.
L:  [SIGH]  Do you find that's hard when you have conversations with people in trying to make that distinction where [COUGH] you know, you're -- you're trying to say that you don't support the reason that -- that you're there but you do support all the people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who are there.  It's very easy for someone who doesn't understand your position to just label you as unpatriotic and, "How could you do that?  How could you think that?  You're hurting our efforts".  [SIGH]  Do you find that -- i- -- is that something that you -- that you've run into when you've talked about this issue with other people?
R:  [SIGH]  I don't talk about it usually.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  No, I supported the military.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  And once it was started I was supporting the military in my mind.  I would talk about that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I want the Army, Navy, Airforce, Marines, ah, whoever's involved that way to do well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And +now, ah, do a good job.  [SIGH]  But to get involved with the politics and that is crazy.
L:  [SIGH]  I guess they've [SIGH] -- they've got to follow the orders --
R:  Of the --
L:  -- regardless of wh- -- whether [LAUGH] they like 'em or not?
R:  Right.  So, that -- that -- that -- they're not -- they're not nuts.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- I -- I -- I thought it was interesting that it was -- what just yesterday, that Bush came on and did his national address and, you know, basically kind of said, "Well, the war's over" and it seems to me like there is -- [SIGH] there's still a lot of fighting yet to be done.  Not necessarily, I guess, the -- m- -- military fighting, but they've got a lot of work to do there if they're going to win over, you know --
R:  I'm -- I'm --
L:  -- the hearts and minds of a lot of the Iraqi people.
R:  -- a sort[?] of Clinton supporter.  I think that, ah, he's right.  [SIGH]  Instead of rebuilding Iraq we ought to be concerned about our own country.  Re- -- rebuilding our own country.
L:  Right.
R:  Our schools are -- are needing help.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  That's -- yeah -- ah --
R:  Why are we spending all this money on Iraq?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  How many billions are they talking about?  A hundred billion to s- -- rebuild Iraq?
L:  I don't know if it's that much but it's --
R:  Or, two billion a week or two billion a day, or something?
L:  I -- I don't think it's that much a day but it's --
R:  It's two billion a week maybe?
L:  Yeah, it's definitely a -- a big chunk a change and it's certainly a good argument --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, my gosh that could -- there are -- there are hundreds of thousands of people who are out of work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- here in the US, or who go to schools where the buildings are falling down and [SIGH] and -- and [SIGH] why don't they deserve [LAUGH] a little chunk of that before -- before it goes off being spent somewhere else?
R:  [COUGH]  I don't think he's going to be reelected to tell you the truth.
L:  Really?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Boy, he's got high approval ratings.
R:  [SIGH]  I don't --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- I don't think the people will vote for him.
L:  Really?
R:  If they want the -- if they want the economy to continue the way it is.  [SIGH]
L:  Do you think that will be the -- the deciding factor?  [NOISE]
R:  Definitely.  We're concerned about our own selves.  We're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- concerned about Iraq.
L:  I guess what was the slogan that they used in the -- what was it the nineteen ninety two election with, ah -- with Clinton and the other Bush.  "It's the economy, stupid".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  It still is.
R:  Of course it depends on who the Democratic re- candidate is.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  If they don't have a candidate that can do it.  [SIGH]  I imagine I'm just going to stay out of it and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I'll vote for whoever.  I don't know.  [PAUSE]  But, ah, somebody has to have the strength to turn this economy aroun-
