L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
R:  Hi, I'm Rita. [LAUGH]
L:  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, fine. [LAUGH] Ah, what's your favorite holiday? [MN]
L:  Um, probably, oh, I don't know.  Uh, I like Halloween a lot.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's unusual.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I suppose so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Why -- why do you like Hall- --
L:  I'm still a kid at heart maybe.
R:  [LAUGH] Why do you like Halloween a lot? [MN] 
L:  Um, oh, I don't know.  It -- because it's just fun.  You know, there aren't supposed to be any deep meanings there.  It's [NOISE] just a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- fun holiday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Just a day to have a fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Kids run out and get candy and adults dress up and go out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  In costumes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, that's a good one. [MN] 
L:  [MN]
R:  My favorite one is Christmas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, because, uh, that's when the family is sure to get together. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  And [NOISE] it's fun too.  You know, you get to watch kids open their gifts and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It has a lot of meaning too.  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, obviously.
R:  Of course. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, you know, I think i- in addition, uh, to the religious aspects, I think it brings the family so much closer.  You know, when they -- when they, um, celebrate it, so ...
L:  Right. 
R:  If you could create one what would it be? [SIGH] 
L:  I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was thinking about that and I thought, "I don't know".  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  Do you have any answers for that? [LAUGH]
R:  Not really.  Um, [MN] I don't know, I -- I just want to celebrate, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something where everybody could get together and have fun and, you know, be peaceful. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe World Peace Day or something? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  That would be good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And maybe to do it you could have, um, like, international foods and dancers, you know.
L:  [MN] Yeah, [MN] yeah. 
R:  Something like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kinda -- that's kinda s- --
L:  I work at a university so they have stuff like that there.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, international days.
R:  That's what gave me the ideas because I -- [MN] at one of the colleges I went to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they had international, ah, [MN] International something Day.  Anyhow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they had all the different flags and all the different foods and then, um, [MN] uh, native dress and all that and the dancers.  But you know what, that would be kinda hard on an individual basis to do.
L:  Yeah, well, maybe not that much, really.  You just need a [NOISE] cookbook and [LAUGH] um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess.  I -- well, I guess --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- you couldn't do --
R:  -- you know what it could be?  It could be Heritage Day.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  In other --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R: -- words a day that you celebrate your own heritage and you have -- you know, you read stories from that, or like, for instance, I'm part American Indian, [MN] okay, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, make Indian dishes and read stories to the kids about their heritage.  That way they could learn more about their heritage.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, although that'd probably be hard for a lot of people because a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people are big mutts, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I am too.  I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a Heinz fifty seven myself.  But --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:   I'm, like, I'm one quarter Indian and I'm one quarter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Yugoslavian and the other half is Heinz fifty seven, English, Irish, Dutch, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But even if you have Heritage Day where they could celebrate, you know, one aspect of their heritage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or even being American.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like have apple pie and [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Watch baseball, well, I don't wanna watch baseball but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, something like that.  Or discuss, you know, different things about the American heritage, because that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- incorporates all --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  -- of it.
L:  -- that's true.
R:  [MN] But maybe an American Heritage Day, you know, 'cause, like, Independence Day isn't really that. [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  Memorial Day isn't, Labor Day isn't.  You know, they're all federal holidays you fly the flag, but it's not really getting to the root of your own heritage.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  So, maybe that would be a good one.
L:  Yeah.  I have an Irish grandmother so, uh [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we -- we would always do big things, ah --
R:  On Saint Patrick's Day, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  So, at least the Irish have that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  I think that probably was because there was so many that came over.  You know, there was more Irish than --
L:  Right.
R: -- American way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back then in -- in New York and stuff, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Right, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, ah, that's probably why they [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Probably.
R:  -- they were able to do that.  And everybody wants to be Irish on Saint Patrick's Day.
L:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I -- I do have a part that's Irish but it's in that Heinz fifty seven.  I don't really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know how much of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  [MN] Yeah, supposedly I'm a direct descendent of Pocahontas.
R:  Oh, really?  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] So, I -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- how true that is I -- I never know about these, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- these family trees that people make.  But supposedly, uh, you know, I have an aunt who went back and through the entire family trees and found it, so I don't know.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whether it is or not, it's still neat. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] It's a neat thing to believe anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  With mine, I know my grandfather on my m- mother's side was, um, on the Trail of Tears, so I know it's Cherokee.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay?  And my older sister knows more about it but she hasn't told me.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I've tried to do some research on it and I haven't found it. [MN] But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, [inaudible].  Anyhow, that's how I know that.  And then I -- I had a job where I traveled a lot and one of the places we went was on the Cherokee reservation.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And so I got the books that have the, um, the seven signs and the, um, [MN] the Cherokee language.  It was almost extinct.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I got the book of that, the primer of it, just little things, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it meant a lot of me, so ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But anyhow, for holidays --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's a good idea, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, th- that question reminded me, do you -- do you ever watch Seinfeld?
R:  Uh, once in a while.
L:  Yeah, there's an episode of that where George's father makes up their own holiday called Festivus.
R:  [MN]
L:  And that question [LAUGH] really reminded --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- me of that episode.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's probably where they got it from. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  That's possible.
R:  'Cause -- 'cause that's not something you normally think about, if you could create a holiday --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause there's so many holidays.
L:  Right, absolutely, yeah.
R:  You know.  That's why I like Christmas, 'cause it's kind of all together, you know?  I mean, Thanksgiving is good too [MN] --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- but Christmas is more celebrated by more people in more ways.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's interesting to see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, how different people celebrate it.  Some don't celebrate it, that's true.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Um, but, uh, I think it's interesting and it -- it does bring the family together.  Like, if they can't make it for Thanksgiving they'll be sure to make it for Christmas, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I have seven children and they're scattered all over the US, so ...
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They're all grown with families of their own, so [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, it's hard for 'em to all get in one place at one time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... but this Christmas I saw every one of 'em, even though for Christmas itself I went down to Missouri for -- with my son. [MN] 
L:  Oh, what part of Missouri?
R:  Uh, near St Louis, Wright City. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah, I used to live in St Louis.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  You weren't that far from him then.  I think he's, what, maybe fifty miles outside of it, or something?
L:  Yeah?  Yeah.  What town does he live in?
R:  Wright City
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah.  I've been there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I lived in the city, so ... [SIGH] but I -- I've moved since. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, since then? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I lived there for about seven years.
R:  Oh, wow. [MN]
L:  [PAUSE] [NOISE]
R:  So, um, you say Halloween's your favorite.  What's your second favorite? [MN]
L:  Um, [MN] you know, there are a lot of the little ones that I really like.  I'm -- for instance, I'm really fond of Arbor Day.  [MN] Um, because, you know, it's a nice little holiday, plant a tree. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.  It's a nice --
L:  Um --
R:  -- peaceful little thing and it does good.
L:  Yeah.  Um, Labor Day I think is a fantastic concept, although I don't think we do it as we should, probably. [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  Most people --
L:  You know.
R:  -- don't really understand what it's about.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  You know, just the idea that we should all take, you know, a day out in the year to think about what we do other than work, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  To realize --
R:  Reflect on it.
L:  -- that there's more to life than that. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Nobody ever said they worked too much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or -- or -- no -- nobody ever --
L:  Didn't work enough, I think. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- said they didn't work enough, right. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  I had that one wrong, didn't I?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Um, although I've met a few people who probably could say that, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, the first one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know a lot did. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, that -- I like that too because it celebrates the workers themselves and gives them a break, you know.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  That's if the employers let them, [LAUGH] 'cause not all of them let 'em off for that day. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I don't know how --
R:  So ...
L:  -- many places do, but ...
R:  [MN] I mean, like you said, they don't do it as they should many times.  And same --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with Memorial Day.  I mean, I remember as a kid that [MN] these holidays were really done up good, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, parades and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Ah, everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Parades everywhere, every city had a parade.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Now, they're few and far between, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you find 'em, but it's like pulling teeth, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  People just catch up on housework those days, I think. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  And they hibernate. [MN]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And the other thing is, like Fourth of July, I remember the parades with that.  Anybody with a bike or anything like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that wanted to be in the parade, they could.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And, uh, it was so much more.  Every city had one for them --
