R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hello, my name is Mickey Brown and this is my first call and I think I missed the first thing that [SIGH] the voicemail told me about holidays, so I need that to be repeated please?  Thank you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Hi, I'm, ah, Chip Hamlet --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- um, a student at Columbia College.
R:  Hi, Chip.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I'm s- say -- say your name again?
R:  Mickey Brown.
L:  Nicky, hi.  Ah --
R:  Mickey, as in Mouse.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah -- oh, o- oh, Mickey, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, Mickey.  [LAUGH]  I thought so.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do -- do you have a favorite holiday?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, yes, I'm Jewish.  My favorite holiday is Passover.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay, it's not -- is it because [NOISE] of the food or because of [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]  You know Jewish people, right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it was because I have very fond memories growing up of [SIGH] with a large --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm an only child but I had, ah, my dad had [PAUSE] six brothers and one sister.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And every Passover all his [NOISE] brothers and sister and children who were old enough to know how to behave at a table [SIGH] would gather at my grandmother and grandfather's house for the Passover dinner called a Seder [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and I know that was the one time of the year, no matter who couldn't come to other family get togethers, everybody was there.  [SIGH]  And it was so joyous and so many good memories and [SIGH] my New Year began.  My personal New Year was not December thirty first or January first, [SIGH] my personal beginning of the year was at Passover time, [SIGH] which is a different date every year according to the Jewish calendar.  [MN]
L:  Oh, okay.  I didn't realize that.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I -- it comes around Easter, you know, it can be a week or two before, a week or two after, sometimes right on the nose of Easter.  [MN]
L:  Oh, I see.  I see.  [SIGH]  Well, being -- being -- being genteel --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- my, ah --
R:  Genteel.  That's very good.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my, ah, [LAUGH] my favorite holiday was -- was always -- was always Christmas for selfish reasons, but ah [SIGH] --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- I think since that may have changed because it's kinda lost --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, it's kinda -- it's kind of lost it's significance for me and I don't -- I don't go to church that much any more either so 
R:  I think Christmas -- for mo- for most non-Jewish people is a favorite --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- time of the year.  [SIGH]  Whether it's ah, -- ah, you know, ah, me, me, me type of thing -- gift or whatever.  I think the birth of Jesus was a very important event.  [SIGH]  And I think, you know, a lot of people have lost the sight of that in terms of gifts --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- it's become so commercialized.  [NOISE]
L:  Certainly.  Certainly.  I definitely [NOISE] agree.
R:  [COUGH].  I remember signing autographs --
L:  All right.
R:  -- ah, autograph books when I was in school [SIGH] ah, I don't think they have autograph books any more, but every one in school had one.  [SIGH]  And I remember signing, ah, [SIGH] "Roses are red.  [PAUSE] --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- ah, roses are red, violets are bluish, if it weren't for Jesus we'd all [LAUGH] be Jewish".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that great?  [LIPSMACK]
L:  That's funny.  That's funny.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not sure that I understood at the time, but I knew it was humorous.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's great.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Roses are red, violets are bluish, if it weren't for Jesus we'd all be Jewish".
L:  Be Jewish.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean that was -- that -- that's an original.
R:  I don't know if it's an original or not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I must have heard it somewhere.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think I was that bright enough as a child to make that [LAUGH] up.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I mean I -- it would never have [PAUSE] dawned on me to make fun of Jesus, so I -- I don't -- you know, it's not making fun of Jesus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just a humorous --
L:  No.  No, I know.
R:  -- it's like the old Polack jokes [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not that I didn't like Polacks or anything [LAUGH] or that Polish people are dumb but the jokes were so damn funny.  [LAUGH]
L:  And all -- I mean all of the -- the Jewish people that I've ever known have had such a -- a good sense of humor, too.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, that is one of the two things w- why the Jewish people have survived all the horrors that they've lived through.  [SIGH]  One is an adherence to their faith [LIPSMACK] and the second is a great sense of humor, usually, self-deprecating.  An- and one of my favorite things I've got is a picture frame -- little things I've cut out from here and there and I just mentioned it to a brother in law whom I haven't talked to in two years [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves [LAUGH] for they shall never cease to be amused".  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And Jews have that quality of being able to laugh at themselves, you know.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] it's so important.
R:  Yeah, really.  Yes, now what can I do for you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well I guess -- I guess we kinda -- we went off topic here, didn't we?  I'm trying to think [SIGH] I'm trying to think if I could create a holiday what it would be.  Ah, [LIPSMACK] just -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK]  You are --
L:  -- I -- I -- I'm thinking that-- I'm thinking I would -- rather than creating a new one, I would take an old one and kinda redefine its meaning or something.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Such as?  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  Maybe take --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- Valentine's Day and make it less materialistic or something.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, [SIGH] --
L:  You know, make it -- you know, never mind the -- the candies and the -- the flowers, you know --
R:  Yeah, well they've all become so commercial.  I'd have a totally different take on that.  [SIGH]  Which we try to -- should be doing and I think we try to do it there might be [COUGH], excuse me, a holiday.  [SIGH]  You know, a love thy neighbor holiday.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Love thy neighbor as thyself, which [SIGH] I mean you have to.  The world is so small and everybody is a human being.  It doesn't matter -- th- that -- that skin tones are different or that [SIGH] you approach, ah, religion in a different way because -- ah, actually all religions are just different streets.  I -- I may take a main street to get to where I want to go, which is probably heaven, and you might take [SIGH] Fourteenth Street [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and someone else takes this boulevard and someone else takes that --
L:  But it's the same -- it's the same -- [several inaudible words]
R:  -- pike and we're all going the same way, we're just taking different directions [LAUGH] to get there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I -- I would -- I would like to see a three hundred and sixty five year holiday awareness of love thy neighbor as thyself.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right and just kind of -- kind of a --
R:  And do unto others.
L:  -- and you could even make a kind of ah, a -- a Christian, ah --
R:  Judeo?
L:  -- Judeo, Islam, kind of you know.
R:  Right.  Everybody.  Moslems, blacks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whites, Chinese, polka dots, [SIGH] ah, I mean, I do believe -- somewhat, I never thought about it really, in the Ten Commandments.  Ah, I mean I think I live the Ten Commandments, generally.  I mean, I'm sure I've bent a few.  [SIGH]  Ah, but to me there's only one.  Those Ten Commandments boil down to one [SIGH] and that is do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  That's really what it's all about.
L:  Right.  We have golden -- golden rule day, or golden rule week, even better.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, right.  Hey, we -- we get along well together, Chip.
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  [PAUSE]  And, ah, let's see.  Wow.  [PAUSE]  If I -- I was gonna -- another one [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- I don't know.  Another one that I -- I would like to see -- and this is because and you -- you may not agree with this but, ah, [NOISE] I would kinda like to see ah [NOISE] Malcolm X's birthday recognised just because [NOISE] --
R:  Are you a black person?  [MN]
L:  I'm not actually but --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, you don't -- you don't sound black but I was going to say that's interesting if you're a white [SIGH] that you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have that take, yeah.
L:  And the reason is because he -- you know, I mean he started out so -- you know, militant and you -- you know, anti -- anti [PAUSE] white maybe but he kind of [PAUSE] com- made a complete one eighty, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  Soft -- he softened.
L:  Right.  And he, ah, you know, eventually embraced -- embraced everybody --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and [NOISE] I think that -- I think that speaks a lot about him that he was able to make that kind of change --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Maturity --
L:  -- in his life.
R:  -- changes people a lot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Chip, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Where we were so [SIGH] ah, gung ho at one point at this -- a- -- at this d- degree --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, of a circle, you know, at one eighty, and then do a complete one eighty, [SIGH] I mean to me that's usually a sign of maturation.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Yeah.
R:  I mean as for -- it can go the other way too.  Look at the Ku Klux Klan.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  By the way are all these conversations as interesting an- and back and forthy as ours has been?  [MN]
L:  Oh, this -- I don't know, this is my first one too.  [NOISE]  This is my first one -- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, we're both virgins to this --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that's great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you're a student and I'm seventy seven.  [LAUGH]
L:  You're seventy seven?  You don't sound seventy seven at all.
R:  Yeah, yeah, just a couple of days ago.
L:  You sound -- you sound just like -- you sound a lot like my mom actually and she's fifty four.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I've been told that before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I don't look my age either and I also, ah [NOISE] [SIGH] I have, ah, I come from Detroit, Michigan and I moved away in nineteen eighty seven and I'm now in Nashville, Tennessee, with stops in Chicago and California in between.  [SIGH].  But in Detroit I had -- I taught folk guitar [MN] and I had a --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a folk -- a folk music group that sang in nine languages, international folk songs, [SIGH] and now --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I -- I play, ah, for the last few years, self taught ukulele and I'm really good at it [SIGH] and I love those razzmatazz songs of the twenties and thirties and I do that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as a part time, ah, [SIGH] career at nursing homes and, ah, [SIGH] and, ah, [SIGH] assisted living residences and retirement [LIPSMACK] places.
L:  So, you're very -- you're very much doing ex- exactly what you want to be doing. 
R:  You know --
L:  That's so refreshing to hear.
R:  -- you are -- you are very smart 'cause there are some other things that I just read to my brother in law about [SIGH] ah, you have to find something you love to do and you'll never have to work [PAUSE] a day in your life.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I don't consider what I do work, although I wouldn't want to do it forty hours, or I'd probably lose my enthusiasm for it, but I've been doing this for nine years [SIGH] and every time it's like it's fresh the first time, because I love all those old songs, and I love the ukulele.  [SIGH]  I love tweaking the memories of these elderly people and believe me, [SIGH] I am older than some of the people that I play for in nursing homes too.
L:  That's what I'm -- right, that's what I'm thinking.  That must be --
R:  Well, it keeps you young.
L:  -- that must be [NOISE] really strange?
R:  Yeah, it really it really is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you know, ah, I used to be very proud of telling people my age, but I'm a little more careful now [SIGH] because a lot of people who are younger than I am, I can see that I might make them feel badly, you know, because I'm very vital [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, I -- I'm s- --
L:  Well, I -- I don't know that's -- I don't think that's any reason to spare anybody I mean --
R:  Well, there's no reason --
L:  -- if anything I -- I would think it would be an inspiration for people to -- to live, ah, a healthier -- a healthier more mentally active life, you know?
R:  Yeah, like a role model.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I mean I think that has a lot to do with -- to do with people kind of, [PAUSE] in old age, kind of, you know, senility and things like that as people don't -- don't keep their minds active.
R:  Yeah.  Well, some people can't help it that their minds begin to disappear.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.
R:  I know my memory is having a hard time --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- [SIGH] hanging in there [LIPSMACK] but, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't know I feel it's like [PAUSE] bragging in a way, you know, if someone says, "How old are you?"  I --
