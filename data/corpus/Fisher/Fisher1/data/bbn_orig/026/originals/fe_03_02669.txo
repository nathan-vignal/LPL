R:  Hi, I'm Rachel.
L:  Hi, Rachel, I'm Mike.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].  So, the topic of the day is --
R:  I missed half of the topic, yeah, 'cause my phone is going in and out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, like it's holiday.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, like, what, um --
R:  In general?
L:  -- what's our favorite holiday and why.
R:  Okay.
L:  Rachel?
R:  Yes?
L:  Oh, okay.  I didn't know if you were still there.
R:  Yeah.  Favorite holiday, they said?
L:  Yeah.  I guess the first part about it was what's our first fav- -- er, what's our favorite holiday and why.
R:  Okay.  Do you wanna go first, or ... ?
L:  [LAUGH] No.  You go first. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.  Um, m favorite holiday is, I don't know, I guess, Christmas.
L:  Okay.  Why?
R:  And ...  Just because I think, like, my family didn't do much for it when I was younger. [LAUGH] So, now that I'm older and I do m- -- like, it's a much more festive season.  So, it's kinda like I'm in control of the Christmas I wanted.  So, I guess that, I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not a big holiday person.
L:  [LAUGH] Me neither, but I guess if I had to pick my favorite holiday, it would be probably Saint Patrick's Day.
R:  Really?  So, you're Irish?
L:  Yeah.  Not at all.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  But on Saint Patrick's Day I tend to, uh, go to a lot of Irish pubs and drink a lot of green beer.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, basically I'm from Detroit and for some reason it's just that has become like a huge, huge thing there. Where --
R:  Are there are a lot of Irish people in Detroit?
L:  Um, I don't think so, but for some reason everybody just kinda tends to start early in the morning at seven o'clock and start drinking green beer all the way through.  And it -- it's just one giant party throughout the whole city.
R:  See, that's funny.
L:  Like, everybody takes off from work.
R:  [MN] Yeah, 'cause I'm in New York where there's a ton of Irish people and people can't take off from work.  Like, if anything, it's the weekend closest, you go out to beers -- uh, to bars, but they don't even do green beer anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's really funny that Detroit's, like, kinda run with it. [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- I -- I hated, I mean, I'm out in LA now, but [LAUGH] uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we're on opposite ends of the coast.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, yeah, back when I was in Detroit, that was -- that was probably my favorite holiday, and that's why.  But it -- it's just, there was a big huge party that the whole entire city seemed to celebrate and that's, you know, I like things like that.
R:  Right.  Well, that sounds cool.
L:  You have that in New York everyday.
R:  Um, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so.  I don't know, I think New York's kind of, like, overrated [LAUGH] as this party and, like, exciting place and people come together, but I don't think it's like that as much anymore.
L:  Hm.  Well --
R:  Okay, so is that --
L:  -- you have to change that.
R:  What?
L:  You have to change that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, anyways, the second part of the theme that we had was, um, we had -- if we could create our own holiday what would it be, or something like that.
R:  Okay, this is like a college application essay topic. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, yeah.  It seems like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Like, yesterday I got one completely current event and this one's kinda goofy.  Um ... yeah.  Hm. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, what would be your creat- created holiday?
R:  [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not really sure.  Um, [LAUGH] let's see.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Don't look for me to --
R:  I mean, I think --
L:  -- fill in because I'm just --
R:  -- Hallmark has already --
L:  -- as stumped as you.
R:  --created every holiday, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  I don't know if there's any left [LAUGH].  Um ...
L:  I know, it seems like there's a holiday every week, or something.
R:  There really is.  'Cause I used to teach and they'd give you this calendar of, like -- so you could celebrate everything with your kids so they'd have this worldly thing.  And if you really start looking into Secretary Day and Ice Cream Week, there's really a holiday everyday [LAUGH] designated by some organization.  Um, let's see, if I could do a holiday ...
L:  That's hard for either one of us, 'cause neither one of us are holiday people.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess, like, wh- -- it would be completely non secular so everybody could actually celebrate and nobody would be left out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Hm.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's kind of hard because if you're doing it in honor of an occasion, it's probably already [LAUGH] been invented. [MN] So, uh ...
L:  I -- it -- it's, like  -- for, like, you know, you said they've all been done.  They're all there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  I mean, um ... Definitely for me it'd be something where it's definitely a party, a celebration for everybody.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I kinda tend to take part in everybody's holidays. [LAUGH] It's g- --
R:  [LAUGH] Anything to drink and have fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Cinco de Mayo coming up on Monday.
R:  [LAUGH] God, do you have that in your l- -- ta- -- uh, circled on your calendar? [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, [PAUSE] yeah, maybe it'd --
L:  Hm.  It's a --
R:  -- be nice if there was, like, a stay in bed day.  Where you just, kinda, [LAUGH] stay in bed all day and then wake up --
L:  There you go.
R:  -- late and go out. [MN]
L:  I -s, okay.  Y- I went to camp up in Canada and we had this thing called The Z Machine, whenever it was raining.  Yeah, and y- -- that's exactly what we did.  We'd stay in the cabin and just, you know, read comic books, whatever.
R:  Oh, that's pretty neat.
L:  Play cards.
R:  Yeah, like, 'cause, you know, people don't take enough leisure time.  So, maybe it would be a forced leisure time holiday.
L:  There we go, Z Machine holiday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Just everybody, just sits, chills with the family, just really doesn't do much of anything.
R:  Right, you know, make sure all those workaholic dads and moms stay home with their kids for a day and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Just, no business, nothing, just the whole country --
R:  You know, the phone company --
L:  -- just, kinda --
R:  -- would shut down phone service. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  You can't be interrupted.
L:  No phone calls.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No emergencies, no hospitals.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So true.  I mean, what could really happen if everyone's in bed? [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah, just -- just -- everybody just stays at home and does nothing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then we can deal with everything the next day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Don't think it would work but --
R:  You know, if your bills were due, they're not that day. [LAUGH]
L:  Nope.
R:  It's [inaudible] Stay In Bed Day.
L:  Stay In Bed Day, there we go.  
R:  Oh ... [MN]
L:  Ah, again I  sh- -- although I know a lot of people who take that as a personal holiday.  [PAUSE]
R:  Wait, what do you mean?  In what way? [NOISE]
L:  In other words, where they just, "No, you know, I'm not going into work today.  I'm just going to lay in bed all day".
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like the mental health days. [LAUGH] See, but you have to lie usually when you're taking a mental health day. [LAUGH] So, this is, you know, promoting honesty in your staying in bed. [LAUGH] There's nothing to be ashamed of for staying in bed all day.
L:  Wait -- wait -- wait.  You actually have a mental health day as part of work?
R:  Well, no.  People call it, like, "Oh, yeah.  I'm gonna have to just take a mental health day" but they don't really have it.  That's what I'm saying, is that they have to lie --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about being sick.  But if you're just burnt out and, you know, like what you're saying, like, you just want to take a personal day.  Like, a lot of jobs don't really have personal days, where you don't say what's wrong with or why you need to take it.
L:  Ouch.
R:  Yeah.  There's a lot of that now.
L:  Ouch.
R:  They're getting, like, strict with days off.
L:  Yeah, well luckily I don't work for a big corporation, so I don't -- I basically, well, I can take off whenever I feel like it.
R:  But -- so, you work for, like, a small company that they don't care?
L:  Yup.  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kinda part time work for small company then I have my own company as well.
R:  Oh, so, your own company, that's the difference. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Then you can do whatever you want as long as you get things done.
L:  Although my sister works for -- for, um, is it Blackstone or Blackrock?  I can't remember which company, in New York ... Black ... I don't know.  One of those two companies.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  And she seems to be taking a lot of days off whenever she feels like it. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, she must be high up or they're not paying her for them.
L:  No!  
R:  Really?
L:  Neither nor.  She makes a good salary but she's not that high up.  But for some reason, I don't know.  I guess she's just too cute to say no to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, she makes her own little personal holidays as she goes. [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah, but ... mm [LAUGH].  You know, as far as the holidays go, like, I don't know, I'd rather be working.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see, not so much here. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  Actually though, like, right now I just got laid off, so I'm unemployed.  And a- actually now I'd rather be working.  But [LAUGH] uh, once I have the job, it kinda would be nice to have a holiday like once a week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just to have that mandatory day off.
L:  Yeah for me it's, like, you know, I would love a few hours off here and there when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, wanna do something but otherwise I don't mind working seven days a week.
R:  See, that's 'cause you're -- you're in your own -- I think, working for yourself.
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't know, everyone I know who's working for themselves and, you know, they see, like, "By working, I'm really moving somewhere and getting something" it's I think, a lot more gratifying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a position to be in.
L:  Well, [MN] except when you've got all the bills that have to get paid, so it's ... [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  So, you feel a little more pressure. [LAUGH]
L:  Ye- -- oh, there's a lot more pressure.  Definitely.  But, you know, hey, whatever -- whatever it is, it is.
R:  So, you live in LA now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably warm there.
L:  Ah, except for today.  Er, last night it was raining, today it was raining.  But, it'll be warm from here on in.
R:  That's good.
L:  They've promised me that.
R:  Oh, have they?  You and the meteorologists have a special deal going? [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  No, but even -- even when it's raining, it's still so nice out here.  Just, you have that difference between -- you've got the city and then the mountains right there.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I like California.
L:  And then the ocean.
R:  Hello?
L:  It's just so cool, all three of them, right there.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I like there, and you can see it, the mountains, from almost, you know, once you get a -- like, I was in the Valley for a while --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just, like, staying there with people for a f- -- like, for about three weeks.  And you just look to one side and you see mountains and even when you're near the highway, it's kinda nice. 
L:  Yes.
R:  New York --
L:  All these --
R:  -- is very different [LAUGH] I think, than California, like, the pace and everything.  Like, I think people are a lot more friendly there.
L:  They are.  They really are.
R:  Yeah.  People look at you in the eye when you're walking ...
