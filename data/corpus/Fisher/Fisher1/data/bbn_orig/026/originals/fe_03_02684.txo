R:  Hi, my name's Adam Ekstrom.
L:  Hi, I'm Monica.
R:  Hey, Monica.
L:  [NOISE] How ya doing? [NOISE]
R:  All right.
L:  I do not have a favorite holiday.
R:  No?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean, I guess, Christmas.
R:  Christmas?
L:  Whatever, yeah.
R:  I think it'd be, uh, Halloween.
L:  Huh.  Why is it Halloween? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't know, the costumes?  It's --
L:  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, it's really not a religious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- date.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, it kinda is, but it's not.  And, uh, yeah, I just have fun, uh --
L:  Yeah, I guess free candy is good.
R:  -- getting dressed up.  Yeah, free candy is good, too.  And, uh, haunted houses.
L:  Well, I can't really hear you actually.
R:  And haunted houses.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Fun.
R:  Hay rides.
L:  Y- yeah, I mean, did you like -- I don't know, it's fun as a kid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's fun as an adult 'cause you have to, like, work at your costume and really --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  -- make it tricky.
L:  -- I guess, yeah.  I used to always love to go to all the -- the rich neighborhoods and get the better candy.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But --
R:  Totally.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] --
R:  Why Christmas?
L:  I don't know. [MN] It's a fun time.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Presents --
R:  For family sort of stuff?
L:  Huh?
R:  For family sort of stuff?
L:  Uh, not really.
R:  No?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Just, uh, the gifts?
L:  What?
R:  Gifts?
L:  I can't hear you.
R:  Gifts?
L:  [MN] --
R:  Presents?
L:  What?
R:  Presents?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Sorry, gifts, I didn't hear you?
R:  Not many people would say that, 'cause a lot of people, you know, get all depressed around the holidays.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think it's, like, fun.  It's all, like, festive.  I like all the decorations.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So ...
R:  [MN] Christmas trees or you --
L:  Just like, I don't know, yeah, flowers, Christmas trees.
R:  Ornaments.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  Stockings.
L:  So, you don't like Christmas?
R:  No, Christmas is -- is --
L:  Why not?
R:  -- actually pretty fun.
L:  Yeah?
R:  But I -- a lot of people wouldn't -- I would just think that a lot of people wouldn't say that because they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so much depression around it.
L:  But New Years is pretty fun too.
R:  Yeah.  New Years would be my second favorite, for sure.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um --
R:  I mean, that's why I like [inaudible] Halloween, to me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like, uh, [MN] like, it's fun, like, just to, like, go out, I guess?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And, uh, Cinco de Mayo actually is my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- favorite holiday.
L:  Are you Hispanic?
R:  No.
L:  Heh.
R:  [LAUGH] My roommate is.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I don't know if I could create a holiday, what it would be.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Create a holiday, I don't know what that would be, as well.
L:  I don't know.  Maybe like a -- yeah, I don't know. [PAUSE] 
R:  Maybe a real Independence Day?  Like an Independence Day from --
L:  Yeah, maybe?
R:  -- from the US.
L:  Maybe, like, yeah, maybe. [PAUSE] [NOISE] 
R:  Or a --
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know what holiday I would create.
L:  What? [NOISE]
R:  I don't know what holiday I would create.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Maybe something, like, [SIGH] fun related?
R:  Like what?
L:  Fun related.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But in the summer, especially.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah.
L:  Just, like, when the weather is nice.  'Cause, like, sometimes, like, Christmas is no fun 'cause it's, like -- like, you can't drive anywhere ...
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah, there aren't really many in the middle of the summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A few.  Fourth of July's about it.
L:  Yeah, I guess so. [PAUSE] Um ... What was their third question they asked us?
R:  Um, and why?
L:  Why, oh.
R:  Why would we create that holiday?
L:  Oh, I, uh, I don't know.
R:  Just to have a day when people come together?
L:  Yeah. [MN] Just another re- reason to be with your friends and family.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't necessarily do [MN] anything with your family on the Fourth of July.
L:  What?
R:  You don't necessarily do anything with your family on the Fourth of July.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And it'd be nice, like, on a Monday or, like, a Friday to have, like, a day off, a long weekend.
R:  Yeah, three day weekend.
L:  That's always good.  Um ... [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Maybe, like, I don't know, we could celebrate someone's birthday?  Like, we have Martin Luther King's birthday and Washington's birthday.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, actually, Paul Wellstone's birthday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's, uh, that -- I'd make that a holiday, for sure.  Do you know who Paul Wellstone is?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh, he was the -- he was the [MN], uh, Governor from Minnesota that, or Senator from Minnesota.  But he was, like, the -- he was the most liberal senator and he just --
L:  Oh.
R: -- died last summer [NOISE] or winter, last winter.  Yeah, he c --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  Um, [PAUSE] maybe, like, like a Diversity Day or something like that?  We don't have any of those.
R:  Yeah, we don't really.
L:  Like, we --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  Every culture, like, has their own, like, specific day, but we don't have one or we, like, celebrate them all.
R:  Celebrate the differences.
L:  Huh?
R:  A day where they celebrate the differences?
L:  Yeah, maybe.
R:  Yeah.  That would be good.
L:  'Cause, like, America is a melting pot of all cultures.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] That would be good.  Actually --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- in high school you have days like that but you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in real life.
L:  That's true.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's why. [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...Uh, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] Have you done this before [MN]?
L:  [NOISE] No, I haven't.  I was just doing it 'cause they, like, give you ten dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every time you do it.
R:  Yeah, I haven't done it before.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I didn't know exactly how it worked.
L:  Oh.  Um, I don't know how long it's been.
R:  [PAUSE] Yeah, me neither.  I assume at the end it just cuts off, right?
L:  Yeah, I think it -- doesn't it tell us when to end it? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Doesn't it tell us when to end it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so we listen --
R:  It goes to -- it supposedly goes to something and then --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it comments.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] Um ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't know anything else to say about holidays. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, there're an awful lot of holidays.
L:  Yeah, there are.
R:  Yeah.  Like Hallmark holidays.
L:  There's not any in March, actually.  'Cause it's my birthday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in March and I always wanted there to be a holiday around my birthday.
R:  Isn't -- isn't, uh, Easter in March?
L:  Easter, like, you usually -- it's -- maybe it's -- sometimes it falls at the end of March.
R:  Right.
L:  But, like, it's usually in April. [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  So, you'd like to have a March holiday?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Spring Solstice, is that --
L:  [LAUGH] I guess it's, like, a dumb reason, but ...
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's not really any in August either.
R:  No? [PAUSE] So, we're at the beginning of fall, which really isn't a holiday but it could be.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've no idea.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, maybe I like seasonal holidays, like ...
R:  Is Solstice in-- in [NOISE] -- when's Solstice?
L:  What do you think? [MN] [NOISE]
R:  I think, [MN] [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's it about holidays, I don't -- I don't know, I guess I don't think about holidays very often.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I, I mean, I definitely -- the older I get the less I get into it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  If I had a family maybe I'd, uh, you know, if I had kids I'd probably -- probably just take them all on holiday.
L:  [PAUSE] It's kinda, like, hard to, like, create holidays, just 'cause, like, you grow up, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with this specific, like, idea of holidays in your head.  Like, it's -- you can't just make one up, you know, like ... ? [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People do it though.  Like, uh, I don't know if you watch American Idol?  But --
L:  [NOISE] Huh?
R:  I don't know if you watch American Idol? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I've seen a couple of episodes.
R:  But, they made, like, a Ruben Day in whatever state he's from -- Georgia --
L:  Really?
R:  -- Atlanta.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.  They made a Ruben Day.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, uh, yeah, I don't think they need to create any --
L:  When is -- when is that day supposed to be?
R:  I don't know.  I think it's probably his birthday.  Maybe it was the day he was, like, voted on?
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  But I don't necessarily think they need to create any more holidays.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Like, personal traditions, I think it's good for people to create personal traditions, but not holidays.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Uh, [SIGH] yeah, I don't know. [MN] [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  [NOISE] I think it's been ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I [MN] I think it's been ten minutes.
L:  Yeah, I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  Do you know how i- it works a- at the end?  Like, as far as --
L:  At the what?  I'm sorry.
R:  At the end of your conversation?
L:  Yeah I --
