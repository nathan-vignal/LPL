L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, this is Dick.
L:  Hi, my name's Donna.
R:  Donna, yes.
L:  I live in Upstate New York.
R:  [NOISE] I live in Ohio.
L:  Yeah.  What's your favorite holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I like Thanksgiving [MN] --
L:  Thanksgiving?
R:  -- New Years, Christmas.
L:  Yeah, they're all pretty good, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know we're supposed to talk for ten minutes about a holiday, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Well, I guess I like Christmas.
R:  Christmas is a good holiday, it -- it's commercialized so much.
L:  Oh, definitely too c- -- too commercialized.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I still like that time of year, the season and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, with the snow and stuff.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It can snow for one day a year, around Christmas, as far as I'm concerned, but --  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  You know?
R:  We had snow this Christmas --
L:  We sure did.
R:  -- here in Cincinnati.
L:  We had a huge storm.  I was in Florida wi- -- at my mother's, and we couldn't come home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had to sleepover in the airport on Christmas night.
R:  That sounds terrible.
L:  Yeah.  It was kinda fun.
R:  Oh, was it?
L:  Hu- yeah, you know, it's always an adventure.
R:  I guess any time you take a plane these days it's an adventure.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.
R:  [MN]
L:  And then getting home, and of course my car was parked in an outside lot so, it was fun getting it dug out and so on --
R:  Gee.
L:  -- but we made it. [LAUGH]
R:  Christmas is a good time of year.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah ...
R:  We got married around Christmas time.
L:  Did ya?  Well, so that's, yeah, special that way then too, huh?
R:  Right.
L:  That's cool.
R:  I like, um, uh, let's see, I like Labor Day too.
L:  You do?
R:  Memorial Day.
L:  Bec- -- Memorial Day, yeah.  'Cause you m- -- 'cause you get a long weekend or --
R:  Well, it's not only that, it's that the -- the weather's normally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- warmer.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Memorial Day is probably the best day of the year for weather, for me.  I don't like snow and all that.
L:  [LAUGH] Then why do you live in Ohio? [LAUGH] You're almost as bad as we are here, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we -- we -- we don't have a whole lot of snow here.
L:  No?  Are you --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- in Southern Ohio or s- ... ?
R:  Southern Ohio, yes.
L:  Yeah?  Oh, that's better then, yeah.  We really got hit with snow this -- this winter around Christmas.
R:  Were you up around Buffalo?  [MN]
L:  Um, east of -- yeah, east of Buffalo, near Utticus[?] --
R:  Oh, Ut- [MN]?
L:  -- you know where that -- yeah, mhm.
R:  Twelve feet -- foot -- [MN] --
L:  Hm?
R:  -- a foot -- feet of snow.
L:  Oh, we got --
R:  Feet of snow.
L:  -- lots of snow around Christmas Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I wasn't here, like I said --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was s- spending it with my mother but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my brother said it was just --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- coming down, like, it just didn't stop. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, three feet all in one day.
R:  We don't even get that much in a -- a whole season.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, this -- this year was really unusual, but.
R:  It's usually we don't.
L:  Yeah.  I like Halloween too, do you like Halloween?  Do you have kids?
R:  No.
L:  No?  You don't like it and you don't have kids, or ... ?  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  I ki- --
R:  -- we usually tur- -- pul- -- turn out the lights and we don't -- we don't participate --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- that often.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I like to put up decorations and stuff, but I don't do the, uh, trick or treat thing.
R:  Yeah, the kids don't appreciate it.
L:  No, they don't.  They don't care.
R:  They want more, or ...
L:  More and more and bigger and better.
R:  Bigger and better and special treats and more expensive treats.
L:  Well, absolutely.  I know you can spend a lot of money on that stuff.
R:  And if you do, they come from all the way out of the neighborhood, all over the place.
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  That's not the tradition though, is it?
L:  I know, it's another one of those holidays that's all about the dollar anymore.
R:  Right. [MN] Do we have, uh, Memorial Day coming up, don't we?
L:  Yep, yep.  That's my daughter's birthday this year.
R:  Oh is that right?
L:  Yeah, this year it falls on her birthday, she'll be eighteen, so it's like, uh-oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  The twenty sixth.
L:  Yep, on the twenty sixth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it will be a double whammy that day.  But we're -- e- -- or actually we're going down --
R:  Does she live in --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- in your [MN] town too?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Does she live in your town?
L:  She lives with me.
R:  Oh, she lives with y- -- she's eighteen, I guess.
L:  She w- -- she's still in high school.
R:  Oh, she's still in high school?
L:  Yep, yep.  
R:  Oh.
L:  She's a junior this year so she's got another year of school.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yep.
R:  I thought --
L:  So ...
R:  -- maybe she was away at college or something. [MN]
L:  Not yet. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Not yet, I know I was --
R:  That's another reason that's like Memorial Day, for kids, well the kids  -- that meant school was almost out too.
L:  Yep, yep.  It makes a nice long weekend.  Actually, we're going down to Annapolis, Maryland, for -- my nephew is in the Naval Academy so we're going down there.  They have some goings ons.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, this should be pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's -- it's c- -- pretty neat -- pretty --
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  -- interesting spot.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  So ...  It puts a different twist on Memorial Day than ya -- what ya normally think of.  But they have, uh, the Blue Angels demonstrate and, you know, do a show and ... oh, different stuff.  So, it's kinda neat.
R:  I like Memorial Day, I like Christmas.
L:  Do you guys do Easter at all?  Celebrate it in any way?
R:  I like my birthday best, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  For my birthday this year I got a new kidney.
L:  Oh boy.  Wow.
R:  I had kidney failure two years ago.
L:  Wow. 
R:  And --
L:  So, is everything okay now?
R:  -- I got kidney on my birthday this year, October twenty ninth.
L:  Wow.
R:  Last year rather ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's a good present, I guess, huh?
R:  Well, that was quite a present.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  My wife donated the thing.
L:  Wow, did she?
R:  [inaudible] the kidney family.
L:  That's great.  You're doing good?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  I guess, everybody's birthday is sort of like a holiday.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Some companies recognize that.
L:  Oh, yeah, I know it, they do. [NOISE] But yeah, that's a definite reason to celebrate your birthday, huh?  That year.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  How many holidays do we have a year?  I understand America has fewer holidays than all the rest of the world put together.
L:  Really?
R:  Not put together, but --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- all of them.  We have fewer holidays that are recognized by the government that the business has to pay for it --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- than anybody else.
L:  Wow.  Let's see, we've got New Years and then there's Martin Luther King, and Presidents' Day --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- now I guess, instead of Lincoln and --
R:  Well, some companies don't recognize Presidents' Day or --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  There's two in January and, well, there's -- there's  Valentine's Day --
L:  Valentines, er, yeah, but, well, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not a real holiday, it's just a -- it's -- I mean, it's a holiday but not in the sense that you get time off from work or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  Then you don't have anything until Memorial Day, I think, re- -- besides Easter.
R:  Easter -- [MN] Good Friday.
L:  Yeah, yeah, kinda -- some peop- --
R:  Sometimes you get a half day off on that. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I never get a day off on Good Friday, but --
R:  Don't you?
L:  Some people do, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  Then --
R:  -- there's the Memorial Day then --
L:  Then there's nothing till --
R:  Fourth of July.
L:  --  Fourth of July and then -- then Labor Day.
R:  Memorial -- Memorial Day.
L:  Yep.
R:  Er, Labor Day.
L:  Labor Day and then ...
R:  Thanksgiving.
L:  Yep, Thanksgiving is always good.  It's kind of a mellow day, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then -- then you're into Christmas again.
R:  Right.
L:  But I like to see the snow at that time of year.  It's nice.
R:  You like snow.  Do you ski?
L:  Well, I like it but I don't like to drive in it, you know?  I like to see it but, [SIGH] you know, it's pretty once a year. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  But you get a lot of snow there, I guess?
L:  Yeah, we did this year.
R:  Do you ski?
L:  N- -- I used to when I was a kid, but I don't anymore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it's gotten so expensive that it's just ...
R:  Is it one of those things?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I don't ski, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, so- -- for several years there was no snow, [COUGH] excuse me, [SIGH] so ...
R:  Yeah.  You quit for a while and then never got back to it.
L:  That's it.  That's it.  I do do some cross country sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if there's enough snow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course this year there was, but not always.
R:  Yeah, w- ...
L:  Um ...
R:  Seaso- --the weathers have been strange and the summers have been strange in the last --
L:  Yeah, they have. 
R:  -- twenty years or so.
L:  Have you had hot summers?
R:  We have h- -- humid, hot and humid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- summers.
L:  Wow, yeah.  I know, we've had -- it's either, I don't know, it's just been strange.  I mean, so far this year, it's been -- it hasn't been very warm.  I don't know about where you are, but it's not been very warm yet.
R:  We've had a week o- warm -- of -- of nice weather and a week of bad weather and a week of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good weather --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and a week of bad weather.
L:  Yep.
R:  They alternate.
L:  I know, yeah.  But Easter was a nice day.  We had a --
