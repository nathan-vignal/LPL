R:  [MN] Mich- --
L:  Hello?
R:  Michelle.
L:  Melissa. [PAUSE]
R:  What is your favorite holiday?
L:  What is my favorite holiday?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know, Christmas.
R:  Christmas, and why would that be?
L:  Um, I don't know, 'cause it's a -- it's a family holiday and I like being with my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I usually like being with my family. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It depends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I like -- it's festive, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  [MN] I would say, Thanksgiving.
L:  Thanksgiving, why?
R:  Why?  Because it's in the fall.
L:  Okay.
R:  You celebrate, there's football --
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot of sports.  Um, family comes over.
L:  Right.
R:  Turkey.
L:  Mhm.  Do you cook?
R:  No, I don't.  Do you?
L:  You don't cook?  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not at all.  How old -- how old are you?
R:  Twenty five, I'll be.
L:  I'm twenty seven.  Okay.
R:  Twenty seven.
L:  Yeah.  Ooh, well, happy birthday.
R:  This is my first time doing this.
L:  Me too.  Me too.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's my first phone call totally.  I was asked, like, oh man,  I don't know.  Well, what kind of holiday would you create, if you could create a holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  I would.  I would create, like, um, a fun holiday.  It could be any holiday, like, a family would want to create, you know what I'm saying?  Like, um --
L:  Right.
R:  Like, if the family liked Christmas then that family would celebrate Christmas that day.  So --
L:  Gotcha.
R:  Yeah.  I'd call it the Fun Holiday.  Whatever your family wants to have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for that day.  What would you do?
L:  I don't know, maybe, like, a week of holidays, kind of like Mardi Gras.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  But, like, a week long festivity that everybody would have to celebrate. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  Now, uh --
L:  I don't know what I'd call it though.  [PAUSE] I don't know.  What's that?
R:  What would you -- what would you do on the holiday though?  Anything ... ?
L:  Uh, party, probably.
R:  Yup.
L:  Just kick back, relax.  I -- I would have it in the summer, so there'd be barbecues and music.
R:  [MN] Now, would you have any, like, fun stuff for kids?  You're like -- you know, for Christmas how they have Santa Claus and Easter?
L:  I don't know.
R:  They have the Easter Bunny.
L:  Maybe, I don't know, like, league sports or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And any kid at the end who wins would get to go to, like, [MN] a local theme park or something.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That would be fun.
L:  Yeah.  That's not too bad.
R:  And they could have, like, volleyball for, you know, different kinds of sports for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the kids.
L:  [MN] Wow, they only gave us two questions, huh, for holidays?
R:  Yeah, [MN] um --
L:  [LAUGH] What else can you possibly -- are there any holidays you don't like?
R:  Any holidays I don't like?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would say [PAUSE] not that I don't like Christmas but I think it's the stressful holiday 'cause you have to --
L:  It is a stressful --
R:  -- get gifts.
L: -- holiday, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You have to get gifts and with me, I don't know how much money to spend on people.
L:  Mhm.  I gotcha.
R:  Especially when it's, you know, family members or good friends or a good boss.  You never know what is the limit.  Like, what is good.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Is fifty dollars good?  Is a hundred good?
L:  And which people, like, that expect gifts and which people don't.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  There is a lot of pressure on that.
R:  And then you don't know what to get.  Like, for instance, like, my grandparents, they already have everything.
L:  They have everything?
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what I'm saying?  As you get older --
L:  I do.
R:  -- you get everything.  So, um, [MN] that's kinda tough.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In Westwood, now. 
L:  Westwood --
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Lo- Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  Where's -- where's Westwood?
R:  Uh, Massachusetts.
L:  Massachusetts?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I knew you were East Coast, I grew up in New York.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I could tell by your accent, like, yeah, definitely east.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is my first --
L:  Um --
R:  -- time doing this.
L:  I know, me too.  I -- this is so strange.  It's like, I wish they'd give us at least five or six questions to talk about.  Okay, well, let me tell you which holiday I don't like.
R:  Okay.
L:  What holiday don't I like?  Um, you know what, Saint Patrick's Day never lives up to its expectations I don't think.
R:  Saint Patrick's Day?
L:  Yeah.  Like, I always think it could be really fun, go out, drink beer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just, you know what?  It never ends up being that great.
R:  [MN] It doesn't.
L:  No.  [inaudible] --
R:  Personally, I think it's m- -- are you Irish?
L:  Yeah, I'm very Irish, my last name is Fury.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think it's more, maybe I'm thinking the wrong way, but I always think it's more for, like, the Irish people.  You know what I'm saying?  'Cause --
L:  Yeah, I know, it definitely is.  If you're Irish it's definitely more of a festive thing.  But --
R:  Yeah, than if you're not.  But, I mean, it still is fun.  Like, last year we went out and they had, um, dinner rolls and they colored them green, so that was fun.  The mashed potatoes were green.
L:  Gotcha, yeah.
R:  And all the drinks were green.  So, it really got into the holiday.
L:  I think it's [inaudible].  So, you like Thanksgiving?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you have a good Thanksgiving this year?
R:  [MN] I did.  Um, I work at a nursing home and um --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  We had the day off.  Well, I did, 'cause I rotate --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with someone else.  So it was fun.  I never really get to see some of my family members so when I did it was fun just to get together.
L:  Does all of your family live in Massachusetts or are they all over the place?
R:  Um, most of them do and some --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- live in Canada.
L:  Canada?  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My family -- some of my family live in Canada.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Or at least they used to live in Canada.  I think they all migrated down here but -- no, there are a couple of people that still live in Canada, that's strange.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, most of my family lives in New York.
R:  [MN] New York is nice too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's Long Island, it's not the city.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I grew up on Long Island.
R:  So, Long Island is the suburbs, right?
L:  Yeah.  It's pretty much the suburbs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then there's the Hamptons, which is like really hoity toity.
R:  Yup.
L:  Which I lived near.  I was like -- I lived, like, half an hour, forty minutes away.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You had a -- yeah.  So, you had a good Thanksgiving?
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- how was your Easter?  You like Easter?
L:  Um, I didn't do anything for Easter.  I actually ended up working and I work at a bar.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I -- I worked on Easter and I felt kinda like that was wrong.
R:  [MN]
L:  That I shouldn't be in a bar on Easter day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was -- I was a little uncomfortable with that.  But I didn't -- it wasn't really very busy either so it wasn't worth it.
R:  [MN] Right.  'Cause you know what --
L:  And I was ill.
R:  -- I think it is too, people don't like to go out on holidays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they kinda feel funny.  I know what you mean, 'cause I had to work Easter too.  You feel like you shouldn't be working, it's a day off.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was s- strange.  But I guess if I had a nine to five job and worked every day during the week --
R:  Then you wouldn't need to work holidays, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't have to worry about it.  That's the only -- that's the only drawback to having a night job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's the only drawback.
R:  It was -- is this your first holiday or something working?
L:  Yeah, it's like you can't celebrate holidays and you can't, you know, I -- I was lucky that I got to come home for Christmas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But for Thanksgiving I had to just stay out here.  I mean, we were closed for that day but I wasn't closed any days around it.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Ever- you know, every other major nine to five job you get a couple of days off. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  And then there was, um, well, Memorial Day's coming up.  Do you consider that a holiday?
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Yup.
L:  [LAUGH] Memorial Day's kinda nice 'cause it's -- it's kinda like a barbecueing holiday.
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Did you have any family that was in the [MN] war or anything?
L:  No, no, I didn't.  Did you?
R:  No.
L:  No?  Yeah, no --
R:  Uh.
L:  I didn't have any family in the war.  I don't really have a very big family.  I used to but I don't really have a very big family anymore.
R:  Mhm.  So, that's a good long holiday.  Now, do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do you know if you're working?
L:  Um, I'm gonna try and get off. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I usually work Monday nights but I'd really -- uh, Memorial Day is one of those holidays I really don't want to be in a bar, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I could really be out -- rather be outside playing Frisbee or --
R:  Enjoying the day.
L:  Yeah, doing something, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though I have days off like that all the time, it's -- it's the holiday, it would be, I don't know.  It's a good holiday, it's like more of a friends' holiday than a --
R:  Family holiday.
L:  -- than a family holiday.
R:  Now, what do you consider family holidays?
L:  Um, Easter -- Easter, Christmas and Thanksgiving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's about it, really.
R:  Mhm.  Same with me.
L:  I can't think of -- I can't think of anything else that's really like a family holiday.
R:  Fourth of July I would say.  Like, with the barbecues.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  It could be --
L:  That's a family holiday.
R:  -- family fun, sorta.
L:  And I'm off on July fourth.  I looked that up a couple of weeks ago. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, I want to make sure I'm off on July fourth 'cause I know, even if I don't get Memorial Day off, I better be off on July fourth.
R:  Yup.
L:  You know, I don't even know if a bar would be open on July fourth.
R:  [MN] Oh, I'm sure they would.
L:  You think? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh, but I won't be there, thank God.
R:  I'd put in your request now.
L:  Phew.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you?
R:  [MN] Oh no, you have it off right, already?
L:  Oh, I have it off.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't have to put in a request.
R:  Oh, I was telling you maybe you should put your request in.  But I -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  No, you already have it off.
L:  No.  I already have it off.  Unless I pick up shifts beforehand for, like, every Friday from here on out.  And I -- and I won't, so ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, 'cause Fourth of July is on a Friday this year, right?
L:  Yeah, it is on Friday.
R:  Oh, wow.  So, we have another long weekend.
L:  You guys do, at the -- at the nursing home?
R:  No, um --
L:  You pretty much -- there's no holidays in a nursing home.
R:  No, they're open twenty four seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  There's -- i- it's not like you could just go like, "Okay, well, look, you know, old people are going to go home". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You can't really do that.  Oh, so you kinda have a job kinda like I do.
R:  Yup.  And, um, now, is your bar open on Easter?  No, right?
L:  It was open on Easter.
R:  Yeah, right, 'cause you told me you worked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, see, w- I work at the nursing home but I ain't get time and a half on Easter.
L:  No, I didn't either.
R:  They don't consider that as a, um, holiday.  Like, it's a holiday but --
L:  It's not observed by everybody I think.
R:  Right, 'cause of the Greeks, like the Orthodox, I think they're called.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Like, the other religion.
L:  Like Russian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox don't have the same Easter, so it's not like a nationwide thing.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I'm pretty sure.
R:  Yup.
L:  Okay, I didn't get to do anything.  I didn't get to color eggs, you know?
R:  [MN] All the fun stuff.
L:  I get to eat a little candy but nothing -- nothing spectacular.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] This is a hard topic, huh?
R:  I know.
L:  I mean, it's ha- -- I think they should supply us with more questions and they're listening so, they should jolly -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They should take this as a cue.  Supply a -- I think you should give at least five questions for ten minutes.  'Cause, I mean, what's your favorite holiday is the quickest [MN] you know, question and answer.
