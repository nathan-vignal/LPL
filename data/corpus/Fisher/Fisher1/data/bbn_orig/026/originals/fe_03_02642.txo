R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Good afternoon, this is Emanuela.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Who I'm speaking with?
L:  Um, this is Ann.
R:  Ah, hi Ann, how are you doing?
L:  I'm doing good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Good.
R:  All right.  So, we need to talk about [LAUGH] what --
L:  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the US should do in Iraq.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]  Would you like to start or would you like me to start?
L:  You can start.
R:  All right.  [NOISE]  I -- I think that, ah, the United States needs to clean up what's going on over there --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- to, ah, create sustainable agriculture and economy [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- in, ah, helping people [SIGH] to regain their health as well [MN] --
L:  Uh-hum ...
R:  [SIGH] -- using, ah, natural devices such as a ground[?] device to purify the water [SIGH] and clean up the [PAUSE] depleted uranium over there.  [LIPSMACK]  And bring out teams to help people -- medical teams as well [SIGH] and environmental organic farming over there.
L:  Right.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And to clean up everything and to [SIGH] um, take out, ah, cluster bombs and all the, ah, land mines they did over there as well.
L:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.  I agree --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think they need to, ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- really help the people to get back [SIGH] their country back on its feet and [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to, um, create some type of, um, controls so that, you know, they'll have more --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, [MN] stability within the country.
R:  Uh-hum.  So, what do you mean by, ah, con- some type of control and, ah, stability in the country?
L:  Like democracy --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, or, you know, not a dictatorship like it was with Saddam when he was in, um, [LIPSMACK] power.
R:  [SIGH]  So, do you think, ah, the US need to bring, [SIGH] ah, ah, it's own, ah, political people over there?  [SIGH]
L:  No, I don't.  I think it needs to be done with the Iraqi people.
R:  Right.
L:  People that they can understand and, um, that [SIGH] would be living there also.
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  The US should also take care of its own problems at home [SIGH] and then --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, try and help those people as well.  But right here --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we have, um, [LIPSMACK] unemployment at a skyrocket --
R:   [NOISE]
L:  -- level.  So, we have homeless people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right here.  So, we need to focus more on at home issues --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that should be secondary.
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]  But meanwhile since, ah, we intervene over there we created a big mess over there too.  [SIGH]  So, if we want to bring back things here, [SIGH] we can use also here with our water [MN] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and with our farming [NOISE] what we are going to bring over there as well.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And we can do it easily.  Um, we can teach people here and do it over there -- how to grow food which is going to be helpful [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- if -- in case we have, ah, nuclear accident [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- for people to be able to get food without being sick and we have the possibilities to do that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  I agree.
R:  So, it's just [NOISE] that we agree to [NOISE] bring in people who are knowledgeable in terms of nutrition --
L:  And agri- agricultural, yes.  Uh-hum.
R:  Right.  Agricultural and people who are like me, um, I'm doing it in my h- -- in my apartment --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so everybody can [NOISE] do it and we need to train people here to take over the health --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and the homeless people to grow their own food.  They don't have to have [SIGH] a home --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- they can start right away -- [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because you just need a container with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with seeds and soil and you can g- um, grow -- um grow greens [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- which are very good for -- for health and we can --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- do that over there as well in Iraq.
L:  Uh-hum.  That's true.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So --
R:  [NOISE]  And -- and what's about, um, [NOISE] what Bush has decided and all the -- th- -- the oil.  What do we do with -- with the oil over there?  [MN]
L:  Well, [MN] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think that, um, that's gonna be, um, a sore issue --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- because a lot of the Iraqi people feel that the reason [SIGH] that he was over there was to, ah, for the oil and --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- I, myself, agree that he was also.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that's gonna be, um [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, a tough battle I think for him.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  So, ah, d- do you think, ah, we need to -- the US still needs to go after Saddam Hussein or -- or not, or what do we do with him?  [SIGH]
L:  Mm?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I really don't know.  I think if they [SIGH] -- you know, they -- they haven't found, ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- Osama Bin Laden after all this time --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so, um, what makes them think that they can just go and find Saddam?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  I got some, ah, some information on -- on the radio from WBAI --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that Osama Bin Laden [NOISE] recently [LIPSMACK] his family [LIPSMACK] they --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- invested the money here [SIGH] to go to Iraq --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so I doubt that Osama bin Lan- Laden was killed [SIGH] and, ah, I doubt that the government doesn't know where he is -- [LIPSMACK]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Because his family his family has been recently involved in the transaction [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- for -- in Iraq --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- helping here in New York [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- ah, with investments for Iraq.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, ah, [NOISE] since the US put up Saddam Hussein and supported him [SIGH] with the first, ah, Bush [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- administration --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  So, I guess, um, [SIGH] [NOISE] um, [PAUSE] [NOISE] they -- they may know where he is. [SIGH]
L:  I think so too.  I really do.
R:  Mm and, ah, [MN]  [SIGH] --
L:  Because, you know -- but if they do -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- then I think that, you know, it's deplorable that they've done all of this stuff and then, you know, are hiding him like that.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Ri- --
L:  Because a lot of innocent lives have been lost, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a result of this. 
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, I think he's created one big mess but it'll -- it'll take a long time to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- really, you know, be able to straighten it out.
R:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  Yes, it's true.  [SIGH] And -- and do you think the US can put a -- ah, has enough money to clean up and [SIGH] take care of the -- the mess which occurred over there?  [NOISE]
L:  No, I don't. 
R:  [SIGH]  So, how are we doing to do that?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Probably with the Iraqi oil.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well --
L:  I think that's where that'll come into play.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Blew up again things.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  To create ah, a military compost statistic[?].  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [MN] To pile up with dirt.  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably.  Mm.
R:  And probably [SIGH] put worms to [LAUGH] to eat the depleted uran- uranium over there and [SIGH] I'm sure we have tools that, ah --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that some people want to use which are going to [SIGH] um, clean up naturally the deplet- depleted uranium and all those bombs it's just, ah --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH] -- it's not to the advantage of corporations.  So you won't make money with that.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  It's like when we put out --
L:  It's gonna be a lot of hard work -- tedious work --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know?  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
R:  Uh-hum.  And what about the media, since they are covering [SIGH] the so-called news [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- what can we do, ah, as Americans to -- [SIGH] ah, about Iraq?  What can we do [NOISE] [MN] as people?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Ah -- I really, you know, don't know because w- I feel that we here in America are so -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] far removed from that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, problem that [SIGH] -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we just, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- see what the media presents to us -- 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and we're sorta like detached from it, but I really don't know -- other than to send, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the American Red Cross --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and you know be supportive in that way and help them [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, healthwise and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also to grow their food and stuff like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I really don't know a lot of things that we could [PAUSE] be doing --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] there.
R:  What I'm aware of because I have receiving, ah, [SIGH] pledges for this, ah, non-profit organization like Haifa[?] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- they help people to [SIGH] [NOISE] to, ah, grow their food --
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and to have their own cattle --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so maybe [LIPSMACK] ah, as American people we can [LIPSMACK] support more these non profit organizations?  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.  Right.  We could do that.
R:  [MN]  And --
L:  That would -- that's a good thing.  [SIGH]
R:  And, you're right and, ah --
L:  And support them.
R:  -- [SIGH] maybe -- I don't know which one but we need -- because the ground devices are not expensive [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, but they are six hundred dollars for, ah, household [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  Well, yes, [SIGH] and -- but they are for life [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, ah, it cleans up the water [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so I don't know [NOISE] how we could um, [LIPSMACK] which organization could take care of that and, ah, to be able to bring this into water over there --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- to clean up the water naturally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] without filtration plant because it's going to be stagnant water [NOISE] so we cannot have any [LIPSMACK] -- most people's [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- ah, sorry the noise is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] not so good and, um, [NOISE] so I don't know which, ah, organization is going to take care of that and if they are going to be able to get there anyway.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Well, may be they'll -- they -- that would be a good thing if they would set one up sp- specifically for that?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But does it have to come from the government do you think, or can it come from, ah, [SIGH] the -- ah, international, ah, [SIGH] United Nation?
L:  I -- I think it could -- could work from coming from the, um, United Nations. 
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Because apparently Bush wasn't really supporting that ah, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- the United Nations.  So, I don't know what they plan to do now about, ah, Iraq [SIGH] with the United Nations.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Well 
R:  Because to me it seems like the, ah -- they really, ah, didn't listen and they didn't follow the international, ah, rules.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.  I know.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But maybe the, um, United Nations needs to be stronger and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know, set up some things aside --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- themselves for the Iraqi people and --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, for the rulership, you know, of whoever is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to, um, be over the country.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Right.  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] what I feel too is that [NOISE] ah, it's up to the Iraqi people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to [SIGH] to take care of their country now in terms of, ah, political regime [MN] --
L:  That's true.  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and they know what to do since --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- there is such diversity, like the Kurds were killed a couple of years --
