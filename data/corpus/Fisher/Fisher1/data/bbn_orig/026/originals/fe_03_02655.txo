L:  Yes, good afternoon, my name is Paul.
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, Paul, my name's Christie.
L:  How are you doing today, Christie?
R:  Oh, fine.  [NOISE]
L:  All rightey, so why don't you start on the topic?
R:  Ah, [SIGH] what would your favorite holiday be?
L:  [SIGH]  My favorite holiday is Veterans' Day because I'm a veteran.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  All rightey.  Um, mine?  Well, I guess, ah, one of my favorites would be Fourth of July.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, Fourth of July, [NOISE] Independence Day?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I love summer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I love, ah, [SIGH] history --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the importance of, ah, Fourth of July so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess [SIGH] that's a good one for me.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well Veterans' Day is a good one because I served in Vietnam [SIGH] --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- I did a tour of duty over there.  [SIGH]  My son is serving in Iraq right now in the Marines [SIGH] --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- so it's going to be a sort of family trait now, from now on.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  But the other part of it was -- wh- what would I trade it for?  And  for me that would be kind of hard.  I mean, as we veterans don't -- well, we get two days actually.  We get Memorial Day for the dead and just V- -- you know, Veterans' Day for all veterans.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, um, the only thing I would like to trade is that when I came back from Vietnam they didn't have no parade for us.  [LAUGH]  I mean that's about the only thing that, um [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sort of saddened me a little bit about that because you know, after the [NOISE] -- you know, Desert Storm they got a parade; World War Two, World War One [SIGH] everybody got a parade.  [NOISE]  But everybody who came back from Vietnam it was like we fought the, um, [SIGH] the un-winnable war, or something like that.  But for trading it for another day, I -- I -- since it's only one day, I -- I really don't see any need to trade it off for something else.  It's doing -- you know, 'cause it's -- it's in warm weather and [SIGH] ah, hopefully, I would like for more people to show up for the parades.  [NOISE]  But [SIGH] I think for -- in the years to come more and more people will probably show up for the parades again like they used to do, ah, you know, in the y- years past.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  Ah, maybe they need to have, um --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- Vietnam, ah, War Veterans' Day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to celebrate just that war.  That was a [NOISE] -- that was a hard one.  [NOISE] And really -- and like you said I don't think you [SIGH] really got recognized for it [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when the troops came home.  [SIGH] They didn't recognize them like they should've.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, it was -- yeah, it -- it didn't have the popularity.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  An- and it's unfortunate to use that word [SIGH] but it didn't have the popularity.  But [SIGH] the -- the only thing I understand is that it's for  -- [NOISE] today's war in Iraq [SIGH] it -- it -- it was an intangible, just like the Vietnam War was on an intangible.  And World War One and World War Two was a definite move.  [SIGH]  Okay, um, [NOISE] we -- we -- we got to defeat the enemy, ah, that [NOISE] -- 'cause they want to take over but, th- [NOISE] you know, Vietnam was -- we don't want -- nobody -- nobody want -- they -- they couldn't take over us and there was no way we was going to take over them.  [NOISE]  We could have probably changed the government again.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Ah, but, you know, it was just one of those things.  But [SIGH] I'm -- I'm -- I tell you I'm a little bit at a loss as -- as far as how do you trade off a holiday, and why would you want to trade it off?  That's the -- ah, the one part of the topic [LAUGH] I really didn't understand.  I could see, "What's your favorite holiday?" [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I -- I don't know if I got that in my notes.  But, ah, yeah, I wouldn't [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.  [SIGH]  I don't know about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- I listened to the topic.  It says, ah, "W- what would you trade it for?"  And I'm like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- "Okay, well my favorite -- pick a favorite holiday and then trade it".  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  A- and [SIGH] -- and then I done thinking [NOISE] ah, [SIGH] I'm trying to figure if -- where something else comes in -- like, ah, a holiday comes Monday -- m- -- m- -- m- make your holiday on a Tuesday so you can get a -- a extra day off of work or something?
R:  Yeah, Friday, or [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] you know, that's the on- [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's the only ration- rationalization I can [LAUGH] get from that, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] if I get two holidays in a row.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Then if I do go to work I get double time and a half and if I don't well then [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I get two days off, and I still get straight time pay.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  As far as having -- making another holiday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'd probably [SIGH] commemorate September Eleventh.  [MN]  I've -- I would --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, you come on Nine Eleven?
R:  Ah, yeah, I was surprised they didn't, um, do that the first time round --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [NOISE]
R:  -- when -- when --
L:  Oh, okay that's the -- that was the second part of th- the topic.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, the year following.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All rightey.  See -- see -- you see you've got to slow those people down from New York.  We know every damn thing up here.  You know that, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause we've got an opinion on everything.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Ah, yeah, but okay.  [SIGH]  So, [NOISE] okay that -- but I -- I want to know.  [NOISE]  Well, th- that should fall on the Memorial Day [NOISE].  Well, you think they should make a special day for it?  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's when it happened -- [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you know, when else would you commemorate it?  I don't know.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All rightey.  All rightey.  [NOISE]  That's [SIGH] -- but then how -- how -- how do you list that, like okay do you -- do you call it a Nine Eleven Holiday?  Or [SIGH] the Memorial for Civilian Casualties of a Terrorist Attack?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean you -- you -- you understand what I'm talking about?
R:  Anti Terrorism Day, or -- I don't know.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  O- -- o- -- oh!
R:  What would you call it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, okay, yeah see now [several inaudible words].  No worries.  And then we've got something to kick over, let's think of a name for it.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, because -- okay -- all right that -- that's going to be good.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  I just thought it would be covered in Memorial Day, but --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but they were all [NOISE] civilian casualties in -- in actuality.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then Congress would have to  b- battle over what the name is.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  [NOISE]  Maybe we'd better start thinking of a name because some ti- -- ah, some point in time in the near future [SIGH] they might run one of those contests, [SIGH] where they ask people to submit a name [NOISE] for some kind of day [SIGH] commemorating Nine Eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they might have a million dollar prize.  And who knows [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Look how long [LAUGH] --
L:  -- we might be able to win.  [LAUGH]
R:  Look how long it took 'em to figure out what -- what type of, um, memorial they were going to have.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  That took a while.  I guess they're working on that now.  I think they're [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  From what I understand they already picked [SIGH] an architect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and his plans and --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- um, I don't know when they're going to start.  [inaudible] [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  Well they did pick an architect and his plans but they also opened up [SIGH] [NOISE] open competition [SIGH] for people to -- ah, contribute architectural designs, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that will be incorporated [NOISE] into the designs that they're already gonna use.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But they're still having a problem with the footprints of the Towers.  The -- the area below the area where the two twin towers stood?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Okay, they're having a problem with that [SIGH] because some people wanted it to remain open.  [NOISE]  [MN]  And they -- they saying, "No, we need to make that into a parking garage and a bus depot".  They saying, "No, no, no, no, no.  [SIGH]  You have to leave that open, you know, for commemoration".  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And then another group is saying, [SIGH] "Well, who wants a big grave yard in the middle of a business area?"  [MN]
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's -- it's -- it's going to be a little while before I think they have really, really anything done on that.  Maybe we're looking at Two Thousand and Nine or something like that.
R:  Oh, Jeez!
L:  Yeah, [MN] well it's going to be a while, you know?  And New York City's --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- in a fin- -- in a financial crisis.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, the whole country is, in reality.  But, ah --
R:  Yeah?  That's what I heard that they were trying to get a lot of, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- business in there and they're still hurting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's what I heard.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, most definitely.  Most definitely.
R:  And they had their peak there for a while.  Everybody was coming [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right afterwards 'cause they were [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were asked to come.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And [SIGH] and we -- everyone wanted to help 'em out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But now, you know, that period kind of left.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And now they're starting to feel the [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, but you got --
R:  -- per-
L:  -- you got -- you got -- yeah, you got my mind going now because I'm really [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] looking at what do you -- what would you call the day?  Like -- a -- a day -- ah, you know, a holiday com- commemorating Nine Eleven?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  This is just -- now that's -- it's like on my mind.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's creating -- you know, because I'm saying -- [SIGH] [NOISE] see but I -- I tell you I just thought Memorial Day.  But Memorial Day in -- in essence is act- -- in actuality [SIGH] for soldiers that died in wars.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, well -- well, yeah, because -- well for soldiers because nobody never attacked this -- that country on that level -- or this country on that level before.  Well, you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] except for the revolutionary war.  And then the [SIGH] -- Civil War [NOISE] was this country decided we wanted to fight each other.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  But that's neither here nor there.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]  But now  and so Memorial Day and Veterans' Day covers all of those.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But, um, yeah and I think Anti-Terrorism Day is kind of -- [SIGH] [NOISE]  It sounds kind of harsh.  [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  It does.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know, it's like -- oh, yeah [NOISE] --
R:  I have no idea what to call it.
L:  -- yeah, you know, "Put that on your calendar" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oh, mommy we got -- we don't have no school tomorrow".  "Why?"  "It's Anti Terrorism Day" you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're like, "Wait a minute!"  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, then you have to explain it to your kids.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  "What's terrorism?"  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, "Well, mommy, what's terrorism for?  To be anti?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Then you -- you sit there and explain how some people hijacked planes and crashed them into buildings for -- because they didn't like America.  But then they say, "What?  They didn't?"  You know?  So, yeah, it would be kind of hard.  [NOISE]  But [SIGH] I -- I kind of hope that they -- I -- I hope they incorporate that on -- on -- on --on -- [NOISE] on their topic list [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the way that you put it.  [NOISE].  That what -- what do you think they should call a holiday commemorating Nine Eleven?  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Ah, maybe it could be America's Day, [NOISE] or something?  Ah 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go, America's Day.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what's your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what would be your next favorite holiday?
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, let me see, um, mm, ah, [NOISE] [SIGH] Halloween.
R:  Halloween?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I've always enjoyed Halloween as a child.  I -- I -- I did.  I -- I enjoyed Halloween, even though it's a little bit different [SIGH] today, but I still enjoy Halloween.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Ah, th- one day [SIGH] to put on a costume [SIGH] and be able to go out and act crazy and nobody's gonna say anything.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's fine.  I do have a lot of fun on Halloween.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [SIGH] and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know what -- and I -- I thought it was great.  I really like collecting all the candy and all that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- good stuff like that [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, if you didn't get no candy we'd throw eggs against your door.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or toilet paper.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, we used toilet paper.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That wasn't too bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well -- when we lived out -- we lived out on like -- well, I used to live in, ah, Queens.  So, that's like considered part of the suburbs.  [SIGH]  Then we use the toilet paper on people's lawns and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But in the city, ah, you know, you just throw eggs against their door and say, "We'll fix you.  You ain't give us nothing". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Okay you'll be scraping this egg off tomorrow".  [LAUGH]  Because it was hard to clean egg off your door, you know.  [LAUGH]  It dried.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, we used to soap windows.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, soap windows?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-hum.
