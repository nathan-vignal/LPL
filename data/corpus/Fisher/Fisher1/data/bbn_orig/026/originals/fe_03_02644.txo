R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hello, this is Michelle calling from Brooklyn, New York.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, this is Melanie calling from Boston.  How are you doing, Michelle?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Pretty good.
R:  How's everything in Boston --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now?
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.  I -- I don't know what the weather is like by you guys, but it's gorgeous here.
R:  [NOISE]  It's sunny but it's a little on the cool side.
L:  [NOISE]  A little cool, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And wind.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, definitely.  [NOISE]
R:  It's still holding on to winter here.  I don't know why.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I know.  It seems like it's already in May and here we are still.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, we're still struggling.
L:  [NOISE]  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [SIGH]  So, the topic is holiday.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, Do -- do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Yeah, um, I would have to say my favorite holiday is Halloween.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  And I know people t- think that's weird.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, w- what -- what are some of your memories or reasons for liking Halloween?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I just like the whole idea of Halloween that everyone has a chance to just go crazy -- go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with the masks and the -- I'm really into, you know, the carnival aspect of it.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  It would be -- especially, um, do you have Halloween parades in Boston?
L:  Yeah, well I don't know if they're parades but, I mean there's a lot of parties and stuff going on.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, is there a specific, like, Halloween parade in New York?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you gone in it before?
R:  Yes, yes, yes.  It's crazy.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, I think Halloween's gonna be on Friday this year, so this year should be really interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, like a million or two million people come out --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- dressed as crazy as they want to be --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm talking about wigs and [PAUSE] [SIGH] glitter and [PAUSE] [NOISE] sexual toys.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  So, what is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what has been something like your wildest costumes that you've worn?
R:  I haven't worn any costumes.  I'm just -- I just go to --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- look at everyone else.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so do you -- do you go in the parade, or do you just like watch the parade go by?
R:  I usually watch -- 
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- try to watch from the sidelines or --
L:  Oh, fine.  [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a couple from -- I -- I think the first time I went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it was so crowded --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the police were discouraging people from [PAUSE] even like going along that route.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we just like -- we were a couple of blocks over and we were watching people and stuff -- so, yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  [NOISE]  [SIGH] Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, I don't know, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- it's candy -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can -- you can't hate any ol- old holiday that, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- advocates candy.  [LAUGH]
L:  R- exactly.  [LAUGH]  I agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wel- well, I think for me I'd probably have to say, [SIGH] -- I just -- I would probably have to say Thanksgiving, even though in some ways I loathe it because it's kind of like the gluttonous side of [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, us in the States.  But in other ways it seems -- it's a lot more low key than Christmas is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you get like a three -- you know, four day weekend usually and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- just hang out with friends and so -- it's a good time but [SIGH] -- and, yeah, I mean good food, you just kind of lounge around all weekend and   [LAUGH]
R:  And if you're into sports you have so much things to watch on TV.  Yeah.
L:  Right, exactly.  Exactly, so -- [SIGH] I don't know but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So if you -- if you could create a holiday would it be similar to Halloween?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, if I could create a holiday and I just thought of this as the -- the, um, automated, um, voice was speaking -- 
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's like [LAUGH] oh! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, not a lot of prep time.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Think about it but --
R:  The first -- the first thing I thought of was my birthday should be a national holiday.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  And it might get --
L:  When's your birthday?
R:  January twenty third.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, there you go!
R:  Pardon?
L:  My brother's is January twenty fourth, so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, two Aquarians.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, wel- well, that would be awesome.  What would you do f- -- what would your like --
R:  Ah?
L:  -- theme be for your birthday?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just want everybody to have the day off with pay.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  And, hopefully, the weather will be nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I could control the weather, it should be like ninety degrees.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For that one day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Wouldn't that be amazing in New York in January?  Right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  People would be out sunbathing all day long.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And just everybody no restrictions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody do what you want to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- within like, you know, legal limits of course. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I mean you don't have to come out and -- and bow to me or anything --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just enjoy the day.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you want, like, people to salute you while they walk by?
R:  Oh, no, that's -- that's -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that would be nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a card or happy birthday --
L:  [MN]
R:  --for Michelle, would suffice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, nice.  Nice.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's about it.  A present -- well, that's really nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, gosh, I -- I too -- it's hard to -- [LAUGH] it's hard to come up with one.  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  I think the main thing is just, yeah, everybody have a day off with pay, and [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know what I would call it.  It think, you know, the birthday thing's a good idea.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure what else I'd go on but, um, [SIGH] yeah, or maybe sometime in, like, February, January, February would be nice because the winters get so long --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just have a like a three or four day weekend.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like some winter [LIPSMACK] wonder break, or something --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]  And everyone can [SIGH] just you know, relax and get out of work, and [LIPSMACK] and kind of do something nice for themself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I feel like it's a long break from Christmas to like s- spring break in April.
R:  I know.
L: [SIGH]  Or like from New Year's I guess 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [NOISE] so, it's interesting, but  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I mean you have the little holidays in between like President's Day --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Right.
R:  -- and stuff like that. [MN] 
L:  Do you guys get those off in [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- New York?
R:  Well, um, normal people --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with, ah, really good jobs get them off.  [LAUGH]
L:  With salary.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, with salary get those off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Which probably is in essence why we're doing the phone thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, yeah.  [LAUGH]  There you go!  [LAUGH]
L:  There you go!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But other people in New York --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like normal --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- just [NOISE] people don't get it off.  Yeah.
R:  It -- me -- a lot of people get it off, or they have the option to, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like with -- I think what they were doing at my last job is, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you -- you just give -- they give you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like seven days --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] and whatever holiday you wanted to choose, you could choose it, you know the thing?
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  So, if you want to take President's Day, take it.
L:  Then you can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So, what's our next holiday that we have?  It's like --
R:  Memorial Day.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what you're doing for Memorial Day?
R:  Well, I'm trying to get it off from my job.  Get the day off and --
L:  Oh, nice.  [NOISE]
R:  -- hopefully the weather will con- you know, continue being warm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or at least, um, become warm I should say.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  And then if I just go to a barbecue or --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- go to the beach or something.
L:  [NOISE].  Nice.  Are there nice be- +beach -- beaches to go to outside New York City?
R:  Um, yeah, even within New York --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean there's like Coney Island Beach in Brooklyn --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, right, right.
R:  -- Manhattan Beach, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's Jones Beach --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- which, I think, is in the Bronx.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Are you familiar with New York City?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well I've been like six times, maybe but --
R:  Oh, [NOISE] okay.
L:  -- just like down town, you know, like hanging out with friends but not -- [SIGH] I didn't know like if there was beach --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know what I mean like swimming water --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- like do people go swimming?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well you won't turn green or anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I know it's New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, some of our beaches here I'm just like I grew up in California, so --
R:  Oh, you're used to 
L:  -- those beaches are what I'm used to --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and like coming out here to the East Coast I'm like, "Oh, I don't know if I want to go swimming".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, there's definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I kind of -- I've never been to California --
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I can imagine what you're used to so --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, our -- but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eastern beaches probably just suck.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Compared to what you're used to.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Well, I hope you get that day off; that would be --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- awesome, Michelle, yeah.
R:  What are you doing for Memorial Day?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] well I -- mm, I have it off 'cause I'm doing now [LAUGH] like a permanent full time job or whatever.  [SIGH]
R:  Good for you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  [LAUGH]  So, it's kind of, you know, not a paid jo- -- paid break but, um, I'm going to go -- I have a brother in Philly.  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I'm going to go, um, visit him for the weekend and I have some friends down there too.  So, that'll be nice and, um --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- think I'll just take the train down and [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] and check it out.  [SIGH]  So, yeah, it would be a good job.
R:  How long of a ride is that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Boston to Philly?
L:  Um, if i- in a car like [SIGH] usually it takes about [LIPSMACK] I'd say six or seven hours --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- probably, like six more.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm on like the south side of Boston [SIGH] and, um, so [MN] it's -- it's a little bit easier [SIGH] to get to but, um, and then in -- in the train it's about like -- I think it's about the same amount of time but you've got to like get to the station and stuff [PAUSE] so.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, that's the one thing, you know, travel -- I love taking the train but [MN] it's a little bit expensive sometimes and --
R:  Yeah, I can imagine.
L:  -- then you -- you have to get like, you know, somebody to pick you up.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all that.  [LIPSMACK]  So, yeah, we'll see.  [LAUGH]
R:  How does that work with baggage on the train?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like do they restrict you [PAUSE] on what you can bring?
L:  Well, I think you can kind of take -- I've never had like any problems as far as -- but I usually just take like one bag, you know, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because I have to take it from the subway here to the train station --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to, you know, wherever, so I just take what I can carry.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  But I think -- we've had friends who've sort of have travelled and like [LIPSMACK] stayed places longer so they've had a few bags and stuff and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they've been fine.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you thinking of going -- going somewhere?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, actually I've never been on like Amtrack --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or taken the, um, that sort of long train ride, so [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I was just wondering.  I've -- I travelled --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, um, I've been to Mexico a couple of times.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I was just wondering like how that works if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go away for a long time and can you bring like a suitcase, or  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- how would that work, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I was just wondering about that.
L:  [NOISE]  Wh- where in Mexico have you been?
R:  Ah, Punta Cana[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Do you speak Spanish and stuff?
R:  Oh, just a little bit.  Just enough --
L:  A little bit.
R:  -- to order things and --
L:  Yeah, oh, that's awesome.
R:  -- get into trouble.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Are you looking to go back sometime soon, or ?
R:  Um, no, I kind of over did it.  [LAUGH]
L:  The last time you were there?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You got in a little trouble and you're not allowed to go back there for a while?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  Yeah, right, my picture is posted up over there.  [LAUGH]  No, I think I'd just like to go some place different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think my next trip will be t- to Puerto Rico.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I hear you can get good deals like flying there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially from like New York or something.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm always on the web checking out the --
L:  I know.  Do you go to like Travelocity or ?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Travelocity.  Expedia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cheap tickets.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know them all.
L:  Price Line[?]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I wasn't really too happy with the Price Line service.
L:  Yeah.  See I don't like -- I don't like the bidding --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the whole bidding thing, [SIGH] but, um, but I've gotten some cheap tickets like I've gone -- my family's in like -- or I have some family in Los Angeles --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where I grew up [SIGH] and I've gotten tickets from Boston to Los Angeles round trip for one hundred and eighty.
R:  Whoa!
L:  Yeah, so like you can -- if you hit it right, but [SIGH] I don't -- I usually always check like Travelocity and that stuff first 'cause -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- because [LAUGH] I don't know the Price Line -- what -- what happened to you when you used Price Line?
R:  I just didn't like the whole thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought it was, you know, you hear the -- the commercial, or --
