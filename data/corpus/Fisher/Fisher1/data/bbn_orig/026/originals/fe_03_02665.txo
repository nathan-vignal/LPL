R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Louise from New York.
L:  Oh, this Omar from Saint Louis.
R:  Yes, I guess we're supposed to talk about our favorite holiday?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, so, I guess so.  It's my first time doing this.  Um, I dunno, what is your favorite holiday? [NOISE]
R:  I'd say Christmas.  I think it's because, you know, the family gets together and everybody is, you know, [MN] in a good mood and we're all celebrating.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, we usually go to church a day and then, you know, you see the excitement [NOISE] on the kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it reminds you when you were little.
L:  Yeah.  I like -- see, I like Christmas holiday  --
R:  Mhm 
L:  -- because, uh, everybody gets together.
R:  Yes.
L:  It's a little different than other holidays where you like to celebrate it wherever.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I say I was born on, er, July fourth.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So, that's a nice holiday too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I guess 'cause of Christmas, it involves everybody, you're not just celebrating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, one person.
L:  Thanksgiving and Christmas, both of those --
R:  Yes, those are good --
L:  -- for honor[?].
R:  -- because everybody is together, [MN] you know, people you haven't seen [NOISE] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- maybe all year.
L:  Exactly.  Everybody comes into town and then you get to see everybody you haven't seen.  You know, 'cause everybody's busy sort of regular --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- throughout the whole year.
R:  I think it's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, you know, I have one child but I have nieces and nephews and you see it through a child's eyes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, if you could celebrate -- you know, make up a holiday, what would that be?
L:  [MN] Ooh, I've never thought about that though.
R:  Well, I have one. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think that, you know, if we can have one holiday that we can make up, I won't be prejudiced against men, I'll say for both, 'cause there are women that do it too.  They should have a Deadbeat Parents' Day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, where you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- flash their pictures and you celebrate the parent that's there taking care of that child.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, I think if we had a Deadbeat Parents' Day and you put all the deadbeats' pictures up [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, that way you can show them what they're missing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I was thinking something -- like another family oriented holiday.
R:  Mm, that would be good, too.
L:  'Cause -- that's -- that's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that would be sorta nice, yeah, because --
R:  You can quieten[?] 'em.
L:  -- Thanksgiving -- Thanksgiving and -- and Christmas is right at the end of the year and there's nothing else for the rest of year really.
R:  Well, I mean, there's Easter or [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, but, I don't know, I mean, Easter, I don't know, there aren't too many people actually -- actually celebrate, you know, and --
R:  Yeah, I think it's more --
L:  -- feel obligated to go.
R:  -- yeah, it's more like a holy day for some people?
L:  Yeah, not a lot of other fe- -- a lot of people feel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- obligated to go and celebrate with their families.  They tend to celebrate [MN] --
R:  You know, they should have something where m- -- a family day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where just the whole --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family gets together and you're celebrating [NOISE] because you're together.
L:  Exactly.  That's -- that's what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm thinking, you know, something of family oriented that would, um, [PAUSE] that would, um, you know, k- k- -- get us back together in the middle of the year at least, you know?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that --
L:  That --
R:  You know, be -- I say, you kn-, well it should be done maybe, like, in the summer?  You know b- --
L:  Yeah, some more time it gives us.  Yeah, there's a long period.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But even -- even if they have to -- eve- if you consider Easter, between Easter and what's the next holiday that's really -- 
R:  And Thanksgiving that's a long --
L:  -- Thanksgiving, that's a really long break.  So --
R:  Yeah, they should have one day, you know, where we all get together and you put your differences aside and you get together as a family.
L:  Exactly.  Because of the -- I mean, that's why a lot of families nowadays have, uh, a lot of, you know, black areas that they don't know about, you know?  A lot o- --
R:  Because they only get together t- --
L:  -- they're distant from each other.
R:  Yeah, they see each other twice a year, if they're lucky.
L:  And that's not enough.
R:  No, I think they should have it -- they should make it a legal day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where you just celebrate being together as a family.
L:  Exactly.  That's --
R:  You know, you could talk about what you did between [LAUGH] Christmas and then.  [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  Talk about your life. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Say hello  -- tell 'em what's going on.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I said, that you tell your family what's going --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- on in your life, yeah, that's it, you know?  Because, you know, -- you -- y- you just -- you come home and people don't know what you've been doing, what you've been going through for the last, you know, eight months, six months and --
R:  Yeah, I mean we have a Fathers' Day --
L:  [MN] Thanksgiving. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, we have a Mothers' Day, but it should be something for the whole family where everybody is included.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, you don't have to -- you know, I'm not saying give out presents, nothing like that, just celebrate that we're here, we're alive and we're together.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, that's j- -- it should be something of a non religious, um, factor, I think too.
R:  Because nowadays --
L:  'Cause you have family -- you have families that are not all of the same back- background of religion too.
R:  Yes, they're insi- -- you have a lot of families that could be raised one way, but it's, like, interfaced [COUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- where they celebrate Easter and some also celebrate Passover.  So, it should be a day that there's no religion involved.
L:  Yes.
R:  [COUGH] It's just family.
L:  Yeah-huh, that's what I think.  Because, I mean, there's a lot of people that might get left out because there's Easter and they're not Catholic or, you know, they're not Christian and they're married to a Christian or, you know, things of that sort.  Or their parents are Christian and they're not Christian, you know?  They decided to take another path, so they get left out.  You know, the whole rest of the family is sitting together, you know, being happy and they're sitting out there, just, okay --
R:  [NOISE] And that's true too.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, I mean, at least this day there's no pressure of, "Okay, well, I'm going to see the family so I have to go to church with them" or "I have to, you know, do what they want".  I mean, if you had family day whe- -- you can have a barbecue, you can -- or bring whatever you want.  And it's just like a, you know, a relaxing day where you catch up on what's been going on in each other's lives the last couple of months.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I think that would make a good day.
L:  Yeah, that's true --
R:  And they can, you know, they can even post it or send out little invitations you can make up on the computer.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  They could do that and, I mean, it's just, [MN] some, I don't know, I just figure that there should -- it should be something during a warm weather, I think.  'Cause, you know, during winter you're all hidden in the house and you can't do anything, it gets crowded.  It'd be nice, you know, something warm would be nice.  In summer or -- or in the -- something turn time it's warm and enjoy, you know, going outside and enjoying --
R:  Mm, you can have a --
L:  -- you know what I'm saying? [NOISE]
R:  -- big picnic, a barbecue, you know, in the summer it's more warmer.  You can go to the -- you know, even at the parks.
L:  Yeah, it's different than the other holidays that we have --
R:  Well --
L:  -- which are in the winter and cold.
R:  -- it's not stressful and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, with Christmas it's more like, "Okay ... " --
L:  Yeah, I m- --
R:  You know, you gotta get the perfect gift and what if they don't like it?  And, or I don't like this one, so I [LAUGH] I --
L:  There's so much pressure. [LAUGH]
R:  -- still gotta get, you know, get this one a gift, even though I like them.
L:  [NOISE] You gotta clean up the house and make sure everything looks perfect so, you know, nobody makes a comment and --
R:  Yes, it's more like --
L:  It's too much pressure.
R:  -- commercial than really being a family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I would agree with that, that they should --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, if we can make up a holiday it should be a family day.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, and not just for the in- -- you know, intermediate family, but [NOISE] distant cousins, like a big, you know, one day a year the whole family, like a big family reunion.  You get together and you just have fun and you don't worry about, "Okay, I gotta ... " -- you know, what we're gonna do.
L:  [MN]
R:  Just something that's outdoors and relaxing.
L:  Yeah. I was saying, [MN] another thing I was gonna add, should be not just immediate immediate family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, yeah, y-  you've got families that are, you know, of adoptive -- adopted kids and so forth.  You know, if you just make it sound like it's a family family day, you know, then those kids might be left out, you know, once they find out they're really not part of the family, they're adopted, you know?  You kn- --
R:  Yeah, well they should make it where it's extended family also.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, if you're -- you're my cousin, brother, sister w- in law, whatever it is, uncle, third uncle, fourth uncle, this is where everybody gets together and they feel, you know, they're all part of that one large family.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, even the step brothers and wh- half sisters [LAUGH] or whatever it is, happens to be, but they're just all together and you're celebrating the fact that you can be together and, you know, just, I guess, you make it a fun day.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly. [MN] 
R:  Where there's no pressure to -- you have to cook a ham because it's Easter or you have to cook Matzahs because it's Passover.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know ...
L:  I know, I know.  There's a lot of pressures with all the holidays that we have nowadays.
R:  It is.
L:  You know, like Easter you have to have the eggs, I mean you got t- turkey for Thanksgiving and then, [MN] um, Fourth of July you've gotta have the fireworks, you know, the barbecue, it's ju- just crazy, you know?  You just need a holiday where you could just -- it's a really no -- a holiday that actually everybody celebrates.
R:  Yeah, just like, you know --
L:  And --
R:  -- like a day we can, you know, everybody can get together.  Whether it's going to the park or, you know, just picking a, like, a small trip that you're just doing something together.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And there's no pressure that the food has to be perfect and this has to be perfect and who are we gonna invite?  And if we don't invite this one, you know, just getting together as a family, like y- -- you know, like you do it on Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, but just getting together to say, "I love you, I'm happy to be part of the family" [COUGH].  You know, whether it's your fourth or fifth uncle.  You know, just that everybody feels this is something --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Right, kinda like a f- --
R:  -- that they can come together with.
L:  Kinda like a family reunion day.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, 'cause there's no commercial pressure on it.  It's just everybody getting together.  And --
R:  Then you don- -- you don't have it, well --
L:  -- and just celebrating it, you know?
R:  Yeah, being a part of that family and, you know, 'cause nowadays with Easter and everything it's, like, you have to -- it's judged on, I guess, you know, you have to have the ham and you have to do this and you have to do that.
L:  Gotta have the draught[?] and you gotta have the candy.
