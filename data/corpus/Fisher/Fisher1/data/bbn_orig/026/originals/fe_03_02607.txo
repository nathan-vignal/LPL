R:  Hi --
L:  Hi, my name's Nathan.
R:  Hey, Nathan, this is Jonathan.
L:  Hi, Jonathan.  So ...
R:  Hi.  Well, I guess our topic is, uh, the arms, uh -- or is -- is it arms inspections in Iraq --
L:  Well, my --
R:  -- or is it disarmament at this point, I guess?
L:  Yeah.  I think I guess that would be it.
R:  Yeah, 'cause arms inspections, that seems a little bit moot at this point.  Uh, well, as far as the -- the, uh, c- continued disarmament, obviously we're -- we're trying to find these weapons of mass destruction.  They're looking very --
L:  Yes, I have some -- some thoughts that, uh, we won't find too much, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think most of it's been, uh, ferried out of the country or been destroyed.
R:  Where do you think it's been ferried to?
L:  Ah, Syria and, uh, Iran.
R:  And do you think that there -- I mean, has our intelligence -- uh, why haven't we had any sort of further corroboration of this?  Why -- why didn't we pick this up when it was happening?
L:  Um, that I don't know.  I think we weren't -- we just missed something, that we were just so focused on finding Hussein himself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that the -- sort of like the ants ran out underneath while we were looking for the queen.
R:  So, as -- as far as with our surveillance, the satellites, all of the -- the sur- -- the surveillance of the -- the ground communications, you think we still allowed that to happen, though?
L:  I -- I don't -- yes, I do, actually, because, um, hey, they -- they found a pipeline that no one knew about.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, hiding a pipeline, that's pretty hard to do.
R:  Right.
L:  So, if in that kind of situation, I mean, especially knowing what I know about the, uh, the way oil is shipped through a pipeline --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wouldn't be hard to containerize something and run it through the same pipeline.
R:  So, they could've -- so that it didn't require any vehicles then?  It was something that could've been done just through that pipeline?
L:  That's a possibility.
R:  Mm.
L:  Also with the amount of traffic that goes in and out of, uh, Iraq, because it had such porous borders --
R:  Right.
L:  -- especially with Syria --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and the amount of trucks -- bless you.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Um, I -- I think that it's not hard to move small things like that.  'Cause how big does a -- does something like that need to be, okay?
R:  Right.
L:  Especially chemical weapons.
R:  Right.  All the more -- I mean, all the anthrax that they were talking about.
L:  Yeah, but still they -- they, um, what was it they found?  Uh, before, um, when they showed how --
R:  Traced it.
L:  -- even using a mobile laboratory that was in the back of an eighteen wheeler --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they could make enough anthrax to destroy [LAUGH] a -- a large area.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that was really disturbing.  Do you think the Iranians are -- do you think that they would've really dealt with the Iranians in that way, the -- the Iraqi government?  Do you think the -- I mean, Syria I could see that that's a possibility because [COUGH] -- but Iran, it still seems like there was a lot of [COUGH] antagonism between the two countries.
L:  I -- I wouldn't say it's with the official Iranian government --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but with, um, probably some sort of splinter group that's based in the area.
R:  Right, one of the --
L:  Uh, I don't wanna say Al Qaeda because I -- I -- you know, but something along that lines, um, some type of militants that are just camped out in -- in -- in the deserts.
R:  Right.  How do you --
L:  Even though I don't know if it's all desert and all that, so ...
R:  Right.  Well, I mean, I think it -- obviously the -- you know, we -- we've gotten rid of a regime that was rotten to the core and was probably one of the most brutal regimes of the twentieth century, so I don't -- hopefully people are not shedding any tears.  But what is the -- the way for us to do this?  I mean, if you look at what we've done, I guess, in other countries, we still have troops in Germany, we still have troops in Japan, you know, and that was almost sixty years ago.
L:  Well, my -- yeah, I -- I sort of feel that this whole bit is, um, American imperialism.  Um, but it's -- it's like the, um, the rise of the American empire, uh, being the only world superpower --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- but we have a different way of empire building.  We -- we go in, we take over, we say, "It would be nice for you to be democratic.  We'll help you along those lines", and then we generally -- we even let them be, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sucking off the profits as best we can.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't -- like, I don't know how we're going to, uh -- I guess there's one thing that was a little bit upsetting to a lot of people, was the way that I guess Halliburton and -- and Bectel[?] had these -- these contracts awarded to them, and there was no -- and they were closed to the -- we really don't understand the way that the bidding process went and how these companies were chosen rather than others.
L:  That and when I read in the paper that Exxon Mobil just had their best quarter ever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, what was it --
R:  And the British Petroleum, all of them did.
L:  -- Ch- Chevron Texaco announced today record earnings.
R:  Right.
L:  And I look at what I'm paying at the gas pump and I'm going, "Why?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, these people are just raping us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least, the one I'm looking at.
R:  It's true.  I mean, it's -- it's -- I would think that, you know, it -- that's -- that's an old sort of I guess paranoid delusion that people say, "Well, you know, at this point can't we have come up -- couldn't we have come up with some kind of an alternative to oil?"  But it's like, you know, we went through the oil shocks of the seventies and then oil got very cheap in the eighties.  We went through the oil shocks of the original Gulf War, and oil was very cheap in the nineties and the economy went fine.  And then oil seems -- you know, there seems to be obviously a -- might be oversimplifying but seems like the, you know, the -- the -- the -- the economy started to go soft here, uh, when oil prices started to go up again.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I am -- I work for a company that's -- that's very heavy -- an extremely heavy, uh, oil user.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I work for a railroad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And our stock price plummeted because our -- our oil or the cost of fuel went up twenty cents a gallon.
R:  Right, and look what it's doing to the airlines, too.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, and twenty cents a gallon to us, I mean, a locomotive uses a lot of fuel.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's --
L:  Even though it still is cheaper than trucking.
R:  Right.  I mean, it's [COUGH] -- what do they say?  It's for every penny that gasoline goes up in price it's a billion dollars out of other -- out of, uh, the economy for other things?
L:  Hm, I didn't know that.
R:  I -- I heard that somewhere.  It's, uh, it's pretty scary.  You know, for every penny that -- you know, that's a billion dollars less that are gonna be spent on other goods and services that would be a lot more productive probably for our economy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, especially considering most of the oil companies now are -- are based offshore.
R:  Sure.
L:  Uh, I think only there's one or two of the majors left in the US and everybody else is offshore.
R:  Yeah.  It's really -- and wh- -- but the problem is, is okay, now that we're gonna have the oil flowing again, you know, look at everybody -- I mean, my car, you know, I'm as guilty as anybody.  My -- my -- I have an SUV.  My -- I get less mileage now than I did probably fifteen years ago when I drove a -- a compact car.
L:  Yeah, I'm in the same way.  I drive a SUV, too, so ...
R:  Yeah, so we're all -- I mean, we're all guilty of this.
L:  But I guess I have a good excuse.  I live on a farm and I kinda need one. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I don't need one at all where I live.  There's no reason for it.  And I'm a lot of times the only passenger in it, too.
L:  Well, I am, too, and I have a long commute to work every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it would make sense for me to buy a small car to drive back and forth to work and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- keep the truck on the farm, but who wants to?
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  And I guess --
R:  That's the thing, we don't -- you know, we -- a lot of -- I guess there's some -- some sort of -- you know, I'm as much of a hypocrite as anybody.  I complain about it and yet I'm wasting gasoline and so that's -- you know, as long as we're gonna be wasting gasoline and it's -- it's demand driven, it's almost like a dr- -- like drugs, you know?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  People don't demand them, then -- then there's no getting -- there's not gonna be a -- a -- a need to supply them.  There's not gonna be the -- the -- the willingness to supply something for which there's no demand obviously doesn't exist.
L:  No, I -- the -- the, um, the big car companies are working on different approaches.
R:  Right, the -- yeah.
L:  And GM and BMW have just agreed to a, uh, common method of -- uh, for hydrogen delivery.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is -- which is a -- a major.
R:  It's promising, but you know, I guess there's a couple -- even -- more immediately the -- the hybrids are already up and running and they work very well.  I mean, a lot of these hybrids --
L:  Yeah, and we're gonna see a lot more hybrids.
R:  I hope so, 'cause -- 'cause I know Ford has reneged.  They were -- they were talking about increasing their fuel efficiency I think something like twenty five percent, and they just downgraded that.
L:  Yeah, we're gonna see a lot more, um, hybrids in -- especially in trucks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, a lot more mainstream vehicles are gonna be hybrid instead of odd looking Honda Insights and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- Toyota Previces[?] and things like that.
R:  Yeah, something that'll be a little more marketable to the -- the average driver.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- or even, you know, these natural gas vehicles that are out there, too.  I mean, there's --
L:  The problem with that is the delivery.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The infrastructure's so in place for the oil industry.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it's unbelievable the infrastructure that's in place to deliver gasoline in this -- in this country.
R:  Sure.
L:  And, uh, that's one thing they have to overcome with any other delivery system.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  And then hydrogen, where are you gonna get the hydrogen from?  Are you gonna take the hydrogen out of the petroleum?
R:  Exactly, yeah.  That's --
L:  Or are you gonna use electricity to, uh, uh, crack water and take the hydrogen out of it? [LAUGH]
R:  I think they say they're gonna use -- the -- the cheapest way to do it is using natural gas, from what I recall, which is something luckily that we have, you know, pretty substantial domestic supplies of.  So, you know, I guess we have enough in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it's amazing that, you know, the internal combustion engine, there hasn't been any real improvement in that, in the -- in the internal combustion engine in what, you know?  We've been using the -- the same fundamental technology for over a hundred years now.
