L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Christie.  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Anne.
R:  Hi, Anne. [LAUGH] Um, okay, we have to talk about disarming Iraq?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, well, uh, I think it's good.  You're probably anti war like everybody else, right?
L:  No, I'm not. [LAUGH]
R:  You're not? [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Where -- where are you from? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in LA.
L:  Me too.  Well, I'm in -- near Pasadena, actually, so ...
R:  Oh, I'm, um, close to Hollywood, east of Hollywood.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Silverlake.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what was the topic again?
L:  Uh, do you think --
R:  What --
L:  What should the USA do about Iraq, if anything?  Should they disarm?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Which -- is it a priority?
R:  Should they disarm 'em?  Well, I think we already have disarmed Iraq.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.
R:  You know, and there's a controversy about whether they were armed with mass, you know, destruction weapons in the first place, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I think a lot of people were like, "Well, there were no, you know, mass weapons anyways", you know, and some people thought there were.  I kind of thought there probably were, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then at the same time I think, um, Bush just wanted to get rid of Hussein 'cause his dad didn't do it the first time, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Right?
L:  Yeah, I'm sure that's --
R:  That too.
L:  -- part of it.  I don't think it's all oil, like everybody says, so, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Like my boyfriend.  We're like totally opposites on this subject and fight about it.
R:  Really?  He thinks it's all about oil?
L:  Oh, yeah.  He thinks it's all about oil, you know, and that Bush --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- is just a big oilman and, you know.  I don't -- I don't care if it is even about oil, at least they're -- they're, you know, doing something for the people over there.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's -- that's what's important.  Doesn't matter --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- how it started out, you know.
R:  There -- it -- it's a -- it's a -- it's a touchy subject, but it's -- it's -- it's more than just oil, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that may have a part of it --
L:  Well, for France --
R:  -- but then again, you know --
L:  -- for France and Russia it's oil [LAUGH] but that's why they didn't want us to get involved.  They have oil contracts there, you know.
R:  Oh, and Russia?
L:  Yeah, Russia and France have oil contracts with -- with Iraq.
R:  Oh, see.  See, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah, that's why --
R:  France a b- [LAUGH] -- France a bunch of sissies, you know.  You see, it's all -- hm.
L:  You know, France has their banking system hooked up with Iraq's banking system, too.
R:  Really?
L:  They have -- yeah, they have a vested interest in Saddam's regime, so ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That's why they don't ...
R:  But then again, somebody told me one day, you know, even if it is about oil ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're not gonna get anything -- we're not gonna get it anyways, you know.
L:  Right, right, they're --
R:  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're trying to --
R:  So --
L:  We're trying to save the oilfields for the Iraqi people so they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- will have their income and everything.  And, you know, my boyfriend's big thing is so that, "Well, we have all our people ov- -- and our companies over there quote helping them and, you know, that -- that there's gonna be a lot of money made off of -- of Iraq" but maybe there is, maybe there isn't, I don't know, but so what, as long as it's helping the people in the long run? [NOISE]
R:  Helping the people, right, right.  In the long run, that's what I thought.  You know, just the way they live in the first place, you know, with palaces and -- and everybody else suffering, you know --
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  -- I mean, that's another reason, you know, we're there.  Nobody else is gonna go in and -- you know, and handle it. [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
L:  Right, it's --
R:  You know, we were the ones that had to say, "All right, you know".
L:  Yeah, it's like -- it's like they have, you know, a hiar- hierarchy there and then a bunch of peasants, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the very rich and the very poor.  I mean, even the poor here are mostly better off than -- you know, than they are.
R:  Than a lot of other places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  It was so sad.  I was watching this one little kid that went -- tried to go to school and all the schools are still closed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] It was the one boy that showed up in school and, you know, it's part of war.  I mean, you know, they're gonna have to redo everything, you know, and re set up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever, you know, they're gonna do.
L:  Yeah, there's definitely --
R:  But --
L:  -- a lot of adjustments.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- and it was hard to hear about, you know, our boys dying over there and, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah, that was really hard.  They were so young, too.
L:  Yeah, and I have --
R:  That was, you know --
L:  -- I have, you know, a -- a son who's gonna be eighteen next month, you know, and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I thought, "Oh, my God, you know, that's, like, near his age" and ...
R:  Oh, I know, can you imagine?  And have you done of these other, um, topics?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You have?
L:  Yeah.  This is my third call.  I guess they won't let me do any more after this one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] That's cool.  I haven't had them call me.  I just call in.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I -- the first time they called me and the other times I've just called in.  It's easier because then you don't have to worry about, "Oh, did I miss them calling 'cause I wasn't home when I said I was gonna be?"
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  It's easier to call yourself and ...
R:  That's cool, yeah.
L:  I can't get my boyfriend to sign up, though.  He's so sk- skeptical.
R:  Oh, my God.  Me neither.  I can't, it's so frustrating.
L:  He -- he says, "Oh", he says, "They're not gonna ever pay you, you know" and ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's so frustrating.  I almost have to dial the number and stick the phone on his damn ear, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and he -- then he doesn't wanna give his social security number either, you know.
R:  And he's like, "No, no, no, I don't want to do it now.  No, nah, nah, nah" you know.
L:  I got one friend to sign up so far but --
R:  And both him and I can use the -- the ten, thirty bucks [LAUGH] like --
L:  Yeah, that's what I said.  It's gas money.
R:  -- unbelievable, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well -- well, he works as a sidekick --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he doesn't make a dollar a minute, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right, right, exactly.
L:  -- doing that.
R:  Yeah.  What do you do?
L:  I -- I run an after school program.
R:  A what?
L:  An after school program.
R:  Oh, that's neat.  That's really good.
L:  I don't know if you're familiar with proposition forty nine that was on the November ballot?
R:  Wow.  Well, that --
L:  But -- but it's one of those enrichment programs.
R:  Oh, we [inaudible] stay on the subject. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.  I was just thinking the same thing.
R:  Yeah, I work part time, like, you know, like, just it's all on call stuff, so it's really, you know, this ten dollars or whatever helps, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  But anyways, so, yeah, I'm glad to hear that somebody totally agrees with me.  There's so much --
L:  Well, you know what?  I think really the --
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  -- the people that are doing the -- the marches and stuff, they're really a minority.  They're just so vocal.  You know --
R:  Right, that's true.  That's what I think, too.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  That's what I think, and on the other --
L:  -- because most people I talk to, you know, would agree with me.
R:  Right, and --
L:  My boyfriend's kinda liberal.  He's from Canada, so, you know --
R:  Yeah, and the media hypes it up, there's protests in this country, over here, over there, you know, [LAUGH] like, you know.  But --
L:  Well, a lot of the European countries have lost their morality, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's what it is.
R:  Well, most of the European countries were for us except for France, but, you know, as far as I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, and -- and I've listened to a lot of talk radio, too, you know, and there's a lot of people out there who are conservative, you know, who ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who are for it, you know, and I listen to Larry Elder, you know, KBC, and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff, but -- but it's funny because it's like the information I'm getting from talk radio is, like, totally different from what -- whatever information my boyfriend's giving.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, because everything he'll say he'll -- he'll say --
R:  Well, he's watching the regular news like the rest of us. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, he'll say it as a fact, you know, but -- but then I believe what I hear as a fact, you know, and it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, [LAUGH] you know, everybody cannot be right, so some of it has to be lies, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  That's true, that's true.
L:  It's like -- or it's just the way you skew things, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He [SIGH] just drives me crazy sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I'm sure he's probably frustrated with me, too, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're thinking the other one is pigheaded and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but he is just so against the war.
R:  Well, if he won't call in and neither will mine, then men are just such children, [LAUGH] it's all I've gotta say.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the first person I talked to was a guy but --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.
L:  But I -- I talked to -- I've talked to Pennsylvania and Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so it's gonna be people all over?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  That's neat.  Like, how's the weather over there and ...? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then talk about the topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you gotten a check yet or ...?
L:  Well, this -- this is a -- no, not yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, well ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the first call was on Sunday.
R:  We are talking about Iraq, [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how -- how, um, we both think it was -- it was very sad, you know, about, you know, the people that we lost and stuff, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of course there's gonna be casualties, you know.
L:  Yeah, and it's sad about the -- the civilians, but in every war --
R:  Sure.  True.
L:  -- you know, there -- there have been civilian casualties.  It's not on purpose, you know.  But -- but, like, people --
R:  Sure, but that's part -- you know, that's --
L:  But Saddam has killed a lot more people than were killed in this war.
R:  True.
L:  You know, of his --
R:  He's killed a lot more people just in everyday lives, I think, you know.
L:  Yeah, of his own people, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And his sons, too.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, his one -- his one son was so evil.
R:  And the whole way they just took over the country to begin with, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- I mean, it -- it was basically a military coup or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, him and his sons just took over the country.
L:  Well -- well --
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it is true that the US kind of --
R:  That's straight mafia style. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is true that the US kind of set -- helped set him up at first, you know, but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but it was the lesser of two evils at the time, you know --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- which is -- that's, you know, happened with some other dictators, too, and I don't know -- we don't know who they're gonna get in there now, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  He could end up --
R:  You see, that's the thing, you know.  Here we go again, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he could end up bad eventually.
R:  We got of the rid of the worst guy and put this guy in, this guy's pretty bad.
L:  Because the -- the thing is these people are not used to having a democracy.
