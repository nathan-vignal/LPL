L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, uh, my name is Cory.
L:  Hi, I'm Jen.  How you doing?
R:  Good.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  Not bad.
R:  [MN] Uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so we're -- we're supposed to talk about holidays?
L:  Yeah, I guess.  Um, do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Um, I -- I -- I really am not religious personally, so, um, ho- -- like, holidays, the ones that I like are, like, Halloween and, uh, like, Fourth of July, like, fun holidays. [MN]
L:  I like Fourth of July a lot.  Halloween I haven't really celebrated in, uh, a while.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just, uh --
R:  It's like a kids' holiday.  But, uh --
L:  But, um, yeah.  I mean, I'm not religious either.  Christmas is fun but, you know, for different reasons, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Just, uh, the get together aspect of it and, you know, but I don't, uh, go to church or anything. [MN]
R:  Yeah, me -- I -- I don't either but -- yah, but, um, I think a lot about Christmas is a lot of, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] It's all about, you know, presents.  It's really not about much anything --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- anymore to most people. [LAUGH] So ...
L:  Exactly.  Which is fine with me, you know?  As long as, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's, uh, enjoyable for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible] celebrate it, you know?
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  It's fine.  But, uh, I don't know, what'd they say, like, you could create a holiday?  That's kinda interesting.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know.
L:  [MN] I --
R:  What w- -- what would you do?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I would just [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's, again, all about, you know, the party aspect of it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Get together with people and, um, celebrate.  But I would, uh, I don't really a -- an idea in terms of, uh, what the, uh, occasion would actually be.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [MN] I think, like, uh, like, Earth Day was always a really good idea, but it kind of, uh, never really -- like, I don't even know when it is actually. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  But, like, a whole planting a tree, you know, whatever --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's in June sometime.  And they actually do a thing for it in New York City, which is where I live.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They have stuff for that, you know, every year I hear about it but, uh, you know, I'm not really a hippy and it seems --
R:  Neither am I --
L:  -- like [LAUGH] --
R:  -- no, no, no. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it seems like that's the whole, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, [MN] you know, Earth Day is just for hippies really.
R:  Right, right, right, right.
L:  It seems that way.  Just -- I mean, [MN] not to stereotype --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but just people that are into that all that.
R:  Right.
L:  And activists about that actually, uh, go out of their way for something like that.  But, uh, I don't know [MN], um ...
R:  What other holidays --
L:  [NOISE] It's kinda cool.
R:  Valentine's Day, most people are very bitter about that holiday. [LAUGH] It's not really --
L:  I am usually but, uh, not anymore.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  'Cause I --
R:  Are you married now or somethi- --
L:  No, I'm not but I'm with someone now, so Valentine's Day won't be a bitter holiday anymore.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But it usually is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, yeah, at a -- again then it all depends, you know?  You can only celebrate it if you're in a relationship otherwise, uh, it's not really a holiday.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  But, uh, I don't know, that was kind of an interesting question that I just don't know how to answer it.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I mean --
L:  About creating a holiday.
R:  [MN] Um, I don't know.  I mean, I -- I guess I'd [inaudible] almost like everybody has created their own holiday in their birthday, [inaudible] you can celebrate it however you like.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN] Um, but, yeah, I'm trying --
L:  But I don't, you know, I have an idea.  They should create a holiday so that everybody can be lazy without feeling bad and call it Watch TV Day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And you do nothing but sit at home and watch really bad TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like the Game Show Network all day long.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a great holiday.
L:  That's my holiday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Seriously, it should just be Watch TV Day.  And then no one has to feel bad about being a lazy bum.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just for day.  Order food for three meals --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and don't leave your barcalounger.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's my holiday.
R:  That's a good holiday, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Hopefully that will be taken into consideration.  That, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if I ever hear of that I'll know, uh, hopefully they'll pay me for the idea.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Oh, I'm trying to think.  Um, what other holidays are there? [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I think that the holidays that are, like, in celebration of people that did good things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like Martin Luther King Day --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ... But tho- those aren't -- end up -- tha- that ends up being just, like, all about black people.  Um ...
L:  Yeah [MN], those kinds of holidays and that and President's Day, those are the kind of holiday that are just excuses at this point in time.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Like, the meaning is lost, they're excuse to get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out of school and work.
R:  Right.
L:  Because they're federal national holidays, but they don't actually, you know, as far as I know, they don't, um, celebrate the actual person.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, President's Day, it used to be, like, I guess, [MN] it wasn't always called that.
R:  Right.
L:  It would be --
R:  It was, like, Washington --
L:  Washington's Birthday, Lincoln's Birthday --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then they combined them because they only wanted to give people one day off. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they made it, you know, "Oh they're birthdays are close, let's combine" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's like people who's birthdays are near Christmas, "Let's combine" you know?
R:  Right, right, right, right.
L:  Those, uh, those holidays don't seem to have the meaning that they're supposed to, you know?
R:  Right.  [MN] Well, New Years is a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good holiday, I guess, then.
L:  New Years is a good party holiday, but, uh, I don't really enjoy it anymore because I -- I can't seem to find people to hang out with that don't, like, drink too much.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Every -- everyone I know seems to not know what their alcohol limit is for some reason.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's always a problem on a holiday like New Years.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I had a party at my house for New Years a couple of years ago and I'll never do that again. [SIGH] 
L:  Never.
R:  Never again. [LAUGH]
L:  Never.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No point in allowing drunk people into your house to trash it as they -- as they fit--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as they see fit.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  But, uh [NOISE], yeah.  That's -- that's the problem with New Years, is that it can be fun but so many people just don't know how to handle it.  Don't -- they don't know how to handle holidays where it's, like, you know, it's, uh, common to drink, so, "Okay, let's drink" but, let's -- why drink till you get sick?
R:  Right, right, right.  You're supposed to just drink to have a good time, not to, like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- get totally -- be wasted. [SIGH] 
L:  Exactly.  But I don't know, I guess it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, you know, my Ir- --
R:  The nature of the beast. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- my Irish blood and my choice of friends, I don't know. [MN]
R:  [MN] Oh, so you -- so do you -- do you celebrate Saint Patrick's Day then too?
L:  I used to, but I don't drink anymore so, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't really.  I mean, you know, Saint Patrick's Day is another one, it's an excuse to get drunk.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not really about Saint Patrick who, admittedly, I don't really know who he was [LAUGH] --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just know it's an Irish holiday and, you know, used to be fun.  But again, it's one of those, like, "Let's get trashed and fall down" holidays and I don't really do that, so ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um --
R:  But I think that's the whole -- the whole point of, like, the New Years -- like, the New Years' resolution that's, like, a, you know, it's a good idea and some people actually do hold up to them. [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, um, or even, like, uh, like, the idea of Lent, um, and that, you know, that you have to give up something for a while.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] I think it's a g- -- I mean, it's a good idea especially if you believe, you know --
L:  In those things.
R:  -- in all that.  [MN] Like, you know --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I [MN] -- I believe in God but I'm not religious --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I don't -- I don't follow Lent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't go to Church on Easter and, you know --
R:  Yeah, I'm the same way.
L:  -- maybe I'm going to hell for that, I don't know, but I doubt it, you know?
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  [inaudible] I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, I -- again, if you believe in it, it's a good idea.  'Cause it's a way -- it's a -- it's like a discipline thing, you know?
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  If you can keep  to those types of things.  But, uh, I just don't see the point personally, for me.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, but for other people it's, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Whatever works, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's pretty much, I don't know, but, uh --
R:  Trying -- what other holidays are there?
L:  I don't know but, uh --
R:  Um.
L:  -- the most pointless holiday, not that they ask, but [NOISE], exactly!
R:  What was -- what did they say?
L:  Flag Day.
R:  Flag Day?
L:  Exactly.  That is g -- again, it's -- it -- it wouldn't be pointless if it was one of those days that you actually got off for, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] [NOISE] Flag Day's in June, Flag Day's in June.  But nobody, you know, it's Flag Day.  "Oh, it's Flag Day.  Oh, okay.  Nice" --
R:  Right.
L:  You don't get off for it.  You don't do anything.  All they do is, like, I think they put the [NOISE] they put the f- -- uh, yeah, Grandparent's Day, Secretary's Day [NOISE], there's a --
R:  Well, aren't Flag Day and Grandparent's Day really close to each other?
L:  I don't know.  But there's a -- it is --
R:  I think I remember in elementary school having Grandparents' Day and Flag Day, like, all in the same day or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just that it's never celebrated, you know?  I mean, like, [MN] those are made up holidays --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're good ideas, but Grand- -- you don't hear Grandparents' Day like Mothers' Day. You know?
R:  [MN] Right, right, right.
L:  Mothers' Day you celebrate.  Grandparents' Day is just, like, "Uh, when is it?" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I knew I'd call my grandma, but I don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I won't, you know?  She won't remember anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She's ninety three, but, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] That's, uh, that's another one.  Yeah, Secretary's Day too, I think [NOISE] may- maybe -- maybe [NOISE], yeah, maybe secretaries have -- celebrate that, you know?  People do something for that, but I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- know when it is.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  Definitely a lot of made up holidays.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think there's -- I think you could probably find a holiday in any given week.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  You know, that [MN] it's -- it exists but not everybody --
R:  Celebrates it, right.
L:  -- participates.  So ... 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Which is probably why they're having this survey, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to see what people do know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about and celebrate.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh [MN] most --
R:  I think there should be, like, a, um, a, um, Random Act of Kindness oh, uh, you know, Day. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Where everyone just does random nice things for people that they don't know and don't tell them their names and, you know?  Just to --
L:  That's a good idea actually.
R:  -- just to help out, like, you know, the world around you.  You know what I mean?  Just to make people nicer to each other.
L:  That is a good idea.  That's, yeah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  I would go for that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would definitely -- one day I could stop being a bitch.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's excellent.
R:  I'm the same way.
L:  And that would make me feel better about the other three hundred and sixty four days.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely, good idea.  [NOISE] So, you know ...
R:  [MN]
L:  But, uh, I don't know, you know, it's jus- -- the big holidays I celebrate, the rest of 'em are kinda just there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But uh ... you know?  I also don't have, like, a real job, job.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, I freelance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, any of those, you know, national holidays I don't get off work for, so, like I said, you know, that's the only reason that -- that -- that people actually acknowledge those days unfortunately.  So ...
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  I don't really pay much attention to them myself because I don't, uh, they don't really affect me.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Which I --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm a musician so, um, holidays are just kinda, like, if it's -- usually on holidays are days that you have to work. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Like, you know, 'cause of the days that most --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, people really want to be entertained, you know?  So --
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN] --
