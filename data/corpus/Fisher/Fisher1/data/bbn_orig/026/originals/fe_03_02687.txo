R:  [MN] Hello, I'm Irma.
L:  Hi, I'm Joe.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  Christmas has to be my favorite holiday. [MN] 
L:  Oh, why is that?
R:  That's 'cause when everybody gets together.  When I was young --
L:  I --
R:  When I was younger it was more about toys, now it's just seeing each other.  A day of reflection.
L:  Yeah, I -- that -- that -- that's a pretty cool part about it, huh?
R:  Y- [NOISE] --
L:  I mean, I -- I like that as well, but I think that, uh, I think New Years would have to be my favorite.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It w- -- I mean, we all get together as well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's not as -- it's not as commercial and it's not as, uh, religious.  
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  It -- it's more -- people -- everybody gets together I think on New Years.  With Christmas you -- you get a certain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- amount of people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting together, but not with New Years.  New Years you get everybody.
R:  [NOISE] New Years, we don't tend to get together.  Not at all.
L:  [MN] Say again, I'm sorry.
R:  New Years we don't tend to get together, 'cause we're so spread out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, we were always in Europe or some place, and Christmas -- everybody, no matter where they were, would come home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but New Years?  And New -- New Years w- --
L:  Well, New Years is only a week later. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, and it's more of a celebration of -- of -- of [NOISE] everyone, not family.  New Years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't you think?
L:  Well, yeah.  Christmas is more family, I mean, I -- I -- I think it's pretty important to see your family on Christmas.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  Ho- -- now, how old are you? [inaudible]
L:  I'm twenty four.
R:  See, there's a big difference.  I'm forty six. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  You're gonna get to that point where you're gonna want to see who's still alive and what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they've been doin' and who's had kids and ... [NOISE] That's what Christmas does for you.  'Cause I don't have parents anymore and I -- I just reflect to think that y- -- we used to do as children. [MN] And I try and pass it on to my children now.  So, we've --
L:  Right, so --
R:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  I n- -- uh, I just wonder --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you, uh, celebrate Christmas for any religious reasons?
R:  Um, yes it is.  Um, we're -- we're all Christian -- Christians.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, we -- we look at the fact that this was the birth of Christ.  It's a new beginning.  That's how we see it.  Um, and that's why we all try and come together.  To see what's happened to the family during that period.  And --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um --
L:  Just wondering how mu- -- how much of that is 'cause of the commercial --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- aspect of it, though?  Like, I mean, in your --in your house, when you celebrate it, how much of it is, like, the religious --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and how much of it is the, uh --
R:  [NOISE] The commercial, toys --
L:  -- you know, the Santa Claus --
R:  -- gifts.
L:  -- and -- and all that?
R:  It -- it used to be a big part.  It used to be I'd say, seventy five percent when we were younger. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But as we've grown older, it more [MN] -- we -- we might spend a quarter of it on [NOISE] gift exchange.  The rest of it [NOISE] is just reflection, and that's what's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so beautiful about it.  It's -- because even though we're all in the same city, a lot of us, we don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- see each other but maybe three or four times a year.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, that's our time to reflect in -- in gossip and catch up with everything. [NOISE] Um, so for us it's not commercial [MN] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I must say.  We don't --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- all run out and buy a whole lot of gifts.
L:  I think the -- the nice part about Christmas is that you get to participate in it, like, uh, what I mean is that, like, you know, on Fourth of July --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or [MN] Halloween, or whatever, you don't really get to participate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but in Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you get to participate in it.  Like, you have family over or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you go to some other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, you know, other person's house and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Or -- or your --
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.  And, you know, and y- you think about all the other parts of it, like, the, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the decorating and the gift gifting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the baking, cooking, eating and --
R:  I love the tree decorating.  Oh, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my favorite part.  I spent, ooh, [MN] [NOISE] it's just funny because in the neighborhood people spend hours and days on their trees and on the yard.
L:  Right.
R:  And it -- it -- it's more of just -- for us, we're military, so it's a collection of what we -- we've gathered throughout the years on our travels.
L:  Mhm.
R:  From different countries and [NOISE] we -- we celebrate it by putting it out for Christmas.  Um, [MN] I have things [MN], just different Christmas ornaments I've collected from different countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things I just like to share with the children and let them look [NOISE] at.  I have ornaments from when the children were [NOISE] in the first grade and things like that. [MN] It's just --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- really beautiful and --
L:  You mentioned going to, you know, be- -- you know, like, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- visiting other countries.  Have you ever visited other countries during Christmas time?
R:  [MN] Yes.  We were in, uh, Germany each time.  And we would do, um, we'd go to Berlin and do the hazelnut [NOISE] -- the hot hazelnuts, [MN] walking down the street and uh, Gluhwein, the heated wine.  Um, and Christmas [NOISE] is so different.  Instead of, um, their -- their Saint Nicholas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he leaves bundles for little children.  Just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [inaudible] extra.  Any little thing, it's not toys.  It's just to show us there's [inaudible]. [MN] Um, it's less commercial in Europe than it is here.
L:  I agree, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My parents are from Italy, it's a lot less commercial there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  More religious and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, well not m- -- necessarily more religious, but for everybody it's -- it's -- it's not so much put everywhere --
R:  Yes, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, it -- know what I mean?
R:  We have friends that, um, he's an Italian, he has -- he owns car lots [LAUGH] over in Germany.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The man's a millionaire.
L:  Wow.
R:  We -- we bought our cars from him.  And he --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- he celebrates every American holiday with us when we're over there.  He just loved it.  He'd say, "Now --" um, 'cause meats are very expensive over there, he'll say, "Now go get the turkey and I'll cook it.  And go get everything that you need" and I fixed one day, um, [MN] you know, you're -- you're American, you know collard greens, right?
L:  Yeah, I do.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I fixed that and I had that on the table one year, and all of them kept say, "What's this green stuff?" and we said, "Greens" and they said, "But what is this green stuff?" and it was just hard to explain to them.  And they say, "Ooh, it tastes good but what is this green stuff we're eating?" and we said, "This is what, um, black Americans use as a [MN] -- a -- a -- a vegetable".
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  You mean, like, soul food, right?
R:  Yeah.  And they c- -- they couldn't understand it.  It [NOISE] was just so strange.  But they sat and ate the entire pot of it.  And, you know, since then, every Christmas they would say, "Now, you do the green stuff". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, wait, what part of America are you actually from?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I'm from Savannah, Georgia.  My husband's from the, um, Virginia area, so we live in Washington D.C.
L:  Wow, okay.
R:  We've done two tours in Korea [MN], um, two tours in Germany.  He's done two Bosnias, one Desert Storm, um --
L:  But --
R:  We [MN] -- we -- we've done all of the US in different stations.  W- w- we've --
L:  That sounds really fascinating.
R:  Just done [NOISE] --
L:  Is this -- this is job related then, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Is -- all this travel?
R:  It was, and it was just wonderful. [NOISE] We were [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] Your husband's in the military?
R:  Right.  He's retired military now as of twenty two years. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, I'm a retired DA civilian worker after twenty seven years.  And, now w- w- we're [inaudible] really retired.  We don't do anything, we just travel.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's -- yeah, that's -- that's the way to do it.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  You just, you know, you just travel, that's, you know, and collect your dues.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that's wonderful.
R:  He -- he's fifty and I'm forty six and we don't work. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're enjoying it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  [MN] We didn't -- our parents never saw days like this and [MN] we just thank God that we can do things like this.  I'm visiting my granddaughter right now.  My first granddaughter.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she's awesome. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's six months old. [LAUGH]
L:  That must be cool.  Um --
R:  It is, yeah.
L:  And -- and this is in the -- the same region?  In Georgia, or -- or D.C. I mean?
R:  Well, no.  I'm -- I'm in Kansas right now.
L:  Oh, you're in Kansas.  Wow.
R:  Yes.  I flew in yesterday and I'm fly- flying out tomorrow. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  I just needed to see the grandbaby and the daughter.
L:  Aw, that's -- that's [inaudible] [LAUGH] that's amazing.
R:  They stationed at Fort Raleigh.  Now, do you have plans of going into service, you think?
L:  No.  Definitely not.
R:  Ooh.
L:  I'm -- I'm sorry to say.  No, no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Military's not the life for me.  I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what's your occupation?
L:  Um, my occupation right now is, uh, I'm working for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --nonprofit organisation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing fundraising.
R:  Oh.
L:  I just got out of college --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in New York, and I live in Los Angeles now.
R:  Oh, wonderful.  I'm glad to hear somebody wanting to work for a volunteer organization. [NOISE] That is very good.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  That's still serving your country.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I think so in some small way.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I wish I had a bigger say in what the organization did, but I don't.
R:  Oh, you will --
L:  I do their work.
R:  -- as -- as the years go on, you will.  You will.  It -- it increases as y- -- with your experience.  And you sound really enthused, ready to do it.
L:  Well, I'm, uh, I'm in enthused, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] the, you know, the change of -- of going from --
R:  [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and breaking into the, uh, entertainment industry --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which --
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's why --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I came here.
R:  Oh, that is wonderful. [NOISE] I hear a lot of people --
L:  But I -- I --

R:  Well, good luck on it.  I tell ya.
L:  I, you know, I've noticed also, working in non profit, how important it is to, you know, to give, like, you know, either money wise or energy wise.  Just, you give money or -- or your --
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, your effort.
