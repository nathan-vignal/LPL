L:  [NOISE]  Hi!
R:  Hello!  [LAUGH]  Hi, there!
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  This is my first time to do this.  [NOISE]  So, 
R:  It's mine too.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  My name's Elva.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  All right, my name's Nancy.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Nancy.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  How are you doing?  [SIGH]
R:  Just fine.
L:  [NOISE]  Good.  [NOISE]
R:  Holidays!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, holidays.  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] what -- what, um, [SIGH] we're supposed to discuss our favorite ones, is that correct?
R:  Uh-huh.  And if we could make one what would it be?
L:  [SIGH]  Hm?  Okay.
R:  Um, or --
L:  Well, what is your favorite holiday?
R:  My favorite holiday has to be Christmas.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I agree.  That's pretty special enough.  Why is -- [SIGH] why is Christmas special for you?  [LIPSMACK]  [NOISE].
R:  Um, family.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  Th- That's [SIGH] it -- I mean, you know, I guess that's the pat answer but that's -- is what makes it special.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Ah, my kids -- this will be [SIGH] the second year that my kids haven't been home.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  They're all grown up now.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I -- I found like last Christmas was kind of  a bore.  [SIGH]
L:  That's --
R:  Without the kids around it just wasn't as much fun.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I agree.  I agree.  Well, my children -- [SIGH] I have one -- [SIGH] ah, two out of the home; one's moving back in.  [SIGH]  And then I have t- the young one that's not graduated from high school yet.  So, [SIGH] I -- I'm beginning to get a glimpse of what that's like.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Well, you know --
L:  You know, what my parents had to go through.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, I -- I'm kind of figuring, you know, it's going to end up being ah -- th- they haven't moved back yet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but probably will.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- I'm forty three and I've been back with my parents three or four times.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE].  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  In fact my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm in a conference with my dad right now, so he's listening to this.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, that's nice.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Well, at least you can be with your parents then.  That's good.  Mine live  um, a little far.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And so I -- sometimes we get home there and sometimes we go to my [SIGH] husband's parents.  And sometimes we're just here because we can't make it either place.  [NOISE]  So --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Been there.  Done that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Worn that T-shirt to a frazzle.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm trying to think.  Um, I really enjoy all the holidays a lot.  Um, we have -- I think I enjoy [SIGH] Fourth of July a lot, 'cause we have a lot of fun.  The kids really enjoy the traditions that we have, um, and make an effort to come back home for 'em.  But there's not any preparation.  You know, there's no gifts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's very little decorating that goes along with it.  Um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And --
R:  And somebody else does all the work 'cause they put on the firework shows.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  That's right.  Well, they have -- we have, um, we -- we live in a suburb of a -- a good size city but we, um, [SIGH] our town has an incredible parade.  In fact we were on -- I think, CNN with -- last year -- the top ten [SIGH] parades in the country.  [SIGH]  But it has --
R:  Cool!
L:  -- a little small town feeling to it and we always [SIGH] go to that every year and then --
R:  Is that the one that President Bush went to last year?
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.
L:  Unfortunately, not.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  But it's just a lot of fun and it's a good place.  [SIGH]  We sit in the same place every year so we see people that we might not see [SIGH] the rest of the time, and, um, then we always [SIGH] go out to lunch afterwards and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then usually, um, do a cookout for dinner and then fireworks.  So, it's -- it's just a lot of fun and, um, there's other things offered but we usually -- that's usually a pretty full day for us right there.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  I have to say [LIPSMACK] I don't think we've ever really had a Fourth of July [LAUGH] tradition.  [COUGH]  Um 
L:  Well, my son in law doesn't.  Ah, he was from a small town, not near a large town, in Pennsylvania and [SIGH] he, um, -- they -- they just didn't have much going on ever.  [SIGH]  Um, and so  we introduced him [LAUGH] to the festivities last year.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's just -- it's a lot of fun.
R:  Well, I guess -- an- and it's really unusual because one of the clearest memories I have of my -- my father, um, who passed away when I was ten, um, is actually going to the fireworks with him.  [NOISE]  But --
L:  Oh!  That's sad.
R:  -- um, I just [MN] it -- it's never been  a big deal.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When my kids were little and I was still married to their father we lived in Southern California.  And we -- I -- I guess the tradition was we went to the beach every year, 'cause they always had the fireworks off the pier.  [NOISE]
L:  Wow, that would be fun.
R:  And I hated it.  And it, ah, was like all day long you [SIGH] if -- if the kids went in the water the -- the waves were too strong and they'd get knocked over because they were real little then, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, you had to worry about sunscreen constantly, 'cause they were real little and would get burnt to a crisp and knock 'em flat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, it was just always so much work.  And I've never liked the beach.  Sand gets places that I honestly don't believe God ever intended --
L:  I --
R:  -- sand to be.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either.  I don't either.  I -- I just -- my -- m- kids we live in Oklahoma so we do have lots of bodies of water but, you know, to have a bona fide beach, you know, it's [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't like to plan vacations there.  [SIGH]  And so they're always asking me, you know, "I just want to live on the beach" or, "I want [LAUGH] you know, go and you go".  [LAUGH]  "You go!"  [LAUGH]
R:  I like looking at the ocean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but going down and getting in it, is nothing to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's not.  And there's all sorts of things fly -- floating around in there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Swimming around, yeah.  So, I'm just 
R:  An- and I can't blame it on Jaws anymore but  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Really.  Really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if we wer- -- if you were to create a, um, holiday [COUGH]  what would you create?
R:  [PAUSE]  Um,  well I don't really know.  There -- I'd like to see a lot more emphasis put on Veterans' Day, but that's not creating a holiday.
L:  Well, it's -- I like that idea though, that's creating [SIGH] um, something [LAUGH] much more than what we have now.  Right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah -- I mean --
L:  Yeah, uh-hum.
R:  -- I -- I think anymore  I -- I think our country used to be really focused on its history and where it came from an- --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and the melting +plot -- melting pot concept.  [SIGH]  Ah, maybe it's a melting plot too, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um  um -- and I think we've lost an enormous sense of our history.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  Um, we've become such a microwave society that  ah, you know, people forget where you came from.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  When -- when I was a kid one of the things my mom would always say -- and I still say to my kids when they leave the house, "Remember who you belong to".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you -- you know, to promote that --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- sense of family --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that you belong to.  You -- you're part of a -- a larger whole.
L:  Yeah.  Well you know --
R:  And 
L:  -- I think that -- that probably that's part of why I like our Fourth of July so much.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's celebration here, it's because there is a strong emphasis in the parade on the veterans, [SIGH] you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And it does bring up [SIGH] -- especially when the kids were younger, talking about [SIGH] the founding of our country an- and, ah, we always have, um, ah, people [SIGH] re-enact -- or in the costumes on horses, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from the civil war, both sides and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we have, um, ah, a drum -- is it?  I think it's drum and fife corps, you know, from the --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- revolutionary war.
R:  Drum and fife.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they, um, they're always walking in the period costumes.  And -- so 
R:  Yeah, I'm not too far away from you.  I'm up in Kansas.  I live in the Wichita area.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and so that's pretty neat because it -- it does foster that, you know, for us, um.  But you know, maybe they needed to do more combining of the two, the Veterans' Day and [SIGH] Fourth of July, and really stress that, um, fact.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just -- I feel like the -- the country has lost [SIGH] and maybe with this last war and so on there -- there's more of a fostering of it then there ever was but it was like after the Vietnam War and -- and that kind of stuff [SIGH] people became almost ashamed.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- if they were a veteran.  [NOISE]  And, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Was your dad a veteran?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Was your dad a veteran?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My dad was --
R:  And, ah, all my brothers and so on and so forth.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And [PAUSE] you know, um, my brother talked about how it was really difficult for him after Desert Storm because [NOISE] ah, nobody acted like that when they came home from Vietnam.  [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, um you know, I -- I -- I really felt for him.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- because wherever you go if you're following, ah, a larger call --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, something above your own selfish interests which our --
