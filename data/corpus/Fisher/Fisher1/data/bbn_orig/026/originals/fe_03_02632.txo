L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  I'm Marilyn.
L:  Hi, Marilyn, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  What state do you -- are you in?
L:  I'm in Michigan.
R:  And I'm in -- 
L:  Where are you?
R:  -- Minnesota.  In Minnesota.
L:  Oh, Minnesota?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm from -- yeah.  Midwest.
R:  Yeah, great.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're gonna talk about Iraq, ha?
L:  Yeah, this one's a loaded question, man.
R:  Really, I'm --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so glad it seems like the end is near.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- this is a tough one because you never know who you're gonna talk to because everyone has such extreme views, but 
R:  Well, I'm not radical.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's good to hear.
R:  I'm -- I think I tend to be more conservative, but first I was real [SIGH] real worried about going there at all, you know, without more support from the United Nations.  But I'm glad we did go and I'm glad it's turned out the way it has.  [SIGH]  Um, it seems like we minimized [SIGH] the amount of damage and the amount of deaths, as much as possible.  [SIGH]  And I -- I think maybe it was necessary.  I -- I don't know if we can ever be sure.  We have to kinda trust [SIGH] those in charge, you know, that's what we elected them for.  Although I didn't vote for 'em, but ah -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  You know, ah, I don't know it -- it's -- it is tough.
L:  I -- yeah, I'm with you completely on that.  I also did not vote [LAUGH] for him but, um, but like you said, it's -- it's about putting your faith that they know something we don't, or -- or -- an' that they're capable of doing what they need to do.
R:  Yeah.  I g-
L:  I mean, obviously -- I -- I agree with you though we didn't have the support.  There are a lot of unanswered questions.  A lot of ulterior motives and -- and, you know 
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  I feel like they just kept changing their idea of why we were going in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Different excuse every time.
R:  Well, you know, I get kind of, um, worried about the press and people who are commenting on what's going on, about how can they be so sure?  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, we don't have all the facts and I'm sure [SIGH] that a lot of things can't be told to us because [SIGH] it -- in this day and age of -- of news media, everything travels so quickly.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you can't reveal your hand.  [SIGH]  So, I -- I think, yeah, it just -- it just came down to trust that [SIGH] we had to wait and see.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  You never know because I -- I subscribe to Newsweek and every week for the past three months they've been outlining the war plan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to assume that, you know, um, you turn on the news and they're saying we're going through this route and we're using these missiles and 
R:  I know and I really don't care about all that stuff.  I only care that [SIGH] that the most people as possible come back alive.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Do you have any family members in the service?
L:  I -- I do have one and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it actually makes me very, very angry that people are so quick to condemn people for speaking out because I -- I support our troops very much so and I want them to be safe and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I think, you know, the sacrifices their families make by, you know --
R:  Oh, I know, I saw --
L:  -- with them out there.  I -- I -- I can't -- I can't imagine that kind of selflessness.  But, at the same time, it doesn't mean I have ta, you know, blindly follow and not question what's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going on.
R:  Well, you have to keep reminding yourself -- I -- as I do, that everybody has the right to their opinion.  [SIGH]
L:  Right, and -- 
R:  And I may not agree with them but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's still their right.
L:  Yeah.  So, I w- -- I was pleasantly surprised that it, you know, it went the way it did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then again who knows what the consequences are.
R:  Really it --
L:  It will be a long time before we know.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I hope -- I suppose we'll be over there for a long time yet.  [SIGH]  And I suppose that it's -- it is going to cost us money.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  But then they keep finding so much wealth that the -- the people who were in charge had -- I think that the -- that wealth should be converted to pay for all the transition.  [SIGH]
L:  I agree.
R:  I don't think we should have to foot the bill for everything.
L:  And I definitely think we need to repair relationships and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, I don't know.  I don't know if we had the right PR guy because [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  We do -- [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Well, it's -- it is hard to think that so many people hate us that -- that's hard to accept.
L:  Yeah, and -- and we -- we did exactly what they expected us to do and -- and -- and we kind of acted like a bully ta everyone else and it's going to be tough to -- you know, this whole question about liberation versus occupation?
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  This is where our true --
R:  And -- and yet I look at it and I think, "Well, maybe -- maybe we needed a bully".
L:  Right.
R:  Maybe that's what it took.  I -- maybe other people --
L:  Yeah.  I think it's long time.  I mean we -- I think the US has a history of -- of supporting people when they need to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when it's convenient for them and -- and we helped Saddam Hussein at one point and --
R:  You have to laugh how France and Germany now are -- are all of a sudden --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- "Oh, yeah, well maybe.  Yeah"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Except I do have to laugh too when, ah -- in -- in Minnesota here there was talk just t- -- the last couple of days about -- about renaming anything French --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I know they've done that in some places, but come on, that's pretty stupid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly --
R:  I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's just -- it's not the image I --
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  -- it's not what feel.  You know, I don't wanna --
R:  French fries are always going to be French fries.  Just -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- give it a rest.  [LAUGH]
L:  Freedom fries and -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Ah, that's such a silly little n- -- nothing thing --
L:  Right and it makes us --
R:  -- that people focus on.
L:  -- it makes us look petty and -- and you know this --
R:  Really.
L:  -- now that we've done, you know, what we did with [NOISE] the success that we did I think now's the time for true compassion and -- and working together --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and saying, "Look, you know, this is for the greater good" no matter what other people --
R:  Well, I think if we could see some things that the soldiers have seen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we'd probably all change our minds and, you know, be convinced of -- of what was, you know, what was, you know, what was right and what was wrong.
L:  Well, we're so isolated.  I mean, I wish I could see -- I wish I had like European television or at least some other form of -- of news coming at me.
R:  I know.  I sometimes wonder if we're getting the whole story or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if it's slanted or, you know.
L:  Our version is the wrapped in a bow.  You know, they say, "Oh, two Americans were killed today a- -- and we slaughtered a bunch of Iraqis" but, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And then again I'm sure that -- that the Iraqi people are being told what -- what their [SIGH] media people think they should be told, you know?
L:  Definitely.
R:  Just as we're probably being told what -- what we -- what the US, um, news people think we should be told.  I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, it's hard to understand and sift through all the junk.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I stopped reading a lot of it and I stopped watching a lot of it 'cause it was just overload.  [SIGH]
L:  Me too.  It's just too much and --
R:  Yeah.  Do you ever watch David Letterman or Jay Leno's show?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the time.
R:  You know, I get kind of nervous [LAUGH] when they start making all the political jokes and I -- I wonder if other countries see some of that stuff what they must think.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  They must think we're pretty flippant.
L:  Exactly.  They -- they -- I -- you know, they think we're cocky an- -- and that we think we can do anything we want an -- and we'll see.  Now --
R:  [SIGH]  And we're just as human as everybody else.
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  But now you never know what is going to happen with other countries.  If -- if we say, "Hey, we -- we're threatened by you, so we're going to invade you" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, what's to stop other people from doing the same?  So, it's tough.
R:  I know.  I don't want to be seen as -- as the country that's the big bully of the whole world.
L:  Right.  Right.  We have a real chance to -- to be like a helper, which is what we want to do is --
R:  Right.  And as far as disarming Iraq, I think they mentioned that we were supposed to discuss that too.  I -- aren't we doing that?  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
R:  -- I think we are.  I think anything they find they're collecting and I don't think they're just going to give it right back to the Iraqi people.
L:  Right.
R:  I have to laugh --
L:  But then again they -- they've shown, like, stockpiles of weapons that the US tried to destroy but [COUGH] ended up going off and killing, you know, innocent people in towns.
R:  Oh, yuk.  I didn't even see that.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Are you okay?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yes, sorry about that.
R:  Do you need a drink of water?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  But.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what time is it in Michigan?
L:  Um, it's eleven twenty nine.  I'm actually not in Michigan right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's where I'm from.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I'm actually in LA right now.
R:  Oh, oh, so it's eleven -- it's eleven twenty nine there?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh, in Michigan.
R:  Oh, g- -- in Michigan, yeah. It's ten -- ten twenty four right here, right now.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, in Minnesota.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what was I -- I had a thought.  Now it escapes me.  [SIGH]  Ah -- about -- something about the weapons.  [PAUSE]  Oh, I know, it's about the people who used to be in Iraq who have now gone back to their country an- -- and are just kind of taking over.  [SIGH]  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wonder who these people are that they think they can do that.  Maybe they are someone trustworthy and of good intentions.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But I kinda -- I'm kinda wondering.  I mean, the first thing they seem to have said is, "Okay, US, now get out".
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] "You know, you've done your duty, so leave" you know, like it's kinda hard just to stop in mid track and pick up and leave.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I guess I don't know enough about the different forms of government but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't know what's gonna work for them.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, yeah, I -- I -- I think -- I think the United Na- -- well, I don't know if I trust the United Nations anymore but [SIGH] some -- some governing unbiased body, if there is such a thing -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- should be in charge of whatever elections or whatever the people decide they want.  [SIGH]  I still wonder if there are some of Saddam's people or Saddam and his sons, themselves, who will still try to take over again once the US, or whoever else, pulls out.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  I mean they still haven't found them for sure, have they?
L:  No.
R:  Not as far as I've heard, anyway.  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Oh, dear.  [SIGH]
L:  I know.
R:  There's always something to worry about.
L:  [COUGH]  So many questions, not enough answers.
