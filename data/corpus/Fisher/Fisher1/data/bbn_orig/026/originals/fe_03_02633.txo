L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, I'm John.
L:  And I'm Jo Marie.
R:  Hey, nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Uh, topic is, um, do we think that [NOISE] oh, what was it?  Ah, the arms in Iraq?  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  D- -- do we think that there should be?
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  In my --
R:  -- I think that.
L:  -- in my opinion I do, yes.  Do you?
R:  You know, I mean, do you?  I guess, I -- I missed the question -- I- -- is it, should we disarm Iraq?  Is that -- is that w- -- what the question is?
L:  I thought he said, or she said, ah -- ah -- do -- do -- about having arms in Iraq.
R:  Our presence, right.
L:  Yeah, our presence.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I think we're done -- [NOISE] I think we need to get out of there.
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean -- [LAUGH] -- no, I -- I think -- I think it was good that we went over there but I don't think we needed 'em -- I don't think we -- [PAUSE] I don't think we needed to do all that we've done.  [SIGH]
L:  You don't?
R:  No, I -- I --
L:  Like -- like what?
R:  -- I mean we have a -- we have an incredible government with -- with a lot of resources.  I don't think it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would -- I don't think it should have taken as much as what it did to, ah, to resolve -- I mean, they still haven't resolved it -- but to, ah, to come to this conclusion.  An- -- and yet they still haven't found any -- any nuclear warheads.  So --
L:  [NOISE]  They still haven't found Saddam either.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I guess my point is, as far as our involvement over there, I -- I -- I -- I think it was a good choice to be involved but not to this extent that we had to go to war and everything.  I mean we should've been able to find, ah, you know, the information that we needed to prove that without going to war.  [NOISE]  An- -- and obviously going to war still hasn't [SIGH] you know, conjured up the answer.  Which -- in my opinion is it's -- it's ridiculous.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I don't think there was any other way it could've been resolved though.
R:  But we still haven't found anything.  You would think that somewhere in the middle of the war, you know --
L:  Well, they've --
R:  -- you'd would have a -- another --
L:  -- at least they've captured some of the terrorists.  That's a good thing.
R:  That's a good thing, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good thing but [PAUSE] I'm not -- I'm not, ah -- I'm not anti war, but I'm just saying it's -- it's --it's a good thing, but the problem I feel is that if we were going to go to war or if we were going to go over there to take care of terrorists, well that should've been the objective, and there should've been a good reason for that.
L:  Mm.
R:  We went over there to -- because there was no compliance with the -- with the situation of the, ah, of the mass destruction weapons.  And in the process we did -- we've eliminated terrorists but [PAUSE] it's the whole idea that we went over there for a different purpose on pap- [NOISE] -- set out to be and I think that that's -- that's a problem.  And that the American people didn't -- I -- I don't think the American people, you know, honestly wanted it -- us to go over there to -- to just crack down on terrorism because Iraq hasn't been a terroristic threat to us [PAUSE] at all.  I mean, Bin Laden, that's a whole different sit- -- situation.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- don't worry, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not for what's going on over there now.
L:  Do you have relatives and friends over there?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Yo- -- nobody at all you know?
R:  Ah, no.  Um, no -- nobody I know.
L:  I don't either.  [SIGH]  No.
R:  So, it's not a person- -- this is not a personal thing.  As a matter of fact -- you know, I -- I come from a military background as far as family and all --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but I think it needs to be -- I think it's -- I don't know -- I think it's absolutely crucial that their purpose[?] are at least laid out for the public so that -- I mean not -- without revealing what we're doing to the world.  I think it's important that -- that we have an understanding of what's going to happen, or what we intend to do before we send that kind of money and that kind of fire power and manpower into a country, all because -- all because there are -- you know, we say that the -- these -- these weapons exist.  And we still haven't found them, and that's pretty unconvincing to have spent as much money as we have and to have spent -- spend the time even though it has been short.  It's -- it's just rather unconvincing though if you ask me.
L:  That was one good thing it was short.  Only three weeks.
R:  Right.  And -- an --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and all the time I go into the theory and I don't think that's good either.  You know, and then they may just have to keep looking for these things.  And they may not even exist, but we -- if I -- I -- correct me if I'm mistaken, but didn't we supply him with the original warheads?
L:  That I don't know.
R:  I think so.  I can, ah -- in the -- in the early eighties and seventies we actually sold  we actually sold the nuclear weapons to Iraq when they were on our side.  So, of course they're there.  They're somewhere. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, you know, I -- I -- I don't know.  I mean you would think they would've used them by now too.  If -- if they've got  if they've got fire -- if they've fire power like that and if there's just one person there who's trigger happy you would think that someone would've used [PAUSE] some of this, ah, stuff by now just to, you know, in -- in retaliation of what we've done?
L:  Well, they have a lot of hiding places.
R:  But what -- I mean, at this point -- at this point, if they're terrorists, right?
L:  Mm.
R:  That's the way I look at it.  If they're terrorists and they have these weapons of mass destruction, [PAUSE] then even if they hide they'll still want -- I mean they're still -- they would still -- you would think they would still take at least one warhead or one [SIGH] biochemical warfare agent and spread it.  And you know what, it would all -- it would all make sense if for some reason we found out that the whole SARS [PAUSE] disease or whatever -- that -- that illness -- if we found out that's actually a man created, you know, biochemical, you know, virus.  If we found that out and we found out that its origin was from Iraq then I can say, "Yes, it was all justified".
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And that's the only thing that's been odd lately that -- that, you know, that -- that's really unexplainable.  I mean, it comes from Asia, but that's the only thing that's been unexplainable.  As far as the war and everything -- actually, if we get the troops out of there.  We have Special Ops.  We have Navy Seals, they have -- we have the, you know, Special Ops from Marines --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- an- -- and get them in there and let them fight -- CIA and SIA -- have -- you know, get those people in there an- -- and figure out what's going on.  Find out where the stuff is.  Th- -- you know, we're not going to get hurt at this point, we've got -- we've leveled the place.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  At this point I think that they should -- if it's there and we can't find it then I think there are going to be a lot of countries that are going to be very upset at us.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Could be.  [NOISE]
R:  I mean I -- I'm glad -- you know, I'm glad that, you know, I'm glad Saddam's no longer in power but then again they haven't found him.  So, really, they haven't found him.  They can't prove that he's [PAUSE] --
L:  But the people --
R:  -- dead or alive.
L:  -- the people seem to be happy he's out of power.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's a good thing
R:  That's a good thing, but --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I don't know if this is okay for the discussion but what about the oil?  I mean -- you know, I mean now -- now Israel wants the oil -- you know, I mean it -- it looks very bad for u- -- in my opinion, the United States has started doing what Britain did hundreds and hundreds of years ago when we stuck our nose into a situation that sadly would've resolved itself, I believe.  Eventually.
L:  Uh-hum.  I -- I don't follow it real close.
R:  No.
L:  No.  Not real close.
R:  I -- I don't know -- I -- I can't comment to you but I mean you have -- you have a dictator because we goes -- and the same thing as Fidel Castro, with optimum power and it really didn't work itself out too much but it -- it no longer became a threat.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  We showed him what we had.  It be- -- it became militarized and I -- think it +could've -- it could've been dealt with similar -- in a similar fashion.  Now, Iraq is stuck with no --well, it's stuck with no government.  They have problems.  We're going to have to pay for that.  We're -- and Russia and -- and us, we're going to have emplo- -- we're going to have to install a government of some sort.
L:  Uh-hum.  Or the United Nations is supposed to he- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- help --
R:  But they're not on board.
L:  -- with part of that.
R:  But they're not on board.  They weren't on board from the beginning. 
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  It's just Britain and the United States.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [PAUSE]  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  We- --
R:  -- I really don't know.  I mean, I think as far as for the topic -- I mean they'd bet- -- they'd better find the weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they need to get --
