L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Krista.
R:  Hi, Krista.
L:  And you are?
R:  You what?
L:  Your name? [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Matt Ifox[?].
L:  Oh, okay.  So, uh, are you, uh, participating in this voice, uh, testing, uh, system as well?
R:  Uh, I don't know.  It just said that, uh, I was gonna have another person on here and we're supposed to talk about, uh, disarming in Iraq or something.
L:  Disarming in Iraq, yep, that's what I heard as well.  I just -- it's funny 'cause I had just sent in my -- signed up on the internet today for -- today at four, so I was just surprised to get a call so quickly.
R:  Uh, I think I signed up a day or -- a day or two ago.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It didn't take very long.
L:  They're just waiting for people to have partners.  So, uh, I guess the question is, uh, do we favor dis- -- if Iraq -- if disarming Iraq is important for the US, was that the question?
R:  Uh, I believe so.
L:  Okay.  So, uh, at this point in the scheme of things with Iraq it doesn't seem like they've found many weapons to disarm them of.
R:  Um, really honestly I don't think that really matters at this point.  I mean --
L:  No, not at this point.  I don't know if --
R:  Um --
L:  -- the question was, uh, posed --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- at what point in the [LAUGH] -- the war in Iraq.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, really as far as disarming 'em, I think setting up any kind of stable government whatsoever over there is the most important thing, whether we find a smoking gun or not.  Um, you know, for peace throughout that entire area, um, I don't see any -- any -- any reason to not go ahead and finish the job, whether we have proof of, uh, [NOISE] chemical weapons or whatever.
L:  No, I think you're right.  It's more important to establish some post, uh, Saddam Hussein government and, you know, let the people of Iraq get their lives back underway and ... and continue. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I mean, what -- and -- and really, I mean, we're looking at what kind of, uh, what kind of life we're gonna bring to that area.  You know, just, uh, you can -- you can look at, uh, what we did in, uh, Japan and Germany and, you know, whether -- whether you like the way it ended up or not, they -- they both have stronger, better economies.
L:  That's true.
R:  Maybe -- maybe even better than what the US has currently.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true, especially probably in Germany when it comes to healthcare coverage and -- and more, uh -- don't they have, like, a month of vacation, uh, every year or ...?  They don't -- they don't seem to quite -- work is not quite as the center force as it is in America, though, and Japan.  I'm sure that's the -- the opposite. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, Japan is [LAUGH] -- is, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- capitalism on steroids.  But, um, you know, as -- as far as being, um, uh, becoming a world power and having a voice and being more, um, on an even kilter rather than extreme one way or the other, uh, the only way I think the Middle East is ever gonna find any kind of peace is if we have enough of it that's at least stable where the people that are in control don't vary from day to day on their -- I -- I mean, you -- you -- you're talking about a part of the world where they have religious wars that have been going on long before America was ever established.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to ...
R:  We're kind of like the young punk coming in and trying to tell 'em how to run the world when they've been around considerably longer than we have.
L:  Yeah, that's definitely ...
R:  But whenever the US steps in, they usually end up better off in the long run, so that's kind of a hard -- hard call to make.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  So, what part of the country are you in?  Are you in the US?
R:  Texas.
L:  In Texas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm in California.  Been rained on for [NOISE] many days here this month.  We've had record, uh, rain, uh, fall, so ...
R:  That's unusual for that area, isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] It sure is.  So, uh, I wonder how long we've been talking for here? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I don't know.
L:  We're supposed to talk for ten minutes, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  What, uh ... I was reading in the paper about Iraq, that they're trying to get people that have -- had escaped to the United States to go back over to Iraq and -- and -- and be a part of the rebuilding of, uh, the government.  That seems -- seems like a -- a good idea.
R:  Um --
L:  A good source of --
R:  Well, it's -- it's kinda hard to tell.  Uh, we didn't have any or it doesn't seem like we had any kind of, uh, um, established understanding of who's where and what their positions were.  I mean, that's kinda something that, uh --
L:  Yeah, it's true.  Like, they didn't --
R:  -- the military has to -- has the ability to get in there and find out exactly who was in charge of what and who's responsible for what and --
L:  Yeah, they didn't --
R:  -- I mean, it's --
L:  They didn't keep track of or didn't publish very much information about what was going on in the country as far as how many -- like their census.  Like, there's no idea --
R:  Well, I mean, right b- --
L:  -- of the numbers of people and ...
R:  Right, because it's all government run.  So, you know, again a reason why it would -- it's a good idea to, um, completely disarm 'em so that the same guys that were thrown out don't get back in.
L:  Exactly, yeah, you never --
R:  But it's -- for -- for the majority of people that you meet in America, I mean, you may be -- you may watch the war coverage constantly, um, like many of the people I know do, um, but the -- the real problem is a lot of people in America think it's just a big, you know, desert.  You know, Baghdad is just as big as, you know, Dallas or San Francisco or, you know, anywhere, you know, around the country as far as, you know, having computers and established businesses and all that.
L:  Yeah, I know, definitely.
R:  Which -- which a lot of people don't -- they don't have that in mind when they think about that part of the world.
L:  Well, yeah, they're -- they're generalizations of what it -- what it's like and deserts and tents in the sand and that kind of a ... [LAUGH]
R:  It's hard to -- it -- it's hard to picture it if you haven't been there.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I have never been to the Middle East, so I -- I have no idea, but definitely, uh -- and it's -- it's a lot -- huge, billions of population wise.  I don't know how it compares to the United States, but it seems --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just what I was reading about it, it seemed like it was -- it was much bigger.
R:  Well, it's a -- you -- it's a -- you know, it was a -- it was a full working government, you know.  The -- the question is what kind of government are they gonna end up with after --
L:  Afterwards.
R:  -- you know, all -- all of this?  You know, what -- what kind of system will be set up?  I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the biggest thing that, you know, the military went in, they did their job, they took the people out of power that needed to be taken out of power, but they still have some responsibility to not just leave 'em high and dry like we did basically before.
L:  Yeah, no, definitely not.  Is -- are you referring to the Persian Gulf War?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that -- I -- I ... didn't realize --
R:  I mean --
L:  I mean, you -- you knew it was so short, but then that's true, being it's so short is that it was just -- they just went in and asserted power but then didn't do anything to help solve the -- the situation.
R:  Well, all -- all the -- all the same guys, even crippled, had -- you know, went directly right back into power as soon as, you know, the US left, so ...
L:  As soon as the US pulled out, no, that's ...
R:  So that -- I mean, that's something that's -- that -- I mean, that I -- I think is more important than -- I mean, we know we have the military power to go in wherever we want to, but what we do with that power a- afterwards is -- is a lot more important than what actually is, uh -- we do, you know, currently.  I mean, it's not like we're conquering countries and moving in and trying to take over.  We're just --
L:  Yeah, that -- we're a far -- far cry from that, so ...
R:  You know, not that we weren't at one time, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  No, definitely not.
R:  But apparently we're better anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, let's hope that they, uh --
R:  So, anyway --
L:  -- use the powers to benefit --
R:  So, is this thing supposed to just shut down at ten minutes or ...?
L:  I'm not sure.  I -- I think it's going on ten minutes because I think the call came in pretty much at four o'clock.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And my son answered the phone and he's just sitting there holding the phone to his ear and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm like, "Okay, who is it?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then -- but they're kinda set up for that situation so you -- it puts you on hold kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so then you can return to the call.
R:  Okay.  Well --
L:  So, uh, I wonder what they'll --
R:  I don't know -- I don't know if we got anything settled. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, uh, I don't know.  Do you think we could -- we have to wait for them or ...?  I think they said that a re- recording would come on in ten minutes.
R:  Uh, this -- this is the first time I've ever done it so I'll know next time what's gonna happen.  I just didn't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for sure this time what the -- what the deal was.
L:  [NOISE] Well, it's an interesting, uh -- it's -- I didn't -- I was -- had no idea what kind of questions that they would give you, but I guessed it would be something that -- that would be a current event and a subject of, you know, sort of -- that everybody would know about and ...
R:  I -- I figured it would be more of an interview process where they would just ask questions, you know, like a survey type -- type deal.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It was -- I -- I -- as I read further into it, I'm like, "Oh, this sounds like you're gonna be talking to someone and -- and maybe even multiple groups of people".  Like, you could have more than two people on -- on the line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... are you driving in your car?
R:  Yeah, I'm --
