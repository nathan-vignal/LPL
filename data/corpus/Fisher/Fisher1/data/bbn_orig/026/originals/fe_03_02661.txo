L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, hello.
L:  Hi, uh, my name is Milly McAdams.
R:  Hi, my name is Daniel McSherry.
L:  Cool.  Where're you from?
R:  Uh, San Diego, California.
L:  Okay, I'm -- I'm living in New York right now, but I'm from Portland, Oregon originally.
R:  Oh really?
L:  So, yeah, west country too.
R:  [LAUGH] Wonderful.
L:  [MN] But -- so, your, uh, your topic is holidays, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Our topic ... Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  D- do you wanna start?
R:  Uh, well, you know, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  [MN] Um, mine -- ha- -- okay, well, it has to be Halloween for the smell of it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, other than that, um, probably Christmas for the food.
R:  [LAUGH] What, uh, what's your ethnic background?
L:  Um, it's -- I'm just, um, regular old American mutt.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Sort of, caucasian, but, um, like, my family, I guess, we're Christian in name --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I call myself more a pagan.
R:  Okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  [MN] I -- I'm Italian, so it's like, the food's, like, central to the holiday scene.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Mm, mm, Italy and Judaism too, like, that's what I really loved about, like, I've gone to some Passover ceremonies and everything, and it's just been --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, they give you the, um, like, the -- the horseradish that's supposed to be, like, um, the pain that your ancestors had felt.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I could really -- I could really get into that pain.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, but [NOISE] it's a good kind of pain.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How about you?  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  Um, I -- Halloween's kinda fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because you've got the whole thing as -- there's the -- the two types of costumes, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's -- there's the one where --
L:  The ambience.
R:  -- the person--
L:  Yeah, it's all about setting the mood.
R:  Well, there's one where they're finally themselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for the first time, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  And then there's the other one where they're the opposite.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so you walk down the street and you look at these people and it's so funny, 'cause you see some guy and he's, like, Zorro, but you're like, "Oh my god, dude, that guy is Zorro".
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  He's always been Zorro [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm, mhm.  
R:  -- but he's just finally owning up to it.
L:  [NOISE] Mm, mm I wonder how serious he would take it?  What have you been for Halloween?
R:  Um, I was the Incredible Hulk one year. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, no, that's wonderful.  Did you make it yourself?
R:  I just painted myself green and ripped up an old shirt.
L:  Oh, that sounds perfect.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was a good time. [LAUGH]
L:  Were you enraged --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --  do we do like, did you have costume changes, like ...
R:  Yeah, people -- people made me mad. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Then I -- then I p- -- then I put on the costume and threw things around.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was a lot of fun.
L:  Well, that sounds wonderful.  And you had an action to go with it to, which makes it all the better.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course, of course.  Um ... [MN] well, hey, if you could create a holiday, what would it be?
L:  Um, it'd probably be -- it'd probably be on one of the solstices.  It'd be creation and destruction on Monday.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you'd like, take out your bureau and stuff that you didn't really want and, I don't know, have captions and you'd probably destroy them all.  Then you -- then you'd have a nice meal and, um, get pretty smashed.  And then you put it all back together in a whole new way.
R:  Oh, that's very nice. [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- I think so.  I mean, it incorporates food, it incorporates -- you can dress up as you destroy things and as you create things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Just that sort of thing.
R:  I'll --
L:  How about you? 
R:  I'll show up for it.
L:  Oh, woohoo! [LAUGH]
R:  Um, there would be, um, Hanging Out at the Beach Day.  A- and I --
L:  Ooh, that's nice.
R:  -- and I think people would just hang out at the beach and be nice.
L:  Yeah, wo- would there be costumes involved?  
R:  [LAUGH] I- -- if you want.  I think it would be, like, you know, pretty open rules.  You know, I think people should talk about their feelings though for, like, three hours of the day.
L:  For three hours of the day?
R:  Yeah, that would be --
L:  Of -- of -- of that -- of that particular day?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think --
L:  Can they sit on anyone's lap while they did it?
R:  I don't know but since -- you know, since it is my fantasy holiday, [LAUGH] I -- I like --
L:  But there might as well be some lap sitting.
R:  There should be some lap sitting and there should be some -- just people talking and people playing with the car, hanging out -- I'd like it. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and would -- would there be food too like would like the food of this holiday --holiday be burritos and like orange crush or something.
R:  I -- I think I'd leave that open too 'cause, uh, if you just have the -- kind of the pressure of the unsaid need for the food then everyone would kinda, you know, choose to their favorite.
L:  But the other thing is like people need food everyday and there's -- sort of a wonderful thing just to like the smell of the turkey and just knowing that that's, um -- I don't know that that's something to look forward to and it is sort of a task.  But it's wonderful to have tasks that are directed towards, like, pleasing other people or just to creating a mood.
R:  Oh yeah, totally.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like that's -- that's how I feel and then there should be, um -- and see plus -- I don't know just like it didn't feel like a holiday to me if my back doesn't hurt from overeating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, so, yeah.  I don't know something could be done about that.
R:  I remember it was a couple of Christmases ago I, um -- you know, I ususally don't live where my family lives and so I'd come in and it was, uh, a big feast, a big huge feast, like you can imagine.  Like every two hours another meal came out of the oven.
L:  This is Christmas?
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I would eat till I was physically ill and then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would pass out cold.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would just -- I would fall asleep and as soon as I woke up I'd just start eating again.
L:  'Cause the next meal would be ready, mhm.
R:  It -- it was a really funny thing but like, admittedly, like I had a friend over and she was like, "Oh, my god, what's wrong with you" and it was like, kinda like, you know, petting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my forehead and massaging my stomach [LAUGH].
L:  It's not -- it's a good illness, it's a good illness, gluttony.
R:  Yeah, totally, it was -- it was really funny.  It was a good time.
L:  It sounds so Italian.  Just like the -- I mean, the bombatoriums[?].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That sort of thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I could -- I could get into that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Every -- every once in a while.  I mean like not every day, like, lunch, I have to vomit again, but, um, but I think maybe like once a year I could probably get into that.
R:  I mean the people took over the world, let's say, you know [LAUGH] back then.
L:  You know, they -- they must have had something going on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think that thing is the vomiting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it didn't go on -- they had lead pipes and that's -- my grandfather says that's the reason that the Italian, um, civilizations started to fall because people started getting lead poisoning.  But, I don't -- I don't know.  Civilizations has its prices.
R:  Yeah, of course.  Of course, always.
L:  Where do you parents live?
R:  Uh, San Diego.
L:  Oh, so they live fairly close to you, right?
R:  I'm talking -- I'm like a hundred people deep in San Diego.
L:  Oh.
R:  I actually don't live here though, I live in Hawaii.
L:  Oh!
R:  I'm just visiting.
L:  Oh, okay!  Okay, oh nice.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's party, party. [LAUGH] Where, uh -- are -- are you alone in New York?
L:  Um, I went to school in New Hampshire and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I, um, and then I just moved down here -- like I graduated in June and, um, I'm living with some friends and I have a lot of people from my high school that -- uh, like, I don't feel alone here at all but still I miss the west coast more than anything.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just wanna come back.
R:  Yeah.  I lived in Manhattan for like four months, it was kinda crazy.
L:  Yeah, yeah, did you miss the west coast a lot or ...?
R:  I missed it a lot. [LAUGH]
L: Yeah, no, I feel that so much is just -- it's -- it's really -- it's just cold all around.  I mean it's -- it's sort of metallic and people don't have the same kind of sense of possibility and openness, you know?
R:  Yeah, don't worry, other people would come up to me and they'd be like what's wrong with you and I'm like what are you talking about and they're like, "You're just smiling, you're just standing there smiling".
L:  [LAUGH]. You should be ashamed.
R:  "Stop it".
L:  The shame.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] for enjoying life, how could you?
R:  It was funny and then other people come all concerned at me like, "Hey, you better knock that off, you're going to get some trouble".
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, like I -- it made me a lightning rod.
L:  Oh, my gosh, wow!
R:  Yeah, it was a funny time but, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  But, hey, that's -- that's a holiday in itself. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, you know, that's -- that's [inaudible] 'cause I haven't encountered so much, um, sort of like street -- like just like whistles and all that sort of stuff, like, since I was in third world countries.  And I don't know if it's like because I am smiling and, like,  looking people in the eye --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that it sort of invites -- I don't know.
R:  No, no, it's a funny -- it's a funny situation out there.  It's a rush.  It's a rush. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's a rush but sometimes you can only take that rush for like two weeks and then --
R:  That's what I'm saying, then get out of there [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Come back -- on behalf of the west coast I invite you back. 
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you so much, I feel so welcome.  See that's the thing, no one would invite me back -- like if I was living on the west coast again, no one would invite me back to the east coast and if they did it would be like [inaudible] invitations, blah -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just would not be very appealing to me but that's an invitation back to the west coast that is extremely appealing right now.
R:  Yeah, and hey, no -- no problem and -- and we on the west coast, we miss you.
L:  Oh my god, oh my god, well, I miss everyone on the west coast too.  Oh, this is so touching.
R:  Yeah, we were just talking about you at, uh, um, New Years. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh you were?  What did you say?  Like that girl should be here because she gets so fucking trashed every New Years and dances on the tables and that's a little bit of what we need right now?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is that what you said?  Because it would be true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it is.  You know, and it -- it all -- for me at least it's always -- it's always coming back to holidays.  You know, the -- the times when you reflect on -- on where you've -- where you've gone in your life 'cause it's a static thing, you know, and they're like tied in with the seasons.
L:  It's all cyclical.
R:  Of course, of course.
L:  You know, um, my family has a hazelnut farm in Oregon and I haven't been back for harvest for five years and this year's going to be the first year that I'm gonna be back for harvest and it just feels like -- I mean, that's a little five year cycle there that's -- well, it -- I -- I feel that it's quite overdue but it's just -- and it's gonna bring everything home, like just that sort of like wrapping up again.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  It's gonna be such powerful stuff, you know.  
L:  It's gonna be extremely -- extremely powerful.  I'm going to be feeling the earth goddess like coursing through my body as I'm on that tractor so ...
R:  No doubt, no doubt.  And I think -- I think that's -- I mean, frankly that's like the origin of like a holiday, you know.  Is like the -- the power --
L:  Is feeling the spirit?
R:  Yeah, it's the -- the spirit and -- and the power and the particular energy of a point in time and just the basic life functions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that need to occur at that time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and -- and then, you know, you got like ho- ...
