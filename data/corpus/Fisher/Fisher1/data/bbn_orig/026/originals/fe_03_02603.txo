R:  Hi, my name's Melissa.
L:  Hi, my name is Amy.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, actually the topic's kind of a little outdated, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Although, I mean, I guess technically they're still doing inspections.  It's just that it's us doing them now and not the UN.
R:  True.  True, true.
L:  I -- I think they're calling them searchers now instead of inspectors, but ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think they'll probably get more done. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Actually -- I actually think it's sort of ironic because before the war started, uh, you know, every- -- the -- the people who were anti war were asking the Bush administration to give the inspectors more time to find the weapons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now that the war's over and the administration's the one looking, they're the one that says they need more time.
R:  Yes, true.  True, true.  It's kinda -- yeah, that is true.  Well, the whole thing has been kinda close to home.  My husband's in the Navy, so ...
L:  Is he actually over there or ...?
R:  No, he's going -- going soon.
L:  Ooh.
R:  But, uh, so I'm kinda like --
L:  Well, at -- at least he's going now that it's all over, but ...
R:  Yes, yeah, exactly.  I was like, "Oh, thank you".
L:  Do you know what he's gonna be doing over there?
R:  Um, well, he'll be on a ship.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, he will just be kind of --
L:  The harbor patrol or --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Kind of sitting out there in case -- [LAUGH] in case they don't let them do what they need to be doing over there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  No, I don't really think there's anybody to stop them at this point.
R:  Ex- -- yeah, true.
L:  It's really just a question of, you know, if anybody knows anything, finding out who they are and what they know.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I -- I heard on the news about them, like, burying them and it's, like, I wonder -- I don't really know too much about what kind of equipment and what kind of things they can do to -- to find those types of things unless p- people will actually come forward and tell them.
L:  I -- I mean, that's assuming they exist at all.
R:  Y- -- true.  True, true.
L:  You know, I mean, there's not -- there's not really any evidence that they still exist at all.  The only evidence is that they once existed.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Which -- which hopef- -- you know, and plus they've said, you know, they think that they -- those that did exist they may have even moved out of the country.
L:  Right.  That's true.  They were -- they were all -- all that talk about, uh, things being smuggled into Syria.
R:  Mhm.  And, I mean, we have no jurisdiction to go over there and search Syria [LAUGH] so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we may never find anything.
L:  I don't know, I mean, we didn't -- we didn't have any more jurisdiction to go into Iraq really.
R:  This is true, yeah.  We just kinda --
L:  Doesn't seem to be stopping us.
R:  Yeah.  This is true.  Of course, I think we're already looking as -- at -- like the bully.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right now I don't know that they wanna be traipsing all over there saying, "We're just gonna ..."
L:  But, you know, I'm -- I'm sort of afraid that if it does work out somebody's gonna get it in their head that what a great idea this was, we should keep doing it.
R:  Yeah.  True, true.  If they find anything.  I think they're a little bit desperate, though, [NOISE] because they haven't really found ...
L:  Right.  And they're starting to look -- they've egg on their faces now 'cause they were insisting that the whole reason they were going over there was 'cause of these deadly weapons and then if they don't find 'em.
R:  These deadly chemical weapons, yeah.  And -- and really they haven't found anything.  You know, I mean, they've found --
L:  Yeah, they found --
R:  -- some weapons with traces and ...
L:  What -- what did they find?  Like, a jug of pesticide and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Or -- or, you know, a bomb [NOISE] that they think had traces of some kind of chemical that could have been a chemical weapon, and it's like, well, now they're feeling like --
L:  Although apparently most of the bombs they've found were American bombs --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that we sold them in the seventies and eighties.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  It's like, mm, okay. [LAUGH] We're finding --
L:  Going over there to get our stuff back.
R:  Exactly.  What did we do here?  So, now they're kind of -- I feel like they're kind of in this desperate search to find something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that they don't look like ... stupid, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's kind of -- I -- I -- I don't know.  Do you really think, like, that they will find anything?  I kinda feel like they've --
L:  I kinda feel like --
R:  -- we've been over there and ...
L:  Yeah, that if -- if there was anything to find they would have found it already.
R:  Yeah, I really do.
L:  I mean --
R:  I do, too.
L:  They've -- they've been searching for what, like a month now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In addition to all of the inspections that went on before.
R:  Yeah, there was inspections that went on before and there were inspections, well, in the last war.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there was inspections then.
L:  And, you know, even when there weren't inspections going on, we were still, you know, flying over the country and taking aerial photographs and spying on them and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, either -- I don't know, either they're not telling us something, you know, they know more than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're letting the public know, or -- or there's just -- you know, it's been moved.  I just don't really think that they're gonna find anything if they haven't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- found anything yet.
L:  It seems to me, though, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they found something, it's not like they're gonna keep it from us because it makes them look bad not being able to find anything.
R:  Yes, true, true. [NOISE] It's just kind of -- I don't know, I think it's -- I -- I -- I know that we need to be over there.  We need to -- and I feel we need to be over there more helping correct all the damage that we did with the bombs and things and getting them help to set up a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- society so that they don't fall into all the looting and stuff that they've been having.  And --
L:  But, I mean, ultimately a lot of that took place because of poor planning on our part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Quite frankly, I think there just weren't enough people on the ground to prevent them --
R:  To stop that, yeah.
L:  -- you know, to actually keep the peace while the invasion was going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you ended up with all this looting of museums and stuff and, you know, I saw on the news the other day that apparently the director of that museum had, like, asked the Americans to guard the museum and -- and we didn't do it.
R:  Oh, jeeze.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Thanks. [LAUGH] You know, I'm sure it's what they're thinking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know, I think -- I don't think that the inspections should even be the priority any more because if they're gonna find anything [NOISE] it's gonna be through -- I don't think it's gonna be through searching.  I think it's gonna be through people --
L:  Right.  They'll -- they'll find it in the course of, uh --
R:  Of -- yeah.
L:  -- rebuilding or of, you know, getting to know people and setting up a society there.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  People are -- you know, people are gonna be more willing to say, "Hey, this is what I know" when they don't feel like we're this horrible tyrant that's come in and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bombed them and ki- -- you know what I mean?  I think they will get what they want through the people, not through searching.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it seems to me that at this point, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Iraqis were glad to have us but their attitude now is, "Thanks for saving us.  Now go home --"
R:  Go home.
L:  "-- so that we can start our own country".
R:  Yeah, I -- I think --
L:  And I --
R:  -- they've probably had enough of us. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It seems like it's time for us to sort of back off and, you know, help them.  You know, maybe something like -- something like what we did with the Japanese after World War Two, helping them write a constitution and figure out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how they wanna set up their government.  But, you know, we have to start treating them as equals rather than as a conquered nation.
R:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE] I think it's time more to have Peace Corps and Red Cross and -- and missionary groups coming in instead of so much, um, the military, too.
L:  Although on the other hand if you send in missionary groups there's like a -- a cultural sensitivity there.
R:  Yes, that's true.  Not necessarily --
L:  Religious missionaries but --
R:  -- religious missionaries, yeah, but --
L:  But there -- oh, there are all sorts of NGOs that are willing to go over there.  I mean, uh --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know --
L:  -- you know, Habitat for Humanity does that kind of thing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, Human Rights Watch.
R:  Peace Corps and Human Rights, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And, yeah, I think it's more humanitarian stuff is what's needed.
L:  That's what they need right now.
R:  Yeah, more than -- than -- than the military presence and the inspections.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I really don't think they're going to find anything that way.  You know, after -- after all this time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and everything that we've done, if they haven't found it they're not going to.
L:  [MN] I mean, you never know.  Things sometimes just turn up, but --
R:  True.
L:  You're right, I think.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, to be honest, sort of, you know, even before all of this, I was -- I was skeptical that, you know, the weapons really existed to the degree the Bush administration wanted us to believe they did.
R:  Thought they -- yeah.  Or thought that they were --
L:  You know, I think -- yeah, I think it was more of an excuse than anything else.  They -- they wanted to get in there and -- and get rid of some evil dictators and ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- you know, and -- and I don't -- I don't disagree.  I don't think that -- that, uh, Saddam Hussein was a wonderful leader for the people but --
L:  I don't think anybody thinks that.
R:  Yeah, and -- but --
L:  I mean, you know, no matter how against the war you are, I don't think people really think that Saddam Hussein is, you know, the ideal leader for any country, but ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And -- but then you gotta -- you know, it's like, okay, [NOISE] I -- I don't know.  I -- I feel the same way.  I feel like, well, did you wanna get rid of him or did you wanna get rid of weapons?
L:  Or alternatively did you wanna get rid of him so that you could get oil?  I mean, you know, it -- it sounds --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trite but it's -- it's a legitimate concern.  It's the reason we went in the first time.
R:  Yeah, with the pr- -- well, the protection of the Kuwaiti oil, too, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Whereas this time we weren't really protecting anybody except them and -- and us.
L:  Yeah.  Sort of protecting them from each other.
R:  Yeah.  And I don't know that they feel like we did that.  I know there's a lot of people that think it's -- it was all over oil.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think there was more to it.  I don't --
L:  Yeah, I mean, obviously I don't think it's as -- as uncomplicated as any of the, you know, protest slogans make it sound on either side.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, true.  [SIGH] I don't know.  There was -- [NOISE] we -- we've bombed so much and I -- you know, I figured with -- if they had anything I thought they would have retaliated with it. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, there was -- there was really no reason not to.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It wasn't like they -- they [inaudible] they were gonna win, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- much as the information minister got on TV.
