R:  Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
L:  Hi, Elizabeth, I'm Rob.
R:  Nice to meet you, Rob.
L:  Yeah.  Whereabouts are you located?
R:  [NOISE] In Dallas.
L:  Dallas!
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm in Seattle.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  I am.
R:  Wow.
L:  Well, my brother and his wife live in, um, Granbury, outside of Dallas, Fort Worth.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  You know --
R:  I know exactly where it is.  I've been there.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, they've li- lived there for almost thirty years.  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I'm pretty familiar with your neck of the woods.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how come they have us talking about holidays --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in the middle of May? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  Or the beginning of May.
R:  -- I'm not sure.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Getting prepared for the rest of the year, I suppose? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  I guess.
R:  [MN]
L:  Do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  I have s- -- couple of favorite holidays.  I think my two favorites are, uh, Christmas and Fourth of July.
L:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I think those are --
R:  And I guess you wanna know why? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Well, Christmas is the celebration of the birth of my Lord and Savior, for me.  Not necessarily for the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Fourth of July is so patriotic and I -- I love the -- the patriotism that's displayed.
L:  A celebration of the birth of our nation.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Two birthdays.
R:  [MN] birth -- births are important. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I think I probably like Christmas, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I'm around children.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I am single, I don't have kids and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, most of my family is -- is far removed, as I mentioned my brother is down in Texas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, I always enjoy spending -- this past, uh, Easter I spent, uh, with some friends who have a three year old --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's fun. [NOISE]
L:  -- and he was just thrilled with his Easter eggs and his Easter bunny and the whole routine, and it was -- it was kinda fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think holidays like that are goods for kids and families [MN] I don't --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  I don't -- I don't really have a favorite holiday.  I used to teach school and any holiday was a welcome holiday --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when it came up on the schedule. [LAUGH]
R:  Of course it was. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, Easter is -- is a favorite of mine but I'm [MN] [SIGH] I don't know that I have a, uh, special celebration for Easter persona- -- in my personal life.  In my, uh, faith it's very, uh, special for me.
L:  Right.
R:  Because Christmas has no meaning without Easter.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And it's not really Easter, it's Resurrection.  It's -- e- -- Easter is a pagan holiday.
L:  Well, that's the thing.  All of the -- the holidays that are celebrated in our society, I was going to say are -- are from --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- pagan seasonal, you know, festivals.  And, uh, um, I'm, uh, [MN] not a churchgoer myself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but have a -- a specific, you know, was raised in a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Christian tradition.  I have a specific, uh, set of beliefs --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, and it what's bothers me very much, that's why I kinda when I don't really have a favorite  --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- per se, though I like to be around kids on Christmas and Easter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, the commercialization is just outrageous and, uh --
R:  Oh, it is.  And it j- disgusts me.
L:  And even -- even Mothers' Day coming up here, has become more of a thing to sell flowers and candy and cards than it is --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to really honor mothers and grandmothers.
R:  Absolutely.  And it -- [MN] all holidays seem to have become very worldly and paganistic and I don't, um, I don't subscribe to any of that.  I -- I take my personal stand against the commercialization by -- I don't send Christmas cards.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I -- I --
R:  I do buy gifts --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and celebrate, but I don't [MN] buy into the commercialization.  I try not to go overboard in gift buying.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I really resent the commercialization a lot.
R:  Oh, I do.
L:  And -- and --
R:  I do.
L:  Both in years where I've had a l- -- a fair amount of money and where I've had literally no money.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I started some years ago as far as the Christmas holiday, I have several Jewish friends who celebrate Hanukkah of course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm not in a position to give their kids eight presents. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, um --
R:  Exactly. [NOISE]
L:  -- I started some years ago, um, instead of sending presents, because I do have a bunch of nieces and nephews and at this stage of the game my two oldest nieces have two kids each theirselves, so that's, uh, it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- beyond the budget, you know?  Um ...
R:  Of course. [NOISE]
L:  So, I started, uh, some years ago making donations to a favorite charity and that sort of thing. [NOISE]
R:  And that's a wonderful thing to do.
L:  And then having them send a card and, uh, I was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- tickled this last Christmas 'cause my, um, my youngest -- or my sister's youngest daughter, a niece who doesn't have kids but is married, um, gave for me, uh, for Christmas, a contribution to the American, uh, Society for -- for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  And I got this nice letter in the mail, and it was such a nice surprise.  I went --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "That's so much better than getting --"
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  "-- some trinket sent across the country".
R:  Getting something that -- yeah, getting something that you're gonna put in a closet and never look at again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And having to pay shipping on it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, exactly.  That's what really killed me.  I always gave books or music, and -- and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sending -- even sending a CD is almost as expensive as buying --
R:  As buying it.
L:  -- a CD.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And you don't know that it won't get damaged.
R:  Right.
L:  And books --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- books have become so expensive, uh, but the cost, like you said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of shipping is -- is really prohibitive.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I've given in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the past, um, this last year I, um, donated to a scholarship fund for -- for underprivileged kids and --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wonderful.
L:  -- I did it in the names of, you know, my nieces and brothers and sisters and, uh, very close friends.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I get as much pleasure out of that, I mean, I like to give more than receive anyway, but I get as much pleasure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as the whole -- I just -- I -- I don't go to malls.  I don't -- 
R:  I stay away.
L:  I just don't.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just won't go into them [LAUGH] and I think the last time I was in a mall is my watchband broke and to get it repaired the nearest jewelry store was in a mall.  And that's --
R:  I -- I only go to the mall when I absolutely have to have something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I can't get it any other way and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I buy online sometimes but I'm not real comfortable with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I eschew  that entirely too.  But the other holidays when -- when I was, uh, I was engaged for some years, to be married, and -- and the woman who I was to marry had a very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- large family and for several years there, every Ch- Christmas and Easter were of course big times for a big family, but every holiday we had to go to her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family's.  This got kinda old --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because my family was spread all over the country but her's was all in suburban Boston.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm talking about Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, every birthday of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- six siblings --
R:  Oh, my word.
L:  -- uh, plus the mother and dad.  Um, you know, Thanksgiving --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh -- uh, Labor Day, uh, there was big traditional end of summer barbecue.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, absolutely.
L:  Memorial Day, traditional beginning of summer barbecue.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  July fourth of course --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- big family barbecue. [LAUGH] And I --
R:  I'm familiar with that whole scene.
L:  -- I loved her dearly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I love her family still, but [LAUGH] it got really old because it felt like there was this long parade of events --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at her hou- -- her family's house.
R:  A long parade of potato salad. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Maybe that's when I got a little less, you know, um, [MN] excited about holidays, I guess is the word.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  But today's a holiday in Kentucky.  It's, uh, Derby Day.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, in fact, when the phone rang here I'd just watched the Kentucky Derby, uh, from Louisville.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L: -- for people who live there, this is a holiday. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I would imagine.
L:  So, what prompted you to respond to the, uh -- uh -- to get involved in this study?
R:  [MN] You know what, I'm not sure?
L:  Did you see, like, an ad?  'Cause I just saw this funny ad in the local paper and I called the eight hundred number and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- low and behold, this is the second call I've been on.
R:  Well, this is my second.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I got an email --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from a fr- -- a lady that I know that does mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  She, um, she schedules mystery shoppings.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And I've done a few things for her and then I got an email from her [MN] with several mystery shops and this.  And I thought, "Well, that sounds interesting.  I think I'll check that out".
L:  Neat.
R:  So, I've been and I signed up.
L:  Yeah.  Cool.
R:  I thought, "Well, how cool is that?"
L:  Yeah.  I -- I --
R:  I like to express my opinions, and get paid for it, wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  There you go.  I found it fascinating --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and when I talked to the -- the lady, when I called the eight hundred number to enroll, it sounds like quite an extensive study.  I mean, if they're able to have this fancy robotic v- -- system to call people all over the country and to pay them for ten minutes of their time.  It must be really extensive.
R:  Yeah, and connect -- actually connect people.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty neat.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I thought so too. [NOISE]
L:  So, um, do you have, uh, plans for the July fourth coming up this summer?  Or do you stay near home or what do you do?
R:  Actually, I do.  I have a friend who is having [NOISE] a very, uh, special birthday, uh, July third, oh, no, fourth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we usually celebrate her birthday on July first.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] So, we always tease her every year about the whole -- the whole United States celebrates her birthday every year with fireworks and everything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely
R:  So, we're planning on having a big party this year.
L:  Terrific.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  July fourth is -- is not when we observe a lot -- because I have a dog who is now twelve years old and Charlie is not a big fan of fireworks.
R:  Ooh, a --
L:  Ch- Ch -- Charlie, uh, one year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I tried to go -- there's a park in my neighborhood, which has a view of the Space Needle downtown, where they do fireworks.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, so, we were gonna watch the fireworks from there.  Unfortunately, the neighborhood we were in around the park, lots of people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were firing them off in their yard.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And he just went berserk.  And, so --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- the next year I tried to go out camping out in the mountains that weekend and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- low and behold, wouldn't you figure, you try and -- you try and escape civil- --
