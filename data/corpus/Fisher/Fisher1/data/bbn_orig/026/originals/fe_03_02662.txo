R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hey.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  T- -- hey, this is Caitlin.
L:  My name is Lavon.
R:  Hey, Lavon, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  So, we're talking about holidays, today? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that what's happening?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm --
R:  Do you have a --
L:  I'm watching the Kentucky Derby on TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's almost like a holiday.
L:  Oh, I know. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're ge- -- they're getting ready to run.  The horses are getting ready to race in a few minutes.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I'm like, "Oh, no.  They didn't call me at this time".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Is this your first time doing this?
R:  It is, is it yours?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  And they tried to call me twice already, but they missed me both times.  So, now finally, it's ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's worked out.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, do you have a -- a favorite holiday?
L:  Probably Christmas.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  And yours?
R:  [SIGH] Gosh, I don't know.  I really like the Fourth of July because I love how festive summer feels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like, it feels to me like we should all still take vacations like we did when we were kids, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Beyond --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Beyond break -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for the summer.
L:  I like Christmas because, not only -- I think it's a holiday for everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, not only for kids but, you know, families -- your fa-, you know, most of -- everyone's whole family gets together and the presents and things.  I think it's fun buying even though you hate afterwards where you have to pay all the bills.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I think it's fun to go out and buy presents for people and then to see the -- the -- the happiness on the childrens' face.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that's why I like, you know, Christmas.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um ...  Now we're supposed to stay on here for ten minutes, right?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Think you can watch the horses and talk at the same time?
L:  Ah ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what's your -- well, I guess they said that the holiday we like the m- -- the most, right?
R:  And then if you could make your own holiday, what would it be?
L:  Hm.  Probably, a holiday would be the, um ...
R:  See, for me it's definitely something that involves eating. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Lots of cooking --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- lots of food --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- lots of frie- -- family and friends.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it should be a day where you don't have to go to work.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  I mean, you know what I mean?  Like a, off work holiday.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, where everyone is off of work and you just do whatever you want to do but nothing conce- concerning work.
R:  Right.  Like, they can't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- even make you take something home with you. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH] If you work on the phone at -- like if your job if you work on the phones I think you shou- -- you shouldn't even touch the phone that day.
R:  Mm, Mhm.
L:  Um, just, I don't know, just something like that.  I think --
R:  No computers for anybody.
L:  -- that would be a cool holiday. [LAUGH] 'Cause a lot of the holidays other than, like, Christmas and things, a lot of people still have to work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  No, it's true.
L:  So ...  Oh well, that's what I -- I -- I think that would be pretty cool.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I wish that we could come up with a holiday that was global.  That wasn't related to a particular country's event.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that wasn't related to a particular religion's event either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something that everybody could celebrate and nobody's gonna feel excluded.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I think that would be really valuable.  'Cause it seems like ei- -- I mean, you know, either you're celebrating something from your religion or something like the Fourth of July so it's part- particularly American.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it doesn't mean anything to anybody else [LAUGH] --
L:  Independence Day.
R:  -- outside of America.  Right.
L:  But I think, um, like, Canadians, they have a Independence Day too, but theirs isn't the same as ours though, right?
R:  Right, it's a different day.
L:  It's a different day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then of course, like, with Christmas you have the Jehovah Witnesses, they don't celebrate it.
R:  Right.
L:  Or ...  Kwan- --
R:  Or anybody who's Jewish --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- Muslim or ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  Now, Mothers' Day ...
R:  Well, that's true.  Is that international or just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- American?
L:  I think that's international.  Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day.
R:  Oh, well that might be
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Are you a mother?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't have any kids.
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've got -- I have two step children, but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- one's sixteen and the other one, he's grown, he's twenty seven. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, I have a lot of niece and nephews. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You're -- does your whole family get together on most holidays?
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My father, he just passed, um, last month --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think, like, Memorial Day will be kinda, you know?
R:  It'll be tough.
L:  Yeah, it'll be kinda sad because, you know, he's always been there, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  But, [SIGH] that's one of those things in life.
R:  And has your mother already passed or is she still around?
L:  No, she's still alive.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  So, um, I think it'll be harder for her than -- than us, you know, than the children.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh --
R:  Do you have a big family?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  You've a big family?
L:  Um, it's four -- I have four brothers and sisters.
R:  That's pretty big.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, six of us. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm an only child, so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh.
R:  But, uh, my dad's got a brother and a sister and they all have kids in my generation, and, uh, [SIGH] so, and we all live real close by, so it seems like having brothers and sisters sometimes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  So, how many children do you have?
R:  Oh, I don't have any yet.
L:  Oh, you don't?
R:  I -- I definitely plan to, just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not -- not yet.  I'm too young, so ...
L:  Do you want to have a lot of kids?
R:  I don't know.  I mean, there seem to be nice a- -- there's something nice about being an only.  You know, you get all that one on one time with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your parents and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, on the other hand, you know, when I get older and my parents get older and they need taking care of and stuff like that I'm going to be all on my own.
L:  Right.
R:  That's gonna be tough.  And plus, I think holidays --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- would be more fun to have.  
L:  But, um, u- --
R:  You know, the more people you have.
L:  -- usually people that don't have any siblings, they usually have at least two children, don't they?
R:  Do they?  I don't know.
L:  I'm thinking, because they -- usually they think that with them knowing that they've only been the only child, they would want their child to have another sibling.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's it but then again, the way the, um, economy is now, it's -- it's -- it's rough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I think you're so much shaped by how you grow up.  Like, I have a friend who was -- who had a twin and he passed away when they were children.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so she swears now that she'll only ever have three kids or more --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- so that God forbid something happens to one of them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- no one child is left alone --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because that's what she had to live with, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think it's very much shaped by what you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  How are the horses doing?
L:  Oh, they just had one [NOISE] Funny Side.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah [LAUGH] I think he was a long shot too.
R:  See, this is kinda like a holiday, people --
L:  Just be- --
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Getting toge- -- it's kinda like a holiday, to celebrate the Kentucky Derby.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's so many celebrities there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a million dollar race and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's -- it's a big upset because everyone was thinking that, um, this one -- they had a favorite horse called Empire Maker --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he didn't -- he -- he didn't do anything, did he?  [NOISE]  He came in third [NOISE] but the -- this horse Funny Side, I think his odds were real low.  He's the o- -- huh?  Twelve to one.  Twelve to one odds, um, he's the one that won.
R:  Wow.  
L:  But so- --
R:  Some -- somebody's real happy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Somebody's laughing all the way to the bank.
L:  Yeah.  But it's -- I -- I -- I haven't actually been, I mean, I live in Kentucky.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I'm eighty seven miles from where the derby is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've been up there to the derby festivities but I've never actually been in, you know --
R:  Right, watched it there.
L:  -- to the derby.  But, um, here where I live and in Lexington they have Kingland, where there's usually, like, twenty seven thousand people that go out there today, on derby day, and you can go out there and bet.  It's just like you're there at Kingland.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you know, I mean at Churchill Down, you know?
R:  Like an off track betting kind of a thing?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, I've been out there couple of years in a row and it's fun.
R:  Yeah.  It must get really high energy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, that's another thing I like about holidays in general, is that everybody gets so -- especially the little kids are all pumped up on sugar and everybody's all high energy and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  But I guess, also, that's why it's hard for some people.  Like, people who get, you know, depressed around the holidays or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whatnot.  I know that's pretty common for people too, now that I think about it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I don't know.
L:  That's -- that's true.   And you know, I -- I -- 'cause I hear, like, Christmas and -- is it Christmas and New Years where, you know, they have those, um, help centers that you call.  Like, the people that are real- --
R:  Oh, like a mental help line?
L:  Yeah.  The people that are really depressed, what is the two holidays that they call the most?  Christmas and Thanksgiving or Christmas and New Years?
R:  Well, you've gotta bet Christmas is one of 'em.
L:  Yeah.  I think it's Christmas and New Years or Christmas and Thanksgiving.  One of -- those are the two where they have the most telephone calls.
R:  Right.
L:  That's sad, isn't it?
R:  Yeah. It's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] 
L:  That's when they said people -- more people want to commit suicide and stuff like that.
R:  Right, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so why do you think Christmas Eve is usually social?  Like, people have friends and they go visiting and stuff, but Christmas morning is usually family?  Why do you think that is?
L:  Why do more people go to visit friends on Christmas Eve?
R:  Yeah, instead of Christmas morning. 
L:  'Cause they go --
R:  Like, I don't know, my experience with my friends has always been that they -- people go visiting on Christmas Eve but they always stay home with family Christmas morning.
L:  Right.  Um, be- uh -- Christmas mor- -- Christmas morning and day is more for the family.  Where Christmas Eve, um, a lot of people go out and drink socially --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] on Christmas Eve. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then they go to see, um -- um, well, I know some -- like, when my sister's -- my niece, when she was smaller I would go over there and help my sister put her stuff together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, a- and it -- it just depends on if a lot of people that don't have children that go ov-  -- to people's houses that do have kids on Christmas Eve, just to, you know, give a hand or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  But like I said, a lot of people go around socially [LAUGH] drinking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To drink, right.  I guess they don't want to be drinking first thing in the morning. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
