L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hey --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- my name is Joe.  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Hi, did you say, Joe?
R:  Yeah, my name is Joe.
L:  Hi, Joe.  My name's Catherine.  Um, come here, I just need to get my dog in, I'm going to close the door.  There we go --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- now we can have some quiet. [LAUGH] Yeah, d- do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  I think it's New Years.
L:  Fascinating.
R:  Um --
L:  How -- how come? [MN] 
R:  Because everybody stays -- everybody gets together and -- and drinks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That why.  And it's pure celebration and it's -- it's, you know, [MN] there's no pretension.  There's no symbols for it, first of all, except for -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- except for champagne glasses.  You know, Halloween you've got something like, black cats and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you've got pumpkins which only really go into a pie and whatnot, you know.  You've got Christmas which has got, like, Santa Claus, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New Years has got no -- no symbol and people get together and just have a good time.
L:  [MN] Just -- just out of curiosity, what's -- is it bad to have a symbol for you, or is it good to have a symbol?  It sounds like it's bad.  How come?
R:  It's kind of bad to -- well, it's not bad to have a symbol, it's just meaningless, more than anything.  It's kind of -- it kind of falls flat for me 'cause it -- it -- it just, I don't know, it makes it kind of contrived.  It makes it, uh, I don't know, like, you know -- you know, like, uh, Fourth of July would be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- al-, you know, would almost be the, uh, the other one for me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, then it's get- -- then it's all wrapped in the American flag and everything and -- and, you know, we're supposed to be proud of our government and our military on that day, and I -- I just don't -- I don't get that.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Um, so I'd rather just have one where there's no symbol. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Interesting.  And -- and you like the celebration with champagne?
R:  Yeah, I like -- I like, uh, champagne.  I know that eggnog is the other -- but it's not really a visual symbol anyway, but ... Yeah.  I like the, uh --
L:  That's so funny.
R:  I like that aspect of it.  Every other holiday has got symbols to it and it's just -- it kinda makes it corny and contrived, I think.  Every, you know, New Years is the one that's kind of neutral on that -- on that, you know, aspect of it and, you know, it's just people celebrating the new year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  What if -- what if New Year, um, didn't fall on New Years but was a different day?  It was just a celebration of happy spring, would it -- would it still have the same effect for you?
R:  Spring?  Yeah, it would actually.  It --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it wouldn't matter what day it is.  Because, you know, the Roman calendar is just an abstract, kind of, idea, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  I mean --
L:  As you can tell, I live near the train. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Where -- where exactly do you live, actually?
L:  [LAUGH] I live in California, in Richmond.
R:  Oh, I don't know where Richmond is.  I live in Los Angeles, and I just moved here three months ago, so ...
L:  Oh, it's near San Francisco.
R:  Oh, okay.  San Franci- -- I haven't been there yet.  That's one of the only major cities I haven't been to yet, in this country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm actually -- I'm from New York and I've --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- been everywhere.  But --
L:  Oh, it's -- it's good.
R:  So, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Christmas.
R:  Christmas?  Why is that?
L:  Yeah.  Eating! [LAUGH] 
R:  Eating?
L:  Baking!  Decorating!  It's -- it's all the things associated with it.  I'm -- I'm an atheist and don't believe in -- in God --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but I just like all the decorating of the house and baking and giving presents and anticipation and then it's always a serious let down afterwards but [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I -- I like Christmas.
R: I -- I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wow.  That's kinda cool how you're an atheist at the same time, and yet you celebrate Christmas.  I'm kinda, like, the same -- well, I'm -- I'm completely unreligious, like, I -- I don't think I'm -- I don't think I'm an atheist quite, I think I'm more of an agnostic, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, I grew up in a huge Catholic family and everything and, um, I don't know, er, Christmas kind of falls- -- it's kind of a letdown in that way.  Um, 'cause [MN] I, I don't know.  It -- it's, like, there's the mixture between, you know, I'm against kind of religion and commercialism and that's kind of what surrounds me about that day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but at the same time, you know, every -- every virtue that you just pointed out about it was kind of cool.  I mean, that's -- that's what I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like about Christmas too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  We're either [NOISE] the part [SIGH] --
R:  Gift giving and --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Cleo says, "Christmas, Christmas".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The -- the part that's funny to me is, I'm -- I was raised by, um, I guess you'd say probably that we were a Christian family but we were raised as little agnostic children and then --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I converted to Judaism but whilst still being an atheist.  [MN] I go to my Rabbi and say, "You know, I'm here because I -- I like the spiritual, um, moral compass of Judaism but I still don't believe in God" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so here I am as Jew being --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know, celebrating Christmas [LAUGH] but I still don't believe in God.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it's kinda -- kinda strange, but ... Yeah, I just like baking, I like decorating the house.  I like the celebration of having lots of people over to the house.  Be able to, um, make presents for people or buy them presents and, um, I just like that part, celebrating.
R:  Hm.  I --
L:  [MN] So, I -- I -- I'm with you though, Fourth of July, who gives a rat's ass?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I -- especially I'm not too proud of our government right now, anyway, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] It's just, I just do- -- I mean, in terms of holiday celebration, um, maybe I can be excited that America was born.  That's -- that's nice, but in terms of for me, baking, what am I going to make?  Oh, whoopee, you know, something red white and blue, okay, fine.
R:  Right.  There's a -- there's a more participatory element to it in Christmas.  Like, you know, so far as hosting --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh, getting together.  There's more of a, uh, you know, like, you feel more participation into it.  Or, y- you know, in the holiday, rather.
L:  Yeah, and it's a one shot deal.  Fourth of July, one day.  Not a whole lot of build up to it.
R:  No.
L:  At least with -- with Christmas there's a whole lot of inte- -- again, it is -- okay, you can say it's one day, but, oh -- oh, well.  So, yeah.  Ha- Halloween, never got into it, other than throwing, um, one day we ran out of, um, Halloween candy and so we threw cherry bombs at the little kids that came to --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- the door.  Okay, that was a bad judgment day, but I was only in fifth grade so I guess you can excuse that. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Man.
L:  That -- that was fun though.  At least it wasn't something like an M Eighty or something. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Jeez.  So, yeah, so, uh, w- -- I don't know.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Should we get to our worst holidays then or what?
L:  Yeah!  Excellent idea.  I didn't even think of that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, brilliant on your part. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I don't know what my worst is, I think Valentine's Day is a really bad one.
L:  Total Hallmark holiday!
R:  Right.
L:  Don't you think?
R:  Completely.
L:  Yup.
R:  Yeah, of course it is.  It's completely commercial and it -- it just doesn't -- you don't set a day out of the year --
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  -- to show your love for somebody.  If you're with somebody, let's say, even for three years, you don't -- you don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you don't do it on Valentine's Day.  I mean, it's j- -- I don't know.  You're supposed to do that at your own voluntary, uh, you know, will.  
L:  [MN]
R:  At your own, um , discretion.
L:  Behest.  I mean, how often do I get to use that word? 
R:  You're -- you're on what?  I'm sorry?
L:  Behest.  Isn't that -- isn't that the right word?  B.E.H.E.S.T., behest?
R:  I -- I think so.  I've only really, uh, seen it written. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Cleo, stop.  [MN] Um, 'cause pe- --
R:  But yeah, Valentine's Day would have to be the worst one.
L:  [MN] Oh, I completely --
R:  Halloween is not so bad --
L:  -- agree.
R:  -- just because, you know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's -- it's all about getting candy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and watching scary movies, so I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I -- I've heard that when you dress up for Halloween it is some part of your, um, inner desire of what you really would like to be.  So, I've noticed --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I've noticed that my sister who, um, is, you know, extremely conservative even though she claims to be a democrat, um, had chosen for -- for years to dress up as a prostitute or a punk rocker.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I always thought --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- "Hm, very interesting" very interesting.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yes, huh, okay.
R:  I'm -- now I'm thinking back of all the things I dressed up for in -- on Halloween as a kid.  I -- I dressed up as Rambo.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then -- and a pirate and then, um, Uncle Fester.
L:  Oh, excellent choice.  Did you have the light bulb that would go off in your mouth?
R:  No.  I didn't have that much. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  I didn't go that far.
L:  Pity.  Pity.
R:  But I had everything else.
L:  Cool.
R:  Um, I -- I don't know.  I -- I don't what that exactly would say about me though. [LAUGH] Rambo and Uncle Fester.
L:  A nonconformist.
R:  Say again?
L:  Nonconformist -- nonconformist.
R:  Oh, really?  Well, Ram- --
L:  Independent, nonconformist.  Um, someone that, you know, is, um, inde- -- makes their own rules and, uh, i- is able to stand on their own two feet and take care of themselves.
R:  Wow.  Well, that's kind of a nice thing [LAUGH] say about me.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm not sure though.  Uh --
L:  [LAUGH] I tried to put a nice spin on it. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think, uh --
L:  I -- I can't remember any of my costumes other than Tigger and I lost my tail and was, you know, just completely beside myself with grief and made my dad go out with our flashlight around the block until we found my tail --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- and we safety pinned it back on. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, wait, so -- okay, so, I guess that would mean that you, uh, you want to be a wilder person than you are?
L:  I --
R:  I guess.
L:  I'm --
R:  If you're -- you want to be a -- you want to be a tiger.  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know either.  I don't know.  Maybe we -- we're degenerating into kind of, like, astrology here, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God.  Sorry, I -- I don't -- I don't buy astrology.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had a friend that asked me, um, what birth sign I -m and when I was born and the precise time and I thought it was such a load of crap so I just made something up to get her to go away [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and unfortunately she spent one hundred and fifty dollars on a very personalized astrological chart to be drawn up for me and I felt so bad because, you know, I'd made it all up and --
R:  She -- [MN] a hundred and fifty dollars?
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
