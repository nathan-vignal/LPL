L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  This is Art.
R:  [NOISE]  Hey, Art, this is Kent.  How are you doing?  [NOISE]
L:  Fine.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's an odd subject.
R:  Yeah, what are we talking about, holidays?
L:  Yeah, I guess your favorite holiday and, ah, first and then the second holiday or th- -- that is we need to make up a holiday, and for what reason.
L:  Oh, and what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I think I like to keep -- ah, let's say Halloween, because it's less commercialized.  I mean it is commercialized but [SIGH] not as much as like Christmas or, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of the other holidays.  So, I think Halloween --
R:  Yeah, I -- I --  I -- I -- I don't actually like Halloween because it's kind of like, every time I get dressed up like a doctor -- I go to a party, people think I really am a doctor.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And I always say, "Well, it's a costume".  Well, you know, but I look so much like a damn doctor.  People think I'm a doctor.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  But, ah --
L:  Actually the -- a -- a couple years ago here in -- I -- I live in LA, um, there was this guy who pretended to be a  actually a policeman, and he pulled out his gun when some policeman were walk- --taking a look, [SIGH] and they shot the guy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I actually read that in the paper.  I'm in LA too.
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  You know -- yeah, that was really, really bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was really bad.  I actually like  I used to like New Year's Eve when I was a kid.  I kind of like, ah, [NOISE] what do I like now?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Valentine's Day's kind of nice as long as you buy the damn flowers a few days before.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, Mothers' Day's pretty nice.  It's actually that's -- yes, that is a holiday.
R:  I've got a buddy of mine getting married on Sunday.  You know, next week, Mothers' Day, which is kind of weird to be getting married on a -- on a Mothers' Day, isn't it?  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, but actually my father's birthday was on -- very close on Mothers' Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He passed away a few years ago.  So, we would, you know -- but every other year, ah, it would run on Mothers' Day so that -- we had two things to celebrate.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  This -- this thing we're doing here, I -- I'm not exactly clear what it is.  Are people doing a survey on just conversation?
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I guess a little ling- linguistics, so they're basically checking our, ah --
R:  They just -- I'm sorry, they just what?
L:  Um, basically, I guess it's a linguistics.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's, um -- I guess it's -- they're, ah, [SIGH] I'm not sure if I get it exactly -- [SIGH] I guess they're trying to decipher our, ah --
R:  Dialect?
L:  Our dialect.  Yeah.  Our -- our dialect and dialogue.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's interesting.  So, what -- what did they say?  Make up a holiday?
L:  Yeah, make up a holiday.
R:  Ah 
L:  -- you know, like 
R:  Holiday -- ah, Orgasm Day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when everybody gets to stay in the house and have as many orgasms as possible.
L:  Well, that would work.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, call it The Big O Day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where nobody leaves their house.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that -- during sit- -- high situations or during a war there, you know, I was -- there were kind of baby boomers I guess.
R:  Oh, really?  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, actually, you know, there's -- I guess a lot of sexually frustrated people out there too.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Or may- maybe make a holiday of Laughs Day, you know, everybody gets to stay in the house and  watch funny moves, or watch funny films -- ah, you know, ah, [NOISE] just you know, wa- -- wa- -- watch everything all day.  You know, the comedy.  That would be a good holiday.
L:  Oh, maybe I think I -- [SIGH] something just popped into my head.  Maybe we'll make it Less Stress Day.  [SIGH]  Everybody take a day off of work and let it be paid and that's -- oh, let people do what they want and, ah, make them go do something -- go to a park or, you know, amusement park and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just try to be young again, I guess.
R:  I think they have that.  I think it's called weekends right?  [MN]
L:  Well, yeah, but that's, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we have to throw this in the middle of the week, like on a Wednesday.  [SIGH]  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, well we're getting rich -- we -- we're getting a dollar a minute -- ah, we're getting rich.
L:  Oh, actually, I guess so.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this the first conversation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you've been in?
R:  Yeah.  I just signed up on, um, Craigslist.  How did you find out?
L:  Oh, Craigslist also.
R:  That's a damn good list, man.
L:  Yeah, a friend just told me about it two months ago.  So, I've been  on it.  I found to about like  six, seven or eight Focus groups.
R:  Yeah, I know it's really good, really, really good.  Ah -- and, ah, I don't know how this guy gets the information but he's pretty damn thorough.
L:  Yeah, well I think Craigslists they have them all over the country.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  And, actually, you know, what you should, ah, not only able -- wh- what -- what section did you see this in?
R:  Ah, I think in E.T.E.R.A. job -- etc jobs, what -- whatever that abbreviation means.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  Actually sometimes they're under community.  Sometimes they're under etc like you said.
R:  Oh, they're under community also?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  Like, sometimes they have other jobs there which, ah -- or other th- things that you could get involved in.  But try either etc or, ah,  oh, I guess that list of, um, like what I just mentioned.
R:  What about Community, is that in the same section?
L:  Yeah.  It's actually on the lef- -- all the way to the left.  Right in the first group -- group.
R:  Yeah, a buddy of mine, ah -- ah, advertises for personals and that and he gets a pretty good response.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I've, ah, just started doing that myself.  I got a few pe- -- a few responses myself.
R:  Yeah, boy -- some -- some of those ads are pretty racy I tell you.  You know, they -- they -- they don't BS around.  Right to the point.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, sometimes they get, ah, knocked out of there but, you're right, I'm surprised some of the things that they  want to do.  [SIGH]  One of the surprises that -- was this guy that wanted to do my -- my dog, or any pets and, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He wanted -- he wanted to make the dog give, ah, orgasm.
R:  Isn't that funny -- if they don't -- if they don't knock that guy out then, ah you know  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  [NOISE]  But we're supposed to be talking on holidays right?  Well, now we're talking about a guy who wants to screw his dog.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, back to holidays, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Actually I forget how many holidays  this country has, about sixteen or something?
R:  Yeah.  I'm not a big believer in this President's Day shit.  I -- I kind of feel like -- you know, I don't think your walls should stop because Lincoln or Washington was born.  You know what I mean?  It's like everything shuts down.  The President's Day.  It's like [NOISE] Christ almighty, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, it must have been some reason they did that.  Just like the Martin Luther King Day.  I think that might have been the last --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- holiday here and there.
R:  I mean I always think to myself, "Man you've got to be a pretty powerful person if everything shuts down in the country on your birthday".  I mean just think about the average Joe on his birthday.  He has a little party, maybe have a little couple of gifts.  You have a -- someone takes you out to dinner.  [SIGH]  But imagine the kind of life you've got to live [SIGH] where Post Offices shut down.  Schools shut down.  No mail.
L:  The banks shut down.
R:  No government buildings.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] coffee economy money.  But actually, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I guess a lot of rest[?] costs people money a lot of times -- um, efficiency.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, actually the holidays do help, you know, especially for the long weekends, you know, three weekends or four --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- people get away.
R:  I think when Bob Hope kicks off he -- he may be the only celebrity that's ever going to get a day.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Either that or a stamp.
R:  Either that or what?
L:  Either that or a stamp made in his honor.
R:  Oh, yeah.  He'll definitely get a stamp.  They're already like commemorating his life.  You know, they -- which is kinda good in a way.  Not waiting for a guy to die.
L:  Yeah.  Actually my roommate or -- she -- her dad had a stamp named after him in France and he's still alive.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  He re- -- I guess he did a lot during World War Two and he was the first Director of the Smithsonian Institute over at Harvard.  Just, ah -- I met him once he was -- he was the number one astrophysicist in the world.  His name is Fred Lawrence Whipple.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, he's still -- he's about ninety six years old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, very accomplished -- I -- actually when I went to college I think I almost -- I did use his book.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, talk about a small world.
R:  Wow.  Hey, let me ask you about this thing.  What do we do?  We talk and then all of a sudden a cheque magically appears in the mail in a couple of days, or a week or two?
L:  I -- I'm not sure but I guess they have a, you know, our pin code number and they took the information before, right?
R:  Yeah, I wasn't too thrilled with all that -- all that information they asked.  I -- I -- I didn't give the Social.  I just thought that was way too much information for not knowing ah, anything about them.
L:  Well, they didn't ask for the Social.
R:  Well, they actually did.  I didn't give it but they did.
L:  Ah.  Didn't -- did you get your email reply back?
R:  Yeah.  I did.
L:  Okay.  Well  that has your number and I guess they have a number so we -- [SIGH] they have -- they took your address.  I imagine sooner or later they'll do it, after you get your first, you know, all three in.
R:  S- -- oh, we get three, ah?
L:  Yeah.  And then you don't get three in one day.  I guess it's three -- one every other day.  I'm not too sure, but  we'll find out, I guess.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  What the heck.
L:  Yeah, I mean this is different from other surveys that -- we talk, you know, over the wine and [SIGH] whatever it is -- they -- my friend who gave me this Craigslist [SIGH] says it does always pay off.  So, 
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I know -- I -- I've, ah, I've been doing surveys for a couple of years and, you know, they're fun.  They're effortless. Le- -- you know, they're -- they're -- the -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they do everybody good.
L:  You do it for -- you know, the marketing thing?  Like this is the university so it's, ah, they're doing it for some kind of research.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, it's funny about that Craigslist thing you said.  Um, I- it's  [LAUGH]  I look at it sometimes for the entertainment value.  I say, "Holy shit!"
L:  Actually, I'm putting a little business together so I met ah, my part- -- my new partner in this.  So it's, ah, it's due to Craigslist.
R:  [MN]  Wow!
L:  So, there's -- and I'm sure I'm going to be using it to, ah, get people to work for me in the future --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- once, ah --
R:  Get it.  Yeah, they're bad one, ah, the other day the guy goes, um, he wants -- he says -- he says, "I want to set up a fantasy where I want to leave my door open.  You just come in, you know, you walk upstairs.  If you don't like what you see, you leave.  If you -- if you do just drop your clothes".  I said, "This guy -- man!  [NOISE]  I wonder how many, ah, offers he got for that".  [NOISE]
L:  Actually, there's a -- a few of those -- act- -- you know, sometimes they always redo it over and over you see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so sometimes you see the same things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, same message --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- over and over again.
R:  It's mostly for chicks who I think, um, you know, they want, ah, little sugar daddies or they want to  do a little side action to pay for school or something like that, and they don't want to really do it, you know, out in the open.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Sugar -- yeah, girls and guys.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, you know, there's all kinds of -- yeah, there are some strange ones in there.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, there's one guy who wanted his wife to be gang banged by --
