L:  Hi.  I'm Debra from Kansas.
R:  I'm Denise from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you, too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What part of Kansas are you from?
L:  Ah, Eastern Kansas now.  For many, many years Western Kansas.  I'm in town called Forlina[?].
R:  Really.  Oh, wow, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Originally from New York, though.
R:  Oh, really?  You don't have an accent. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm in -- [LAUGH] well, I've been out here so long they embarrassed me out of it. [LAUGH]
R:  I understand. [LAUGH] Well, that's good.  Oh, jeeze.  I, um -- have you ever done one of these before?
L:  Yes, I did one last night.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, this is my second one.  I did one last night, too, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] This -- this is an odd topic.  It's kind of an after the fact topic.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, did -- didn't everything end -- didn't it end today or was that yesterday?  The --
L:  Well, yeah, the -- the official hostilities --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- are over.  We're still fighting but, yeah, the war's technically over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess we've done what we need to do with Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  That's what I thought, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, well, when they gave me the topic I thought, "This'll be interesting". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I know.
L:  Ah, we may have to go to Syria, but I think we've taken care of Iraq.
R:  I know, really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  I know.  Last night I had a topic on reality television, so that was more -- I think that was a little different [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Yeah, it was -- last night I had a -- a -- I'm older --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I had a college kid, so it was a lot of fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm -- I sound young, but I'm twenty seven, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, you are young. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Well, thank you.  I know I feel old, but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, you're the age of my daughter, my oldest. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] Yeah, I, um -- actually I -- you know, I, um -- well, I just started a new job, but I had a, um, an account in Kansas City, um, in Missouri not Kansas, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I had someone that just -- I was a recruiter and I just had someone the other day, they, um, got a job, so I'm actually gonna make commission off of my last job, which is good. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good.
R:  So, yeah, somebody got a job out there for one of -- it's a Pittsburgh account, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I just found that out today, so --
L:  Kansas City, Missouri, that's the rough part of town. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  It's a little rougher than the Kansas City, Kansas part.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is Kansas City, Kansas, smaller, though, or ...?
L:  Uh, yeah, it's smaller and it's, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- probably -- it's a little wealthier, a lot less crime.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, more crime on the Missouri side.
R:  Oh, is there really?  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, and their school system is struggling on that side.  I'm a teacher, so I know all about their school system. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  What do you teach?
L:  Middle school social studies.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, we've been talking a lot about Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sure. [LAUGH] I know.  So, yeah, what -- did you watch when the, um, when the president went on to the aircraft carrier yesterday?
L:  Yes.  In fact, I was kind of watching it when they were doing the survey last night.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Because when the phone rang, I thought, "Now, who would be calling me --"
R:  Oh, gee. [LAUGH]
L:  "-- from two one five area code?"
R:  I know, I was just -- I was just out for dinner and stuff.  Yeah, 'cause I thought that, um, I thought that the phone number would come from a one eight hundred number and then it came from two one five, so I'm like, "Oh, that -- this has to be it" so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, this has -- this has been interesting.  I wasn't quite sure if they were on the up and up with the phone survey.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  So, this has been kind of fun.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I'm, like, I don't even know what else to say about Iraq because --
L:  It's tough.  We are -- we're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's done, they're turning themselves in, we're looking for Baghdad Bob --
R:  Exactly.
L:  When we find him I guess the war's really over. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, do they think that Saddam is -- is killed or not or what's the ...?
L:  I -- well, they're saying they think he's alive.
R:  Oh, they -- okay.
L:  But, um --
R:  'Cause I -- I've heard mixed things and I haven't been able to keep up with it when I'm at work and everything, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, the last I heard is they think he's alive.  They're not --
R:  Okay.
L:  They're not sure.  We don't know one way or the other, but I guess anything that's being said in that country we're basically eavesdropping --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and so they think he may be -- they think his son is dead.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, Uday, the oldest one, the one that was --
R:  Uday, yeah, oh.
L:  The one that was really crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the one who, like, raped women and did all that, yeah.
L:  Yes, and tortured his Olympic team.  Yeah, he was a sweetheart. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, really.  I know, I was watching a special about him. I'm like, "Oh, that's just great.  You know, I wouldn't live in that country". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, like father like son. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Well, they even said they thought he was worse than his father.
R:  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.
L:  Because they said Saddam at least would give you -- might g- -- might give you a second chance --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- but his son wouldn't.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  Um, he -- he trained them to be cold, and they were.
R:  Yeah.  You know what, it's sad 'cause, um, the one day I was watching on Good Morning America and they were talking about the war in Iraq and they were talking to the children over there, and it was just so sad because they said -- they were asking them, you know, "How do you feel about the US coming into your country and ...?" and they were actually glad that we -- you know, we came over there.  And then they said, you know, "Could you, um" -- "What could you say about, you know, about Saddam or whatever?  Like, are you glad -- you know, what's going on?"  And when they said they really couldn't say anything basically negative or they could be hung.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was just -- you know what I mean?  It was just so sad to hear and it's, like, realistically, I mean, that's why the war was being fought and all these people that were pro- -- I don't know if there were protesters in your area, but there were protesters out here and I'm just -- I mean, I don't think they knew what they were doing, you know.
L:  No, they were just protesting to protest.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, here, we are in a -- in the middle of -- we're in the Bible belt and we have a major, uh, air force base here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I had students with -- with, uh, fathers and mothers who were deployed.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And so, yeah, there were no protests.  In fact, we had a huge rally in town.  It was kinda interesting to see for me what was going on back home in New York, uh, you know, with the peace, and I thought this reminded me a lot of Vietnam and people hopefully will know you can be angry at the government but don't be angry at the soldiers.  They're doing their jobs.
R:  Exactly.  I know.  They're out there protecting our country, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, yeah, very much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, these are the same protesters that were nowhere to be fou- found when September eleventh happened.
R:  Oh, yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I -- I was just -- I think people wanna go out there and they think they're doing some good, but they're just doing more harm than good, you know.
L:  Well, yeah, because it was being used -- we live in such, um, uh, everything is on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You -- we can't sneeze in this country without CNN covering it.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] I know, I know.
L:  And so they're watching this in Europe and I thought, "We don't need to be giving the French any more and the Germans any more". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] And what part of New York are you from?
L:  I'm originally from the Bronx.
R:  Oh, the Br- -- okay, [LAUGH] wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Then you really don't have an accent at all. [LAUGH]
L:  I really have lost it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  The only time it comes back is when I'm around my parents and then my --
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  -- my kids just laugh.
R:  Oh, that's so funny.
L:  Say, "Mom, you're talking like a New Yorker. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I came out here to go to college.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I've lost it.  I've been out here so long, I lost --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Oh, at the end of the day some days in school I'll get tired and I'll say, like, "Lorn" and my students will go, "Mrs." -- you know, "Mrs. H, you're, uh, you're talking funny again". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, jeeze. [LAUGH] Oh, that's funny.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it is.  How -- is the weather out there nice right now or ...?
L:  Very nice.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's really nice.  We had severe -- you know, we're Tornado Alley.  We had severe weather earlier in the week.  It's really, really nice.  And I'm keeping my fingers crossed, my grandson was supposed to be born yesterday --
R:  Are you serious?
L:  -- so I'm hoping the weather is good so we -- in fact, in Kansas City we can travel there --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and see -- yeah, my daughter who's your age --
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  -- is expecting her second -- yeah, her second --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- my second grandchild.  Pretty pumped.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But he doesn't seem -- he's not giving any indication of wanting to come out into the world.
R:  Yeah, I understand.
L:  He's too comfortable. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  She even got on the treadmill yesterday. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, jeeze.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I can't believe that.
L:  So, do you have any children?
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm very -- no, I'm very much by myself. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm still living at home, actually, so -- well, actually, I moved back home last year, so -- but, um, yeah, I just started this new job and I'm gonna be doing some traveling and try --
L:  Oh, that's exciting.
R:  Yeah, and I just -- I want to buy a house then and, you know, kinda move on with life, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We'll see, but, yeah, have to get, like, everything else settled in right now, so ... [PAUSE]
L:  This is weird.  Like I said, they gave us a topic that there's nothing really ...
R:  Yeah, nothing new on, exactly. [NOISE]
L:  Now, do you understand the purpose of why we're doing this?  Have they -- have -- I'm kind of confused a little bit.
R:  Oh, right.  How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, someone off the internet.
R:  Yeah, that's what I got, too, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's, yeah, the Fisher project, so I don't know.  Um, I don't -- yeah, like I said, this is my second -- second one, so I don't know.  'Cause I've done other research studies on the internet and gotten checks and stuff in the mail -- in the mail, but I've never done it on the phone like this, but this is interesting.
L:  Yeah, I've done internet ones, too, and I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I didn't know is it -- of it -- is it a research or are they doing a voice recognition?  It's just -- it's unusual. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, it is. [LAUGH] I don't know, I guess we'll find out after a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I keep waiting for a follow up internet email from them or something to kind of tell me --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- what this is.
R:  But there is the main -- there is the main website, I guess, so you could always go back on there, but you -- it doesn't give you any other information.
L:  It's just it's a lot of fun, though, meeting people from -- I met --
R:  I know.
L:  I talked to a guy from Maryland yesterday.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I talked to -- I talked to someone from New York yesterday, so, and she had, like, really the New York accent [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the [inaudible] accent.  So, yeah, that was interesting, though, but, yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I -- I know, I just signed up on it, like, two days ago and I just got the call, so I guess they're pretty prompt about it.
L:  Yeah, they were very.  I just -- I think I did it Wednesday.
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.
L:  Just on a lark I thought, "Oh, this'll be nice and relaxing.  This is such a stressful time of the year".  We're ending up --
