L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, I'm Jan[?].
L:  Hi.  I -- I'm sorry, what was the name?  [NOISE]
R:  Jan.
L:  Zen?
R:  Jan [NOISE] -- like Jean.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Ah, Jean.
L:  Jean?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm sorry --
R:  It's simpler.
L:  -- it's hard to hear?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, my name's Ken --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Nice to meet you, Ken.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] from Southern California.
R:  I'm in LA too.  [NOISE]
L:  Where?
R:  [NOISE]  Are you in LA?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm near LA.  Yeah.
R:  I'm in Long Beach.  [NOISE]  So 
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in Camarillo.  [SIGH]
R:  Where's that?
L:  Ventura County.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]  Okay.
L:  By the way, h- how many times have you done this?  This is my fourth.  I thought we were limited to three.  I hope I--
R:  Yeah, that's weird.  Oh, I'm -- [LAUGH]
L:  I know they're short of male voices they said, so 
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know be- -- I -- I've done it --
L:  I hope I get paid.
R:  -- this is my second time but since both of us in the -- ah, household are doing it we don't know because it's the same phone number, we don't know [SIGH] how -- how it's going to work out.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's my second time but --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's good that you can do it four times.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I hope so.  I hope I get paid for four.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I'm [LAUGH] certain[?].
L:  I'm gonna research that after I hang up.
R:  If you still get paid thirty dollars maximum you're screwed but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How did you hear about this, before we get started?  [NOISE]  Are you a mystery shopper by chance, or how did you find out?
R:  A mystery shopper?  Ah, no, I -- I 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on Craig's List[?].
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  On Craig's List.  Ah, I'm guessing because, you know, like since when you're ah, ref- -- ref -- like refer for people --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you get a dollar.
L:  Oh, okay, something like that.
R:  This lady put an ad on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Craig's List and she just said get -- 
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- make ten dollars ah, and just -- under this pin number, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was her pin number so she just put an ad --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so she got a lot of referrals.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN]  So, 
L:  [MN]  Well, ye- -- ah, did you get all of the -- the subject for today?  Something about Iraq and what we -- what you think the government should do -- what we should be doing about it, or --
R:  Yes.  We- -- ah, --
L:  Yeah, I hope it's current --
R:  -- if anything what the US government should be doing in Iraq --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- about a- arms inspection?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if, ah -- if it's a priority or not?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, what do you think, Ken?
L:  Well, I, ah, I think we've done the right thing and we should continue to do what we're doing right now and [SIGH] ah, I firmly believe in our intelligence which caused us to, ah -- to do as well as we did militarily.  And so I think that same intelligence will lead us to the weapons eventually.  [NOISE]  So, [SIGH] I think we're doing the right thing and I think we should continue.  Obviously, I wa- was in favor of the war.  [LAUGH]  You probably gathered that.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  All right.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Ah, I -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- pretty much think the opposite.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH]  But that's, ah, you know, like I think that it's not [SIGH] -- I think the intelligence purpose is -- was not -- I mean, I think people do -- like there's a lot of people here believe it's a good thing because they do believe it, but I think they are made to believe it by -- by an intelligence and a government that's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that makes people that -- makes people think that it's happening to like liberate people and make them more sec- more secure and all these things and [SIGH] -- and it -- it's not true.   Like it's other interests that are in case[?] -- that are in question and these interests, I think, should not justify goi- going to another country and killing a bunch of people.  [SIGH] but I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I believe that it's the right thing to get Saddam Hussein out of power and all these things.  But it could happen differently and mostly not under the cover that he has nuclear weapons, because they haven't found them yet, you know, and as you said the military is very performing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in very -- it's like very [PAUSE] high technology and --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- very -- like it's the best military in the world but if they really [PAUSE] they -- I'm sure they would have looked -- I mean, since they're so strong they would have found things already.  After so much time, they would've found --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, nuclear weapons and they haven't found them yet, so I think --
L:  Well, not so much of a nuclear as -- they didn't really say nuclear, it could be biological or chemical and --
R:  But they haven't said that they found them yet, you know.  Like I would --
L:  Well, but it's only been -- it's only been like less than two months.  [SIGH]  So -- and they said it's going to take some time because they're -- probably could be in a river.  They could be buried.  They could be in so many -- you know, it's a big country.  [SIGH]  So, I'm willing to give them the time and -- and so -- well, from that point of view what would you say if they did find the stuff?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Suppose tomorrow they said, "Yeah, we found it.  Here it is, it's proven" and France agrees.  Everybody else agrees --
R:  Oh, well I'd be --
L:  -- it was there all along.
R:  -- I'd be --
L:  You would change your mind then?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, first if I heard that I -- I would be very, very careful before I actually believe it -- like I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would want not the US intelligence to say it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would want -- like neutral --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like UN --
L:  Yeah.
R:  UN govern- -- like UN things --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- inspectors to find them [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and to --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like put their UN stamp on it [SIGH] because I think they are very fast in claiming that there were nuclear weapons there and that.  Remember how when they said they found things or [SIGH] -- like then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it came out that the --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- reporters calling power game[?] was like a paper written by a PhD student ten years ago.  Like the -- the things that they have used to prove their points in the -- the next few months for me have been very -- like every times [PAUSE] they -- they come -- they come up with like this, "Oh, okay we've got it" you know, we know they have them and every time it's investigated a little bit more -- 
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it -- it turns out that these --
L:  Well, yeah be- but --
R:  -- proofs are not valid.
L:  -- that's why they're investigating.  They're doing the investigation.  They were always saying in the beginning, "Well, we're not sure yet.  You know, we're going to test it and see".  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But what -- to begin with what -- what -- what interests do you think we were trying to promote -- you said our self-interests.  What -- what exactly do you think we're -- the people in power hope to get out of this if not the stated reason of [SIGH] [PAUSE] uncovering these weapons and freeing the Iraqi people?  What -- what interest is it?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I mean -- first like it's not we -- for example I don't include like [PAUSE] you and like the U- like America's people, you know --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because I -- I think that people --
L:  I said the people in power, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- the nuclear --
L:  I'm not in power.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Because I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like people do believe in it for freedom.  I mean like maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's very -- like heard and reheard but the oil thing is definitely something -- but it's beyond that it's like more [SIGH] -- like, ah, for power stability thing like [SIGH] -- because 
L:  [NOISE]  Stability?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Like stability in the region.  Like the US thinks that if they --
L:  Well, is that -- is that a bad thing?
R:  Well, but it should -- the stability --
L:  I mean shouldn't we have stability?
R:  -- from like a -- a democratic government should come from [SIGH] like the people of -- of Iraq --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like [SIGH] like doing their government because, ah, you-- ah -- if they're going to put in place a government that's obviously going to be in favor of the US [SIGH] and it's not going to be --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because for example you had sixty percent of the Shiites -- people in the streets -- and they are the majority --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so if they voted democratically they would not elect anybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- favorable to the US and that's not what's going to happen.  So it's not going to be democratic [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so the purpose -- the -- the stated purpose of giving Iraq a +democratic gov- democratic government is not -- is false according to me.  [SIGH]  And -- I mean also the fact that you know --
L:  So, wh- what -- yeah, okay.
R:  -- all the -- the Halliburton contracts were signed like months before the war and all these contracts [SIGH] that are --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- benefiting US industry and US corporations [SIGH] being signed [LAUGH] even before the war you know, [SIGH] even before they started looking for [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretext to go in makes me -- makes me think that these are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- serving like corporate [SIGH] interests and, ah, things like --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like -- like Chaney --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all these people on board of directors of major companies.
L:  So, yeah, given all that wh- what would have been your solution if you -- if you were in charge?  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  How would you have done this differently?
R:  How would I have done --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things differently?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah -- I mean we would just -- just turn -- turn your back on it and say, "Well, it's not [PAUSE] a threat to us so we're not going to do anything"?  Or --
R:  No --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like everybody I think --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- even the people who are against the war --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean because for example I was against the war but [SIGH] people who were -- like even governments who were against the war and -- as well as individuals.  Everybody knows --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like Saddam Hussein is a bad person and he's doing nothing good --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for his people.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But I think some -- the reason why he -- he stayed like that is that he was being reinforced by the fact that the sanctions were on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Like first, I would have lifted the sanctions because it's impossible for a country --
L:  Oh, lifted the sanctions.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like ten years ago, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because when people are thinking day to day what they're gonna eat they have no time to think who they are gonna -- like about the marvellous thing of freedom -- like you know, [SIGH] they don't have the energy to do this because they are struggling -- like every day to like know what they're going to eat -- like having their children dying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the hosp- --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like because there's no -- they can- they couldn't get any medicine you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] right now the rhetoric is like, "Oh, we're building hospitals" but these hospitals have been without any medicine for like ten years because of the sanctions.  First, I would have lifted the sanctions a long time ago.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And then like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if Saddam Hussein was still in power --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- and the people were still showing to not be happy about him, because I'm sure they would not be happy.  [SIGH]  I mean I'm sure if the +sanctions -- the sanctions would have been lifted --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people would have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they really didn't like him, they would have organized then got him out -- gotten him out of power.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I mean, ah, Bush senior should have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could have remove -- removed him out of power ten years ago and he didn't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that's a mystery to me.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- I would've evaluated the situation and I would have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like no country can go in because that's too like you're invading a country's sovereignty and you --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are yourself a country -- that's doesn't work.  But you should send UN teams [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to [MN] evaluate the problems --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then NGOs to like educate the people and like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- educate them about how they could [PAUSE] like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, build --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the infer- -- organize and--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make parties and like [NOISE] build part --
L:  [NOISE]  But the trouble is when you have a dictator like Hussein who's so much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in control [NOISE] and was such a threat to his people and was executing the people.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's pretty hard to organize any kind of a revolt when they know that n- not only they, but their family, would be at such risk.  [SIGH]  And from the prisons that we've liberated and, ah, areas that we've discovered [SIGH] -- everything from the torture chambers to the [PAUSE] killing fields, I -- I don't see how we could have ever encouraged them to [NOISE] revolt.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I mean --
L:  I mean he had his thumb over it in such a manner that, ah, [NOISE] I don't see how we could've done anything.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I agree --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that it would've been --
