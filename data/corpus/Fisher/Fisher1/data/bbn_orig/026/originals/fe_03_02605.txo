R:  Hello.  I'm Ruth Ferrari.
L:  Hello.  My name's Matthew Newberry.
R:  Hello, Matthew.
L:  How you doin'?
R:  Oh, fine.  Uh --
L:  Uh, it's kind of a nice day --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  It's a really nice day here in Oklahoma today.
R:  Oh, you're in Oklahoma?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Little bit cloudy today.
L:  Oh, is it really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's a little -- it's a bit too hot here today.  It's getting that time of year where we're gonna have to turn the air on.
R:  Mm.
L:  Won't turn it off until probably September or so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well.
L:  But Massachusetts, always wanted to, like, go there.  My wife and I like to travel.
R:  [NOISE] Do you?  Do you?  Well, yeah, we -- we can -- we get to travel every so often, but my husband's there in Wichita Falls, uh, Texas.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  At Shepherds Air Force Base.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, um, well, what is your view on what the United States should do in Iraq?
R:  Well, um, I agree with it.  I, uh --
L:  I certainly do as well.
R:  Pardon?
L:  I do as well.
R:  Oh, good. [LAUGH] Well, nice we both agree on it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, no, I -- I think, um -- I support the President, I support our troops, and, you know, I really feel that, um, if we didn't do something he would've, Saddam I'm talking about.  So, um, and, um, and I -- I think it's -- it's proven well what he's done, um, what Bush has done, and, um, the efforts and, um, I just hope that he continues to.
L:  Well, I do, too.  I -- I agree that, um, we had no choice in the matter, you know.  We had to go over there and do something because, you know, that guy was -- he was just doing so many illegal things and so many wrong and immoral things it just -- you know, it had to be taken care of.  And I hope we can just stay there in Iraq and make 'em free.  That just seems kind of impossible, but I guess that's what's gonna happen, you know, which would be really nice.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I was sad to see that our so called allies turned their backs on us.
L:  Yeah, they didn't have any faith at all, did they?
R:  [SIGH] No, they didn't.  Um, I was, um ... I -- I really, you know -- but I guess some of the stuff that's come out and is currently coming out I think last -- this last week where they've found some documentation where actually the French helped --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- him before the war --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- um, was really quite a slap in the face, you know.  Um ...
L:  I'm -- I don't know.  I've always had kind of a -- a sour opinion of France and the people there just because how they -- they just dislike Americans, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they -- and after this, I really don't like it over there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  And, um --
L:  I don't -- I don't even have a desire to go there any more.
R:  No.  No, I don't.  I don't.  I know that there are a few, um, that don't agree with what France has done, that -- we have a -- a gentleman that works, er, where we work, where I work, and, um, he is French and, um, he said, uh, he didn't agree with it.  And he said, "It makes me ashamed of my own people" and ...
L:  Wow.
R:  So, there are a few out there.
L:  Yeah, I can imagine it's, you know, not -- not the whole country.  Just like here in the United States, there's some people who for some reason don't agree with what we're doing.
R:  Mm.
L:  Or don't -- don't believe that it's right, you know.
R:  No, there are --
L:  And --
R:  -- and that's what makes us free.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, free to be able to do it, you know, to -- to be able to say, "No, I don't agree with it".  Um --
L:  Yeah, and I -- I'm thankful for that right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  But I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they have the right to sit in the streets and block the traffic and --
L:  No.
R:  -- and, you know, uh, tie up our policemen when, you know -- that I don't believe.
L:  No.
R:  Have a peaceful march.  Go for it.
L:  Yeah.  Speak your mind, you know, when -- when you have an opportunity to, but don't -- don't interfere in our everyday lives with it, you know.
R:  Absolutely.  Definitely.
L:  But yeah, I just -- it just doesn't even seem real that we've gotten fo- so far along that, you know, we're starting to actually rebuild the place.
R:  Yes.
L:  To actually have them wanna be free and to wanna be like us and it's just amazing, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yes.  I -- I -- I do hope that they will be able to [SIGH] have a balance there of representation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I worry that the Shiites will try and overrun it.  Um ... you know, um, true, you know, the majority of the people are Muslim, and that's fine, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I hope we can find that they -- you know, that they can establish a fair representation of all the people.
L:  Yeah, where they can at least -- like, we -- we believe over here that it doesn't matter what religion you choose as long as we can get along and --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- enjoy our freedom together.  It would sure be nice if they can somehow figure something out like that, 'cause I agree with you.  I think that so many of them are gonna be so [SIGH] hard to, uh -- hard to understand the other side --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as their own people even, you know, that they're just gonna say, "I'm right and this is all there is" and if it doesn't go this way then it'll end up being just like what we just got rid of, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Th- that's true.  That's true.
L:  But I'm just -- I'm hoping, knocking on wood, that things can just be planned out right and hopefully they can, you know, understand that we deal with the same situation, only with us it's, you know, we've got Baptists and Catholics and Jews and -- and any kind of religion out there.
R:  And Muslims.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And we get along fine.  You know, we can stand hand in hand, you know.  It would sure be nice if we can somehow indoctrinate that into them, you know.
R:  Yes, yeah.  Their -- their cultures are so very different than ours and, um, I -- I think that's -- that's one thing that we have to work in is, um, their culture, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, which takes in a lot of their religion, you know, but, um ... [MN] it's not going to be easy and I don't think it's gonna be quick.
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  And, um, I just -- I -- I hope that, you know, a lot of people -- we're just such, aren't we, just such a instant society?  We want everything instantly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We think, "Well, why can't you just mirror us right now?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, be exactly like us but they're never gonna be like us.
R:  No.
L:  They might be -- they'll be better off because they're not underneath that guy's stronghold any more but --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- it's gonna be -- it's gonna be a totally different kind of society than ours.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I [MN] -- oh, I -- I think so, but hopefully it will be a society that will be able to [SIGH] accept America and be allies with America, you know.  I think, you know, instead of, like, France, slap us in the face.
L:  Yeah.  And then, you know, as soon as we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel, as soon as they started to thank us and pr- -- you know, tell us, "We -- we are glad that you came here and tried to get him off of us and we appreciate that" then -- then France just wanted to be all a part of it then.  But they wanted to be a part of the, uh -- you know, they wanted to have some kind of part of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- rebuilding it, you know, have -- have -- "I want my share" but they sure didn't wanna help us.  They just -- I get on my soapbox because it -- it does bug me, you know.
R:  No, I [MN] -- it's -- it's funny because I just so totally agree with what you're saying.  Um, I really do.  It -- it's like, you know, [MN] I think they're trying to get their hand in it because they wanna ensure their [SIGH] agenda.  They want to -- they wanna ensure their portion and, um, to make sure that -- that they get benefit out of it.  It's for their benefit.  It's not for anybody else's.
L:  Yeah, that's just so selfish, you know.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  We -- when -- when we're -- we're, you know -- we've lost some lives already.  We've -- we've had to -- we've paid the ultimate price, which is what war is, you know, and what have they paid?  They haven't given anything other than a headache.
R:  No, they've -- they've -- they've done and paid nothing.  No, no, wait a minute.  Maybe they paid Saddam. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But it -- it sure is nice to get to see images now of American flags waving --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and people, you know --
