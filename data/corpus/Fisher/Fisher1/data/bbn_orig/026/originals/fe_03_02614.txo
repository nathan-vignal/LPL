L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Th- hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think?  Do you think the US should be disarming Iraq?
L:  [NOISE] Should -- should Iraq what?  I -- I didn't hear the -- hear the question that clear.  Should Iraq -- fight with -- fight or something like that?  I didn't hear it.
R:  Yeah, and should we be disarming Iraq?
L:  Disarming Iraq?  Mm, I -- I really don't have any much comment about the Iraq.
R:  What is your nationality?
L:  Um, Chinese. [NOISE]
R:  Chinese.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you feel that affects your decision at all?
L:  Mm, no.
R:  Do you have family still in China?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  No.
R:  Um, I -- I guess personally I think we should be over there because I fear for our safety here in the United States.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And the safety of our children.
L:  [NOISE] That sounds right.
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- it -- it comes down to who you believe, you know, whether you believe Saddam Hussein and what he's saying as, you know, that he doesn't have any nuclear weapons or that, [SIGH] um, you know, that he's not doing anything wrong over there, or if we believe President Bush and whatever information --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he has.
L:  Well, I -- I really -- I -- at first I thought there shouldn't be any war actually.  It's really, you know, a war which would really create more problem, like, that's what I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you ask me whether there should be a war, I'd say no, I don't think so.  We should try to make peace and try to settle it down without having to, you know, send our -- send the soldiers to fight for their lives and some have lost their lives.
R:  I know.  That's awful.
L:  Yeah.  I don't like that.
R:  I know, that's very sad.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you think -- did you support President Bush before the war?
L:  [NOISE] Um, well, I -- I -- I did choose him as a president be- -- over Al Gore because I didn't -- I don't -- that was the first time I -- I, um -- [NOISE] -- um, oh, I don't know.  I really don't have much --
R:  It was the first time you voted?
L:  [NOISE] Hm? [NOISE] Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Two boys are fighting here.
R:  I have two little ones, but they're in bed already. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so, would you vote for President Bush in the next election?
L:  [NOISE] No, I wouldn't.
R:  You wouldn't?
L:  [inaudible] -- no, I wouldn't.  I don't think he make good decisions because he -- he said to -- to have this war without really, you know, thinking about what -- what do we think, what -- what the United States people, you know, [inaudible] about it.
R:  Well, but there are statistics that show that more of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- American people support the war than those who don't support the war.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  So, I mean, like, if it -- I don't -- I -- if you took a vote, I think we -- that the American public would have voted for war and not against it.
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you not think so?
L:  That's -- yeah, that's true.  But, you know, I'm -- I'm not, you know, part of the, um [LAUGH] -- that -- that decision, so I don't know, it's really hard for me to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, okay, okay. [NOISE] [inaudible].
R:  You what?
L:  I said [inaudible] I have to -- my little boy bite his big brother.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... um ...
R:  Uh ... what do you think about the use of nuclear weapons?
L:  Nuclear weapon, I don't think there should be anything, but I hope they will find -- find it and -- and destroy it.  Everybody's fear of them. [NOISE]
R:  So, should we have any as -- should --
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  Should the United States have any?
L:  No, I don't think so. [NOISE] I wouldn't -- I wouldn't go --
R:  What about the other countries that have them?  Should we go after them also?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yes?
L:  I think yes, yes. [NOISE]
R:  So then, why don't you believe that we should have had a war with Iraq?
L:  [NOISE] Mm, because I really fear for the -- all these soldiers dying.  I -- I really feel very bad for them.
R:  Mm.
L:  Those parents, those families who so- whose son has to go out there and fight, that's -- that's what I fear.  Just don't want [NOISE] -- want more trouble, more [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the [inaudible] the world is really falling ... [PAUSE] [NOISE] How long is this -- this thing? [LAUGH] Has to be ten minutes, right?
R:  Yeah, I think it's for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah.  And we just talk about Iraq? [NOISE]
R:  Iraq and disarming them, and I guess American involvement over there.
L:  Uh-huh.  Mm, no -- [NOISE]
R:  Do you know anyone personally that's over fighting in Iraq?
L:  No, I don't, I don't.
R:  Huh.
L:  Personally I don't know.  I know a few of the teachers in our -- our building, their husband or their brother is a soldier and they went over there, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [NOISE] ...
R:  'Cause I think that's what makes it more realistic when we know someone who's over there or we know someone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or we know someone's family who knows someone that's over there.  I don't know. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes just seeing stuff on TV, it -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- it's -- it's not real to me.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] [inaudible] it's over, is that the war is over --
R:  I know.
L:  But they still haven't -- they still haven't really caught the person that they wanted to catch.  [inaudible]
R:  Do you think they will go after them still?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I don't know how they're gonna do it.  I mean, they -- it take them so long, they still haven't got anywhere besides, you know, bombing the whole Iraq, killing a lot of innocent people and children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that's not very easy, you know, you had to -- they're -- they're human, too, but they're -- they're not the one who's -- who's causing all these troubles.
R:  I know, and I think about that and I think, okay, so who -- here I am in the United States.  If -- if I were under the -- uh, the dictatorship -- if President Bush was as awful as I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Saddam Hussein is from the information that I have, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that he was torturing my family and friends and torturing everyone in our country --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think I would be willing to lose my life if China were willing to come over here and help us get rid of President Bush.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I know that's hard to say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's easier to say not being in that situation, but that's what I look at it, and I look and think, those people know that they -- even though they've lost their lives or lost their parents, that those people didn't die in vain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they died so they could have a better life in a freer country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they could live like we're able to live now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that's so important and I value my freedom so much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay. [NOISE] What else do we have to talk? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so you wouldn't vote for President Bush again?
L:  No, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't vote Bush in.
R:  'Cause you think he entered too fast?
L:  He -- he what?
R:  Do you think -- do you think --
L:  He make decision too -- too fast?
R:  Is that what you think?
L:  I think so.
R:  [NOISE] Do you think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if he'd waited longer and still decided to go to war that you would vote for him?
L:  No, I don't think I would vote for him.  I -- I really don't have very much time on who's the president.  I never really vote that much at all.  As I said, this time I did.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I thought I'd just put my X -- my -- my input --
R:  Are you a citizen of the United States?
L:  Yes, I am, mhm.
R:  Yes.  You were born here?
L:  No, I was born in Hong Kong.
R:  In Hong Kong?  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I've been here over thirty years, so ...
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I'm a citi- -- I was naturalized when I was eighteen.
R:  And your family all moved here?
L:  Yeah, the whole family's here.
R:  That's good. [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  That's good.  I think that's what the United States is about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we have -- we have freedom here.  We have freedom.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE] And I'm sure your parents would have given up their lives for you guys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to have freedom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If that's what it meant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess that's how I look at the Iraq situation.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well, they told us they would tell us when ten minutes was up.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  And I thought -- I think it's up, but they haven't said anything.
L:  Mm. [NOISE] [MN] Would you vote for President Bush again?
R:  I think so.
L:  You would?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You think he's a good leader?
R:  I think -- I think --
