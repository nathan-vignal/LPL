R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, are you the call partner?
R:  Yeah, hi.
L:  Okay, here's your client, just hang on.
R:  Okay.
L:  Introduce yourself.  The topic is arms inspections in Iraq.  Uh, hi.
R:  Hi.  H- hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi, what's your name?
L:  Erin.
R:  Erin, hi, I'm Tio.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  Um, yeah, I guess, uh, we're supposed to talk about arms in Iraq and how we feel about that.  Have you been following the whole situation with the war and stuff?
L:  Yeah, I have, and it really disturbs me because Bush is, like, really mad at -- he -- he acts really mad and he acts like nothing cares to him.  Like Iraq, he's killed a lot of civilians. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that bothers me.
R:  Yeah.  That bothers me, too. [NOISE] No, yeah, I know.  Um, yeah, and it's like, yeah, 'cause he does -- like, 'cause he claims that it's just because Iraq has all these nuclear weapons or something like that, and that's why he feels like he needs to go to war with the country, but I'm just like, I -- I don't know, I don't feel that's a valid enough reason to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like, go to war and then, like, kill so many people and lose so many American lives as well.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, sometimes I just think it's, um ... what is it?  Like, it's a -- it's a front for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, what his real agenda is, you know.  And I don't think it's real -- like, even if -- I mean, 'cause we have nuclear arms ourselves, so what's -- I mean, why can't Iraq have arms, too, you know?  So ... yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
R:  Mhm.  Um, I kinda think yes, I'm, like, really against the war pretty much.  Um, yeah, 'cause now -- I mean, now that we've toppled Iraq I think we're trying to go into other countries, too, for, like, the same reason.  Like, and I don't know, I just -- yeah, I don't agree --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the whole thing.
L:  I don't agree with it either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you heard about the two children that were hurt badly?
R:  No, I didn't.  What happened?
L:  There were two children in Iraq.  One li- -- one male, one little boy and one little girl.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the little boy, he was -- they didn't answer because they didn't know Eng- -- they didn't know English, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they fired at the children.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's horrible.  Where did you -- did they put this on the news?  Where did you hear about this?
L:  I heard about it in Denning[?], New Mexico on -- on the Denning newscast.
R:  Oh, okay.  At the news at ten.  Yeah, see, that's the thing.  Like, I don't think -- I don't look -- I didn't hear about that and I think people -- the American public needs to know more about stuff like that.  Like, 'cause I don't think a lot of people, like, who support the war realize, you know, some of the horrors and stuff, like children being killed, that's going on, you know.  And that's another problem I have with it.  Like, the media doesn't really cover it at -- that well, or they're covering it so that, um, people will just rally behind the president and stuff and, yeah, that really, um -- yeah, that really makes me mad.  That's so sad.  Um ...
L:  Oh, really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it makes me mad, too.  I mean, they should -- I mean, like, they should respect the children.  I mean, they're just children.  They -- they don't even know what war is.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  That's just -- yeah, like, and I don't think -- like, if people -- 'cause -- 'cause I think the US is different because we haven't had a war on our, like, soil, like, in our country, you know, since, like, the revolutionary war or the civil war, which was, like, generations and centuries ago.  And, um, I don't think a lot of people realize that when we go to war, like, it's really traumat- -- not even like -- even if you don't kill people, like it's traumatizing to people because, I mean, can you imagine, like, looking out your window and seeing tanks rolling by and, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hearing gunshots and bombs outside and, you know, like -- so, I -- I think people would be less inclined to go to war if they realized just, uh, how detrimental it is, you know.  Like, 'cause we've just never had to experience that and I think that's a problem as well.  Yeah, it's really -- the whole thing is really sad.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Well, the children aren't dead, but they're -- the b- -- little boy, the doctor said that if his leg doesn't get better they may have to amputate it.
R:  Oh.  Do you know how old the children were?
L:  [NOISE] The little boy was seven and the little girl was only six.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] That made me so angry when they did that.
R:  Yeah.  That made me really angry, too, 'cause I have, like, cousins and stuff who are, like, that age and just to imagine them going through something like that, like, that's just really sad.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  Do you happen to know any, um, people fighting in the war?  Like, any -- do you have any, like, friends or relatives who are fighting over there?
L:  [NOISE] I know -- I've heard of a few people from Fort Stockton, but I don't remember their name.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I know, uh, Davis is in the war.  He's Ms Jarver's son --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he's fighting in the war in Iraq.
R:  Wow.  So, what -- so, are you friends with, like, his mother?  Who -- whose son is he?  He's, like, a friend of yours or something or just someone you know?
L:  Her name is Ms Jarver.  She was my teacher in New Mexico.
R:  Really?  Oh, okay, okay.  Wow.  Do you -- do you happen to know at all how she's dealing with it?  Like, if she's, like, really scared for her son?
L:  Well, I can sense that she's stressed about it because --
R:  Yeah, no, definitely.
L:  -- she doesn't -- mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she doesn't know what all is gonna -- is gonna happen to her son.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then [LAUGH] -- yeah, then it doesn't look like it's, like, gonna end any time soon, you know, 'cause, like, even though, you know, the regime has fallen and Saddam Hussein is out, like, they still need troops to stay there and, like, keep the peace and make -- like, to rebuild the country.  And then I think we're going into other countries, like, nearby Iraq and so, you know, like -- 'cause I think people were expecting a quick war, but it's just gonna keep going on and on, you know.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's really -- that's really sad.  Um ... wow.
L:  I feel like whoever's in the tanks, they need to teach 'em the children in Iraq, they have a different language than we do, so --
R:  Exactly, yeah, 'cause, like, I mean, if someone started yelling at me in Iraqi, like, I wouldn't know what they were saying, I wouldn't know what to do.  You know?  Yeah, that -- that's just awful.  Like, I don't understand that at all.  They should -- I mean, [SIGH] yeah, they should know better than to do that.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] Um ...  Yeah, did you hear about anything else, like, bad that's going on in the war?  Anything, any other stories like that?
L:  Well, I've heard that two of the most famous people in, uh, the Iraqi terrorist attack --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're dead now.
R:  Mm.
L:  Saddam Hussein's son is dead.
R:  Whoa.  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I guess I need to be following the war more.  Like, do you, like, read it in the newspaper or you just are, like, lis- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or you just watch it on TV?  Like, 'cause I don't -- 'cause I -- the thing is, like, after, you know, the war started, I was just so angry with it, but I just, like, every time it was on TV I would, like, click it off.  Like, I just was just -- I didn't wanna, you know, hear about it 'cause it just made me so mad.  So, like, do you like, um, always, like, read the newspaper or, like, watch the news about it?
L:  I listen to it on TV.
R:  On TV, [NOISE] oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, I need to do that more.  I don't know, it just -- ugh, it just makes me so mad is why I don't [inaudible].
L:  It does me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I know some of the -- I know some of the, uh, what do they call them, troops?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know some of the troops are trying to get -- make the children happy, and that's good because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they need to be happy because [NOISE] the -- they're in their country destroying their country, they're making their moms --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and their dads unhappy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and scared and it makes the children in turn very terrified.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine.  Like, what -- what kind of stuff are they doing, do you know?  Like, to make the children happy?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I've heard that some of it's --
