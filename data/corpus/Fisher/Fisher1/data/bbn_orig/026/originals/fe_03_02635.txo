L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello, my name is, ah, Larry.
L:  Hi there?  [MN] I --
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I didn't catch your name.  Would you say that again?
R:  Ah, Larry.
L:  Larry, yes.  My name is [SIGH] h- -- Harold.
R:  Hi, Harold, how are you doing?
L:  Fine.
R:  I -- I didn't catch there the topic that clearly --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I --
R:  -- I know it's --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- pertaining to Iraq.
L:  -- didn't get the -- I didn't get the full topic.  I know it was on Iraq but, ah --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- just beyond that I'm not sure what they did say.  [MN]
R:  I'm not so sure what they -- they said.
L:  I think -- I think that they're asking, ah, how -- how we feel about -- if we should be involved over there?  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  That's my guess.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, that's wa- -- was my feeling too.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  So, I -- make my little statement, Harold, and I think that, ah, [MN] yeah, I'm in support, you know, of what the President did, ah, in Iraq.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Um, you know, I -- I -- you know, I'm for -- ah, human rights, you know, for all people and so I believe that what the President did was right, ah, to remove, ah, the, ah, regime over there.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Well, ah, [SIGH] my [SIGH] where I come from I'm a student [SIGH] I'm a student of the Bible and so that ah, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I have to remain neutral.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't take sides.  [LAUGH]  I know --
R:  [LAUGH]  Ah 
L:  I know this country has -- [SIGH] has it's, ah, reasons for doing it but, there again, [SIGH] ah, look- -- looking at the overall picture from the Creator's viewpoint and what mankind should be doing [SIGH], um, shouldn't be involving in war, so --
R:  Yeah, if you can -- since you are a student of the Bible and, as you know, the Bible says in the last days there shall be wars and rumors of wars --
L:  Th- -- that is true.  An- -- and that an- --
R:  -- in the last days and, you know, and so even during the, ah, Old Testament days th- -- the children of Israel was involved with wars on top of wars, you know, with -- with, ah, other nations, you know, throughout the history.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yes, that's true.  Ah, however, [SIGH] that wasn't to the liking of the Creator because in the Lord's Prayer [MN] it talks about His Kingdom, which is His government, that's going to replace man's rule [SIGH] so that the Kingdom will bring about conditions on this earth to [SIGH] individuals that are worthy of being here, ah, righteous conditions without war, crime and, ah, sickness an -- -- and all these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad things that are going on today, so  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, and I do -- I agree with you when His Kingdom come.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it, you know, -- and, ah -- you know, and I understand what you're saying and I do, ah, you know, ah, respect your opinion --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and also I agree with you.  You know, I -- I'm just one that believes, you know, in [LIPSMACK] standing for righteousness.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, righteousness give -- and do not allow evil, ah -- ah -- ah, as to get, you know, the upper hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- you know, if you are a Christian, then we are in battle every day --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in the spiritual warfare.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every day, you know.
L:  That's oh, yeah that's --
R:  You know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes --
R:  So, we are constantly fighting too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  As the Bible indicates that the god of this system of things [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- is Satan, the Devil, not n- -- not God almighty, the Creator.  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I guess we're not talking about the topic they have but, ah -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, anyways we'll g- -- get back to the topic, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, get back to the topic.  I agree.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Where you [LAUGH] where you calling from Larry?
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm -- I'm in Michigan.
L:  Michigan.  Oh, I'm in New Hampshire.
R:  Okay, New Hampshire.  All right.  I'm also a -- a student of the Bible for, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- ah, but any way I -- I -- I do support --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the President an- -- and, ah --
L:  Well, I'm -- at least I'm happy to hear that things have, ah, quickly come to, ah, hopefully to an end.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I -- I was praying for a quick -- you know, a quick end to the -- to the fighting over there 'cause I have a son that had to -- that was over there in, ah, a goddaughter that had -- you know, over there.
L:  Yeah.  You say he was over there in Iraq?
R:  In Iraq, yes.
L:  Oh, boy.  Yep.  [NOISE]
R:  A Mari- -- a Marine.  He's a marine.
L:  Boy, he saw a lot of, ah, [LIPSMACK] action, I imagine, being a marine there, huh?
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  [SIGH]  So, does he -- does he know when he due to be shipped back?
R:  Ah, I -- in -- next month.  He'll be back home next month.
L:  Next month.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, that -- that'll be nice.  [SIGH]
R:  Right he's gotta be -- ah, come home for his sister's wedding.  Yeah.
L:  Well, the next, ah -- the next big, ah, phase of the operation is to what?  Hopefully, to rebuild or --
R:  Reb-
L:  -- to assist in, ah, getting the place rebuilt, huh?
R:  Right.  Right.  And I -- and I think -- and the reason I support it is because, you know, I felt what President Bush was saying about the regime over there is that they were oppressing the people, [NOISE] you know, and, um, then they was being killed or poisoned and, you know, they were just not free.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I- -- is that a phone of your's ringing?
R:  Yeah, that's my other phone ringing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah -- yeah, my kids'll get it.
L:  I was reading in the, ah, local paper here tonight, ah, in the editorial the person wrote a rather interesting and, ah, lengthy, e- -- editorial on -- she's a teacher, ah, about, um, ancient history [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she was, ah, pointing out that over in Iraq [MN] [LIPSMACK] during the war that [SIGH] the, ah -- ah, US was mainly concerned -- well, not mainly but it was, ah, concerned about, ah, protecting the oil fields and, ah, certain areas of military importance but the [SIGH] area, as you know [MN], ah, is the cradle of civilization and they had the -- ah, several museums or the ma- -- or the major museum there contained [SIGH] um, much irreplaceable, ah, documents and history of -- of -- ancient history of mankind's beginning and, ah, they gave no protection to that and most of it was destroyed, which was upsetting to her 'cause she's a teacher of [MN] ancient civilization.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  But anyways, ah, what I'm saying is it is just too bad that, ah -- that ah, [SIGH] ah, things of importance to -- to humanity like that just didn't get the same protection as, um, some, ah, [LIPSMACK] features that the government co- -- ah, feels --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are important to militarization.  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.  You know, [NOISE] I don't think, [NOISE] you know, I -- I don't think they were thinking about that.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  You know, ah, did not have [NOISE] the knowledge that all of that was there.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I -- don't know though -- I don't --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- know.  I mean, I really don't know [NOISE] if they did or didn't.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I feel they -- if hadda thought about it then they would've protected it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's just  my guess on the subject.  Well, I felt bad too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, that, you know, history was de- -- destroyed, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But then there is the, ah -- the, ah, groups, so to speak, that feel that things could have been accomplished, or settled, or handled, ah, in a more peaceful way without going in there.  I don't know that, ah -- how do you feel about that?
R:  Well, I -- you know, I -- I feel [NOISE] in -- in time it, ah, it would ha- happened in time.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, it would, ah, happened in a more peaceful way, ah 
L:  [SIGH]  But isn't it strange when they, ah, [LIPSMACK] were over there before that, ah, nothing was done to remove them him from power at the time when they --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- when they were there and su- -- and supposedly, ah, [LAUGH] w- -- won the battle.  [SIGH]
R:  Right -- right -- right.
L:  But, ah, there they go.  They -- they pull out over there at that time and left him there and I just, ah, myself don't understand that one.  Do you?
R:  I don't -- I don't understand it either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't understand it either.  No.
L:  So, there -- you know, I do have my mixed feelings --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I do have a lot of, ah, unanswered questions but, ah, anyhow, ah, I'm not placing judgement one way or the other.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I'm the same.  I have my mixed feelings about it, you know, ah, you know, I'm a man of peace. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, [NOISE] but you know, at the same time, you know, I know that, you know, sometimes, you know, you have to go to war, ah, you know, to -- to obtain peace.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's my feeling, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I know that someone asked me as being a man of God, would I ever fight?  I said, ah, "If someone's going to come and mess with my family.  Yes, I will".  [LAUGH]  You know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- I will protect my family to the end. --
L:  Oh, yeah, sure -- sure.
R:  -- you know.  So, yes, I will, you know, but I will not commit murder --
L:  No.
R:  -- or anything like that --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know -- I will.  And I think in th- -- the regime there in Iraq they were, ah, committing murder and everything else, you know, on -- on their own people.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I was -- so in that respect I was glad that, ah, the US went in and, ah, set the people free --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- from that regime.
L:  But I find it interesting too that, ah, the people over there, ah, you have different factions such as, ah, groups that, ah, was glad to see the troops and, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- claimed to, ah, be happy to have these, ah, [LIPSMACK] restraints lifted that, ah --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- Saddam and his group had -- had over the country but then there is the groups -- ah, the group, or groups, that just didn't want the US there at all.  I mean just why would they feel that way I wonder?  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I- right the, ah -- ah --
