R:  Hello? [NOISE]
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Karen.
L:  Hi, Karen.  My name is Prem. [NOISE]
R:  What -- what's your name?
L:  Prem.  P.R.E.M.
R:  Pier?  Oh, Prem+?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  So, we're supposed to create a holiday?
R:  [NOISE] Um, so what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Can you say that again, I'm sorry?
R:  What's your favorite holiday?
L:  My favorite holiday? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My favorite holiday has to be the Festival of Lights.  Um --
R:  The what?
L:  I'm from -- I mean, eh, yeah, I'm from India --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, originally.  And, uh, around, uh, late f- -- aroun-  --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around early fall, actually, we have, uh, what's called Diwali.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, it's -- it's, uh, it's -- it's a full day festival and it's -- it's -- it's really, literally translated --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- means, The Festival of Lights.
R:  Oh.  What do you guys do on that holiday?
L:  Well, so, the [MN] in -- in terms of actual action, what we do is, there's lots of, uh, firecrackers [inaudible] uh, during, uh, August, four days, actually, and -- and -- and, uh, every house has all sorts of, uh, illumination, uh -- uh, orientated decorations, uh, either hanging outside the house and -- and then inside as well as, uh, on the lawns and around the house you have lots of lamps and, you know --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- some of them are -- yeah.  It's actually the whole --
R:  Do you guys --
L:  Sorry?
R:  Um, do you guys celebrate that here?
L:  Yes, actually, we do.  Uh, me and my wife and, uh, we -- we do it every year -- every year.  And, uh, it's -- it's of course much more, uh, [MN] low key because part of any holiday being, like, very successfully, the whole community taking part in that.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And -- and here we don't have, you know, a -- a huge community to take part in it where we live, but we certainly go to the temple and stuff to, sort of, have -- have a celebration.  But in terms of actually having the whole community lit up, that happens only at Christmas, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] So, uh, yeah, but we do actually celebrate that here because, uh, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's a lot of fun for me because my --
R:  That's good.  Yeah.  Um, I guess my favorite holiday would be, uh, Chinese New Year. [NOISE]
L:  Chinese New Year?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- is -- so, I guess you're from China or ...
R:  Um, not China.  My family's from, like, Taiwan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  But, it's like almost the same thing.  It's around, um, February every year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like -- it's different every year.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I think it lasts for, like, ten days.  And, um, I guess, we celebrate with firecrackers too and stuff.  And we also get red envelopes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  With money inside.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, that's always a nice part of most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- holidays.
R:  Yeah, that's the best part.
L:  Right.  Uh --
R:  Yeah, and like, you're supposed to give it when you're married.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, like, only married people will be giving the red envelopes and the people that aren't married receive them.
L:  Ah [MN], actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is something -- I -- I remembered one of my, uh, Chinese colleagues mentioning that even -- even for marriages and stuff in China --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I don't know if it's true in Taiwan, it's more a- a- appropriate almost to give money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than to actually give a gift.
R:  Yeah.  We give money.
L:  Right.  And -- and it's almost the reverse in the US, right?
R:  Yeah, we still --
L:  I mean, far more --
R:  -- do it here.  Yeah, we celebrate here.
L:  A- ah, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I -- in Boston we have, I don't know where you're from but, um, I'm from the --
R:  I'm from -- 
L:  -- Bos --
R:  -- New York.
L:  You're from New York?
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, in the -- I -- I live in the Boston area.
R:  The, what are- -- Boston?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, uh, Chinatown here usually has a New Years' Parade.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, so for the -- for the Chi- --
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:   -- the Chinese New Year.  And -- and we go --
R:  Yeah, we have a Dragon Dance and everything.
L:  Yes, yes, yeah.  [LAUGH] I'm [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  Have you seen it before?
L:  Yeah.  I've, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- been down, uh, down to Chinatown a couple of times --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but  uh, um, I -- I -- I used to have more [MN] Chinese colleagues earlier than I do now, for some strange reason.  But, um, [COUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  But, uh, I used to go down with one of them for New Years, uh, to just -- to see the Dragon Dance and to see the parade itself.
R:  Yeah, I -- I drove by that area before.
L:  Chinatown here?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, how does it compare with the New York's, uh ...
R:  Um, well I've never been there around the, you know, the parade.  I just drove by once.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, apart from the religious holidays, I mean, do you -- uh, does China have a lot of, uh, I mean, given that f- for -- for a while now China has not been a very religious country, like, I mean, partly because of the communists and even before that, because, uh, in my understanding is that China is not a very religious country.
R:  Um, actually --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- most of them are Buddhist.
L:  Are -- are they into this Taoism or Confu --
R:  Yeah, yeah. there's a -- 
L:  -- Confuciusm? 
R:  -- bunch of those.
L:  Right.  So, are there -- are there, um, I mean, I -- the New Years, I believe, is just a more traditional holiday than -- than -- than associated with a religion?
R:  Yeah.  There's no religion involved. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  So, are there, uh, any religious holidays as such in -- in China?
R:  Um ...
L:  Or, uh --
R:  Let me think ... I can't -- um, I don't know if it's religious but we tha- -- we have something called Moon Day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's, like, every year in September.  But I don't know the details and then we eat, like, moon cake.
L:  Whoo. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it sounds like something you're making up. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm not making it up.  I just don't know much about it, so ...
L:  No, no.  I'm just saying moon cake sounds like some poem[?].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's a round thing and it -- there's like a egg inside.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  So, we eat that -- we eat that once a year.
L:  I -- actually one of the things I do, I used to indulge in what often was, uh, was coconut stuffing filled, uh, cakes that you get in Chinatown.  I don't know --
R:  Oh, wow.  That's good.
L:  Wh- -- I don't know  -- I don't know what it's called.  It's, um, it's -- it's available in a Chinese bakery downtown.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I wouldn't know what [NOISE] it's called either.  I'm more Americanized. 
L:  Oh, so you grew up here mostly [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or entirely?  I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, so it's pretty much you only do the big ticket items, like Chinese New Year and then Mood Day?
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's ha- --
L:  What --
R:  Hm?
L:  What's the most obscure holiday that, uh, you've celebrated?
R:  Um, like, what do you mean?
L:  Like, it's like, you know, there -- there are these holidays that are very common and everybody knows about.
R:  Um.
L:  And then there's a holiday that you suddenly find out that it's a holiday, you know?
R:  There's, like, Christmas and Thanksgiving.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um ... or else there's New Years' Eve.  There's -- what else is there?  
L:  Hanukkah.
R:  Oh, I don't celebrate Hanukkah. [NOISE]
L:  Uh ...
R:  No, I celebrate Christmas. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you do celebrate Christmas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] What, uh --
R:  Oh, and Easter.
L:  And then Easter which just happened recently?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, so, you celebrate Orthodox Easter or ... ?
R:  Um ... 
L:  Isn't there something --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- about like one Easter f- -- um, before --
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know.  I heard there was, like, a couple of Easters that people celebrate but they're all, like, on different days.
L:  Right.  In fact, one is --
R:  Yeah, I just learned -- 
L:  -- before Passover.
R:  -- I just learned that, like, this year. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.
R:  Well, I didn't know there was more than one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think it's actually different in calendars.  Uh, that -- that is -- that is -- there's as s- -- there's a slight difference in the way they figure when the moon is somewhere.
R:  Something like that.
L:  Uh --
R:  But I don't know. Mine is always on in April, on a Sunday.  But some people last, like, the whole week.
L:  Yeah, I think it's the week of Passover or Lent or some --
R:  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  But I don't know much about that because I don't celebrate that.
L:  I see.
R:  But I -- I heard about it recently.
L:  [MN] Oh, so China is -- is big on -- all ri- -- [MN] I mean, that you just said that you actually might not be very traditionally oriented, but -- but there's [MN] -- there is a lot of all these, uh, paper -- paper lights, you know, paper, uh --
R:  Lanterns?
L:  Paper lanterns and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is there any -- is there any holiday or festival around that?
R:  Um --
L:  You know, where everybody's -- where every -- because that's what actually we use in d- -- in -- during Diwali, I mean, you will find a paper [MN] you find lots paper lanterns in everybody's house.  Like --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- in -- on the doors and the windows and stuff.
R:  You use them too?
L:  Yeah, we use them.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- and I actually don't know whether it came, uh, in the last couple of hundred years from China or whether they're, uh, they're older than that?
R:  I think that --
L:  But is there other --
R:  -- I think they've been using it for a long time.
L:  In China?
R:  I think so.  'Cause when I see old movies they use it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, actually now that you mention it, I remember -- I remember the, uh, the story in which a, um, uh, er, a girl, um, a daughter in law is being taken out to some remote travel with her mother in law and she travels to keep her mother in law, uh, happy by telling her stories.  And -- and -- and it --
R:  Oh, what movie is this?
L:  [SIGH] I forget now, [MN] I can't remember the names of any of these, uh, movies though I like watching them.
