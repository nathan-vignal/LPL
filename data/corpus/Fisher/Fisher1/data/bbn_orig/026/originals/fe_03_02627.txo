R:  Hi, my name is Anita and I'm -- ah, in Michigan.
L:  Hi, I'm Jessie.  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  Me -- [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  I didn't get clearly, um, all of the topic.  Did you get it clearly?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, pretty much they just want to know what we should -- what our best -- um, opinions of what we should have done in Iraq or whatever[?].
R:  Oh, oh, okay.  Okay.  Well, I'll let you go first on that one.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] actually I think we handled it really well.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [SIGH] I think, um, they need to -- I think disarming Iraq was probably one of the best things that they could've done.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  'Cause there -- there just seemed to be, ah -- ah, such argument over -- I mean there were -- they were spinning their wheels pretty much is what I think.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I think they did what they should have done.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And now it's [SIGH] pretty much over so 
R:  Right.
L:  We can all get on with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  Um, [SIGH] and, um, to add on to that, you know, [SIGH] it was, ah, you know, sometimes we do things that we really don't want to do, [MN] um, and like you said it -- you know, this was something that probably just really needed to be done, even though, you know, we didn't lose a whole lot of lives -- well, we lost definitely enough lives, you know.
L:  Oh, definitely.  One life was enough life.
R:  Yes, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we have definitely lost enough lives [SIGH] so, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, if you know, it's just a hard thing, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all round.  Hard for, you know -- even though we would come out on top with the victory, there's still -- you know, you look back and you look at the ashes, you look back and you -- you know, you may know somebody that even if they have not lost their lives, you may know somebody.  I personally know a few people that had to -- you know, just go over there.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and -- and, um, I just don't know what impact that would have on them for the rest of their lives, even though they may not been in -- have been in the main stream of everything that was going over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on in Iraq but still, um, you know, you just -- 'cause we're not there.  We're sitting at home.  We're in our houses.  We're comfortable --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and we can watch, um, from afar off.  I mean we can watch everything on the TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but we're not there.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, it's like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we -- you know, what it looks like to us --is par- -- I'm sure it, you know, it's totally --
L:  It's only a fraction.
R:  -- totally different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than what they are facing and what they see and how they feel and [LIPSMACK] -- you know, it's just like -- you know, my heart goes out to them.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, even though we may come back as victors -- you know, but still it's like --
L:  Well --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- but something had to be done.  I mean for crying out loud it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- starting to, you know, we as -- as a nation were starting to come under attack.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  And -- an -- [LAUGH] you know, it -- you know, for us to -- to come under attack, that's pretty desperate.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  We are, you know, we're one of the most powerful -- or the most powerful nation in the world.
R:  Right.  That is true --
L:  So 
R:  -- that is true.  And, you know, like you said, again, this is just something that had to be done because -- I mean if we didn't -- if we kept stalling and we didn't do anything about it -- you know, ha, who knows what would happen next?
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's right.
R:  So.
L:  I mean if you were in President Bush's shoes, I mean what would you have done?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean everybody's like frowning on -- on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- this poor man.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  I think a president is good or bad --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- according to what is going on while he is serving his term.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean [SIGH] President Bush walked in during nine eleven for crying out loud.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, my stars, "You've come into -- you know, during nine eleven, you're a bad president".  I mean he's been [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he's been accused of being a bad president ever since he walked in the office.
R:  That's true.
L:  And I -- and I really feel -- I almost feel bad for him --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because of that fact.  I mean he's -- he's trying to do what he can.  He loves this country just like everybody else.
R:  Right.
L:  And he needs ta -- I mean he made a good decision --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and if [SIGH] you know, some people are gonna [SIGH] like the decision, some people aren't and --
R:  That's true.  That is true.
L:  -- that's just the way it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's the way it is.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, um -- yeah -- um, I think, in the long run, and as things, you know, get back to normal and our people come back home and, you know, things like that we will look back and say, you know, "It just had to be done and that was the right thing to do".
L:  Well, nobody wants war to happen.
R:  Right.
L:  Nobody wants war to happen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think everybody's just paranoid because they don't want another Vietnam or 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or whatever -- something like that happening.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] So, [NOISE] I think, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah -- yeah, from -- you know, from the y- young people, you know, who fear of, ah, being drafted, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- up to, um, you know whatever age their cutoff age is -- you know, it's like I'm sure a lot of them think in the back of their mind, "Oh, my God, please -- just please don't --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- call me", you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  As you say.
R:  You know, "Don't -- don't start that enlisting, um, process" because I know [LIPSMACK] my son, um, who -- he just turned eighteen and, um, I have -- he has like the Navy calling, the Army calling --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's like, "Why?" you know --
L:  [NOISE]  Just want [inaudible].
R:  -- and they are probably [LAUGH] really, ah, being pushed right now to really get in there and recruit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, exactly --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- my downstairs neighbor is being sent over and it's all done.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he's still getting sent over.
R:  Wow.
L:  But I think -- I think it has something to do -- well, he says it's mo- --mostly for, you know, forming like police and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Cleaning up.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but they already paid for him to go over there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He has to go.
R:  Mm.
L:  Even though [LAUGH] it's all over with so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- yeah, but I think -- you know, I think the whole recruiting thing isn't that pretty much --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, they don't -- they don't start that until, um, all the reserves and all those people are exhausted?
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  I think that's how that works.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but, um, I don't know -- it's just that, you know, recently they have really been, you know --
L:  Pushing.
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Sure.
R:  And I -- I don't know, if maybe they have a quota or, you know -- even though they may that doesn't mean that the people, you know, who may enlist has to leave right away.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  But still it just seems like, um, you know, from -- from personal experience that they're really like, "Oh, we gotta --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- try to get some more men in here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And women --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as a matter of fact.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, I mean --
L:  It's bigger than us that's for sure but, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hopefully it's over with now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I don't [LAUGH] I remember my sister saying something about -- you know, she's -- she's real -- she was real biblical -- I -- I lost my sister last month so I'm still talking --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, like she's [LAUGH] here.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- about that.
L:  Oh, its -- it's -- it happens, but, um -- no, she was always really into the Bible and what not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she was saying something about, you know, this isn't just a war about oil.  And this isn't just a war about terrorism.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, she says, "You need to look this stuff up in the Bible" and what not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I kind of -- I kind of -- I should really do some research --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and stop being such a heathen [LAUGH] and find out what she was talking about.
R:  Yeah.  It's in there.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's in there.
L:  So, I mean, you know, that's kind of crazy and she said something about, you know, the United States standing alone or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- against all the nations.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and, oh, you know, that's like, "Wow" you know, maybe that's why they're pushing for it so much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible] you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  We're going to have to stand alone and that's the way it is.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Yeah, so -- [LIPSMACK] oh, you know, we --
L:  Yeah, and [inaudible] the longest.  Is this your first call?
R:  No, this is my second call.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I -- um, filled out the -- um, web -- web page two nights ago --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then I started last night and this is my second night.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um -- I'm just wondering, you know, will there be three nights and then will that be it -- or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I really don't know.
L:  Well, I know they sign you up -- they sign you up for, [NOISE] you know, if they want to use you again, or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I don't know.  I'm not very good at it [LAUGH] so I'm sure they're not going to --
R:  Oh, no, no --
L:  -- use me any more. [LAUGH].
R:  -- no, no, no.
L:  [LAUGH] I can never use up the full ten minutes.  I know yesterday we were talking about, um, reality shows --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we were done in five minutes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, goodness.  [SIGH]  So, now -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is this your second night?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm just wondering like if they put people in a group and -- 'cause the lady that I had last night, that was her first night --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I'm wondering, you know -- if they take a group and they all start at the same time and then the next grou- -- you know what I mean?
L:  Oh, may- [inaudible].
R:  Instead this is your first night, my second night, somebody else's third night --
L:  Sure.
R:  So -- yeah, that's what it seems like --
L:  Well, I suppose they want you -- yo- -- wanna see if you improve with every call or whatever I suppose.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't --
L:  [NOISE] better.
R:  -- I really think it's about, you know, improving or anything like that --
