L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Kelly Hannibal[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Tina.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Good.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess the topic -- what's -- is there a third person?
L:  [NOISE] No, no, it's my son in the background.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just it's really loud on my phone.  Um, I guess the topic we're discussing is the disarmament --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  in Iraq?
L:  Yeah, yes. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I guess I -- I mean, I don't quite understand what they're talking about, but I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, do you agree with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the troops going --
L:  [NOISE] Well, to me, I'm gonna tell you my point of it.  It's all about the oil.  It's all about the oil.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm, like, against the war because what they're doing in there is [NOISE] they're talking about weapons of mass destruction --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they sh- -- they couldn't even come up with any weapons of mass destruction, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's all about the oil, about Bush going in, you know, destroy the country, fight, have a war, and then say, "I'm sorry.  You know what?  Let's help you and let's clean up" and then they're gonna put the pipeline through their country to get the oil.
R:  Yeah.  No, I agree.  I think it's, like, it's definitely a financial thing.  There's a -- a lot of other countries are very war torn and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of, like, bad leaders in the countries and yet we're not doing anything about it.  Like, North Korea has definitely, like, posed, like, a nuclear threat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, has the US gone in there and done anything?  Because it's, like, there's nothing for us to -- to get -- in a way to take advantage of.  I know that sounds bad, but, you know, I guess --
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  I mean, I agree it's like -- I agree with you how, like, ku- -- like, in Iraq, like, if they didn't have oil there we most likely wouldn't be there.  It wouldn't --
L:  It's a beau- --
R:  -- be a concern.
L:  Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE] It's a beautiful country, a beautiful country, and look what they did so far to it.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I agree, like, that, you know, we have to intervene in that, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there are inhumane things going on there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that as human beings we can't let people suffer, but it's like, how do we pick and choose battles?  And like, how do we, like, suddenly go from Afghanis- Afghanistan to, like, Osama bin Laden, to suddenly, like, well, Saddam is suddenly a threat.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  But we knew that.  Like, we knew that from --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- long -- like, years and years ago, and so forth, so ...
L:  Well, I'll tell you this, you know.  Bas- -- you mentioned about Korea, Korea has weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Do you see them going over there?
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.  Like, it was in, like -- it's in the newspapers, it's definitely in the media, and, like, they declare that they have nuclear weapons and they're, well, willing and ready to use them at any time.  And it's just, like, are we doing anything about them?  And it just seems like a very slow process how we're so concerned about this Iraq business --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And it's because we have -- there's oil there and we know that we can sort of exploit that and, like, we decided to go in without the UN and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we decided that, you know, like, therefore we have control of what we can do to this country and how we wanna set it up and whether, you know -- and it's -- it's hard because we're a very different -- we're a very westernized country and the country there, part of them want our assistance but a lot of people don't want our assistance --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and [inaudible] so ...
L:  Well, I'll give you the example.  Um, my husband emailed me a picture of this girl who just got killed by a bomb [inaudible] killed over this whole war.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Her leg was ma- mangled, her -- actually her foot was hanging off, and her head was, like, like, [inaudible].  It was blown, you know, half way off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was just sad.  You know, you see all these innocent people, but a lot of people who are not aware what's going on, what Bush is all about -- he's a -- he has money in oil.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He has money in oil, and he's sending these people out there to -- first of all, he's sending the troops out there on what they -- what they think he's right, so they go in there pumped up and, like, war, we're gonna fight, and they don't even know what he's doing over there, you know.
R:  And true, and it's like, I mean, I was reading an article on how, like, all -- I mean, it's -- it definitely shows that we care about oil 'cause we have guards standing around the oil, you know, like the refineries and so forth, yet, like, we have no one guarding the, like, library and then the museum which, like, the people -- the Iraq people looted themselves and it's like --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And it now is so sad because it's like, it's part of our history, just part of human history, and like --
L:  They destroyed their history.
R:  Exactly.  [inaudible] that happened and then Donald Rumsfeld was saying, like, "Well, boys will be boys" and like, that's what happens --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when people don't have freedom and suddenly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have this freedom, and that's total BS because we -- like, I was reading another article on how there was consultants that told the military the top twenty things to protect.  And, like, the library, which had the basic human writing and the history of just humankind, they -- at the museum they were told to protect, and that was like number two and number three, and they didn't choose to do that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And it's not like -- and it's not like the US are lacking of troops.  They're protecting different interests and that have more immediate monetary value, not -- and it shows, like, Americans with our brief history of, like, two hundred years, we -- you know, it's like what we're concerned with is, like, money, what's important now versus what was important in history and of mankind.  And I think --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's very sad and how, you know, I'm sure other people view us, it's like this imperialistic [NOISE] power going in and doing what we want because we can.  And I mean it's good that we're alleviating suffering, but it's, like, at what cost?
L:  Yeah, at the cost of innocent people, men, women, children, who are getting killed, you know, over what?  What is it?  And they can never explain.  All they can say is, "We need to kill him", you know.  Um, we need to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- take -- [inaudible] -- mass destruct -- [inaudible] -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  They just -- oh, they -- the -- the country, before they even went in, it was -- it's a beautiful country and they just messed it up.  They mess up the people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] homeless.  They have -- [inaudible] -- destroying their --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [inaudible] they wanna go in just like going to the -- the museums or offices, everything, just like destroy every- everything just because Bush with his --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And then the -- but I also think, like -- like, as humankind, that you'd think we'd progressed very far in that we don't fight, we can at least have some type of diplomacy, conversation, where we can solve the problems.  Yet, like, we still have to resort to very animalistic behavior where we have to fight and kill and that sort of results in -- like, it's just this constant power struggle and that.  I don't know, I think it's just -- it's very sad.  Like, I don't know how far we've progressed in, like, thousands of years as mankind.  Like, we still kill to get what we want.  And so, I don't know, I just think it's like we're supposed to be this intellectual power, yet we're not really because we still resort to, like, basic animalistic instincts.  I mean, I have friends that argue differently.  It's like, "Well, you know, you fight to get power and you do it whatever means.  War is a consequence of that", so I don't know. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello? [NOISE] I'm doing this survey.  It's ten dollars for ten minutes of conversation about just random topics.  It's this research study.  I think we just got cut off.  Hello? [NOISE] [inaudible] [NOISE] I signed up. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's ten dollars for ten minutes. [NOISE] I told 'em specific times.  You tell them.  So, I figured, like, on my cell phone.  It's a robotic system.  They tell you what the topic of conversation is, and then they find another person and they match you, just random stranger, and they're trying to study how people talk.  But I -- it's not -- she -- I think she got cut off. [NOISE] Yeah.  Or it's like they match the two of us together. [NOISE] Well, she agrees.  She's, like, I think it's stupid and so forth.  So, at least we agree. [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE] It is a survey, sort of. [NOISE] Oh.  I think we got cut off. [NOISE] She can't.  I don't know her number. [NOISE] She can't call me back because we're both set up by this automated system.  Like, a robot calls me and then called her, and then we got connected.  She had some baby -- [NOISE] I guess. [NOISE] I wanna get paid for this conversation. [NOISE] Is that Nicholas Cage? [NOISE] Oh, he's cute.  Nicholas Cage is not as cute. [NOISE] Oh, so beautiful.  Oh, that's what I'm wearing today. [NOISE] Oh. [NOISE] It's beautiful. [NOISE]
