L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, good evening, my name is Joe.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, hi there, ah, this is Dean.
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, Dean, how're you doing this evening?
R:  I'm fine.  [NOISE]
L:  Have you done one of these before?
R:  No, first one, how 'bout you?
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I got one -- one other one in earlier today so ... [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]  Just an interesting little thing.  But, ah, let's start talking about Iraq.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, like what's --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- the first part of the question again?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, should, ah -- what -- well, I think [LAUGH] very open, ah, ended.  It was what should the US do about Iraq?  [SIGH]  Ah, should disarmament be a major focus of the US effort, something to that effect.
R:  Ah, interesting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, I guess -- I mean, one is I would say -- part of th- -- I think part of the premise is a little off in that, um, [SIGH] if you'd asked me, you know, a month ago [LAUGH] about -- or two months ago about disarming Iraq, okay, that's -- that's a debate but the fact is we have invaded it and basically possessed the country, so disarming is kind of, ah, part of the game.  [LAUGH]  Now we own it so we've gotta -- we've gotta deal with the disarming, ah, part of it, whether we -- whether we had business going in there or not in the first place --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it still [SIGH] it's -- we got it [SIGH] and so we got to do something with it.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess I -- I have to agree with that.  Um -- yeah, I wasn't [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know -- ah, the US is like always, like, messing round with other countries. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I mean it -- it's -- it's kind of a notorious thing, big countries, powerful countries have this tendency and if they don't they're accused of being isolationists.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, so, it's when you're with -- are the big boy, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I just --
L:  Ah, [SIGH].
R:  -- think they should -- well, I think they should kinda take care of -- US should take care of its own people a little bit more.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  As I said, it's a hard balance, I mean, in -- and you'll never make everybody happy when you're trying -- I mean, 'cause -- 'cause you have too many constituencies that have too many different ideas and the constituencies are maybe by their nature vocal.  [MN] You know, um, it's like -- it's which is -- which is more important, foreign affairs or domestic affairs?  Well, [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH] I'd say domestic affairs [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]  Yeah, but how much more important?  And --
R:  We-
L:  -- what should that, you know, wh- -- where should the energy go and what should it be?  I mean, it -- it becomes an intellectual exercise, I think, as much as anything.
R:  Ah, I just think, well, whenever the -- the -- oh, I don't know -- the US --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whenever they get -- the -- all these wars and stuff, it's like a ton of money they spend.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  I mean -- yeah, and I think -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- wars -- wars are definitely the last, um, [LIPSMACK] last bastion and I've been -- ah, definitely surprised about how the last couple of military efforts have gone, ah, and from -- at least from a military standpoint, how smooth they've been.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the fact [LAUGH] th- that, ah, people have had, ah, to obsess about how poorly things are going in the middle of it wh- when the reality was it was only a day or two ...
R:  Huh.
L:  -- of, ah, less -- I'm don't say smooth sailing, but less than smooth sailing at some level, but, ah.  So, I guess -- let me ask you this, Dean, what do y- -- what do you think we should do as far as the government of Iraq?
R:  The government, well, yo- --
L:  Yeah, I mean here you have a country with no government, that hasn't had a government --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in thirty years, other than the one.  [NOISE]
R:  I think, um, first of all I think you're [LAUGH] right.  It's like, "Well, we've invaded and w- and now we own them and, yeah, we should, ah -- might as well do whatever the heck we want --"
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- disarming or whatever.
L:  Well, on- -- only what, you -- what, kinda of -- I mean how involved should we be in setting up the government?  Should it basically be what we want it to be, or how much say should we give to the Iraqi people in setting up the government?
R:  [NOISE]  Well, as far as I see it most likely it's going to be [SIGH] from the past history of how the United States dealt with these kind of things most likely it's going to be the people over there running it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, they'll be heavily influenced by the way United States want it run --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- like -- like a democracy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so, yeah, I guess that's the way to go.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, I mean, wd- would -- and one of the real issues is gonna be that, ah, at least right now, I -- a very high percentage of the people will probably opt for a religious government, which is exactly what the US doesn't want because they're afraid that'll mirror Iran ah, and, um, kind of bring up those problems.  So, ho- -- I mean -- how do you think the US should handle that?
R:  [NOISE]  Mm --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- kind of dangerous.
L:  [NOISE]  Kind of a danger of giving anybody -- it's like okay, now you've given them the right to vote.  Okay, [LAUGH], now [LAUGH] this is what the majority says -- what -- are you -- you going to live up to that?
R:  [COUGH]  Oh, I think it's still gonna be ...  I don't know, I still think it's gonna be -- it's gonna be kinda like a mixture of what the -- what the US ideas are and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Iraq's idea of, ah, you know, how they want to live.  The way they want to be governed, something like that.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  
R:  That's the way I figure it's gonna be.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  As far as -- I mean they -- I mean --it is those people over there and we are over here -- so, the US unless they -- unless the US sends a -- like a lot of like, I don't know, politicians, or whoever, you know, to really run the place --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  
R:  -- which I doubt they will do, then it's going to pretty much be run -- it's gonna be -- it's gonna kind of be like, um, [COUGH] the US's going to be like the big -- like the big -- I guess, the big mother hen, or whatever --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- and their government, whoever it is, is gonna -- is gonna be like a kid.   [LAUGH]  They're going to be like supervised --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but their running i- --it's gonna be like a mix.  That's -- most likely things going to be.  It's not going to be -- I doubt it's going to be all that re- really like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fanatical religion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but if [LAUGH] it is then it's gonna --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the future of the thing is going to happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- again I think.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I -- I think that there's -- there's a strong possibility.  The Shias, who are a majority [NOISE] of the people in Iraq, [MN] have been the less dominant political force in Iraq.  The Sunnis have been more dominant politically, but lower in number and the Shias tend to -- tend to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be more fundamentalist and want a very strong religious basis for the government and so I think they're going to try to, um, directly, or indirectly, really have a strong influence.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah --
R:  I agree they probably will.
L:  -- and because I think -- the only people -- really the only government right now in Iraq is in the mosque.  It's the Imams who have more power than anybody right now, other than the US, and they have the power of the gun, but ... [SIGH] And so I think it's gonna be the, ah, the -- the Imams who are going to be the ones [SIGH] who shape things and they -- they tend to be very fundamentalist and tend to have a strong influence on the people to get them to go in the direction they want 'em to go.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I think pretty much it's gonna -- [LIPSMACK] what I think it's -- it's probably going to be as heavily influenced by those people -- their religion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if the US is going to try to make it, ah, a democracy. 
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  That's -- ah, I guess what the US really can do unless they really want, like changes to the Uni- [LAUGH] part of it -- changes like you know, Puerto Rico is like -- part of the United States, that kind of thing.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  But I don't see that happening.
L:  Yeah, well, we don't need -- we don't need territories.  [SIGH]  Common rules.
R:  Well, I don't see that happening though.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH].
R:  I think the US [LAUGH] in some ways are more interested in controlling, um, probably the oil.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I think.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  So, I mean that's why I -- that's why we were there in the first place.  I mean the Middle -- the M- -- if -- if it weren't for the oil the Middle East would simply be ... part of Africa. [SIGH]  You know, in the US mind set it's just, "Okay.  These countries just can't get along and [SIGH] they're gonna f- fight some but we really don't care".  You know, b- but Kuwait [LAUGH] and I know some Kuwaitis -- it -- it was not a country we necessarily needed to [LAUGH] go worrying about defending.  Yes, Iraq did a bad thing invading it years ago, but the Kuwaitis are not [SIGH], ah, the nicest people in the world. [SIGH] Maybe 'cause they had so much money -- ah, especially in the -- the oil rich days of the eighties. [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  They were a pretty rich bunch.  [SIGH]  Now, let me ask you, Dean, do, ah, is there much discussion you know, at work or school about [SIGH] Iraq?  I'm -- I'm working at home mostly so I don't get this -- the kinda discussion but are people talking about it in the office?  [SIGH]
R:  Ah ... well, not really.  [LAUGH]  I -- I'm, in here in Los Angeles --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- California --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's -- it's really -- not really -- people don't really talk too much about it.  I mean -- I mean, yeah, well, there -- I guess there is some talk like, ah, socially.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, ah, where I work and that -- like you know, at, ah  parties and that, people will talk about it and they'll kind of debate about it but --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- for the most part people are pretty -- I don't know, they're not that concerned over here -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- about it, in a way.
L:  -- [NOISE] I mean it gets into politics.  And I guess politics becomes contentious and unless you live in Washington DC --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- you just don't live by politics much.  [NOISE]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  Now, so -- do you just get all your information from the TV [LAUGH] and radio?
L:  Um, mostly the radio.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Ah, I listen to NPR a lot and, ah, [SIGH] I'm in -- I'm in the Boston area, so we have -- we have a lot of -- there's some discussion about it -- and you see -- you hear lots of protests and bumper stickers, ah -- [SIGH] that kind of stuff, um, but you -- you -- you kind of -- you -- you balance it all, um, but I was just kind of curious in the workplace -- I -- I think -- I'm assuming there was a lot more discussion when the war itself was on -- when -- that reality TV show we call the War in Iraq was going. 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  [MN] Um, but that was -- it -- it's funny 'cause I'm -- I have a military background so I -- you know -- I -- I'm, you know, I haven't lived quite at that level [LAUGH] but I've a better understanding.  [SIGH] Um, that was riveting and I think a lot of discussion, but it was about, you know, something real and about real people and it didn't matter ... the politics of it, you know, it was happening. [SIGH]  But I think the politics of it make it much more -- once i- -- once we're getting to this phase it's the part America hates as a country.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  We like to go -- we like to win the game but we don't like to clean up afterwards.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we don't like the -- we don't like messy situations, you know, where we don't understand.  I mean we're still -- we've got a pretty big mess in Afghanistan from everything I've been hearing lately. [SIGH]  Supported the wrong war lords and [SIGH] --
