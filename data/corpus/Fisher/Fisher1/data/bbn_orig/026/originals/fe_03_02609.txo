R:  Uh, Rebecca Gould is my name.
L:  Hi, my name is Bola[?].  I'm calling from Washington DC.
R:  Hi.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Are we -- good.  Um, uh, well, my opinion on the -- the subject is, um, that the United States should not involve itself, um, with -- with what's going on in Iraq.  We should take care of, um, the people who are -- who need help in our own country.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too, but, um, my feeling is don't you think -- a- according to what they're saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're trying to say that they want to, you know, keep us safe in the future and, you know, prevent what happened on September eleventh to happen again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if, um, Saddam does have, you know, weapons of mass destruction, they're, like, scared that he might use it against America.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, according to them, I think they're trying to stop that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That is why we have to, you know, sacrifice, you know.  I believe in this life nothing comes easy, no good thing comes easy.
R:  True.
L:  We have to make some sacrifice, I know that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that is what, um, B- Bush and his, you know, cabinets are, you know, trying to do right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To, you know, buy us future freedom and buy our children future freedom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then after we make those sacrifices, they might come back and, you know, tackle the issues of poverty and, um, joblessness and, um, unemployment and, um, health insurance and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That is what they are saying, but, um, personally I don't understand everything.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't understand it and I don't like war.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, I agree with you that, um, they should fix what is happening here and, you know, get people their jobs back and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- give homes to the homeless and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that's a valid, you know, argument and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their argument is valid, too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um --
R:  That's true.
L:  Like so --
R:  I live in -- right.  I live in New York and, uh, when I'm on the subway there's -- there's, uh, militia army -- uh, people from the army, uh, are -- are everywhere in the subways and they -- they're saying that it's costing us, like, uh, forty million dollars a week and I just think of -- I mean, I -- security is important but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, also the -- the fact that, um, there's so many homeless people in New York City --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's budget costs in the library and education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that should be a priority but --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- it's not.
L:  I -- I -- I believe you.  I believe you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because, um, right now at my job, you know, a lot of people are facing the, you know -- you know, the fact that they might lose their jobs very soon at, um, my w- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, you know, my husband works for one of the, you know, airlines, too.  And, um --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- he's facing that, too, so I -- I really believe firmly that issue, like, face the problem in the United States right now and try to help people that needs their help instead of, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- spending all that money on Iraq and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I just believe that if -- since they've started with Iraq now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they should go to other countries and help them then if that is really what they want to do.  If they want to, like, liberate citizens from, you know, wicked, um, presidents and wicked rulers, then they should go to all countries to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially the African countries because there are a lot of African nations that have, you know, bad leaders and, um, their people really need to be l- liberated, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they want to start -- if they want to do that and liberate people, then they should go around the world and help.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  And what -- do -- do you think it would be better if the US had other countries helping them rather than just acting alone?  You know, there -- there was some sort of more, um, neutral, um, government that could, you know -- because there's all -- the US is always gonna push its own interests, I guess is --
L:  Of course, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.  They always put their own -- yeah, push their own interests, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, people just -- [SIGH] I guess I think people just think it's not -- it doesn't look normal for them to, like -- you know, they're claiming right now they're liberating the people of Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There are thousands of nations that their people needs to be liberated, too, you know.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  So ...
R:  They just picked Iraq because of the resources there.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  There needs to be some way to -- to, um, to -- to monitor what the US -- I mean, the -- the US can help other countries, but I think they should also be watched, right?  I mean, there's like the UN that should be maybe more aggressive --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- than it is, and -- and, um, making sure there's justice for everyone, not just the powerful countries.
L:  I know.  I know.  I know.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  And we should just understand that we can't save the world, you know.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  We should just stay home and save our -- you know, solve our own problems and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- leave the world to God.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just interesting.  It's interesting and, um, sometimes I listen to, you know, news about what is happening over there at Iraq.  Sometimes I just say, "No, let me watch something else, you know.  I want the goods news, you know". [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Right.  It can be overwhelming.  I -- I tried to follow the news and I just -- I got so depressed after a while, all the war, and I couldn't. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  There was one time I was, you know, listening to the news and a guy here from Baltimore had a picture of his son.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  You know, on the TV, you know, that his son died in the war and it was like President Bush --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "This guy was my only son".
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  "My only child, my only son".
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  "You took him away from me".  It was so sad.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
L:  You know?  You know?  I didn't know when -- you know, I started crying.  I'm like, "Oh, God".  You know, I felt for that father on that day.
R:  Of course.
L:  You know, it wasn't gonna -- he's not -- he's never gonna see his son again.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  So ...
R:  Yeah, and there's nothing we can say.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's really tragic.
L:  It's very, very tragic, you know.
R:  Mhm.  This was, um -- he was an American or Iraq- -- American, um --
L:  American from Baltimore here.
R:  Oh.  Oh, wow.  And his son lo- -- was in the military?  Oh, my God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he got killed over at Iraq, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think Bush -- it would be good for Bush to watch that also --
L:  Stuff like that, yeah.
R:  -- and see, yeah, what people lose.
L:  Yeah.  It was also on the first page of the Washington Post, so ...
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I'm sure President Bush might have, you know, seen the guy or something.
R:  Yeah, I hope so.
L:  You know, it was just so sad, so devastating, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I have, um, my sister's boyfriend, you know, is in the army, too.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  But luckily for him he was not, you know --
R:  That's good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's -- he hasn't been called up?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He was like, "Well, this is what I signed up to do, to defend the United States and, um, all that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we said, "Yes, we know that" but we still prayed that he would not go to the war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  My sister is young.  I don't want her to lose him now.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's int- -- right.
L:  You know, there are -- there are not a lot of good guys out there, so the ones you see --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you hold on to them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so ...
R:  And it's interesting how many, um, of the people who are in the -- the, uh, soldiers at the front lines are not -- you know, how many of them are, um, Latino or African American compared to the people who are at the -- who are, uh, in charge, and they're -- they're mostly, you know -- [MN] most of them are -- are -- have -- or come from better -- you know, a better, um, uh -- have a more privileged background.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It makes you think, like, the people who are dying, I mean, they -- they -- they went into the -- many people, I guess, go into the military because they don't have as much opportunity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's -- it's kinda sad.
L:  Exactly, very sad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very sad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, according to them, they think the war is over.  I pray that it is.
R:  Yeah.  I heard that.  Yeah, I -- I hope no more fighting.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Well, what can we do, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some claim that it's just a personal vendetta between Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, you know.
R:  Mhm, Saddam, right.
L:  Yeah, but ...
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's interesting, uh, like I was talking about the US always pushes its -- its own interests because we supported Saddam, you know, ag- -- when he -- when the -- Iraq was fighting against Iran.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, you see how -- there has to be some neutral, you know -- they can also not -- not let the US mess up the governments there and I just -- I mean, there's -- there's a lot of in that area, um, the Arab co- -- Middle East, there's a lot of governments that are repressive that I -- I would like for them to be more free, but, um, also I -- I don't think, you know, it should be only the US that decides, like, which one needs to be invaded or, you know.
L:  That's terrible, that's terrible, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You see, that was what I was trying to say earlier.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They should not just like, you know, choose the countries they will -- that they will claim to go help the people who are there.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they should really help those that are really in need.
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
L:  They should go to Sierra Leone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Go to the Congo, you know.
R:  Mhm, uh-huh.
L:  Some parts of Africa.
R:  Oh, yeah, the --
L:  You know?
R:  Right, I'm sure there's been a lot of terrible things happening in that area recently.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They should go to those places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those people really need to be liberated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely, absolutely.
L:  You know?
R:  I hope -- I hope they get more help, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people are starving there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.  You know, people live on, like, a dollar for almost or sometimes for two months or three months, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it's just so sad.
R:  And it's the children -- children are forced to fight?  I've heard they make -- they have children who are soldiers and who --
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's really terrible.
L:  You see a nine year old, a ten year old carrying --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- you know, guns and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're forced to fight in wars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's just so sad.
R:  And do you think the US is ever going to -- to help or is -- are they receiving attention from other countries, the p- -- the people of Africa?
L:  Uh, I don't think the U- -- I -- don't let me say I don't think, I'm -- I don't know if the US will help.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know because if they were going to, then they would have.  They would have, especially in Sierra Leone.  What's been -- what's happening in Sierra Leone has been going on for a long time.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, if they had an intention of helping I think they -- they would have helped.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.  And they had the chance, uh-huh.
L:  Exactly, you know, so it's just so sad that, um, they get to choose where to take their help.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they leave the people that are really needs --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- that really need the help.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
