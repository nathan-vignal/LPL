L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is --
L:  Hi, this is Marcos.
R:  Hi, this is Nicky.
L:  Hey, Nicky.
R:  [LAUGH] Have you done this before?
L:  I did this, uh, Friday.
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I did it on one other day.  I missed it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yesterday when I was at the doctor.
L:  Oh, yeah, I missed it yesterday 'cause, uh, I was on the other line, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what would -- what would be the holiday that you would create?
R:  [MN]
L:  And when would you celebrate it?
R:  Best Friend's Day.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'd do a Best Friends' Day.
L:  A Best Friend's Day?  Like a Mother's Day or a Father's Day, except it's Best Friend Day?
R:  No, you know, like your best friend?  You know, uh, do something special for your best friend.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's cool.  Like, kinda like --
R:  What would you [inaudible]?
L:  --  the way you do something with your mother, like, for Mother's Day, say?
R:  But you have a Mother's Day already.
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I said you have a Mother's Day already, though.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [NOISE] Right.  Okay, [NOISE] huh?  [NOISE] Oh, a -- a Yourself Day. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A- a- a Me Day.
R:  Celebrate Me Day, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  An All About Me Day.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we'll put it in June 'cause there's really nothing else that goes on in June.  [NOISE] You know?
R:  Well, that sounds good. [LAUGH]
L:  It's, like, a Me Day in June.  Maybe extend it into a week and just go on a cruise or something like that. [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm going on a cruise for Me Day.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I could live with that. [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Come back with a tan and, uh ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Get a massage at every day of the cruise, or something.  Um --
R:  Well, just think if you did a Best Friend's Day you could both go on the cruise.
L:  Yeah, you could -- you could give each other a cruise. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you could both go. [NOISE] That -- that -- that'd be a stellar one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Then --
R:  That way you'd have somebody to party with while you were gone.
L:  Yeah, maybe we should put Me Day and Best Friend's Day really close together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Like --
R:  Then --
L:  -- a week apart, right?  So, then you --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- can take the week.  [MN] You could start with Best Friend's Day and then you could end with Me Day.
R:  [LAUGH] That way you could have a two week long party.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Let's see, I think, uh, I think Me Day should have a barbecue.
R:  Ooh, that sounds good.
L:  With like the -- your favorite food.  Has to be the favorite food.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um ...
R:  Oh ... God, I'm trying to think. [MN]
L:  And Best Friend's Day --
R:  I'd throw a lobster on the grill.
L:  -- you have to, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- make your best friend their favorite food.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] I'd bet they'd like that, too.
L:  Think a barbecue for Me Day?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or Best Friend Day, whatever.
R:  Either one.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- it's good.
R:  A barbecue always goes good.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause it's in June, it's in the summer so it's -- it's barbecue season, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Being outdoors and stuff like that.  Um, what else?  How else would we celebrate?  Hey, how about a pinata? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that would be --
L:  I always like pinatas.  Maybe on Me Day you get your own pinata and it's just for you to [LAUGH] to bust it open. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like if everyone has their own pinata.
R:  Yeah, God, I haven't done that for years.
L:  A pinata?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I haven't done that since I was ten.  I think I w- --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I was like a kid too. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I think that -- that's, you know, the last time I ever opened a pinata.  [MN] Um ... [PAUSE]
R:  It would be neat if you could hang the pinata outside. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Outside?
R:  We did ours in the basement.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But if you can hang it from, like, a big tree outside.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah, that'd be great.  I think th- that -- that could we- we've -- I've -- we've had pinatas hung from, uh, laundry, like clotheslines. [LAUGH]
R:  Have ya?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I guess so all the kids could stand around all the way 'round it.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  It's kinda violent if you think about it, you know?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  It's kind of violent if you think about it.  'Cause it's like, uh, it's like in the shape of an animal usually, right?  And then strung up and tied up hanging and the -- and then you have your kids, like, beat it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- until it falls apart.  [LIPSMACK] I never thought of it that way.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] We picked up a bunch of 'em when we were in Mexico.
L:  Pinatas?  Did you use them or do you just keep 'round?
R:  We just keep 'em most of the time.
L:  Mhm.  [PAUSE] Yeah, they're lovely.  Making them -- my mom makes them.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  She -- you take -- you take balloons, right?  And then paper mache.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then, uh, like, frilly lacy stuff -- not frilly lacy stuff, uh, like, uh, not crepe paper but streamers, you know?
R:  Streamers, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And then -- and you sort of cut them up and you glue them -- glue them in layers and then that looks like feathers or fur.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, uh, you know, depending on the color you can make, you can make, like, a purple mouth or something like that.
R:  That would be neat.
L:  You can add [inaudible].
R:  [MN]
L:  Or like -- like, knobby arms or something.  [LIPSMACK] Um, [MN] so those are our holidays.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Me Day and Best Friend's Day.
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  Now, which one do you think should be first?  Should it be Me Day or Best Friend's Day?
R:  Mm, I don't know.
L:  Thing is, if it's Me Day and you make your favorite food then it's really easy for your Best Friend to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- know what your favorite food is a week later.  So, I think Best Friend's Day should be first, so it's kind of like suspense for a week and then when you make your own favorite food or you get your own favorite food, and then, like, your best friend -- your best friend either knows for next year [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and if yo- and if your tastes change in a year and your best friend, um, makes what your favorite food was last year then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you'd be like, "Uh-uh, you have to catch up, this is my new favorite food" you know? [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  I used to like --
R:  That would just be neat though, to have a day for yourself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And a day for your best friend.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, would you cel-
R:  -- those are good days.
L:  Would you celebrate Me Day alone or would you celebrate Me Day with everybody else?
R:  With everybody else.
L:  Yeah.  Th- that'd be--
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- that'd be kinda neat.  Everybody else would be celebrating their Me Day.  It's like, I guess Me Day is already like a birthday.  [LAUGH] We already have birthdays for Me Day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you --
R:  I guess it would be, huh?
L:  But if you celebrated Me Day with everybody else, like, how -- how special would that be?  Like, everybody would be trying to focus on themselves.  I mean, who -- who else would pay attention to you?
R:  Mm.
L:  Like, the whole point of having a birthday is, like, you celebrate y- -- the fact, you're here, you're alive and then everybody else is focusing kind of on celebrating for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know about Me Day anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- I think -- I think Me Day would be actually celebrat- you had to celebrate it by yourself.  And I think that would be great for, like, people who are uncomfortable [MN] being alone, spending alone time.
R:  [MN]
L:  You know?  [PAUSE] Yeah.  So, definitely you celebrate by yourself.  So, at the end of the week when you get back from your cruise then you just take the day -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- off and do whatever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- whatever it is that you want to do.
R:  [MN]
L:  Hm.  [PAUSE] Even if it's, like, one thing.  'Cause people don't celebrate the whole birthday, you know?  They just go out at [NOISE] -- at night for dinner or something or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for a movie and drinks or something like that.  But you'd celebrate Me Day for a few hours.  [NOISE] All by yourself.  That's what I would get, I would get a massage probably, on Me Day.
R:  Would ya?
L:  I've never had a massage, it'd be -- it'd be special.
R:  I haven't either.
L:  I'd, ah, pe- pe- people keep telling me I have to get a massage.  "You have to get a massage.  Oh, it's wonderful, it gets all the kinks out, you feel refreshed" you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I met, uh, a girl who's a massage therapist and she -- and she gets a massage.  So, I guess that speaks to the [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- speaks to the quality of -- of getting massages, you know?  She's -- she's like, "Man, I need a massage".  It's too bad you can't massage yourself.  That'd be ...  'Cause you do all that training.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] 'Cause most other services you could do for yourself.  Like, if you're an accountant --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, you learn --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be an accountant, you could take care of your own accounts.  But not a massage therapist.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] You can't --
R:  So, what are you going to do --
L:  -- take care of yourself.  Huh?
R:  So, what are you going to do besides, you're going to have a massage ... ?
L:  I'm gonna have a massage, gonna celebrate with a massage.  I already mentioned the favorite food.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Go on a trip.
L:  [MN] I would probably take -- I would take the day off from work or maybe, like, leave early.  Leave early from work and take a nap. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Take a nap or something.  [PAUSE] Take a massage -- get a massage and then take a nap afterwards.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have some favorite food.  How else could you celebrate?  Rich people have Me Days all the time in spas and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't think of another way to have a Me Day by yourself.  You could go --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- on a walk -- go on a walk or a museum.  [MN] Most activities are pretty social.  Go on a --
