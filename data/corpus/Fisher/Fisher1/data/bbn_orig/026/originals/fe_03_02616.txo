R:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
L:  Hi, I'm Shannon.
R:  Hi.  What is this?  Have you ever done this before?
L:  Yeah, actually just the first time was yesterday.
R:  And what's the deal?  I -- I signed up for this thing and we're -- I'm supposed to talk to you about --
L:  Right.  They give you a topic --
R:  -- arms inspection in -- okay.
L:  Each time they call they give you a topic and we talk for ten minutes about the topic.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they're doing a linguistics test so we're just supposed to talk about it -- [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for ten minutes.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] How very strange.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.  Uh, what is it?  Arms inspect- -- well, what do you think about it?
L:  Um, I actually think isn't it a little late?  I mean, I thought the war was over.  What does it matter now?
R:  Right.
L:  I thought he said that -- Bush or whatever said it was over and we won and obviously it wasn't a big threat.
R:  Right.  But I think that's the thing, it's the whole premise of going into Iraq in the first place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was that there were weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Right.
R:  And they haven't proved that there are any, and they were in there and obviously have control over it and if they don't find any and do something about it, then, you know, world opinion is still gonna be against them.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] So, I don't know.  I don't -- do you think there were ever any in the first place?
L:  Um, I really have no idea.  I really didn't know much about it.  I just kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hear what everyone else says.
R:  Were you -- did you support the war?
L:  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, yes and no.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No because it had nothing to do with us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so why did we get involved?
R:  Right.
L:  But yes because I guess it was helping them out.
R:  Right.
L:  But a lot -- a lot of those people are ungrateful anyway.
R:  True.
L:  They're still -- still backing him up and ...
R:  [NOISE] And I don't know how much we actually see about how, you know, supportive everyone is.  I don't know if what we get from the media is true.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Obviously they're gonna show people celebrating and being happy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we won, but, um, [NOISE] I don't know. [SIGH]
L:  And about -- that's the arms inspection.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't even -- what -- what even does that mean?  They're -- we inspected what they suppo- supposedly had, what kind of weapons they had, they were supposedly using against us?
R:  Well, I guess the thing was that in the first place it was supposed to be UN inspections.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the US claimed to know more than the UN did and more than the UN could find.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, they agreed to send in these inspectors --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then thought that they weren't doing anything, they didn't find enough in time or something.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they went, "Okay, forget it, we know that there are weapons of mass destruction.  We don't need the UN to tell us that and it's taking too long and they're not disarming, so we're just gonna go in".  But I think the thing is we still don't know whether there were any weapons of mass destruction because the US hasn't provided any sort of concrete proof.
L:  Right.  And they obviously -- they didn't really use any, so there's really, exactly, no proof.
R:  Right.  And I guess since the first, you know, Iraq war, whatever, in ninety one, um, part of the deal when everything was done was that Iraq was supposed to let in weapons inspectors.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they kicked them out, like, after four years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's still part of the, you know, agreement at the end of that war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that inspections should go ahead.  So, I guess whether or not there were -- was a war now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in -- in the terms of ninety one, they're still supposed to go in.  So, I guess they should go in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's just gonna be interesting to see [NOISE] what happens if they don't find anything.
L:  Or what if they do find something and then what are -- what -- what if, like, Iraq hears that the weapons inspectors are supposed to come in and so they just start firing off everything they got, all these deadly weapons?
R:  Right.  I --
L:  That we didn't -- we didn't find -- we didn't know about in the first place, so we couldn't do anything about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They just start -- start shooting them off and whatever -- whatever they got over there, I mean.
R:  I -- I don't know.  I mean, the whole thing is so, you know, what are you supposed to do?  You think that people have these weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you wanna preemptively make sure that you're protecting yourself --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- against these weapons that you're claiming that they have.
L:  Right.
R:  But in order to do that you start a war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is gonna -- I -- I don't know.  It's -- it's interesting.
L:  And what --
R:  I really don't know where I stand.
L:  What gave us the idea that they had these weapons over there in the first place?
R:  Well, I g- -- I -- I don't know -- hi, [inaudible].  Sorry.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess, um, [NOISE] I don't know.  They -- they -- they say that they have their own intelligence, they have chatter from the CIA and this and that, but I mean actual UN weapons inspectors, since they went in again after the UN decided sometime, you know, last year to send them in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have been there for years and years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I don't know what the US is doing in there in the first place and what they've found.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- and I don't know why that became such an issue today.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Like, was it something that they found after ten years or, like, now we know that there are weapons but that -- we didn't know that before?  I really -- I don't know.  I guess they have to go in and it's never a bad thing for them to go in and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- check what's going on, and I -- I think that the -- the US has to let them in, has to want them to go in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because if they don't then it's kind of like it goes against their whole cause in the first place.  And they really must want them to find something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause if they don't then they'll forever be wrong, even though they liberated these people.
L:  Right, right.  And what happens if we do find something?  What are we gonna do with it? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  We're gonna bring it back here and build a playground out of it or what? [LAUGH]
R:  Does -- does the US still have weapons of mass destruction?  Like, aren't they -- we have nuclear weapons, right?
L:  See, I really -- honestly I have, you know, very few opinions about it and I really have -- don't know for sure what even -- even anything about that.  I really -- you know, I read what's in the paper and that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I wish I -- I really -- I'm not clear on it because I feel like so -- I read somewhere that there are something like five countries in the world that have nuclear weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then it becomes, you know, Iraq and this dictator and whatever can't have nuclear weapons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- while the country that is disarming them does.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's just that sort of we trust ourselves not to use them but don't trust them, like, with the stuff [inaudible].
L:  If other -- if these five other countries have it, why aren't we going after them also?
R:  Right.  Well, because they're western countries and we don't care and I don't know.
L:  'Cause I think they can probably do --
R:  It could still all be about oil.
L:  Right, they could -- they could all do just as much damage as -- as anyone could.
R:  Right.  I mean, I don't know what the situation is now.  Are they sending people in?  Have they started?
L:  I, again, have no idea.  I just actually read in the paper today that the war's over so I thought everything was over.  I didn't ... [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I think things will start now that the war is over.
L:  Uh-huh. [MN]
R:  Because the war --
L:  I think that --
R:  -- accomplished, I don't know, getting -- you know, liberating people and blah blah blah, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they didn't find any weapons.
L:  Well, I think they can go in -- I think they can probably go in easier now, now that they, you know, he's -- Saddam's not in power any more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can probably go in a lot easier.  It's probably a lot easier for them to actually go and find something, be able to search around without people down their throat.
R:  And I guess the other thing is now that there are these experts and scientists and stuff that were involved in these supposed programs before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- who are turning themselves in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they're getting more intelligence from, um, you know, the experts that they were trying to track down before.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I think they have -- they have to do something because now they're saying that they think Syria is protecting them and maybe knows something else, so it's sort of like they've started something, they have to finish it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  How long is that gonna take?
R:  I don't know.  That I don't know.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A while, I think.  I mean, if they find one thing, it's justified in all of it.  It's almost like we're hoping to find something.  We never hope --
L:  Like, what is -- what is classified as a -- a, um -- a, you know, mass destructive weapon or whatever?
R:  I guess, like, biological and chemical weapons, nerve gas.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  They said they had VX and I don't know.
L:  That's what they said Iraq -- Iraq supposedly had a lot of I thought was like chemical and they thought they were [inaudible] biological warfare and ...
R:  Exactly, and had, like, anthrax and stuff.
L:  Well, that's the kind of stuff I think they should go in and check for that stuff then.  I'm -- I'm all for that.  I don't want, you know, people bringing anthrax over here any more at least.
R:  Mhm.  That's right.  So, that -- to my understanding, that's what they're looking for.  There was a lot of -- you know, any of those -- I guess anything that when you have biological or chemical warfare, it's mass destruction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can, you know, wipe out a whole population.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And nuclear weapons, too, I guess.  That's the one I'm kind of hazy about 'cause I -- but the thing is, I feel like I don't know if the US has chemical weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if we have, like, you know, nerve gas and all this other stuff, but I mean, hello, we did use a nuclear bomb on, you know, Japan in World War Two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's not gonna go away.  So, I'm sure they're out there somewhere.  I don't know.  I really don't know how I feel about all this.  I wish I had more of an opinion.
L:  Well, what about -- what about weapons inspection on us?  Are they doing anything from over there to come over here and see what we have?
R:  I think the whole deal is the weapons inspection notion came from the first Ir- Iraq war, the Gulf War.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And no one else is being inspected.  It's the fact that, you know, Iraq was believed to have these weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And after the war part of the agreement, you know, war is over, here is the, you know, treaty and the agreement of peace.  Part of it was let weapons inspectors in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that was a big issue, too, because they let them in, they started doing their work, then they kicked them out, like --
