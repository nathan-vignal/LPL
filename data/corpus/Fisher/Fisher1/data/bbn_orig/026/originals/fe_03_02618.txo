R:  Hi.  I'm Molly.
L:  Jen.
R:  I'm sorry, what's your name?
L:  Jen.
R:  Jen?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi, Jen, I'm Molly.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Thank you.  Nice to talk with you, too.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in, um, San Diego, California.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Washington DC.
R:  Oh, well, about as far apart as we could get, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, let's see how far apart we are [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with our viewpoints.  I guess we're supposed to be talking about, um, the disarming of Iraq.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, um, if -- if that's a little dated or not.  I mean, I feel [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, um, you know -- I mean, I'm not as informed as I probably could be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, at the stage that we are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, with Iraq right now.  But I feel like, um, I mean, the US has already done what it -- what it intended on doing, um, which is currently disarming Iraq, correct?
R:  Uh, correct, but I understand that they're still looking for the, um, weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Right.  And, you know, I mean, I've -- I've never been a big proponent of the war [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, and I -- I feel like there definitely were -- were ways to go about doing things that were legal and, um, diplomatic.  I also understand that, you know, sometimes, um, those don't work as well, but I don't feel like we, um, exhausted those methods, um --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- and I -- and I don't think that the reason why we went about it so soon was I think -- I -- I don't feel like we were in the immediate danger that, um, the Bush administration and the media sort of [SIGH] I guess tried to get people to, um, believe, you know, to agree with their cause.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, you know, it's -- it's interesting.  I used to consider myself what they called a dove.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- do you know what that is?
L:  Uh, well, I can assume, um, [LAUGH] [MN] --
R:  Uh, very peacefully oriented and --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- and that war is an abomination under any circumstances.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And strangely enough I've changed over the years.  I'm not quite sure why.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I really do believe that Iraq -- and I wasn't a big fan of Bush, by the way.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I, um, I do believe that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.  I believe that there's a lot of Middle Eastern countries with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- weapons of mass destruction.  And I went against some of my friends who don't believe that, and even though we don't talk about it a lot, I believe that it's kind of affected our friendships because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I believe that we did the right thing.
L:  Well, I mean, I feel like the first thing that we should've done about Saddam is to not support him fully right through his worst atrocities, you know, and far beyond and to not have provided him with the means to develop weapons of mass destruction in the first place. [LAUGH]
R:  You know --
L:  Um --
R:  I -- I agree with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I have to say that I'm not fully -- my ex husband is a marine corps reserve --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and has, um, a history with the marine corps, was, you know, an officer with the marine corps --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and has been called back up for fulltime duty.
L:  Right.
R:  And like I say, he is my ex so we don't believe -- you know, we don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- we don't believe all the same things.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, however, I don't really remember the history of it with the or- original Bush, but apparently it was one of those things where it was, um, um, [SIGH] how can I say this?  They -- they supported Saddam Hussein as the lesser of two evils.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that's how he ended up being supported by us.  And I don't -- I don't really know -- I mean, I don't trust the government entirely either.  I mean, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I don't know exactly why they supported him, but they did and, um, I -- I personally am behind it all the way.  I mean, I think they did the right thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I've read a lot of history about Germany --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, I know that there was a time when, you know, the -- the destruction of Hitler wasn't taken seriously.  You know, they wanted to wait and see what was going to happen.
L:  Right.
R:  And now people take a lot of grief because, "Oh, well, you didn't jump in it faster".  You know, "Where's your humanitarian beliefs?"
L:  Right.
R:  And I think if we didn't jump in and take care of Saddam Hussein we're going to face the same thing in the future.
L:  Well, I mean, I agree.  I -- I'm not always opposed to war.  I mean, I would obviously prefer peace, uh, you know, to war, but I don't think that everything can always be solved peacefully and I think in some cases things have to be solved through force --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just like with Hitler.  I mean, there's sometimes just no way around it.
R:  Right.
L:  But I mean, I -- I do feel like the government supports, um, dictators in third world countries, um, far often than -- than we know.  I mean, there's, you know --
R:  I think you're probably right.
L:  -- um, just like, um, [LIPSMACK] in Burma.  I mean, the president right now, who, um, the -- the president who the people of Burma elected, the government has put under house arrest or our government has put under house arrest, um, and installed, um, a military leader which most people don't even know about.  But it's like the situation --
R:  I've never heard anything about that.
L:  Yeah, I mean, the situation going on at the moment right there is also, you know -- is -- is very, very bad, but I feel like right now our interest is in Ir- -- is in the Middle East for countless different reasons, and it's -- I definitely agree that it's -- it's really good for the people of Iraq and I think that if that was our sole, you know, interest in mind, then I think we would be very noble and that would [LAUGH] -- would be a good thing.  I just -- I -- I guess I'm a little skeptical as to why we always -- you know, I feel like sometimes we support things when it is in our interest and I just have to wonder, you know, what it -- what could be our other interest aside from disarming Saddam.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- you know, it might be naive to think that it's just oil, but I think that that probably does have a large part to do with, you know.
R:  Really, and I feel just the opposite.  I don't think it has anything to do with the oil at all.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I have -- I live in a part of Southern California that has an extremely high, uh, concentration of Caldians[?].  Do you know what that is?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Uh, Caldians are Christian, um, Christian Iraqis.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, of course, they've faced a lot of persecution when they were living in Iraq because they weren't Muslim.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I live in a subdivision that -- oh, let's see, there's fifty two houses, probably, mm, twenty of them are -- are inhabited by Caldians.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I don't know of anybody in our neighborhood who hasn't entirely supported the overthrow of the Iraqi government.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, you know, they have family there.  Some of them have family who've been tortured and it's their belief that, um, Saddam Hussein has had, um, weapons that he's had a lot of time to hide.
L:  Right.
R:  Because apparently, um, that part of the country, Iraq, is approximately the size of California, is what I've heard.  I don't know if that's true.
L:  Right.  Uh, to be honest, I'm not sure exactly.  I mean, I -- you mean population wise?
R:  Um, uh --
L:  Or, uh --
R:  Geographical.
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm really not pos- -- I'm not sure on that.
R:  Yeah.  So, there's a lot of area --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of desert --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, where they could be hiding this sort of thing.
L:  Well, I mean, I [inaudible].  I mean, I think it's hard to tell, you know, just based on -- and I don't have those, you know, specific, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, real life examples.  [inaudible] is my big source and I -- and I think that there's probably a lot more -- I'm sure a lot of people are very happy, but based on even what, you know, I feel like the biased media [LAUGH] presents --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's still definitely, I think, a lot of people who still aren't happy with our role and I don't think that we should entirely discredit them for being ungrateful because I know historically we still have done a lot, you know, of damage.  I mean, they've -- they are just a country devastated by war and I think that if we're going to install a democratic government there that we have to be willing to accept that in a democracy people might not actually like us, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, I think that, um, while it's definitely good -- and I don't think Saddam Hussein is, you know -- I think he's a very, very bad person and I think it was definitely -- [SIGH] it was right to get him out of power, I -- I don't know if there could have been a better way.  I mean, it's -- I'm -- I am happy with the war that the war turned out, the fact that it was as quick as it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but I still feel like there's probably going to be a lot of opposition.  I -- and I still think after the war, I mean, Dick Cheney is a businessman who profited off of the first war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so I mean even though I know that, you know, the people of Iraq are very happy, I'm sure a lot of people are and, um, possibly we could have prevented a -- a lot of future damage, I mean, there's still going to be the threat of a lot of people being unhappy and a lot of those people, you know, could turn out to be [LAUGH] potential terrorists and, you know, I don't think it's going to maybe in the end save us from as much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, harm as -- as we could anticipate.
R:  So, are you thinking that by, um, by going into Iraq we've opened ourselves to the possibilities of terrorism, more terrorism?
L:  Well, I don't if it would have been prevented either way.  I mean, I think --
R:  Yeah, I don't either, yeah.
L:  Um, I certainly don't think that it helped things.  Um, I mean, I -- if anything I think it -- it could fuel, you know, more anger and -- and -- and could have possibly made it worse.  I don't think that it would've been better by not going in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I just -- you know, I -- I feel --
