L:  Hi, I'm Mary Davis.
R:  Hi, I'm Carol.
L:  Hi, Carol.
R:  Hi.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, what is your favorite holiday?
L:  [MN] My favorite holiday, um, [SIGH] I have to say my favorite holiday is Christmas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about you?
R:  [MN] Um, [SIGH] I would say any three day weekend. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um ...
L:  That's a good thing.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I'm not that crazy about Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean it's like there's a lot of expectation surrounding it.  It seems like people get very troubled around Christmas time, there's a lot of stress and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, money and [MN] there's just too many expectations wrapped up in it.  It's too much, I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for lack of a better word, voodoo, wrapped up in it, you know what I mean?
L:  Mh- --
R:  And I -- but it's a religious holi- -- so it's not voodoo, you know what I mean.
L:  Right.
R:  There's too many expectations and --
L:  Yeah, I think people get a little carried away and lose the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- real, you know, meaning --
R:  [MN]
L:  of what it c- -- what it could be, you know, and about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be- being together and, you know, and sharing your time with people you care about, you know?
R:  Right.  And then if -- if --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- your family situation isn't exactly the way, you know, Normal Rockwell --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or what, you know, media's told us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it should be, people get depressed.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know?  And it's -- it's -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, the last --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- couple of years I've ended up spending my holidays with -- with, sort of, like, my second family, you know, like, [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're  -- they're not my -- they're not my biological family, they're sort of like an adopted family that I have and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three boys and they look so forward to it, you know?  And we go to church and we have a good time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so in that respect it's, like, I -- I -- you know, I -- it's more fun, you know?
R:  Mhm.  [MN]
L:  I agree with you about the -- all the family -- all the family, uh, things [LAUGH] that can happen, can make it, you know, stressful for -- [MN] -- and -- and -- and I've had that happen.  So, it's like, okay, I think from now on I'm going to spend time with people that, you kn- [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that appear to be a little bit more normal. [LAUGH] You know, so, it's m- -- it's become more fun, you know, to do Christmas.  But you're right, there is a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stress around it.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I like, uh, you know, Memorial Day.  Where I grew up, it's like, you know, that's when the summer starts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's a good -- that's a good holiday, I like that holiday.
L:  The one that's coming up next month?  So --
R:  Yeah --
L:  Memorial.
R:  -- this month.  It's at the end of this month, huh?
L:  Yeah, the end of this May.  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, it's -- th- -- the- -- I've got a b- -- a listing of the question here, it said, "Why?  If  y- -- if either of you could create a holiday, what would it be and how would you have people celebrate it -- it?"  Do you have any thoughts a- --
R:  Um, I would create it -- I would create it, um, I would say that it would be, um, going to Las Vegas holiday. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, [LAUGH] why is that?
R:  You know, 'cause I love Las Vegas.
L:  [MN] Uh-huh.
R:  I dunno ...
L:  Are you from there?
R:  I think it would be -- no --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- no I just like it.  I -- I live in Southern California.
L:  Oh ho, uh-huh.
R:  So, it's not that far away, but I love Las Vegas --
L:  U- --
R:  -- it's great.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, no it would be, like, a national day off.  And people, er, would just spend it, um, just leisurely.
L:  M- --
R:  It would be like almost req- -- like, kind of like, you know, um, the Jewish faith has, where you're supposed to go at sundown, you're supposed to go in.  You're not supposed to go out after sundown.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Friday night -- and it lasts until, I don't know when on Saturday, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the thing is, I guess, yeah, sundown to sundown, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something like that, you know, when you're required to be with your family, or your friend and just do something leisurely --
L:  M-
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm, mhm.  That s- --
R:  What would your idea be?
L:  That sounds good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I would, um, I think I really -- about having a-, like, an ex-, you know, an extended weekend, you know, where there would be, um, where you'd be off on a Friday and a Monday. [LAUGH]
R:  There you go.
L:  So, that you could have a really, really long weekend and, uh, and you would have to -- you wouldn't be required to, but people would celebrate it by doing something, um, something within that time frame that required you to help somebody else, you know?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, if somebody, not necessarily somebody in need, but what if somebody, you know -- you do something that you wouldn't normally do, like, um, like, I don't have a particular -- I don't have a house, I live in an apartment, so, it's like, um, I might go mow somebody's -- mow somebody's yard or help somebody with -- with their garden, you know.  Something, you know, something that you would enjoy doing tha- -- that you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- necessarily have the access to.  You know, so, y- -- you -- you would get to pick what that would be but -- but it would be something that somebody might need to have done.  You know, like --
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  I'm good at orga-, you know, I like to organize, you know, so I might find somebody that has a really messy garage and -- and help them accomplish that task.
R:  Oh, great.  You could come over here and organize my place.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That could be your first thing. [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause that would be, you know, and it would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a reward for the recipient, but -- but then something that, you know, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would enjoy doing too and you might --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not get a chance to do it, you know, that -- that kind of thing.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And then, you know, the rest of the time would be spent however you wanted to spend it, just a, you know, really long -- a really long weekend.  You know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- involving four days instead of two. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] That's a good idea.
L:  [SIGH] You know, so -- I think that --
R:  How about a National Crafting Weekend or something like that?
L:  Maybe?  That might be possible.
R:  Or something like, yeah, ma- --
L:  Eh.
R:  -- where you sit around and make things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, yeah.  That would be good too.  O- --
R:  Maybe teach people, I don't know, um.  When you co- -- when this topic comes on, do you have the -- the chance to say no or not, yeah uh.  I think you can choose whether or not you want to talk about this when the recording first comes on, I don't know.
L:  Oh, does it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, uh, I don't --
R:  I think s- --
L:  I didn't -- I didn't catch that then, 'cause it sounded like they picked it and you didn't have a choice.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Am I wrong?
R:  Well, I think you have the choice to say no if y- -- but I don't have that many ideas about holidays. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, wh- um --
L:  Yeah, that's the truth.
R:  Because holidays are like, all the -- you know they try to make all these different holidays like Secretaries' Day and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, Grandparents' Day and all this, and -- [MN] maybe I've become too cynical and mostly holidays --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are just stuff made up by the card companies now.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it would hardly -- it would be hard to get another holiday going.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know? [LAUGH] 'Cause there's so many --
L:  Well, you know, they have it for everybody --
R:  -- I mean, now that people are, like --
L:  -- you know, they have everything related t- -- you know, if I ha- -- if I had to say anything about that as a criticism, it's kind of like, well, they have a Grandparents' Day, they have a Secretaries' Day, they have a -- a Mothers' Day, they have Fathers' Day, but they don't have Brothers and Sisters' Day, and they don't have a Singles' Day, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  They don- -- they [LAUGH] or the, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  And Christmas is family and Easter is religious and, you know, and then there's other holidays named after people, like Martin Luther King, you know, stuff like that.  Which are -- and they're fine, you know, they're all well and fine, but, you know, what about a fun holiday, just a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- day where it's just every g- body gets to take a personal day, and it's that day, you know -- where you -- you know, everybody has to ride a bicycle that day, you know.  They can't [LAUGH], you know, something they ca- --
R:  [MN] They can't drive?
L:  -- they can't drive around in their car, you know?  Or -- some -- some -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something where it's just got to be one day where it, uh, you know -- what about a Singles' Day?  That would be fun [LAUGH], you know, just a -- something that's just, you know, kinda different, you kn-, kinda out there --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but -- but I don't know, you know, but --
R:  Where do -- where do you live?
L:  I live in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you live in, where in C- -- Southern California?
R:  Southern California, yeah.  In Orange C- --
L:  Whi- -- which place?
R:  Orange County?
L:  Orange County?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I don't know where that is.  Is like -- where --
R:  By Disneyland. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  I live, like, the next -- to the north of Disneyland.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you like where you live?  Have you lived there all your life?
R:  N- not all my life.  I'm originally from Wyoming.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, uh, [MN] yeah, it's okay.  I mean, it's expensive, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but it terms of the weather and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- overall, you know, it's -- it's okay.  I -- sometimes I get burned out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The traffic and the [SIGH], you know, like any big city, right?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But --
L:  Right, traffic's bad here too, m- --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- I'm originally from -- yeah.  It's bad.  You know, but I'm originally from Florida, but -- and I usually travel home for, you know, Christmas and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  [SIGH] you know, and -- and sometimes it's like, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hot in Florida, so it's hard to get in that Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- spirit when it's not snowing or something or chilly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, not cold and stuff, but, you know, so ...
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  But, you know, it's a -- it's okay.  I think any holiday is kind of a state of mind.  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  That's right, every -- every weekend feels like a holiday for me. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know what mean?  When it's the --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- end of Friday and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's the end of Friday, it's like, you know, you've got some weekend, just two days just to yourself.
L:  Mhm, exactly.
R:  [MN] That feels good. [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But I guess that any time you stay home from work that's kind of a holiday, isn't it?
L:  Uh- uh-huh.
R:  I mean, if you're not sick that is.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if you ever just take a day, a personal day for yourself just to take care of things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that --
L:  Yeah, that can be very satisfying.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Like, yeah, if you -- you know, you get up leisurely and you're doing stuff in the middle of the day when everybody else is working.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that sounds very ... [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that can be real fun.  You know, where you go, okay I'm having a personal day and I can plan it all for myself.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you can work some fun into it and treat yourself to a massage or, you know, hairdo --
R:  Yeah, go and get you a hair cut, yeah.
L:  A manicure, pedicure, you know, just really spend it on nothing --
