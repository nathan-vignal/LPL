L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name's John.
L:  Hi, John.  This is Amy.
R:  Hi, Amy.
L:  How are you?
R:  All right.  How 'bout you?
L:  Fine, thanks.
R:  Good.
L:  Oh, what the world should do about Iraq, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and it's asking should we disarm them?  Uh, it's a little dated because I think they, uh, put it together before the, uh, recent, uh, uh, war that went on. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  I think, um, yeah, other than disarming them, this might seem bizarre, maybe it is [LAUGH] a little bit, but, you know, we're going over there and we're spending all this money and we're dropping bombs and feeding their people, you know.  I think we have people here in New York City, how 'bout dropping meal packages into the Bowery or Skid Row or something like that, you know?  Um, take it over.  You know, how much money have we put into this land over there and how much money have we spent trying to make it somewhat of a democracy, but the people there, that's not what they know, that's not what they understand.  I -- I think it's kinda crazy.  I think we could -- you know, if we do, like, Puerto Rico or, you know, something that we've done like that, make it a -- a UN -- a US, um, I don't even know what it's called, maybe colony or something like that, [SIGH] maybe we could, uh, benefit.  They -- they would certainly benefit from that.  I don't know.  What do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, one of the interesting things that I, uh, have followed is for the last, uh, years ever since the g- -- first gulf war, we've continued to bomb there and most of the US populace has been unaware that we've been bombing the whole time, [LAUGH] so ...  It's very interesting because actually the news once in a while would carry it, and they, um, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was just a few weeks before September eleventh was, um, one of the ones that I had noticed, that they had carried a news report the US had just stepped up the bombing again in Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, that was one reason I was not really surprised by the September eleventh attacks as we -- our government was continuing to bomb for, you know, a dozen years or so. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Well, I think our government does a lot more maybe than we think that they do and, um, [SIGH] I don't know, it's scary.  I know September eleventh scared the heck out of me.  I mean, you know, I live in New York State.  I have friends in New York City.  I had people down there.  Um, I don't know, I mean, that's -- that's one thing that, like, hit home to me.  But even before that, I sit back and I think, "Why do these people have to suffer?" you know.  Let -- the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  There's no middle class.  You hear people complaining all the time in America, okay, the middle class gets, you know, the raw end of the deal all the time, but things like this, you have to think, do you really?  You know, aren't you glad to have the middle class?  That's really something to think about sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's one of the things that's made our society a lot more stable is that we have not had the broad disparities.  Yes, we've had a lot of rich people and we've had poor people, but overall --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, we've had mobility, that somebody, you know, just getting out of school is in the lowest twenty percent of income, and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as they work they move up.  And when they retire, often they're back down.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, people move back and forth, so when we talk about, uh, income disparities, it's a fluid thing.  People have the mobility here that in other cultures, other -- other countries, uh, you don't have the mobility.  You're born in the lower class, you stay in the lower class.  You're born rich, you stay rich.
L:  Right.
R:  That's been a real difference here.  I think, um, one of the things, uh, the, uh, formal reason giving -- given for going into Iraq was to, uh, uh, disarm them of certain weapons of mass destruction and all.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they kept saying, "Oh, yeah, we know you've got 'em".  Government of Iraq s- -- kept saying, "No, we don't have 'em".
L:  Right.
R:  And kept saying, you know, "We -- our laws forbid them" and such, and even as the troops went in there and every once in a while they'd come across something and, uh, they were overly -- they were very cautious because they did not want people to be hurt --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, if they found something that was dangerous.  So, they'd get a lot of false positives and that would get reported in the media and then later you'd hear, "No, it really wasn't".  You know, they -- like, one of the latest ones was a barrel of stuff that they said, "Oh, this might be nerve gas or mustard gas or something".
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, especially there's missiles around it, and as they did further testing it came out, well, it looks like maybe that was for refueling missiles. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  So, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They never did find the -- any evidence yet of the whole rationale given for the war, which, uh, to me is disturbing that our government went after this without that being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, without the rationale that was given being there.  Yes, there were other rationales, but those weren't the ones used and, you know, yeah, uh, Hussein was definitely, uh, very evil and had killed a lot of people, but that wasn't the rationale given for the war.
L:  Right.  And -- and I agree with that, in a way.  I mean, I'm -- I'm pro Iraqi war probably ninety nine percent.  I do believe, however, your point.  Like, I understand that, that the rationale that was given, you know, they said, "Okay, it's, like, to disarm them of these weapons that may harm, you know, American citizens" and blah blah blah.  But you know what?  Th- these weapons of mass destruction that were not found, okay, that may not even be the point.  The point may be terrorist attacks in general, like they did on September eleventh, I mean, that they did on the World Trade Center twelve years before that even, and that is scary.  Um, I think maybe our government needs to -- they need to validate what they do, of course, because otherwise they wouldn't get any support or any money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but you don't have to -- I don't think you really -- it's necessary to -- to specify, correct me if I'm wrong, that, okay, we're after Saddam because, uh, he has these possible weapons of mass destruction.  All right, maybe we're after him because we think he has a link to Al Qaeda that had a link to, you know, the World Trade Center bombings.  I mean, that's where we wanna protect ourselves.  We -- we're too busy worrying about every other country in the world and we have people starving and suffering in our own country.  I think -- I think it's pretty crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  One of the, uh, ministries I work with is we -- we have a food bank and a clothing bank and such to help and, uh, try and provide what we can for people in need.  And actually [LAUGH], you know, I've been out of work for two years, so I qualify [LAUGH] as a client --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- as well as a volunteer, so ...
L:  Yeah, how many meal packets have you gotten? [LAUGH] [PAUSE] You know, how many meal packets were, like I said before, dropped down in, you know, New York City?  How many people are being helped that need it within our own country?  I think that, um, we're too busy sticking our nose into everybody else's business and then when it comes to our own country we're not.  And it's not like these countries are gonna reciprocate.  I mean, look at the years that we've put action into Canada and, um, France and Germany, whatever, and now they stick their nose up.  I mean, I'm not saying that we need to have a World War Three, but it's gonna happen whether or not they -- you know, either way, if they agree to help us or they don't, they're an enemy or they're an ally, you know.  It's like, you can't avoid it, but why should we help you in a time where you're not gonna help us when we need it?  You know, I think -- I think it's crazy.  And then, we're the American citizens, we're the ones who are suffering for it.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Am I off base by saying that?
R:  Well, I know there's certainly a lot of need and, uh, the US has been one of the most generous countries both with our own people and overseas.  And, uh, a lot of times it hasn't been appreciated [LAUGH] either place, but ...
L:  Right.  Well, I think the whole oil thing is -- is an issue over there, but [SIGH] I think even if the -- you know, America took over, just say if they took over Iraq and made it one of their, you know, sub areas or whatever, like we have Puerto Rico and all that, we're not gonna take those oil fields away from those people, you know, and -- and you have to think we're paying the highest gas prices that we've paid --
