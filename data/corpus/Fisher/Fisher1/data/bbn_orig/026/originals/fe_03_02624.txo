L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Sherice[?].
R:  I'm Gregory.
L:  How are you?
R:  All right.  How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm okay.
R:  [SIGH] It's seems we've got a pretty outdated topic.
L:  Yeah.  I was really surprised.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean I think we're over there for a reason.  Let's get rid of it and get going.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I think we went over there for a --
R:  Ye-
L:  -- reason to disarm 'em.
R:  Well, that's what we said anyway.
L:  I mean I don't know -- if we're over there why we're not doing what we're going to do, but I -- I'd hate to see us go over there and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- leave 'em with all this arm[?] and then have to go back again some time.
R:  Yeah.  From what I can tell from the newspapers it sounds like they went in there claiming they would find stuff, um, they were so sure they had the intelligence reports and so forth, [SIGH] but they've been there for months now and nothing has been found.  Right?  [LAUGH]
L:  They didn't find anything big.
R:  Right.
L:  They --
R:  Right.
L:  -- might have found -- you know, they didn't find what they had thought they were going to go get, but then again how -- how do I really know that's they went over there for.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That could've been just what they said they were gonna do.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  It was a good selling job you know --
L:  Yeah, bu-
R:  -- they spun the  invasion pretty well in the press.
L:  But they need to get over there and ah, get what they wanna do and get out and come back home and [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- then leave 'em on their own.  [SIGH].  [NOISE]
R:  We- -- I guess the question becomes then how to leave them on their own?  I mean --
L:  [MN] I don't know because they're sure violent against us right now all of a sudden. [NOISE]
R:  I'm sorry?  
L:  They're sure fighting us right now.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know I thought [NOISE] we went over there to help them.
R:  [SIGH] That's what we said [SIGH] -- we --
L:  And so if we're over there helping them, why are they turning on us? [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Probably because they aren't happy with us either.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I can't believe they wanted to live the way they were living?
R:  Well, it's possible th- -- that they like neither option.  Right?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Wh- -- what's your other choice though?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  There's not a whole lot of places.  [LAUGH]  You know, it's either this or that.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  And it seems like we were being pretty nice guys to go over there and help 'em.
R:  [MN]  I suppose.  I don't know, I'm a little --
L:  I don't know.  I guess, you know, I'd have to really [SIGH] wonder.  You know.  You know, nobody asked my opinion when they went over there so I guess [MN] I don't know all the facts 'cause if I did I might have a different opinion.  [NOISE]  I only know what th- -- the media's reporting, don't I?
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  That would --
R:  Yeah.  I've been trying to read --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- British newspaper websites and so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- forth to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to get some angle on the story at least that's not the official US [SIGH] angle [SIGH].
L:  [NOISE] But is their op- opinion any different?
R:  [SIGH] Um, they're somewhat more open about criticizing their government.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN]  Ah, I think the invasion wasn't quite as popular over there in Britain.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the newspapers aren't quite as much in line with ah, "Rah, rah.  Let's go". 
L:  [NOISE] Well, after seeing, ah, Bush [NOISE] last night it seemed like he had quite a lot of support.
R:    [LAUGH] He was on the aircraft carrier, right?
L:  Yeah, but even the news media today played it up pretty --
R:  Ok-
L:  -- pretty good --
R:  That's true.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  That ah --
R:  -s a good point.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I do wonder about the credibility though.  Like we said -- like you said that we're going to go over there and find stuff --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and if we don't find anything --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what's going to happen next time --
L:  Well --
R:  -- with the next country?
L:  Yeah.  But hasn't --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- every president had his own war?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe Bush got jealous?
L:  I mean isn't that kinda like norm?  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Everybody -- every president's had their own wars or maybe he's just wanted to --
R:  I suppose.
L:  -- I don't know, but [NOISE]  he sure doesn't seem to be low in -- right now he seems to be okay in his ratings right now after last night's speech.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Every thing I read said he --
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  -- people were really impressed with his speech.
R:  I didn't see it, but I --
L:  But --
R:  -- I -- the newspapers, they seem to be --
L:  But, ah --
R:  -- pleased with it.  Yeah.
L:  But then, you know, I could do a good speech too if I had five hundred people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] -- helping me write it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's my crummy speech all by myself that gives me trouble.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I d- -- I wonder when do -- when do Presidents stop writing their own speeches?
L:  I don't think they ever do, do they?
R:  You don't think, like, Lincoln or Washington wrote their own?
L:  Well, yeah, back in those days 'cause they didn't have any flunkies like we do, right?
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  Nowadays I think nobody in -- the government -- president --
R:  No, I'm sure.  I'm sure, I'm sure, like, junior senators have speechwriters --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, left and right.
L:  But I think, ya know.  I don't know he's [SIGH] -- that would be a tough call.  I don't want to make it if I -- you know?  [SIGH]  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't want to have to go worry about going to war if I'm going to be President.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just let me to do up the big things like the price a gas or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] But he'd better do something if he goes over there 'cause if he comes back with nothing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ya know, it's like a --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  -- little boy crying, "Wolf" -- we're not going to believe him again.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm sure th- that's going to be the other side of th- of the suspicion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that if they come over there, spend two months looking around -- all of a sudden tomorrow they say they found something, people are going to say, "Is it planted?"
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Is it just us putting things there because we can't not find anything --
L:  I guess he's not going to win, is he?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How many more years does he have to?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think he put himself in the +situation, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's his fault for going in there with  no international backing and no [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  And do we -- don't even know if we'll ever find if we got the man or not?
R:  Right.  He's dispp- --
L:  So, how are we --
R:  -- he's disappeared.
L:  -- to ever know that we got him.
R:  Bin Laden -- yeah, Bin Laden disappeared.  Saddam disappeared.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm --
L:  Everybody's gone.
R:  Yeah.  They don't --
L:  So --
R:  -- die -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they just [MN] go into hiding it seems.
L:  Yeah.  Well, -- yeah [LAUGH].  I guess I'd go into hiding too if they were shooting at me.
R:  S- sure.
L:  Right.
R:  But are they any safer -- are th- -- are they any less dangerous to us when they're in hiding?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  I don't know because [SIGH] -- it -- it seems like we kinda took out all his, ah, helpers, didn't we?
R:  [MN] Ah, sounds like it.  I'm sure he doesn't have the same, you know --
L:  So, I mean.
R:  -- deluxe accommodations and communication network that he used to have.  So -- [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] I mean we've taken out his relatives even.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they keep capture -- capturing his half brothers  on the border --
L:  Did we get them too?
R:  Yeah, they got a couple of them, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which is, I guess, useful for DNA testing.  I think --
L:  He sure lived like the king, didn't he?
R:  I'm sorry?  Yeah --
L:  He sure lived like a king.
R:  [LAUGH] I must say I loved the photos of the US soldiers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lounging around in the --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, and then the --
R:  -- golden beds and the gilded --
L:  I think, you know, they should all --
R:  -- bathtubs.
L:  -- go there and have a shower or something and play --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, ah, boy oh boy the way he lived, I'd only could dream of.
R:  Yeah, well, when you're an absolute dictator you can --
L:  Yeah, how did he get so much money --
R:  -- live as you wish, I'm sure.
L:  -- I guess?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  They were finding charred dollar bill corners I heard -- like charred --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hundred dollar bills.
L:  Yeah.  Shh -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- everything was gold and it -- oh, my God -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was just so beautiful I just  think the people that would be -- over there would be so angry when they saw the inside of those pictures.
R:  Oh, I'm sure they knew.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Because, God, oh, if my president were living like that and I don't have any [NOISE] place to even sleep, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, then, I guess it's a different way to live over there.
R:  Yeah.  But 
L:  I don't want to go over there and live though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever done one of these before?  These --
R:  One of these conversations?  No.
L:  Yeah.  You know what, I just signed up the other day.
R:  Yeah, I signed up just a couple of days ago and this was the first one I managed to actually be home for.
L:  Yeah, and I was like said -- it -- at ten o'clock and all of a sudden it's ten oh one.
R:  Yeah, I keep coming home at like eight fifteen and they -- ah, leave me a message on my machine at eight oh one.
L:  Oh.
R:  Bang.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wh- do you know what we get paid for these?
R:  Ah, I think they said ten bucks per call.
L:  Oh, aha -- I hope they call me a lot.
R:  Well, it's three calls per person I think.
L:  For wh- -- for good?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Forever?
R:  I -- I think that's what they said, yeah.
L:  Oh, well.
R:  Because I suppose they want a wide net of people, um, you know, they want us to have lots of different voices and accents and so forth.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that's my guess.  I don't know.  I'm not quite sure what they're doing with these.
L:  Yeah, I -- I can't figure it either, but 
R:  Ah.
L:  I signed up to read the ads too and I've been reading those, so 
R:  Mm, how are those?  I haven't seen that.
L:  Um, they're not bad.  An- it takes [NOISE] -- it's just a pop up ad, ya know, so I read those and  [SIGH] it's kinda boring.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you only have to stay on ten seconds.
R:  Yeah --
L:  So --
R:  -- I suppose the only interesting advertising I've ever heard of is on the Superbowl.
L:  Oh.
R:  All the other ads are boring.
L:  Yeah.  Well, these are definitely boring 'cause --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they're all the pop ups on the computers.
R:  Mm.  That's no fun.
L:  So, they're very, very boring.  [MN]  So [NOISE]   Now, does somebody come back and talk to us when we're done or what --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- happens?
R:  Oh, they said they would tell us when ten minutes are up.  Um.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh 
R:  At the beginning that's what they said --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- I'm not sure if, ah --
L:  Well, [NOISE] I don't know -- I just --
R:  I thought -- I thought it was ten minutes by now, but 
L:  I just hope my sons never have to go over there and fight.  [LAUGH]  Anywhere.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I guess that's the  plus side of an all volunteer military, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless there's a draft you can never be forced to fight.
L:  Thank God.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Definitely.
L:  That would really -- but, you know, I don't know if it's worse though, when you know, you watch all these people over there and you thank God we're going over there, "We're doing you some good.  At least we thought we were going to do you some good".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "And now, all of a sudden you're shooting at us".  I think I'd be pretty angry.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I'd want to think that when I went over there it was for a reason, [NOISE] but --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- I don't know if was or not.  You know, how am I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- supposed to know?
R:  [SIGH] Well, if you can't trust your President I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's not much of a way to tell.
L:  Well, I've never had to not trust him so I guess I'd better tr- trust him now, so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He doesn't behave in a very trustworthy fashion though.
L:  [NOISE] He's -- you know, he's got a nice little [NOISE] soft accent, you know, he kinda [NOISE] reminds me of like [NOISE] a hometown [NOISE] boy and I kinda --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know he doesn't tr- [NOISE] give me a bad vibe or anything, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  At all.  [NOISE]
R:  I guess that's his ap- that's his appeal, right?  That, "Oh, shucks" --
L:  I guess, you know.
R:  -- image.
L:  Of course I liked his daddy.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, he --
