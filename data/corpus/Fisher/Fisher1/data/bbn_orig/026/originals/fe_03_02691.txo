L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi.  Um, my name is Nancy.
L:  Hi.  I'm Carrie.
R:  Hi.  I'm in New York, where are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm in New York also. 
R:  Yay!  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yesterday, I got somebody in Iowa. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  I had someone in California.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, I didn't know what the topic was 'cause my husband answered the phone, and he didn't realize what was going on, and then when I got it -- got onto the phone, I had a- -- accepted it but I didn't know what it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but now -- and now I guess it's about holidays, right?  So 
R:  Yeah.  It's what's your favorite holiday?  Why, an' if you could make up your own holiday, what would it be?  And how would you celebrate it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  Okay.  What's your favorite holiday?
L:  I guess Christmas is my favorite holiday.
R:  Okay.  Mine is Halloween.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  And why is Halloween your favorite?
R:  Uh, 'cause it's a totally make believe, made up kinda day, you can be anything you want, you can be nice, you can be funny, you can be drastic, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can just kinda go all out and it's all pretend.
L:  Right.  I mean, I like giving out candy and stuff like that [LAUGH] on Halloween, I -- I know.  Um, Christmas has just always been like a real like special family time, like -- always growing up and everything.  Just the time like, we would always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bake cookies, and just do things, like me and my Mom, and me and my Dad, and so -- and my Dad passed away, so it's kind of like -- I don't know, I just -- that time of year, it's for family for us, but [MN] --
R:  So, it's a good thing for you, it's a special thing.
L:  It's a special thing, right.
R:  See, Christmas is not a good holiday in my house.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  We [LAUGH] don't get along.  I especially don't get along with anybody at Christmas, and we've always had huge fights like every Christmas for years and years.
L:  Oh my goodness!
R:  So, it --
L:  I can see why that's not your favorite.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It -- it's not a real good time, and even if everybody's being nice, it's always like, "Okay.  When are we going to start fighting?"
L:  Oh!  That's terrible.
R:  So, it -- it's not really a good holiday here but we're thinking of trying to celebrate it differently, like maybe go to the zoo or something, and just hang out and enjoy the animals being there, or something.
L:  Right.
R:  And my family's not religious either, so -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that aspect is not part [NOISE] of any celebrations we have.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [NOISE] Which, you know, I know can make a big difference --
L:  Right.
R:  -- depending on the peop- --the person.
L:  Right.  The other part of the question is -- is trickier in terms of what holiday would I create? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That I -- I don't know, I've never given too much thought to that, but --
R:  Neither would I, but I would probably have like a celebration of animals kinda day.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I'm sure there's something out there that covers it but nothing that I know of that's promoted. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, go out, support your local zoo, volunteer at a shelter -- something like that -- respect other living creatures --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- that kinda thing.  Um, I like animals a lot and I like to work with them, and I think a lot of kids and adults don't really get enough exposure to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that would be a good thing and maybe help promote understanding. 
L:  That sounds good.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I would like to participate in something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always try and do things for -- like with the lesser known holidays, like Arbor Day and Earth Day and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, work in my yard, fix the flowers, I mean, just something --
L:  I mean, on Earth --
R:  -- that kind of everybody can share in?
L:  Right.  On Earth Day, like do they have anything organized for people to like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go out and clean up in their neighborhood and things like that, or not really?
R:  They did something in Central Park but I'm not exactly sure what they did.  I did -- I went to something in the botanical gardens which was a little after the fact.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it, um, they had like different information tables, and different planting societies, and things to answer questions and promote brightening your area, and showing you how to compost and things like that.
L:  Right.  Because I -- I would probably come up with some kind of day, like cleaning [LAUGH] that type of thing for -- for nature, because like even just today we went to a park in our neighborhood and i- -- it's -- there are a lot of geese there and things like that, and there's just so much junk that people throw into the water, and you know, now I have a small baby so I can't really, um, go and pick up the garbage 'cause I have to watch her, but before I had her, I would always go and pick up the litter around there when -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just when I was hanging out at the park during the day.  I just hate to see that.  You know, the a- -- the ducks and everything are living there, and there's all plastic bags and things in the water.
R:  Yeah, and it's dangerous to them and that's their home.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, people need to respect it.  They wouldn't throw it around in their own home.
L:  No, and people -- like -- like there are signs not to feed them, but people do anyway, like a -- a lady was feeding them bananas today, and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  --so I don't know, but I -- I guess it would be something like that.  It's ju- --I mean, it -- and it -- it's a nice neighborhood too where you would think that people don't do that, but they do it everywhere.  So, I don't know.  I can't really think of anything else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Any other [LAUGH] kind of a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- day that they don't already have, like -- I'm not sure.  Do you have any other ideas?
R:  [NOISE]  Um, I pretty much think it would wind up being something animal based --
L:  Animal.
R:  -- if I was working with it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or if I was the one planning it.  Um, 'cause we have all kinds of religious holidays and different --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- folk based holiday -- holidays from different cultures, which I guess are based on other religions, and we have things that are, um, just based on cultures themselves already. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, being in New York we get to celebrate a lot of holidays other places don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  'Cause we can both go celebrate St[?] [inaudible] in two days. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right.
R:  And around here, no one cares whether or not you're status[?], you can celebrate, but I'm sure, maybe people in Wisconsin don't get that same opportunity we do. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- we definitely do have --
R:  -- there's a parade like every week now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for some group or other and it's always kinda like, "Come on out, celebrate, learn!" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, you must like the Halloween parade that they have?
R:  Um, it's kinda fun. 
L:  Yeah, I -- it -- I mean, I've never been there but I've seen it on TV, and it --
R:  It --
L:  -- looks like they're --
R:  -- it's very casual.  It's kinda like, "If you want to join in, join in, this is where we start.  If you want to just watch from the sidelines, watch".
L:  The costumes are amazing though. 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's --
L:  You know, people go all out.
R:  Yeah, that's the fun part.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And no, I look forward to Halloween for my daughter, she's only eleven months old now, but um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I look forward to that, 'cause my Mom would always make our costumes from scratch and stuff, so I look forward to doing that kind of thing.
R:  See, I think that's what -- another reason I like that so much, 'cause we really didn't do a lot of straw bullet stuff.  We made a lot of things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, that was a family holiday to us.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's so much better when -- when you make the costume than when you buy it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, you just feel like more pride and stuff in wearing it.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just 'cause of so much went into -- to making it. 
R:  And it's truly yours.  It's not like, "Yeah, I'll take the mass produced Spiderman outfit".
L:  Right, and look like everyone else in the block, yeah.  It's true.  And we still have some of the costumes that we made.
R:  [LAUGH] So do I. [LAUGH]
L:  It's funny, 'cause we have pictures of like everyone in our family wearing it at some point when they were younger, just -- maybe my daughter will end up wearing the one that we -- 
R:  That would be a nice tradition. 
L:  Yeah.  Funny, I [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.  [PAUSE] Kind of not much more to say really. [LAUGH]
R:  And if there was nothing -- if -- if it had to be something more structured than that, I would do something silly, like, "Okay, fine, it's celebrate the Muppets Day.  Let's bring the Muppets back" and you know. 
L:  Right, right.
R:  Something like that, just something very wholesome, enjoy it, don't think about it too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just spend a day thinking happy thoughts kinda holiday. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and a -- uh, well so many holidays are so commercialized that, y- -- you know how when you go into the store and like it's five months before a holiday, and --
R:  [LAUGH] August twelfth and ho- -- and Christmas is up?
L:  Yeah, it's terrible.  It -- it's like some things get passed over, like Thanksgiving always gets passed over, you know?  'Cause the Halloween --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff is out, and then it's like it skips right to Christmas, and Thanksgiving -- I mean, I -- and I guess it's because people don't give gifts and things like that, so the stores don't really care too much about it, but [LAUGH] --
R:  But it's important 'cause that's the day you're supposed to just be with your family.
L:  Mhm.  I don't know!
R:  See, we do that.  We try and go to the parade together and eat together that day and stuff, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we'll put out flowers and you know, if there's friends around we'll say, "Hey.  Come on over for desert or to eat or -- you know, just come".
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's genuinely just about people being together, and being happy for that opportunity to be together, and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you see -- and somehow that -- that one gets the least attention.  [LAUGH] I don't know, very strange.  [PAUSE] In terms of these calls, th- -- they told me that I could only do three of them or something?
