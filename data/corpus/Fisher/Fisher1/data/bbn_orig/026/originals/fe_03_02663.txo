L:  Hi, this is Caroline.  I'm from, um, LA.
R:  Hi, I'm Diana.  I'm from New York. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is my first call. [LAUGH]
R:  Me too, I'm nervous. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] so I guess we're supposed to talk about holidays?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] We- well, I guess my birthday doesn't count? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It's just my holiday.
L:  Yeah.  So, what's your favorite holiday?
R:  Um, I think maybe Valentine's Day.  Is that considered a holiday?  Or is that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think I like Valentine's Day.  Or maybe Christmas.  What about you?
L:  I think Christmas.  I think I like Christmas because of the presents. [LAUGH]
R:  I was gonna say that, but then it's stressful because you have to figure out what type --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- of present you want to get people.  So, that could be stressful. [LAUGH]
L:  I, like -- I, like, um, make this -- I have a folder where I cut out stuff from magazines all year so that around Christmas time, I just whiz through all my clippings of cool stuff and then I'm not as  stressed out.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  Like, I just go through magazines and I'm, like, "Oh, that's a cute purse" or, like, "That's a cute sweater" and I just shove 'em in this folder and then, like, I have this folder that I look at, like, around September, October and I then I just start ordering stuff.
R:  For yourse- -- [MN] wait, for -- for -- for people?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How do you know that it's their -- their, you know, that it's to their liking?  That that's what they're gonna like?
L:  I just --
R:  I guess you know them?
L:  I just, like, a lot of times I get people what I want to get the- -- like, what I think they're gonna like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just, my stuff not -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't really ask them what they want because then they're, like, give you a list and I think it's really predictable.  So, I try to get them uni- gi- -- kinda unique gifts.
R:  Really?  Then -- then, uh, with my  family [LAUGH] you know, I ask them, "Come on, tell me what I can get you" --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and everybody says, "Nothing, I'm fine.  You don't have to get me anything" so that sucks. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's worst. [LAUGH] 'Cause it's like  if people give you lists [LAUGH] [inaudible] I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess [LAUGH] they're both bad, getting lists or -- or -- not knowing -- or them telling you n- not to get them anything at all.
L:  Right.  'Cause you're gonna get them something anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, Joe, stop. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you hear -- that's my stupid boyfriend. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] He says he wants a Christmas present. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I got a phone call from the study yesterday and my boyfriend was around, he's like, "Who the hell is that?" I was like, "Forget it, I won't do this right now".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He just thinks it's weird.  He's, like, "How are you gonna talk to them when you don't even know 'em?" I'm, like, "I don't know".
R:  [MN] I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Stop!  Get away.  I'm closing the door [NOISE] so ... he wanted to know where you live. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, in LA. [LAUGH]
R:  She's from LA.  Good bye. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He's so silly.  Yeah, that's -- that's who I spend my Valentine's holiday with ...  God. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so that's why you like Valentine's Day. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I guess so. [LAUGH] Is that considered -- that is a holiday, right? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, you know what I like, New Years.
L:  Oh, you like New Years?
R:  I think I like New Years better than Christmas.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause it's, like, a new year coming up and, you know, you have fun that night and there's Christmas -- Christmas time is over --
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause it could be stressful, like, dealing with family.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so ... Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's cool to get presents but if [LAUGH] you're all stressed out 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- everyone's together and getting on their nerv- -- each other's nerves or, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  M- maybe sometimes fighting. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Well, maybe that's just my family?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't really see my parents at Christmas.
R:  You don't?
L:  No, 'cause, like, I -- my parents are from Chicago and I'm in LA.  And, like, travelling during the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- holiday is so stressful for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I'd rather see them, like, in February after it's all over, you know?
R:  And they don't get upset?
L:  No.  I send them gifts and then, like --
R:  M- --
L:  -- I call them and stuff, but I -- they understand because I hate -- I hate going to the airport when there's, like, lines up, you know, outside and it's freezing.  I just don't like doing that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That -- that's the -- well, my -- my mom, she would lay such a guilt trip because she thinks people should be together for holidays.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, she gets mad at me if I'm late.  Let's say she wants me to come over for -- for, like, whatever, Mothers' Day or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Christmas or some holiday, she gets upset if I get there, like, maybe, like, at [MN] three, four, she thinks that's pretty late.  She expects me to be there [LAUGH] by noon or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think my mom would be very understanding --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I -- if I didn't fly in.
L:  Ah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well ...  You're from Chicago?
L:  Originally, yeah.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, a friend of mine is from Chicago too.
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Yeah, she always -- she, yeah, she always flies home for the holidays and that can get really expensive.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, she's -- she's a student, so, right now she -- she, like, doesn't really have much money and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, yeah, and, like, July fourth is coming up, well, that she doesn't have to go home for, but she tries.  She's very close to her family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so she feels the need to always be with them for the holidays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  So, if you could make up a holiday, what would you make up?
R:  Oh, that's right.  Um ...  [LAUGH] I don't know.  [LAUGH] Um, maybe, adopt an -- a pet holiday, I don't know. [LAUGH] I love --
L:  [LAUGH] Do you have a pet or something?
R:  Yeah, I have -- I have cats.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not going to tell you how many, 'cause you'll think I'm a freak. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my gosh, how many?  You've gotta tell me now.
R:  Ah, well, I have a three bedroom apartment.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have five cats.
L:  Whoa.
R:  Yeah.  So, and -- and I always -- whenever I see -- it's rare to see a stray, but once in a while when I see a stray, I just think, "Oh God" you know, like, maybe bring them home to somebody to -- for somebody to adopt, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, maybe ... see, that would be my holiday.  Adopt a stray, [LAUGH] adopt a stray holiday.
L:  Oh, I think that's a good holiday.
R:  [LAUGH] What would you want?  What holiday would you make up?
L:  Well, I kinda already make one up every, um, Sunday.  Like, me and my boyfriend celebrate Caroline Day.  And it's a day dedicated to just me.
R:  Aw.
L:  So, I get to pick [LAUGH] -- I get to pick what we do and, like, some days, like, I'll just say, "This Caroline Day is free day" which means we don't, you know, whatever.  Do what you want to do, watch football, watch basketball.
R:  Aw.
L:  But, um, we go to the park 'cause he works and I work, so, like, we don't see each other a lot during the week except, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we --
R:  Aw.
L:  -- just try to spend one day a week going to do something outside 'cause, you know, California has such great weather that we can always do it out -- outside.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's so sweet.  So -- so, you do that every week?
L:  Yep, on Sundays.
R:  Oh, wow.  God, Sunday is his day -- my boyfriend's day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He -- he goes softball every Sunday.  So, that's, like, his day with his friends.  So, we have --
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  You have Caroline holiday, I get to be alone. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I should -- I'm gonna tell him about that holiday that way [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, like, I pay for it --
R:  We're gonna try --
L:  -- 'cause, like, during the week his, um, best friend, he comes over for dinner all the time. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I told him, like, since he's over hanging out with us all the time, like, on the weekend I don't want to see him, You know?
R:  Yeah.  Aw. [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] this is a pay off.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, he's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, he -- I think if -- if he were to think of a holiday it would be, like, you know, a friend day.  But friend [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, friend --
R:  -- he's got that holiday every week.  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [MN] twice a week, so that's his holiday, Friend Day.
L:  Oh.  So, how -- how old are you?
R:  Oh, God.  I'm gonna be thirty in June.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] You sound young.
L:  Happy early birthday.
R:  Thank --
L:  I'm not that young, I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh, yeah, you sound younger. [NOISE] You sound like twenty two or something.
L:  I still try to use my student ID at the movies. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Does it work?
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  Mine --
L:  -- my student ID doesn't have an expiration so it works.
R:  Oh, it doesn't?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  'Cause mine -- mine did.  Mine had an expiration so can't really use it anymore 'cause it's got that big sticker thing, you know, fall nineteen ninety eight, or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Ours just says -- ours just has our name and our social and our picture, that's it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's good.  That's good.  That way you can even say you're still a college student.  [LAUGH] Well, you --
L:  I know, my boyfriend's like, "You're not gonna be able to get away with that very long" so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm, like, "Whatever" as long as I can still get away with it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like, "Shut up, let's go do Caroline holiday now". [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
L:  So, where'd you hear about -- where did you hear about this thing?
R:  Um, I was, um, the Village Voice.  It's a -- it's a local paper.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, it's -- it's a free paper now and it's, like, a huge paper --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, and it's, um, there's like, um, ads in there for everything.  And I just happened --

L:  Cool.
R:  You know?  Yeah, that's how I heard about it.  How did you hear about it?
L:  Email.
R:  Oh, really?  They just emailed you?
L:  I got an email.  Yeah --

L:  -- and then I sent it to all my friends.  They're, like, "Is this some kind of scam?"  I'm, like, "I don't know, dude.  But I'm gonna do it" and they're like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Okay, I'm gonna do it".
R:  Yeah, I was a little nervous at first.  But I'm, like, okay, you know, they're asking all this information but then I figured if -- if --
