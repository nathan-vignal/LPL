L:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name's Lisa.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, my name is Karen.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, hi Karen, how are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  All right.  And the topic I- is, ah ?
R:  Holidays.
L:  Holidays.  Okay.  My favorite holiday, um, is Halloween.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mine is Christmas.
L:  Oh, Christmas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And why is it Christmas?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, it's Christmas because all the light -- I love the whole season.  It's nice and cold up here in New England, and [SIGH] the lights make it beautiful and, um, [SIGH] you know, the kids are always so happy and running around and [SIGH] all the presents on Christmas morning.
L:  [LAUGH]  It doesn't scare you?  [SIGH]  So, you live in New Yo- -- New England?  That's pretty cool --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm out in New York.  I used to live in Ohio but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I don't like Christmas too much.  Ohio was pretty bad.  Ah, [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I definitely like fall because, since I was from the Midwest originally got a lot of like foliage, [SIGH] and I love the leaves just falling and like, it's called change because it's almost like drastic.  Like you see 'em green one month and the next they're like all these different colors and [SIGH] 
R:  Definitely we have that here.
L:  I love running around in costumes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's fun and everybody gets candy so you -- you get a -- have candy for at least like a whole year if you get [SIGH] the right neighborhood.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  The same idea with the kids running around and everything.
R:  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Definitely.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Definitely.  I love fall, um, but --
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.
R:  -- we get the leaf changes up here and it's always so nice and clear as crystal.
L:  I just went to New England for the first time, actually, um, [NOISE] ah -- like three, four months ago.  Like somewhere, like after Christmas I went up to Maine and it was like -- the [SIGH] one of the prettiest places I've ever been to --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- I really like Maine a whole bunch.  It's like my favorite state.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One of my favorite states, now.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Halloween's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinda tricky here because we get --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- um, it gets real cold right about -- just before that happens unfortunately.  [SIGH]  So, you get the cute costumes but the kids --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- are bundled up to their noses.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so it does get pretty cold -- like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- during Hallow- oh, man that sucks.  Yeah, it's kind of cold some years like [SIGH] some years it gets really cold, other years it'd be like really hot and other years it'll just be like fall weather, you know --
R:  Yeah, some years it's [SIGH] --
L:  -- what you'd expect.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, so you know it depends on how El Nino and  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess if I could create a holiday [SIGH] it would be some time in -- at the end of September, first of October.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we need a holiday then.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Something to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, something to do with the foliage and [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and just like, you know, the relaxing and settling and sort of stuff.
L:  I fell like I have a bias of view on holidays because since I'm not a mother I can't really say anything like, "Oh, I don't like Mothers' Day".  Like how do I know?
R:  Oh, don't feel bad.
L:  I might like Mothers' Day, I just don't know because I don't have kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know.  It's kind of like a biased survey [LAUGH] with a wiper[?]
R:  I'm the same way.  We don't have kids either, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so it's kinda -- it's like, "Oh!"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's cool.  Did you find out about this on line?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, cool, me too.  Somebody like put a post on a [SIGH] a [SIGH] [inaudible] thing and you get paid, like ten bucks or something?
R:  [NOISE]  Something like that, yeah.
L:  Oh, cool whatever.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's right.  [SIGH]  Are we supposed to be talking about something else other than this?
R:  Probably the holidays I think.  I'm trying to think what else we could talk about with it.  Um.
L:  The holidays.
R:  What's your second favorite?
L:  Second favorite?  [SIGH]  Mhm.  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, I don't really  like any other holida- -- [LAUGH] no, Fourth of July.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yes, Fourth of July.  Definitely.  [MN]  Or St Patrick's, it depends.  I didn't celebrate it this year but [SIGH] -- so I can't say it's my favorite.  But like I used to do a lot of St Patrick's when I lived in Ohio, but not so much now I'm older.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I did say Fourth of July because I've gone -- I've done cool stuff and I've seen tons of firework shows.  So, [SIGH] yeah, Fourth of July would be my second.
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to think what mine would be.  [SIGH]  Um  jeez, this is a tough one.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yeah, as you just tell I like warm weather, I don't like the cold.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  See, I'm the opposite.  I don't do the heat --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- or crowds so Fourth of July is kinda o- out, although we can [SIGH] see the fireworks and stuff from our house, so that's pretty cool.
L:  Oh, really?  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I went to Myrtle Beach, ah, [SIGH] last summer for Fourth of July and that's pretty cool 'cause everybody on the beach from like [SIGH] the second the sun starts setting, and like -- till like five in the morning we'll be setting off fireworks, all along the beach.
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  So, you just walk down and you'll see fireworks going off like [SIGH] -- it -- it gets kind- kinda disgusting because the cloud get so -- or the sky gets so smokey.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you can't even like see, so it's like, "Oh!"  [SIGH]  And then it gets really obnoxious too 'cause you want to sleep.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  Uh-hum, they're still shooting them off.  [SIGH]  How old are you bu- -- do you mind telling me or is it conf- --
R:  Oh, not at all, thirty two.
L:  Oh, that's cool I'm twen-  I'm eight- -- ah, twent-  [LAUGH]  I'm nineteen.  [SIGH] Ah, I got my ages mixed up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I just got a fake ID so  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  I've been having to use it as twenty three in the city.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, is that supposed to be part of the survey or what?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Ah 
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Actually, I think that's all legal.
R:  I can't think what else we could say about holidays.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] [SIGH] I guess if I had to pick a second one I'd almost say New Year's Eve because it's so close to --
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I didn't even think about New Year's.
R:  -- you know, Christmas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you get like -- two -- two days off back to back --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  -- and all that stuff.  And --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] um [LIPSMACK] yeah, I'd say --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'd have to say New Year's.
L:  [SIGH] I wonder how many people say Martin Luther King Day?  [SIGH]
R:  Probably none.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's what I was probably thinking.  [SIGH]  Or President's Day, "Yeah, President's Day is my favorite holiday".  [SIGH]
R:  It was when I was a kid 'cause you got  a -- a -- 
L:  It's [SIGH] cool --
R:  -- week off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, tha -- that's why I like Martin Luther King Day, you get school [LAUGH] off too.  It's like ye- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it turns into like a three day weekend or something.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Other than that, no.  That's cool, I -- I've never done this -- just so I -- I don't really do know exactly what they want me to say other than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, the holidays, so   [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, same problem here.
L:  Um, no, do you usually go like all out on Christmas or --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- do you just kind of like put up  like a Christmas tree and that's it?
R:  [SIGH]  A little -- well, [SIGH] because I'm older and having to put the tree up and take the thing down again, it -- it's not quite as much as I used to.  [SIGH]  Um, we usually do lights out front and on the bushes and, um, [LIPSMACK] usually that's about it.  I enjoy lo- looking at the lights on the way home from work and stuff like that.  [SIGH]  Um, and we -- ah, unfortunately we have this tree that's like -- half our -- takes up half our living room.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, we [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- we wind up, ah, kind of moving everything and walking very carefully by this hu- -- enormous tree [SIGH] for about a month.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, we may actually have to look into getting a [LAUGH] sm- smaller one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, [SIGH] I -- I've seen like really huge Christmas trees and one friend had like a fifteen foot one and it was like, "Oh, my God".  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they have real- -- this is in Myrtle Beach too and so they have like a really nice big house there [SIGH] and that.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I usually --
R:  It's great if you have a big house.  Unfortunately, we don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ne- -- I live in -- I share a house -- so [LAUGH] you know, definitely don't have a whole bunch of room.  [SIGH]  No, I usually don't go out -- all out on Christmas m- -- as much as I do for Halloween.  [SIGH] Like [SIGH] I'd wear -- I wear the colors, you know, like I'll wear lots of like oranges --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably, and blacks.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  More so I always wear black all the time but oranges I -- I usually wear a lot around  [NOISE] um, [NOISE] Halloween and [SIGH] when I -- I actually did have a house of my own in Amityville --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, during Halloween and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually, I bought a whole lot of Halloween stuff to decorate the house with.  We actually had fibre optic pumpkins and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Wow, we've never done much.
L:  So, -- yeah, you know what you should do?  You should get a fibre optic Christmas tree.  [LIPSMACK]  Have you seen those things?  They're like 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're actually  really expensive but I mean they're so nice and [SIGH] if you like -- like --
R:  And you don't have to string the lights.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  You don't -- they're already there and all- -- it's already done for you.
R:  Over the eight[?] foot tree.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  [NOISE]
L:  And it changes colors too and it looks really -- like I've known a couple of people who've owned them and they just look so beautiful.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, like my one friend's mom, she had a smaller one it was only  probably like five feet or -- no, probably, even smaller like four and a half.  [SIGH]  And she didn't have no lights, nothing on it, you know.  And the only thing she had was on the top like this really nice, like paper mache angel [SIGH] she got from like, Cracker Barrel, or something.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  It look- -- it looked really cute together, you know, because it had little lights on its hands too that were fibre optic.  [SIGH]  Like it was holding candles but the candles were like fibre optic.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That would be cool.
L:  It sort of kind of accented the tree and everything.  [NOISE]
R:  I know.  It amazes me how m- more houses didn't burn down in the old days when they had the [SIGH] real candles on trees.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know -- you would think, like  oh, you never -- I guess they don't talk about that nowadays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause what's the point?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, but I know, it's -- I --
L:  Like why would we give a shit if somebody else's house burned down nowadays, you know, and [inaudible] --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- that stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I really wouldn't look -- make me wonder like how many houses burned down just for the sake of, like a holiday?
R:  I know it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's awful.
L:  Yeah, maybe we should have -- ban holidays in general?  [LAUGH]  They cause fire hazards.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, usually mostly when --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people are stupid and put things like -- you know, put five extension cords going to the tree and --
L:  Yeah, and pu- -- you know what?  Holidays promote drinking too.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  And most holidays consist of drinking alcohol.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like everybody drinks on Christmas, New Year's.  [SIGH]  I know a lot of people have Hal- -- like Halloween parties in college  so,  I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, Halloween -- when I was in college Halloween parties were a big thing too.
L:  Yeah.  Like everybody got up -- dressed up and like tried to kiss the girl.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  You know, like --
R:  -- unreal.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, man.  [LAUGH]  I --
R:  Those were --
L:  -- didn't go to any Halloween parties but I heard about stories and think, "Yay, that sounds fun".  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I remember.  Oh, those were unbelievable.  That was like the one holiday -- and everybody was just settled back into school and [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- oh, my!
L:  And St Patrick's -- yeah, a lot of drinking on holidays.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  It's like, you know -- I bet Mothers' Day people don't get too drunk.
R:  [SIGH]  I wouldn't think so.
L:  Hey, is the Superbowl consid- considered a holiday?
R:  I don't think so.  It should be though.
L:  'Cause like a lot of people just like mark that on their calendar, like it's a day they're going to have a party and stuff.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you know, they really do.
L:  At least in the US.  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely, and they, um --
L:  Hey, have you talked to -- have you -- is this like your first time doing this, or ?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, an initiate[?], okay, me too.  I was going to say did you [SIGH] -- do you know if you talk to anybody in other countries that might, like, know English, or ?
R:  I don't know.  I don't think so.
L:  'Cause they ask like what languages you speak fluently.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Like as a secondary language and it's like Spanish, but I was thinkin --
