L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  This is Clovis.
L:  What -- what's your name?
R:  Clovis.
L:  Oh, Clovis?  My name is Raphael.
R:  Hi, Raphael.
L:  How are ya?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess we have to talk about creating a holiday. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that, and which is our favorite holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I would say my favorite holiday is Christmas.
L:  Yeah, mine is too.
R:  It's -- it's a runner up Christmas and Easter, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm trying to see what would I do, I mean, what holiday would I create?  Um [PAUSE] ...
L:  Maybe a holiday where you have to buy presents. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And spend money. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  Seems like every Christmas I just have to save up for that, that one day, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I know and -- and -- and -- and it doesn't last but one day.  I mean, I -- I think it should last more than one day because every day is Christmas, I mean, every day should be Christmas, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I guess the holiday that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I would create would be, um, oh my gosh, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's kinda a tough one because, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know, I know.  I -- I think the holiday that I w- -- I would like to create is to -- where everyone would put aside, um, I mean, where -- if -- if there's a need just fill it.  You know, where money doesn't -- money is not an object.  You know, if -- if you're in need of a home then, you know, a millionaire that has the money, you know, give that person a home or, you know, a -- a -- a day where -- d- that's a good thing, when you were saying it's for is money.  A day where money does not exchange --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it -- it's just a day of giving.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I think I would like that day as, you know, where there is a -- like somebody is able to fill that void.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, if I would, uh, I would say if I ever have a ho- -- create a holiday would be, I don't know, where -- a day where I guess everyone would put their, uh, differences aside, you know?  Or just, like, you know, a certain holiday just for certain religions or races, you know?
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Where everybody has their own little time and, uh, place on th- -- you know, on the year when they celebrate their own, you know, either religious or, you know, race or something like that.  They should just come up with, I don't know, I guess a day where I just -- where everybody can celebrate, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.  That would be so nice.
L:  Yeah, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, Muslims have it on a certain day where they, you know, celebrate or, I don't know, I guess there's like a week or something where they fast and stu- -- and Jewish people have a certain time around December and, you know, Yom Kippur and other days, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH] Um, well, I mean, that I -- I -- I think that would be really nice. [NOISE] [LAUGH].  Um, I'm trying to remem- uh, that was -- this is tough. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Is this the first one or ... ?
R:  Uh, this is my second one.
L:  Yeah.  I know, the first one was easier. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  What was your first one?
L:  [SIGH] It was about food. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  If I preferred, you know, take home or, uh, or dining out, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  And what kind of food I liked. [LAUGH]
R: Oh, that -- yes, that was easy.  My -- my first was, you know, a season, uh, [MN] you know, does -- do people get cold at certain seasons and, you know, or is it an everyday thing? 
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know wha- I --I guess I really didn't really think about [PAUSE] I -- I mean -- I -- I really don't think about, you know, w- -- if I had a holiday what, you know, what holiday would I create?
L:  Yeah.  That's kinda a toughie. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, well, let's see ... um, oh goodness.  Uh, a holiday where [SIGH] [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I  have no -- I mean, that's the only thing.  Like I said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before, that's -- that's about the only thing that I could even think of.  You know, holiday where tha- -- and basically, like you said, that all differences are just put aside.  You know, holiday where you just enjoy each other.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, just relax, don't think about, you know, I -- you know, I have to get to work and -- and make this extra, you know, million dollars, you know, junk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Relax, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Make it a paid holiday too. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH] I know.  Where you just sit --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- home and you just relax.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, that's a good holiday.  That everything just shut down.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, where you don't worry about making that big business deal --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, you know, or -- or doing anything, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- relax.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just w- --
L:  Na- --
R:  Ge- --
L:  National Relaxation Day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes!  That's a good one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  National Relaxation Day. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, put away your cellphone and computers, you know?
R:  [MN] I mean, because you really need a day like that because even in the European nation, where you -- even in Spain where you have a- -- or -- or Italy, where, you know, there's a certain time that they just shut down shop.  And they just relax.
L:  Yeah.  I know there's many, um, Latin countries that do it too, like I guess, they call it a siesta.  Where they, uh, during lunchtime, I guess they take like, two or three hours --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, just to go home and relax and they just come back and finish up their hours. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know, and it's more productive because you're letting -- you're allowing those people to detox, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Not like here, it's just, like, work, work, work and, you know, you can't leave till you do -- finish your project or till you finish your work and ...
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  And you leave all exhausted and you go home, like, uh, you don't wanna do nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh gosh.  Um, so how many m- -- how many minutes have we talked? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ... ah, quite a few, actually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And --
R:  Oh my --
L:  -- time flies, you know, when you're just talking and, you know.
R:  [MN] I know, but [MN] I -- I -- I guess you're, you know, I -- I guess I'm, you know, conscious+ of the time especially when I don't really, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have an idea. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so, I guess we both agree then, a National Relaxation Day? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, definitely neat. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, so, [MN] we should write a letter to President Bush, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sign it into Congress.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Make it a paid holiday too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nobody has to work.
R:  [MN] I wonder what -- I mean, you know, I -- I know we're, you know, thinking of this but, I wonder will that thing fly if I actually did that? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  Um ...
L:  Where -- where are you at?  Where are you located at?
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where are you, Florida?
L:  California.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm at the other end. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, that -- that means yours is, what, about three o'clock?
L:  Uh, yes.  About three twenty, around three fifteen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What, are you guys, like, six, over there?
R:  Uh, ye- -- about six eighteen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I know.  I mean, that's -- that's the only thing when, you know, they have the major league and the national league playing in California.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- we're, you know, we're waiting eleven o'clock, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] And, uh, that's what, uh, watching some basketball game when one game doesn't start to , like, eight o'clock and I'm, like, thinking, "Wow, East Coast that's like, eleven o'clock out there". [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  You have to be a real die hard fan just to stay up that ni- -- late, you know, and watch the game, you know?
R:  [NOISE] W- -- was that the beep to say it's over?
L:  No, actually that's like a, um -- um, there's like a computer that comes on and it tells you, you know, you have, like, thirty seconds to, uh, to say goodbye or something like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- didn't you get a le- -- didn't they tell you that that first time or no?
R:  Um ...
L:  I think we have, like, maybe, like, maybe a minute or so left.
R:  [PAUSE] So, that's what we're putting in writing?  National Relaxation Day.
L:  Yeah.  Let's -- let's write up a p- pi- pa- petition for that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, um, who -- who's playing tonight in California or -- or there's no game scheduled there for --
L:  For baseball or ...?
R:  Right, for baseball.
L:  Uh, I don't know where the Dodgers are playing.  And, uh, Angels.  They should be playing, uh, we're playing at home.
R:  Uh, [MN] s- s- since -- I was wondering, since -- since, oh, I -- I know we're back to yellow but when we went to orange, was it very difficult to get autographs when you went to the game?
L:  For what?
R:  You know, for baseball -- the baseball games.  Was it very difficult b- when -- when the -- the, uh, the country went into orange code?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay, it was the same?
L:  Yeah, pretty much the same.  They just checked your bags a little bit more but, you know, nothing -- nothing too major, you know?  They won't let you bring in, you know, like, bags and stuff, it had to -- had to be little bags.
