R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Joe.
R:  Ah, my name is John.  [NOISE]  What's up boss?  [NOISE]
L:  Hey, what's up?  Do you have a favorite holiday or what?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  All of them are my favorite holiday.  [NOISE]
L:  What is?
R:  Yeah -- yeah, all holidays are my favorite holidays.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, because you take off, right?
R:  [NOISE].  Yes.
L:  You have the day off.
R:  [NOISE]  No, it's just --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you get to my age holidays are just holidays 'cause those are the days you get off from work on pay, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  Well, yeah that's -- well, that's the only reason I -- I think they should exist really.  I -- I don't really have any, ah, [SIGH] I don't really celebrate them in any way.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I mean there's like Thanksgiving and -- Thanksgiving's all right.  I guess.
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't know -- I like the food but it's -- it's all an abstract idea.  I mean I -- I don't really [SIGH] you know, I -- I don't really sit down and become thankful all -- all of a sudden.  Or -- or I don't celebrate Christmas with the idea of religion in mind or anything.  So,  [SIGH]  I don't know.
R:  See that's -- that's what it is.  See like those holidays that was there when we was -- how old are you?
L:  Ah, twenty four.
R:  Oh, see yeah -- yeah, I'm forty two.  Right.  Wh- when I was younger, man, you know and it's -- it's like the gen -- and like constant changes.  [SIGH]  It's like [COUGH] we've come -- we've -- we steer away from what the holidays are really there for.  [SIGH]  Like --
L:  Oh, yeah -- it's all -- it's all commercial now.  It's all about 
R:  Yeah.  Except for like the Fourth of July  you know.
L:  No -- well, that -- that's cool, I guess, but I'm not -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm feeling really anti American these days, just --
R:  [NOISE]  Yep.
L:  -- just because I -- I don't like what the -- what the Bush administration is doing, so I -- I'm not feeling too patriotic.  [SIGH]  Um 
R:  I see.  That's why you can't let that get you like that either.  [SIGH]  See then you've got to take it back to, what -- you know you've got to represent you for you.  [SIGH]  You know what I mean?
L:  Right, exactly, that's what I mean.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I'm saying like a nation, or whatever, is an abstract idea and I -- I just don't -- I don't feel like following my country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when my government like do whatever it does.
R:  Right.
L:  So, 
R:  And -- and you know what, man?  It's the -- if half the people in this country --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- knew what the country's done to us as the people.  [SIGH]  And past experimented on towns and stuff like that, without our knowledge -- their knowledge -- you know what I mean?  [SIGH]  They've got a lot --
L:  Oh, yeah, they -- they hide everything from us.  They don't -- yeah, they don't tell us shit about what they're doing.  Like [SIGH] they've got all of these, ah, all of these, ah, plans right now to like  you know, cut back on social security.  And like, you know, we don't even have health care in this country.  And -- ev- every- -- everything that they're doing [NOISE] is -- is, you know, it -- it's to serve the rich people with -- with tax breaks.  [SIGH]  And, you know, everybody else just gets screwed, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, everybody's getting laid off and -- [SIGH] and people are losing their jobs and yet we're spending like a million a minute on the military.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're spending that much money on the military and we're not -- we're not able to afford like -- to -- to take care of sick people.  We can't afford to, like, educate young people.  [SIGH]  You know, people are dropping out of college 'cause they can't afford to stay in any more.  And like [SIGH] you know, this is what all the taxes are going to -- it's -- it's all the army  and the military.  [SIGH]  And then they like --
R:  Right.  Yeah, and --
L:  -- they draw up the American flag and we're supposed to be, ah, you know, we're supposed to be proud of our country when it's not even taking care of us, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And they -- and the -- and then the thing about it they -- they're not even paying the military that much money.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, the people in the military?  Yeah, but they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they do get things.  Like they do get, ah  they do get ins- -- they're -- they're really well insured for one thing, though.  So, that's --
R:  Yeah, and the houses and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  So, they -- they're taken care of.  [SIGH]  But, speaking of holidays -- I think I -- I think New Year's is probably my favorite one, now that I think about it.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, because you're celebrating living another year [SIGH] -- surviving.
L:  Because every -- everybody gets drunk on New Year's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody has a good time on New Year's.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody stays home and everybody has a good time, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.  Everybody stays home because of New York.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  They go right to Times Square.
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I -- I actually went to Times Square with, ah, my girlfriend and, ah, when it turned Two Thousand.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we thought that the Y Two K thing was going to happen.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  Ah, but we went anyway.  [NOISE]  We -- it was pretty cool.  We like snuck in right into the middle.  [NOISE]  Like we followed these journalists right into the middle of Times Square --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] then because you had to stay there -- you had to be in line, or you know, like for -- for like a whole day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people were camping out there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get into the  little pig pens.
R:  Yeah, it's true.
L:  But 
R:  And the hotel rates go up.
L:  [NOISE]  Say again?
R:  The hotel rates go up for that day.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I had to --
R:  That makes big money.
L:  It was like a hundred and eighty dollars for that night.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  Right around there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you from New York?
L:  Say again?
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, I live in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, yeah, I -- I live in New York.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, New York that's where I'm from.
R:  Oh, yeah, what part?
L:  Ah, Ridgewood, Queens.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm originally from Shirley.  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, Shirley, yeah.  I -- I know Shirley.  I've been around there.  There's a  lot of Italians there, too.
R:  Ah --
L:  I don't know, maybe not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But the last time I went, ah, my parents were looking for houses there and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they wanted to live there 'cause they're -- I don't know, they -- they thought there were a lot of Italians there -- or -- or they know a lot of Italians who live there.  I don't know?
R:  Wow, ah --
L:  But even on Long Island it -- it's hard to live there now.  Isn't it a 
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's high, man.  It's high.  [SIGH]  A lot of people are moving to Harlem, man.
L:  Yeah, no kidding?  I mean on Long Island even like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even families with like two incomes are renting out their basements to people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty ridiculous, I mean it -- it's -- it's just like the cost of living is really  you know, it's -- it's just -- it's -- I don't know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's impossible to live there.  [SIGH]
R:  So, if you could make a holiday what holiday would -- would you -- what kind of holiday would you make up?
L:  Um [PAUSE] I haven't really thought about that one yet.  I don't know.  It'll probably hit me later in the day, when I'm walking around like, "Oh, yeah, I know". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, not I -- I can't think of anything right now.  I don't know, what would you make up?
R:  I don't know.  National Peace Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  National Peace Day.
R:  Yeah.  I -- no matter what -- how mad you was with somebody [SIGH] you can't be showing your madness.  [SIGH]  And you know what -- you're lucky, you're looking at getting National Peace Day, man.  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  But you went to the war.  [LAUGH]  And then by tomorrow you won't be mad at 'em no more.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, ah, hm, there should be a holiday something along those lines.  I think it's more like [SIGH] -- I think that Thanksgiving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is kind of like that though, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where you get together with your family and  you become -- you know, it's like you're thankful, or [NOISE] -- I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  There should be, um  I think September Eleventh should become Media Blackout Day.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  Where you don't pay attention -- you don't pay att- -- you don't -- you don't read the newspaper that day.  You don't watch TV.  [NOISE]  You don't listen to the radio.  Nothing.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Like you just [NOISE] -- you don't listen to the media whatsoever.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's a good day.  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  [NOISE]  I -- that's what -- that's what should happen on September Eleven from now on because I'm so sick of it [NOISE] -- it's like you turn on the T- -- I mean that day was just -- that day really sucked, I mean that -- that was a scary day, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And -- and for them to just keep repeating it, and repeating it, and repeating it, it just doesn't -- you know?  It's -- it's -- it's like they're just trying to scare the shit out of you.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And, ah, I don't -- I don't like, you know, I don't like it being like this other  thing on the news anymore.  [NOISE].  And -- and I don't like it because like the more they talk about it, the more insignificant it seems.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  You know, [NOISE] what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [NOISE] on that day I think we should all [NOISE] stop.  [SIGH]  We -- we should not watch any television or anything like that.  Just Media [NOISE] Blackout Day that's all it should be.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  [NOISE]  Just not listen to the bullshit.  [SIGH]  I don't know.  Other than that [NOISE] I don't really have any, ah, hm, any other [NOISE] type of holidays in mind.  Um  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  National Sports Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  National Sports Day?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a Superbowl for that, though.
R:  Yeah.  Superbowl and [SIGH] -- there's [inaudible] --
L:  [inaudible]. 
R:  All the championships, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's Olympics that's what it is.  Every four years the Olympics.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE].  I think there should be, ah, I think there should be a day when we trade, ah, where we trade days with somebody else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.  [NOISE]  There -- there -- there could be something fun like that.  [NOISE]  I -- I -- I don't know if we really have it in us [NOISE] to have anymore holidays, though, you know?
R:  Um, what's the word --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You said trade days -- we can [SIGH] trade, um, [LIPSMACK] nationalities with somebody else?  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Trade nationalities?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like what?  You move into their neighborhoods and then they -- and then --
R:  That's --
L:  -- that -- that will just happen [NOISE] for like the whole day or something, where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you go to their job.  They go to yours?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, some -- something like that.  In your neighborhood, or [SIGH] live like they live on a regular day.  [SIGH] You know?
L:  Hm.
R:  So, you know, it'd be -- it'd -- it'd -- you know, it'd be fun if it turned out, you know?
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  So, how long have you been in Los Angeles?
L:  Ah, three months.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  You like it there?
L:  It's actually -- it's -- it's really bad, actually.  It's -- I -- I knew it was going [NOISE] to be bad.  I came here to [NOISE]  write for TV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  To get into the [NOISE] television industry and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it -- it's -- it's -- ah, it's -- it's really -- the only [NOISE] -- the only people who are enjoying Los Angeles are the rich people.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And they live out in the suburbs in their big houses, but the city itself is like -- it -- it's just like -- it's -- it's bad.  It's dirty and it's shitty and it's run down.  And it's --
R:  It's worse that Shirley?  I mean -- um, New York?
L:  Ah, no, [NOISE] actually New York has a lot of great places in it though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, a lot of great communities.  A lot of great -- I mean even something like Queens or parts of Brooklyn is really nice, because you get that old architecture.  [SIGH]  I don't think people -- you know, people who live there take it for granted but here it's just like [NOISE] -- flat stucco [NOISE]  houses and it -- it just looks real run down.
R:  Wow.
L:  It -- it -- there's not like -- and you need a car to get around too.  There's no, like, real subway here.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  So, -- yeah, everybody's in their cars.  Like when you walk around New York [NOISE] you see people on the streets.  [NOISE]  You --
