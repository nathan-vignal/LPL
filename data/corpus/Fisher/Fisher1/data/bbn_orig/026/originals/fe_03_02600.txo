L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.  My name is Sandy.
L:  I'm Ashleigh.
R:  Hi, Ashleigh.
L:  Hi.
R:  We're --
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  It's very nice to talk to you.  So, we're supposed to talk about Iraq?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what should we start about?
L:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, the list is long.
L:  What a topic.
R:  I know.
L:  Um, uh, disarming Iraq.  Well, gee, you know, to be honest, I really don't know both sides of th- -- of this argument.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, you know, that -- uh, what disarming will do versus what it won't do.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you have a, uh, an opinion on that?
R:  Well, I -- I think that, um, that they're -- I think they're a dangerous country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think the people are dangerous, I think the leader was dangerous.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that arms in -- in responsible countries is a good thing, but I don't think he was responsible --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with, uh, using -- you know, a lot of country have -- you have to have some type of weapons program for defense.
L:  Right.
R:  Just -- just for practical defense, but I don't think he was using his weapons for the good --
L:  Right, and not --
R:  -- of anybody.
L:  And not being up front about what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he had.
R:  I think he was just -- I think he was just really keeping the weapons to, um, gain control and to use it as blackmail.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Really for the rest of the world, and that's -- that's just not good.  So, I'm glad they -- that they did that, but now they're showing -- now you're seeing a lot of the weapons of mass destruction coming up and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the chemical weapons, so it just goes to show they can lie through the whole thing. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's, you know -- I mean, disarming Iraq would be -- would be a great thing to do since -- since they were supposed to be up front with the UN about what they had anyway.
R:  But they weren't.
L:  And they weren't.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, it -- it's kind of a tough one.
R:  If so many people were against it also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- against disarming him, and then now when they found out that, you know -- now -- now that -- that you're hearing more and more about how -- what they're finding, you're -- you don't [NOISE] see too many protesters.
L:  Right.  No, um, I guess it's -- it's kinda tough.  I -- I have always had problems with thinking of a -- of the US as being a policing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, kind of, um --
R:  Right, right. [NOISE]
L:  -- parenting nation to the rest of the world which I don't think is healthy, um, in all venues, but when it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- comes to weapons of mass destruction --
R:  But I think as a -- as a super power we have a responsibility --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to keep -- to not be like -- not really to be the big brother or to be the police, but to keep dictators like this under control --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and understand that other countries also need their weapons program for their defense but -- but to keep -- keep someone like this from -- from becoming another Hitler.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  He was scary.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, really awful.
R:  And now that you're seeing what he has and that there was connections with him and Al Qaeda and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's scary what he -- what he was doing while we were, you know, running around being happy and --
L:  A- and --
R:  -- thinking nothing of what's going on, he was doing all this stuff in the background, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think --
L:  Well, you know, and the fact that we also, I guess, supplied, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a lot of these, um, [LAUGH] weapons.
R:  Right, without realizing it.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and now, you know, we wanna try and take 'em back and, um, I just --
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a tough topic.
L:  It is a tough topic.  Y-
R:  Because you know what it is?  Our country doesn't tell us everything either.
L:  No.
R:  We don't know everything, so a lot of it is a secret.
L:  It's so true.  And, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've talked to people who served in Desert Storm and, um, and other people who -- who follow this stuff very closely, um, over the years and -- and know about what's going on.  They still don't even really know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Even the people who are kind of in that knowledge circle and -- and have this other information at their -- at their fingertips, [SIGH] uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they don't -- they have their opinion on it, but we're not gi- -- well, you know, the general public at large is certainly not given enough information.
R:  Right.  I don't think so.  But I -- I also think that they can't really give us a lot of information.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There -- there -- there's only so much they can really give us.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  But I feel -- I actually feel safer knowing that they did -- they did disarm that country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do feel a little better because I think that he did supply, um, a lot of these terrorist organizations with weapons, if he hasn't already, [NOISE] with weapons of mass destruction, with chemical weapons.  I'm sure he has already.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I guess the whole thing is to track them down and try to get the -- the weapons from them, but I think I know -- I just feel a lot -- I feel a lot better that they did go in there.  I -- I feel terrible that so many people died because of it but, um, I just -- I just -- just -- do you feel a little safer?
L:  [LIPSMACK] --
R:  I just feel a little bit better that they took care of this.
L:  You do?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not sure.  I -- I'm not sure it's changed for me.  I think --
R:  I mean, I think there's gonna be a little backlash.
L:  Yeah, I believe so.  I don't believe that this is going to be -- I don't -- I don't feel like for me personally that I'm gonna feel safer about this whole thing for a while.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, I live in New York, so we had to deal with the September eleventh issue.
L:  Oh.  Do you live in the city?
R:  I live out on -- on -- on the island.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  So, my husband works in the city.
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  So, that was a devastating day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, to -- to see that they finally -- and -- and what's -- what's upset -- what's actually upsetting for me is it took them so long to do what they had to do.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Well, you know, then there's also the debate of -- of whether or not it's disarming Iraq versus, you know -- I mean, everyone's kind of lumping, uh, Saddam in with Osama --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and sure that there are connections, but, um --
R:  They don't have any direct link, though.
L:  W- yeah, yeah.
R:  They don't know for sure.
L:  And so, well, who knows if -- if we're safe.
R:  But you know what I think, too?  I think that if they talk about it then it really is true.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think a lot of times they can't -- like you -- like I said -- you said, we can't -- they can't really give us a lot of information, but that when they talk about it a lot usually that's the truth.  That's what I find. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That that's usually what's going on.  But no, they haven't found a link yet, but I don't -- do you think that he was involved with him?  I think he was.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think -- I think --
L:  I -- I think that two people that powerful in -- in that -- in that space over there, you know, uh, for sure had -- had some, [SIGH] you know, some kind of, um, work --
R:  Connection together.
L:  You know, some kind of connection, yeah.
R:  Now, the big question is, where are we going next?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You hear about, well, who else they're looking at now, you know.  They're looking at Iran.  They're looking at North Korea.
L:  Syria.
R:  You know, are they gonna leave everybody else alone or are we gonna go after them, too?
L:  I know, I know.  And --
R:  And is Russia gonna start getting ticked off at us and they gonna start stepping in?
L:  Well, you know, and it's -- and it's not just us.  It's not just, you know, the -- the European nations or some of our a- allies that are -- that are kind of divided on this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because even within our country people are saying, "Yes, we should -- we should go and we should -- we should, you know, try and bring democracy" and then other people are saying, "No, that's not our business".  And -- and it's -- and that's even the case there, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, they -- they -- they are divided.  Some of them are very happy that -- that our presence was there and -- and others are protesting, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I think [SIGH] -- I -- I don't --
R:  I think that once everything is all said and done and once -- once it -- everything comes to light as to what he was hiding and what was there and what the plans were, I think everybody will feel, um, I don't know better, but I think differently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about a lot of topics.  I don't think -- and I -- I don't -- I hope that our president and our administration wouldn't send us in there if they didn't have some solid proof.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like I --
L:  If --
R:  You know, sometimes you wonder, do they really know any -- is there really anything that they know or are they just going in there because they want the oil?
L:  Right, right, and they're just, you know --
R:  Or they want control of the region.
L:  Warmongers or something.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, which --
R:  And I hate to think that they're warmongers.  I don't want to -- you know, that's -- I guess I just don't wanna believe that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just --
L:  Well, about our country especially.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, I -- I just -- I just don't wanna believe that we're like that.
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  But, yeah, sometimes you wonder, though, you know.  They haven't really found anything substantial. [NOISE]
L:  That they've told us about.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless, like I said, unless they're finding everything and then everything's gonna come out later in dribs and drabs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which -- which might happen, too, so ...
L:  Yeah, as is so often the case, people --
R:  But I mean, to be perfectly honest, I started turning off the news because it was starting to get to me.
L:  Oh, I did that ages ago, you know, uh, when -- when all the war footage was coming over the airwaves and the -- and [SIGH] it -- it just affected me so much.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I -- I found that I was so sensitive to what was going on in the world that it was really affecting me in my -- in my own life --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- that I -- I --
R:  You're always afraid.  And, well, every time I saw a plane -- even to this day when I hear a plane fly low --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I -- I get -- my heart just sinks because I -- 'cause I think it was only thirty miles away from me --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that this had all happened, and I remember sitting on the front steps, just sitting there and I was just staring out 'cause I didn't know if my husband was okay and I couldn't get through to him and --
L:  Oh, it was just --
R:  -- oh, it was just --
L:  It was just horrific.
R:  -- still over here.  It was still.  It was horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And to think that it was so close, you know, and sometimes he goes down there to run -- to bring reports to the Fed, and to think that he could've been down there.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's horrible what --
L:  It -- it really is.  It's -- you know, I -- I was thinking about it the other day, you know, and -- because for a long time I think that a lot of people had kind of put it out of their minds.
