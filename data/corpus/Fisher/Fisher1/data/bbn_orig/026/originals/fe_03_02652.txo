R:  Do you -- do you too?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Um [PAUSE] let's see, um.  And then we supposed to talk about, um, if we could create another holiday what would that holiday be?  [SIGH]  I haven't thought about that.  Do you have an idea?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I really don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I can't think of -- ah --
L:  I can't either.
R:  No, I can't come up with something like that.  [SIGH]  Where -- where do you live?  I'm curious.
L:  In Georgia.
R:  Oh, in Georgia.  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm in Indiana but I'm --
L:  Oh, nice!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I'm originally from Kentucky, so 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Um, gosh what other kind of holiday?  [SIGH]  I don't think we need any more Presidential days.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I don't think we need any more of those.  I think there are enough of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'd want to have a holiday that's kind of a fun holiday.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Do you like NASCAR?
R:  Um, yeah, that's -- yeah, I do.  That's okay.  Yeah.  Then -- they have a big race here, you know, in Indianapolis.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  The Brick Yard Four Hundred.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] yeah, do you like it?
L:  Oh, yeah, we -- they can have like a NASCAR Day or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, there -- there you go.  Hey, yeah, they could do that.  Yeah, the Indianapolis Five Hundred  that's coming up, um, [SIGH] -- there -- that's all they talk about on the news here is the Indianapolis Five Hundred right now.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah, they -- they could do that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I can't think of, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't think of another holiday that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, that I would want  to add.  If I was going to add one I think I'd want to add a religious one, too.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um, [PAUSE] of course we've got Easter and, ah, Easter and Christmas --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe -- maybe one in the summer?  Ah 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause there's kind of a long stretch there between holidays and I don't know that Memorial Day -- well, I guess Fourth of July is a big deal but that's not a big deal for me, but 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I ought to let you talk a little bit more.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  So, it's, um,  I'm talking so much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You go ahead and talk some more so they can have a sample of your voice.  [LAUGH].  [NOISE]
L:  Now how long are we supposed to talk?
R:  Well, we talk for ten minutes.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- yeah, we talk for ten minutes and then when the time is up they come in and they tell us  to stop.  Um, what else do we like about Christmas?
L:  [SIGH].
R:  Um, [PAUSE] I -- I just like the -- the festivity of it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, the extra church services and, um, [SIGH] the special services like music events and, um 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I just like all that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and this getting together with people and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having meals and  get togethers and things like that.  I just like all those things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um 
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Let's see, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Have you ever done like this type of thing before?
R:  No, this is the first time I've ever done it.  Have you done it before?
L:  No, this is my first time too.
R:  Oh, you too -- yeah, I've never done that before.  I found it on a link [SIGH] and, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done this too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, this is a new one for me.  [SIGH]  [COUGH]  Yeah, they tried me last night too and I was gone.  [SIGH]  And so they got my machine and they left a message so [SIGH] I didn't get to do it last night.  I wish I had.  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  Um, let's see.  What else do you like about Christmas?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] just the thought of -- just the feeling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the presence [SIGH] of the Lord and knowing you know, that that time of the year  is for him and  [NOISE]
R:  That's right.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And everything centered around -- around that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Just basically, yeah.  [NOISE]  And people seem to be, um, [NOISE] I don't know, I kind of like it 'cause some time -- ah, most of the time it seems [SIGH] like people seem to be nicer and they're happier and they seem to be nicer towards each other [MN] --
L:  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  You know, just like if you're in a store or something like that.  [SIGH]  I kind of like that  too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [PAUSE] [MN] but I still can't -- I guess the NASCAR holiday would be okay.  That'd be cool --
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  -- have -- or a racing holiday?  [SIGH]  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That would be a [COUGH] I've been [COUGH] excuse me, I've been sick so I've been coughing a lot.  Um, [SIGH] if you had a racing holiday that'd be kind of cool, I hadn't thought about that.  That's kind of a neat idea.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  What would you -- what would you do, like on the hol- -- what would you suggest they do?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have a special race, or ?
L:  Um 
R:  -- party?  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I guess just like 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you were a NASCAR fan, you know, wear your favorite NASCAR driver's shirt or something, or  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  You know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  Um, whether you decide to have a party or not let that be, you know, your own choice.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, however you want to celebrate it.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, a lot of those guys are, um, Christians too.  I like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of the NASCAR drivers.  [SIGH]  An -- which one is your favorite?
L:  Oh, [LAUGH]  Dale Earnhardt Junior.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's sad about his father.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Jeff Gordon's kind of neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's from here.  He's from not too far from where I live.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.  That's where he was, um, [MN] raised and -- yeah, Pittsborough.  It's only [SIGH] it's only miles from where I live.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he comes back, you know, to Indiana quite a bit.  [SIGH]  Yeah, but I think, um -- I'm not sure if he was actually -- I think he was  I think he was born there, but I'm not sure.  I'd have to check that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Because he liv- -- I think he lives in North Carolina now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, I don't think he [NOISE] [SIGH] lives here.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, yeah, like it's celebrate -- there haven't been that many of 'em killed either.  Have there?
L:  No.
R:  No.  So, ah when Earnhardt --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was killed that's -- there -- I think there've been more, fo- -- race, ah, Indy drivers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  killed than [COUGH] than, ah, NASCAR so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It seems to be safer or something like that.  Yeah, we could -- you could do -- we could do that.  I had a -- I'm a photographer so I had a -- I had a photo exhibit when they -- um, I think for two years I think, on NASCAR [SIGH] um, here in Indiana -- Indianapolis um --
L:  Hm?
R:  Yeah, I ah, um, -- [SIGH] yeah, I had a photo group and [MN] still have it but we just don't do it any more but, yeah, we ah, [SIGH] that's the way we celebrated it was, um, [LIPSMACK] we had a photo exhibit and we included [SIGH] you know, all kinds of things about the NASCAR [SIGH] drivers.  It was the first year in nineteen ninety four when they first ran the -- Brick Yard Four Hundred.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, [SIGH] yeah, we had pictures, you know, of them -- of the -- all kinds of things.  Everything from the cars to the activities to [SIGH] the drivers in their cars and all that kind of stuff, or even the drivers out of their cars.  And, yeah, so 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I that's how I'd celebrate it.  I'd just have a photo exhibit.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, the ten minutes seems to be kind of long.  It seems like we've talked longer than ten minutes.
L:  [NOISE]  Ah -- I know!
R:  Doesn't it?  I wonder if they should be cutting us [SIGH] I don't know how -- that's kind of interesting how that works.  [SIGH]  Well, I guess they'll cut us off whenever the ten minutes are up.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We could talk more about [SIGH] Christmas.  [SIGH]  Do you usually travel some place [NOISE]  at Christmas?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  [NOISE]  Usually, um, everyone just comes to my house.
R:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  How many people [SIGH] [COUGH] do you have?
L:  Um, we usually have about [LIPSMACK] eight or ten people over.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  Yeah, and --
