R:  Jen.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Charlie McSweeney.
R:  Um, hi, this is Jen Pursely[?].
L:  Hey, could you help me?  I didn't, um -- my hearing's not so good and I didn't hear -- even hear what the topic was.
R:  Oh, the topic is arms inspections in Iraq and if you think -- what you think the US should do about it?
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  Gee, that's a ...
R:  Yeah, that's a tough one.  Um, well, I don't know.  I feel like I'm not a -- can you hear me okay?
L:  Yeah, I hear you fine.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I feel like I'm not as informed on the issue as I could be.  I have, uh, my own, I guess, personal opinions about it, but I don't know [SIGH] -- uh, I don't really think I have all the facts very well, so I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, basically, I mean, I've -- I've never been for the war [LIPSMACK] and, uh, and I don't think that, uh, based on what I know, that the -- the motives I agree with. [LIPSMACK] So, um, but, you know, I feel like, um, obviously if there are weapons of mass destruction they -- they should be disarmed but we should go about it in a legal way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, I -- yeah, I'm not, um -- I wasn't really in favor of the war although I'm glad to see the way it went. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, 'cause, um, I -- I -- like you said, I don't have all the information, I'm not over there, but, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm, you know, um, the things [NOISE] uh, the things that he was doing is, uh, not very good, but, uh, so, um, if we should con- [NOISE] inspections I definitely think we should --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, um, uh, the UN wants -- wants that.  You know, basically the entire world wants, you know, to keep any more countries from getting more, uh, mass destruction weapons which I'm -- I'm definitely in favor of that.  I mean, I -- I'd like to see peace everywhere [LAUGH] and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and nobody, um, um, you know, I -- I hope that, you know, within the next few years that things can change.  I -- I think the US needs to take a whole different, um, approach to the situation.
R:  Definitely.
L:  I mean, these people don't -- around -- some people around the world don't hate us for no reason at all.
R:  Right.
L:  And sure they -- some of them might get propaganda from the wrong people, but at the same time, um, we're -- we're sitting over here rich and having a -- a great lifestyle and -- and it's because there's people around the world working for nothing and some people in prisons providing -- making stuff that we get really cheap then, and then go buy it at, you know --
R:  Right.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And that's not right.
R:  I think that, you know, it's -- I -- I don't know.  I mean, I think that if our motives are really to, um, you know, liberate the people of Iraq and to, you know, keep them, um, out of harm's way or Saddam Hussein or, you know, any -- [SIGH] I feel like that's noble of us, if that really was the only motive, but I -- you know, there's third world countries, uh, you know, all over the world who have really harsh dictators who we support, um, and who we --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- give weapons to and -- and, you know, it's like we support them when it's in our interest and we will fight them when it's in our interest, and here, you know, it was in our interest to disarm Saddam Hussein.  And I think it would be a lie to say that, you know, oil wasn't a big factor.  Um, and I think that we definitely need to, you know, invest a lot in rebuilding the country.  I mean, they've been devastated by war for years, you know, and -- and had been abandoned, and I think that we really -- we need to -- to help them in that sense and we also need to understand that if we are instituting a democratic government there, that we have to accept that they don't really like us [LAUGH] and that, you know, if -- if they're going to have a democratic government that doesn't like us, but it's the government that's going to allow them to be more free in expressing the fact that they don't.  And we need to accept that.  I mean, you know, it's like we have also done -- even though we've done a -- a supposedly good thing here, and I think that we have in some sense, even though we've also caused a lot of damage --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I think that, you know, we've done so many bad things in the past that, you know, it just can't be forgotten that, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that there's a reason why, you know, that the people don't like us.  And -- and I really don't know, um, the -- the weapons of -- of mass destruction that they -- that [LAUGH] they have over there.  Um, I feel like there is a legal way.  I mean, the, you know, the United Nations has a process for this that I think we sort of abandoned [LAUGH] and that --
L:  Yeah, but they were -- they weren't cooperating with the UN and the UN wasn't really standing behind what they said --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that they had to do.  And, uh, but, you know, we're the ones that put Saddam Hussein in -- Hussein in power to begin with.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, and, um, you know, I think we can, um, you know, win over the world a lot better by example than by, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, you never can really achie- achieve peace by war.
R:  Right, definitely.
L:  Because the underlying causes are still there, you know.
R:  And I -- yeah, I agree, and I think that, um, you know, what a lot of people are concerned about is, you know, that President Bush and the media has instilled sort of a fear in people of -- of terrorism, that, you know, they need to do this in order to protect us and the whole rest of the world.  But, I mean, I think this is also going to cause a lot of -- lot more anger in potential terrorists, and I don't really think it's going to keep us safe from future terrorist attacks or, you know, other countries.  I think that really the only thing that, um, will -- will help us I think is the US not being this superpower house of needing to, you know, be the ones who fix everything and, you know, ha- -- they have to have a hand in -- in every country.  Um, you know, I think in some -- in some instances we can just pull out, you know.  Like, I think that we should pull out of, uh, our interests, you know, in Israel and -- and Palestine, but I know we will -- will never do that, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Too much money involved and there's -- I mean, I think there's just a lot that we don't know because I -- I don't think that the media is very, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I don't think that they're very accurate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in everything that they've put out, and I think it's pretty one sided. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But -- are you still there?
L:  Yes, I'm still here.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Um, but I -- I don't know if we should stick on the topic of disarmament as far as that goes.  I really -- I don't know -- I don't know the right way to go about it.  You know, I think, um, force, uh, is what we've done, and I -- I don't think we can really back out of that now.  Um, you know, I think whatever -- whatever they have -- but at the same time I don't really understand how, you know, it's -- it's okay that we have whatever weapons we, you know, need to protect ourselves, and that, you know, we're uncomfortable with other countries having the same thing.  It's -- it's a little, you know, disconcerting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, well, I -- not -- not to get off topic here, have you done this, um, this Fisher thing before?
L:  Yeah, one other time.
R:  Uh, this is the only time I've done it.  Has -- how when the call -- does the call end itself or do we end it or ...?
L:  Well, somebody will come on and say, "You've got thirty seconds to say goodbye" and then afterwards they'll ask you if you wanna make any comments.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, you know, it's being recorded.
R:  Oh, okay.  I didn't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, and where are you from?
L:  Uh, San Antonio, Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm from, uh, Washington DC. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, uh, well, I -- it's interesting to know the, um -- I -- I -- it seems like Texas is a very, uh, Bush, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm not necessarily a Bush, uh -- I'm definitely not a Bush supporter.  I'm an environmentalist and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I -- we -- we just moved here, my parent- -- my wife's family's here, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm -- I'd much rather be back in Michigan, uh ...
R:  Right. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  But, um, anyways, uh --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  It seems like -- h- how long is this call?  This call has been eleven minutes and four seconds.
R:  Yeah, it seems like it's been a long time.
L:  Well, actually, no, it hasn't been that long.  That's how long since I called in.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it's -- it's -- anyway, so ...
R:  Well, yeah, I -- I think that, um --
L:  But, yeah, we need to keep doing inspections over there.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, 'cause, um, I -- you know, I -- they did, you know -- [LAUGH] I mean, they gassed their own people back -- a while back, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um ...
R:  Yeah, it's -- I mean, I -- I definitely don't think that -- but I mean, I'm not a supporter at all, but I -- and I -- I'm not a Saddam Hussein supporter either.  I think that he's, you know, a very bad person, but at the same time, you know, like you said, I mean, we supported him in the past, um, and even when he did worse things than -- than this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, we supported him all the way through his worst atrocities and because it was in our interests at the time.  And I think you're right, I mean, we definitely, um, need to set an example by not, you know, in the future supporting dictators like that and then later, when we realize the mistake we've made, you know, go back and -- and annihilate them.  I think it's best just not to support them in the first place. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, I think we also need to -- to work a lot on our diplomacy with other countries, um --
