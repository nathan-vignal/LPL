R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  Yes?
R:  Hi!
L:  [MN]  Yes?
R:  This is Chris?
L:  Yes, [NOISE] hello?
R:  Yes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who -- who am I speaking to?
L:  Ah, I, ah, I don't know who I am speaking to myself.  [NOISE]  You mean you -- you're talking from the phone and, ah, I -- I give -- I have to give you a pin number, right?
R:  Mm, I don't think so.  I think we just talk to each other [PAUSE] about the -- the subject.
L:  Yes, okay.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Ah, my name is Jean.  [NOISE]
R:  Jean?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Nice to talk to you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, same thing here.  What's up?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, okay, so did you hear all of what they said we have to, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- say whether or not we have a favorite holiday and why --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I didn't get the second part.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  If we were -- if we were going to create a holiday of our own --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sort of thing.
L:  I don't know whether -- I don't -- I-- I +love holidays but they're all good and they're all bad, depends.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Depends who- who, ah, oh, the fact really. Some people like holiday more than others, ah, some people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] -- ah, get touched by it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some people don't -- you know, that's hard to say.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm, some people dread it.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's for sure.  [LAUGH]  Some people hate holidays.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know why.
R:  How do you feel about it?  [NOISE]
L:  Ah -- ah, I think holidays are -- are -- they are the nice break in life they -- they -- they give you -- they give you a little break, that's about it.  But then people get so involved in it that [SIGH] they demand -- they demand too many things.  They demand attention.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  That -- that's the way I feel about it.
R:  Right, um, some people they feel like they have to [SIGH] really make an event out of it.
L:  Yes.
R:  I think especially some women and they have -- there's all the pressure of preparing the meal --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and all that stuff.
L:  Yes.  And their giving present and so on and so on.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  And then must -- it becomes like a chore.
L:  Yes, it is a chore and, ah, attention please, attention please.  And if you don't then you [SIGH] you become a dog.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]  What can we do?  [PAUSE]  Nothing much.  I -- I don't know.  I think there's enough holidays as it is.  As far as I'm concerned.  Too many anyway.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, can I ask you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, it sounds a little like may- -- maybe you have a French accent or --
L:  That's correct, I know.  It is.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, because I was gonna say that, of course, different people from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different countries --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they have their own [PAUSE] holidays --
L:  Holidays.
R:  -- not just --
L:    No, I don't think so.
R:  -- the standard ones --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in -- the standard ones in America --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, um, [LIPSMACK] but I guess in France --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have pretty typical ones --
L:  Ah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- Christmas and --
L:  Nah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- which ones do you -- do they have that we don't have here?
L:  Oh, --
R:  You've got Bastille Day, right?
L:  -Oh, phew.  No, we don't pay attention to it.  It's just another day that we [SIGH] thank God we have nothing, ah, you know, that's stuff[?].  You see that's -- that's a holiday like Bastille Day.  Don't -- don't -- people don't [NOISE] -- they -- they [COUGH] like May Day and all that -- that's, ah -- that's, ah, -- no, nobody pay attention.  I -- I, you know, French people we we're really weird.  [NOISE]  We don't pay attention.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We -- we -- we -- we don't pay attention because it's a -- it's a -- a day to relax but we don't pay attention like American people do, let's say.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  Let's say like we don't it, we don't take a part.  [SIGH]  You know, we just --
R:  You don't take a what?
L:  We don't take it apart, you know, we don't make a big deal about it.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, we don't make a big deal about it.  We just take, ah, take off, ah, -- it's a big day to go and have a --
R:  Right.  Just a social thing to be together and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah, well to get a piece of fresh air and do whatever you please.
R:  But do you ever think that people forget the meaning of things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for example, Christmas?  They just --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it's turned into a totally commercial thing.
L:  Ah, ah, yeah, that's some problem.  Commercial, yeah, a commercial thing that's -- that's, ah, people are turning away from commercial stuff.  [SIGH]  You know, I -- I [COUGH] I have a -- I -- I don't have too much family left i- in -- in -- in my country but [SIGH] they -- they -- they said, "Don't -- please don't send me a Christmas card.  Don't -- don't -- don't send me a card".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They say that?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, they do say that.  They said because they are so commercial they said, "Don't send me a card".
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, boy, i -- if I send them a card and I say I've an extra card somewhere -- [LAUGH] whoa, "Don't send me a card".
R:  Well, that takes some pressure off you.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, well, no, it's not a pressure.  I say to myself, "Oh, I'm not" [SIGH] -- I mean how cheap can you get, but it's not cheap -- it's --
R:  'Cause usually they say, "Don't send me a gift.  Don't give me a gift" you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, but because you know, it's like saying, "Okay, I send you a card with my -- my name under there" and they -- and that's a get it out of you, you know.  [LAUGH]  They know that.  [SIGH]  And that's not what people appreciate per se.  [SIGH]  You know, it -- it -- holidays are, um, relaxing things and um people should take it easy but they don't, ah, I mean, people make demand of it and that's -- that's where the holiday become a big pain because, ah  [SIGH]  And then families and so on [SIGH] I -- I , but I [COUGH] -- I am still very, very laid back, I don't, ah -- I don't pay attention to fam- -- to holidays that much.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I think it's a great day to have a little [SIGH] a little relaxation to make a better meal, maybe.  You know, if you have time and -- 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- things like that.  But not t- to, ah -- [NOISE] ah, demand of your friends, "Do this, do that.  I hope you do this.  I hope you do that.  You forget me.  You didn't do that".  [SIGH]  You see that's the thing.  That's the thing about holidays.  [SIGH]  They become very demanding and, ah, [SIGH] -- as birthdays.  Oh, God, forget it, birthdays. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Man.  [LAUGH]  You should forget somebody's birthday, you're in a bad shape.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Ah, I mean, ah -- no, in my days nobody pay attention to your birthday.  Come on!  [SIGH]  I mean --
R:  Really?
L:  No, well they did but they didn't do like, ah, like today -- today you have a birthday --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my God.  [SIGH]  You're born and, ah -- you -- you know you're don't supposed to ever die, [SIGH] but you do [LAUGH] miserably enough.  [SIGH]  Maybe soon enough, but maybe later enough, who knows?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the thing is that, ah, [SIGH] I mean people ought to relax about things, not to -- to take it so down [SIGH] with -- with such a -- such a [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, gusto, you know.  I mean relax, relax.  Lay- --
R:  Well, do you have -- do you have a favorite holiday or are they all kind of the same?
L:  No, I don't have a favorite holidays.  I love them all.  I [SIGH] I, ah, I don't think they are bad, I think they are great.  [SIGH]  But they ought to be more, ah, [SIGH] ah, relaxed, not so [PAUSE] family oriented maybe -- too family oriented.  [SIGH]  You know, families are families.  But [SIGH] I think they're too family oriented for one thing.  I mean and the -- and I don't think fami- family -- and that's why people kill each other and [LAUGH] oh, my -- all those things, you know.  It's always somebody who -- who's hitting each other on the head [SIGH] because it's no good and -- and you know how families, they get together?  Can you imagine all the family get together, [SIGH] they all m- make it messed up altogether?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Please --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's a .  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a mess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's enough to get your stomach go home, you know, [SIGH] I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, it is -- it is -- 
L:  -- it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- you get in fights with people --
L:  Oh, yes, you get in fights --
R:  -- because some of them maybe, you know, you don't really get along with but you have to act --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nice because it's the holiday and --
L:  Oh, right -- right -- right.  And -- look -- look at, ah, I mean, in this country you have Thanksgiving.  I think Thanksgiving is a great i- -- is a great thing.  I think it's a lovely [SIGH] lovely thing.
R:  Yeah, I do.  It's a good idea.  Uh-hum.
L:  It's a good idea but then the same thing.  People get together they eat and reminisce[?].  You cook all day.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  They eat and reminisce and then [SIGH] then they start to -- to -- to-- to misbehave.  [SIGH]  And -- and, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean if the baseball --
R:  Alcohol.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Alcohol.  The baseball game, whatever, [SIGH] nothing contain ah -- ah -- ah, some aggression, ah, some stupid idea that they have one against another, this [SIGH] maybe you, ah -- and everybody should -- and -- and two reasons stuff and everybody's better than the other.  [SIGH] I mean, it's so corny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I saw this -- so ridiculous, [SIGH] I mean so -- it's not relaxing, you know what I mean?  [SIGH]  It's demanding.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That -- that's what holidays are, ah, too -- too demanding -- I --I --
R:  Yeah, so demanding [NOISE] that's a good word for it.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, they're demanding on one another.  [SIGH] And, ah -- and -- and I don't know who can cope with all that stuff?  I -- I -- I te- --
R:  Oh, I think the men can cope --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they usually don't do much.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, the men can cope.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's the women who send the cards, buy the gifts --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- wrap them --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- cook the food --
L:  Cook the food.
R:  -- and men just sit down and watch the football game, you know.
L:  Exactly.  Oh -- oh -- oh, I mean, Thanksgiving is disgraceful.  [LAUGH]  I mean, it's even the worst holiday for -- for -- I mean for women because the women do all the work, the poor things.
R:  Right.
L:  And then the men just drink their beer or whatever they do.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, they think it's -- you know, they don't -- they don't -- shouldn't -- of course, sometimes they wash the dishes, but I mean --
L:  Oh, bluh on that.
R:  -- you have to drag 'em into that.
L:  I mean dishes, you know, I mean people make a big deal.  I know dishes are a big pain but [SIGH] the thing is --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I mean, ah -- ah, you know, you can eat simply, and -- and well, with even one dish [LAUGH] and one fork, you know.  It doesn't have to be -- [SIGH] have a -- a -- a five star restaurant, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean the -- when people expect too damn much from one another, as far as I'm concerned.  Much too much.
R:  Well, if you could create a holiday.  I think that was the second part of the, um, topic, um, what -- what eve- -- what event or for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what reason would you create a holiday?
L:  Create a holiday?  Ah, peace.
R:  Peace?
L:  Ah, I value just peace and understanding, ah, be kind, you know.  Please be kind [LAUGH] that's another -- a -- a -- a --
R:  Yeah, that's the most important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One of the most important things.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, ah -- ah -- understanding.  I mean people, don't understand one -- I don't care, ah, what the heck you -- from or whatever.  It is kindness.  It is understanding.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's what an holiday is.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  But when you -- you start to compare and -- and, ah, put your valuable fortune, ah, that's not an holiday, [SIGH] that's a showoff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]  A total showoff and that's what it is.  Those holidays like -- like a showoff.  "Oh, I'm going to have the best".  And -- and the most people don't this -- they don't cook at home they have a kind of this and that --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's a big showoff.  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's, um, [MN] I don't know.  To me it doesn't turn me on, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think an idea for, um, a holiday, [SIGH] just it could be a regular holiday --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like Thanksgiving or whatever, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to have like a potluck thing and just get --
L:  Yeah, p- peace.
R:  -- a -- together a bunch of people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from any -- any country, from any --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just throw 'em together, you know?
L:  An- and -- and peace and -- and under-
