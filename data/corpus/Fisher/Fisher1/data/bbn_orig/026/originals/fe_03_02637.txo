L:  Hi, I'm Candy.
R:  I'm Crystal.  [NOISE]
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, and how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  I -- I forgot about the phone calls and I was almost asleep.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I hate when they do that.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So, ah, what do you think we should do about Iraq?
R:  Well, I'm [PAUSE] said this from the beginning that if Bush would've said [SIGH] the correct thing, we would've been totally in support of -- of Iraq.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He should've said to -- we are to go to war to free the Iraqi people from their dictator, which would've been Saddam.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Instead he's like, "Well, we'll just throw Saddam out of power".  So, I support what -- I support our troops but I don't +support -- support Bush.
L:  I agree.
R:  Because --
L:  Definitely agree.
R:  -- you know, he -- for one thing if Clinton was in office, we'd be doing something totally different.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  This wasn't the really big worrisome until Bush got into power -- into [PAUSE] the presidency.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]  But it's like [NOISE] [PAUSE] it's really hard to [PAUSE] say what would've been right, or would've be- -- what would've been wrong with everything, but we should never have put our troops in the first place out there, because we've already had so many deaths from this war already.
L:  Yeah.  We definitely have.
R:  And they should've nev- -- we should've never have had those deaths.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]  So, what do you think, also?
L:  Almost exactly the same thing.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I agree with the reason we're over there, but I don't agree with his tactics on how he went about it.
R:  Yeah.  Because the UN would've supported us [PAUSE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if he would've said it correctly.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I've got a family that's over there now and [PAUSE] I just pray to God they come home.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  And it's just like what, um, that one guy said when his, ah, son was killed, [MN] that he puts all the blame on Bush.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because [PAUSE] if it wasn't for Bush most of our soldiers that have died would not have died.  They would've been at home safe with their families.
L:  Mm, definitely.
R:  And now they're so many people in our country that are going without a mom or a dad, [SIGH] or a sibling, you know, and it just -- it wasn't worth it.
L:  No.  It's definitely not worth it.
R:  And [LAUGH] most of the accidents were mainly because of [SIGH] we flying into a Briton plane or [PAUSE] something stupid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Instead of -- ex- -- except for when we got bombarded and had our, [SIGH] um, people +taken over.  [PAUSE]  You know?  And they were captive and POWs.  So, it was like [PAUSE], "Why are we going through this?"  It's not worth it on our country.  [NOISE]  We've already had enough damage to it.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we definitely have it -- definitely had that.
R:  [MN]  And the person that we should be more worried about is Bin Laden, not Saddam.  [PAUSE]  'Cause he's --
L:  Mm.  I think it's kinda equal.  But for me if we would've took care of Saddam the first time we were over there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we wouldn't be over there now.
R:  Yeah, we should've taken him [inaudible] like --
L:  What really ticks us -- ticks me off most is we really had him last time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we let him go.
R:  Yep.  We would've --
L:  Just so we could turn round and cost more tax dollars and grief to go back over there for a unsupported war.  I mean [SIGH] that's just crazy.
R:  Yeah, it's hurt our economy too.  Totally.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And we -- we should've went over there when we had -- when we were over there ten plus years ago [SIGH] is when we should've just got done with it.  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  Instead we had to wait this long to take him out of power.  [NOISE]
L:  And then we lost that many lives last time.  Because --
R:  Uh-hum.  And because of Bush we have no funding for our schools because we went to war instead --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and a lot of our schools are closing down because of it.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  [NOISE]  Because they --  [NOISE]
L:  It's hit here pretty hard here too.
R:  Oh, it was like he took, um, a tax cut of like -- mean, out of -- for schools it was like forty -- forty nine million, I think -- more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean our s-
L:  I've been signing petitions against it but our word don't mean nothing, [LAUGH] I don't think.
R:  [SIGH]  I c- called our senator and stuff like that and, um, it's like [NOISE] -- and our representative and stuff because right now our -- um, our governor is going into a special meeting [SIGH] because of the war and everything and re-pass -- trying to pass things so we can get money for our schools and stuff.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Well, it's like we're not the ones -- in ten -- in less than ten years we're not going to be the ones that are running our country, it's our children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just like our family before that.
L:  And if they don't have an education, where do we stand?
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, my kids are five, seven and eight and [PAUSE] the way things are right now, I kind of wish I'd never had 'em.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I hate them growing up in a world that's so screwed up.
R:  [NOISE]  I have a two year old.  [PAUSE]  And I'm to -- to the point that I believe that I think other than [SIGH] -- there's one good school where I live at and I'm thinking about sending her there [SIGH] but, other than that, I would home school her --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because of everything that goes on at school and stuff.  Now, we have to worry about people coming in with guns and stuff.
L:  I know.  I don't -- I don't know what in the world's happened.  Somewhere another -- I think it boils down to where they kicked in the child abuse laws and all that.
R:  Well, it come- 
L:  We've lost control of our kids.
R:  Well, it comes with how our children are taught.  If you -- if you're taught to -- a lot of p- -- a lot of parents are very competitive with their children [SIGH] and -- and bully really bad.  So, when they go to school, they're bullying other kids and so forth.  Instead of dealing with -- with this at home in our own backyards [SIGH] we're dealing with this at school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And people are like, "Well, terrorism starts in different countries".  No, it starts in our own back yard.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It started right --
L:  When we terrorize each other, we have a problem.
R:  Yep.  And Saddam is -- Saddam or Iraq is +dealt with -- is dealing with that and that's why [PAUSE] I think that's part of why we should've because of how many people Saddam was killing of his own people.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I mean, in a way --
R:  Because it's not right to terrorize each other.
L:  No, it's not.
R:  Let alone another country.  [PAUSE]
L:  But if they don't take him out of power, they're set down there and build all these weapons against us that are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they could just totally wipe us out with one blow.
R:  Yeah.  The only strange thing is -- is I don't understand is why they didn't find any, um, weapons of mass destruction yet.
L:  Well, I think they said they found a few the first couple of nights the war had started --
R:  Probably.
L:  -- started -- that they had shot a few of 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually launched them.  But all these ones that they say he has sitting back ready to use on us, it's funny we can't find 'em.
R:  Uh-hum.  But yet they found one guy with, like, regular handguns or like four hundred regular handguns.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Whoop de do, ya know.  We have more weap- -- more handguns than that.  And yet [NOISE] they're supposed to have a lot more than we are in mass destruction and -- the only other thing is that I don't understand is why is it that every other country, except for the United States, um, can't -- cannot have weapons of mass destruction but the United States can?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Is that stupid or what?
L:  Yeah.  It makes no sense to me.
R:  Because you look at, [NOISE] um, ah -- let me think here.  England.  England can't have them.  Korea can't have them, but yet we can.  [NOISE]  And they're supposed to be our allies and stuff like that.  It's just stupid.
L:  And what worries me the most about all that is the more we go to war -- which is like the third war since I've had my kids.
R:  Ah hum.
L:  And it seems like every time something bad happens all of a sudden they want to run to war.
R:  Yep.
L:  What kind of message is that sending to our kids?
R:  That --
L:  Because when they get older, they'll all become dictators like Saddam and think, "Well, war's the only answer".
R:  Well, I'm to the point of thinking that the way that Bush is handling our country, that he's becoming a dictator.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Because --
L:  And when he launched his campaign about the war he started off saying, "We're going to attack terrorism" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he brought up the whole nine eleven thing.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I think he done that just to get enough support to be -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- able to go ahead and get the war started.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And once the war had started, he don't really care what the hell we feel.
R:  Uh-hum.  And the other thing is he doesn't understand that even though they brought terrorism to the United States, we're bringing it right back to them.
L:  Which makes us just as bad as them.
R:  Yep.  If we would've just [SIGH] went on our merry little way and made it out -- made it look like they didn't change us for no reason --
L:  That's what they said to do --
R:  -- that we're still gonna fight for --
L:  -- was keep going on about your normal life, not to let it affect you --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:   -- and what did we do?  We turn around and let us -- let it affect us.
R:  Yep, we turn around and we just bomb the hell out of other people.  [PAUSE]  And bring terrorism to them.  [NOISE]  And do it right back, which is wrong on our part just as well as it is on their part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was always taught through the Bible, and stuff, that two wrongs don't make a right and we haven't made any right.
