L:  Hi.  This is Douglas in Los Angeles.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, ahem, Deb in Sacramento.
L:  Oh, okay.  We're both from California.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello.
R:  Hello.  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay. I didn- -- I didn't realize that you were still there.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  I didn't -- 
L:  [NOISE] A --
R:  Hm -- okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] What? 
R:  Well, I figured that -- is -- is this one of these survey calls?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, it is.  A- -- actually, did you actually hear the recording at the beginning?
R:  Sort of.  Yeah, I just didn't -- uh, gosh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Did it catch you off guard?
R:  Yeah, because I figured it would be, "To ask questions, you press one for whatever" and you -- um [COUGH] it's kind of a [inaudible] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] So, did you hear what our topic is?
R:  Yeah, something about holidays. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Something about holidays.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Well, it's -- it's -- yeah [LAUGH] exactly.  No, it's that -- um, it's something like if you've, uh, you have a favorite holiday, or if you wanted to create -- if you were able to create a holiday, what would it be?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hm, so I guess let's take the first question.  What is your favorite holiday? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't know.  I guess Christmas, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] Christmas?
R:  Sure. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Not Thanksgiving?
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  [NOISE] Christmas is better because of the presents?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, just as a big -- yeah, in our h- house, Thanksgiving is a fa- -- is a family time, but I think you tend to -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- reach out more to people with cards and everything at Christmas, so yeah, Christmas.
L:  Oh, okay.  That -- yeah, that's -- that's true because for other holidays you don't really like send out a lot of cards, [NOISE] I guess, right?
R:  Well, you're not really --
L:  You're just kind of get --
R:  Right.
L:  If you get together, you get together.  [NOISE] Um, if you don't then [NOISE] but yeah, I guess -- yeah, you're right.  I never thought about the difference between Christmas -- because my first thought was, "Oh well, Thanksgiving" [NOISE] because it's a family holiday and you know, everybody gets together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But um, what you just said about the cards is -- it makes sense because not everybody can get together, but at Christmas, even if you can't get together then you just send them a card. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and no matter, you know, how far across country they are, I -- you know, it's generally the time I -- I do anyway. 
L:  [NOISE] And it's cheaper to send a card for thirty seven cents than it is to fly across country to meet somebody for Thanksgiving. [NOISE]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [NOISE] Um, well, I guess my favorite holiday would be, like I said, Thanksgiving, I guess, because -- a lot of it has to do because I come with a --from a large family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and we're able to get -- a lot of us get together and -- and celebrate it that way but [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know if that would have been my favorite holiday if I were like, you know, from a small family.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Mhm. 
L:  Do you have any other holidays?
R:  [NOISE] Um, not -- not on and -- I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  How 'bout holidays in the summer time?
R:  [MN] Holidays in the --
L:  When you can get out and do stuff -- have fun --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, uh, Fourth of July.
R:  I don't know, I think -- well, actually I like Halloween. [LAUGH]
L:  Halloween is fun too.  Do you have kids? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] No, but we usually --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, have a- -- an event at work, and it's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, and we're -- kind of we're all encouraged to do costumes and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- we have contests amongst, um [NOISE] --
L:  Amongst your coworkers?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. So, it's -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's a lot a -- it's 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably different than all -- in a lot of workplaces, I guess.
L:  [NOISE] But it takes a lot of effort for Halloween, though.  I mean, it's a good holiday but it -- it seems to me like it takes -- well, it's different, I guess, 'cause for Thanksgiving everybody has to do something, I'm sure.
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  So, especially like if you're having a family over, or whatever [NOISE] but, um, it's -- it's a -- I don't know.  I -- yeah, Halloween is fun.  I used to do like a haunted house, uh, my house, uh, for the kids in the neighborhood?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] So, it was fun too but it was a lot of work.  And okay, I'd still rather enjoy Thanksgiving than Halloween.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I think really 'cause other men don't have to cook or bring anything.
R:  Sorry?
L:  No, sorry, I enjo- -- I say, I think I enjoy, uh, Thanksgiving better because I don't have to cook or --
R: -- or bring it? [LAUGH]
L:  -- w- -- worry ab- -- [LAUGH] yeah, exactly, you know? 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Or on Thanksgiving, like, you know, it -- it -- it was that expensive to have to fix my house for all those kids and get everything for them, so [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but Halloween is fun too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You know another holiday that -- uh, [NOISE] because I lived in Latin America for a long time, that another big, big holiday there is, um, the day of the dead, or the day of all saints, and it's like a big national holiday where people go out to a cemetery and you just spend the whole day there, like you actually bring like a picnic.  Have you ever heard anything -- like about it?  Or do you know much about it? [NOISE]  Like has anyone ever mentioned it to you?
R:  No, not really, not recently.
L:  Okay, well, the way we used to celebrate it, I remember with my grandma 'cause my grandfather died when I was a little kid.  So, we used to go and like we used to k- -- have like I said, a picnic [NOISE] and celebrate like -- I don't know, whatever you celebrate at a cemetery.  Like we would clean the -- [LIPSMACK] the tomb and everything, and like bring fresh flowers and actually eat that person's favorite food, so it's like a big, big holiday there but here it's not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, it's not anything big.  I mean, I guess in more ethnic communities -- like I'm from Latin America, they kind of do something about that but, uh, overall, it's just like a -- a cultural holiday, you know, somewhere else in the world, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- but [PAUSE] anything else you wanna say for holidays?
R:  No, and they said something about if I could create one, I don't know.  I just --
L:  Oh, that's right, that's right, if -- yeah.  So, if -- would you like to create a holiday?  [MN] You could?
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know.  I just need -- I know we need one between, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We need one between all the holidays in February and May. [LAUGH] There needs to be something --
L:  Oh, we don't have anything in between?
R:  No.  There really is a kind of real dry spell for holidays there [LAUGH] except for Easter, but 
L:  Oh!  So, we have what in February, like Valentine's?
R:  Well, no.  There's the President's Day, you know --
L:  And there's President's Day.
R:  -- holidays and that, and --
L:  And then we have what?
R:  And then -- and then May is Memorial Day but there's nothing in between.
L:  Right, that's true.  So, we go April and March.
R:  But -- but I don't really know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nothing in March.  See, there really isn't anything that is big.
L:  Right.  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, so --
L:  See, I never thought of that.  Okay.
R:  And then the other thing, I think, is St Patrick's Day but that isn't really enough to take --
L:  Well, that's just like ea- -- on your own, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I mean, as in -- you know, enough for us [COUGH] a big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sort of family thing where you get off work, or, uh, I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I don't know what I could do -- could think of, I mean, I don't know.  Um -- oh, gosh!  Ahem.  I know we have Labor Day, but maybe an Employees Day would be nice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, "Hey!" [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, everybody is one in one sense or another.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well you know, I -- here in -- well, you know, in California we have like a lot of state holidays, but I guess that only applies if you're like a state employee.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like I know that you said like just a Childhood's Day, and um --
R:  Right.
L:  And here in LA -- I don't know about Sacramento -- but here in LA, um, like Cinco de Maya is like a huge thing.  Um, and it's not really a holiday but a lot of people pretend it is.  So, you know, you don't go to work and you do other things.  Everybody is sick on that day.  [LAUGH]  But they're not.  They're out celebrating and stuff [LIPSMACK] but, uh, to create something in between February and May.  Hm.  That's interesting.  Employee Day.
R:  That's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I don't know, it just came to mind.  I don't know --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- what else could do.  The only thing that I could think of any because I don't know of anything of insig- -- of significance in between. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah 'cause -- I mean, you know we have like -- I would say set holidays.  We have like pretty much [NOISE] one that honors, you know, something or somebody.  Like we have President's Day, we have -- well, what's Labor Day, Labor Day is not for people who work? [PAUSE] But it's still too far into the year, huh? [LAUGH] We still don't have -- that leaves us out something in between, uh, February and May.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah it is.  Still it's getting closer to Memorial Day but [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  I know, it just seemed like there should be something.  Mm.
L:  Mm, interesting.
R:  Well, that's my idea. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't know -- what the heck.
L:  And I agree with you because [NOISE] I didn't realize I wouldn't have a holiday between -- between those months.  [NOISE] So, I -- maybe I have something there [LAUGH] I don't know.  What do you do to create a holiday? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know when I want it, that's for sure. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE] That's interesting.  Let's see, if I wanted to -- if I -- because when I heard the question, I started thinking, "Well, if I were to create a holiday what would it be?"  But, um, like I was just telling you they -- i- i- i- i- -- we -- it seems like we have a major holiday just about for everything or everyone that we need to commemorate, I guess. [NOISE] Like I guess Thanksgiving and Christmas would be like for famil- -- well, Christmas would be for family times.  Thanksgiving would be for like -- I guess, you know, appreciating things and showing that. [MN] Labor day would be to -- a day of rest.  Um, is Easter a holiday ?  No, huh,  It's just a religious holiday.
R:  It's a more religious holiday and --
L:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] then we have President's Day -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then we have Fourth of July holiday to celebrate the -- the nation.  Um, I don't know.  I -- I was trying to think [NOISE] of what is still missing to commemorate or to celebrate, and I guess Employee Day. [LAUGH]  Employee Day in the middle -- right in the first quarter of the -- of the year would be nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Why not? [NOISE] As you said --
L:  But you know, have you ever read those things where it says like, "How many like holidays there are in a year?" 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and like at the end of the year, like supposedly you have had more time off because the holidays than -- than you have actually worked?  But it's not true of course.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that is definitely --
L:  Because if that were the case --  
R:  Haven't se- --
L:  Have you ever re-?  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L:  You know, I've never -- I've never --
