L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, hello, this is Anthony.
L:  Oh, hi, this is Karen.
R:  Hi, Karen.  I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee.  Where are you calling from?
L:  From Florida.
R:  From Florida, really?
L:  Yeah, we're nice and warm.
R:  Yeah, well, it's a nice day here, too.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, gosh.  Favorite holiday.  I -- I probably would have to say Christmas.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's just the only --
R:  Just, ah, I guess from a --
L:  -- time you get to see everyone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- it's, ah, obviously a big family thing and, you know, and obviously the religious impact of it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, has a big meaning for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, being a Christian and all.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, [SIGH]  I don't -- I -- I've never really thought about creating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my own holiday.  [LAUGH]  That's kind of a [SIGH] a unique proposition.  [SIGH]  Um, you have any thoughts on that?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I -- I like [NOISE] the idea of Christmas in July.  You know, they have those, ah, things for sales and all that kind of stuff, but having something, [SIGH] um, some sort of a celebration in the middle of the summer, [SIGH] um, besides, you know, Independence day, but just a sort of a [SIGH] family get together, ah, reunion type of holiday may be.  [SIGH]  Um, I like Memorial Day because I'm a school teacher and I'm really close to [NOISE] [SIGH] summer vacation but -- [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I -- you know, ah, my family does have a reunion every summer.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  [NOISE]
R:  We just -- we just make it an annual tradition -- well, on my father's side.  [SIGH]  We just kind of make it an annual tradition but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't consider it a ho- [LAUGH] holiday per se.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  We just say, ah, "Okay, it's this weekend and it's gonna be at such and such place and everybody show up".  [SIGH]  You know, and bring food of course, [SIGH] ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] Easter's also ah, a holiday that I really like a lot too, again, you know, just [NOISE] from the religious aspects --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if nothing else.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Um, but um [LIPSMACK] anyway but I -- I'd definitely say Christmas is my favorite [SIGH] -- oh, wh- what --
L:  Yeah, I like um, tr- trying to figure out what to get people and, [SIGH] ah, it's nice to -- to see or hear about, you know, I -- I try to get like very [NOISE] unusual type gifts and [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, something that, you know, the -- people probably don't buy for themselves --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot.  No --I -- I don't buy practical stuff that much [NOISE] or if it's practical it's something that [SIGH] y- -- um, people won't spend the money for because it's either too expensive or too [SIGH] you know, whatever, and I just wait till [NOISE] there's, ah, some sort of a sale or something and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- everyone's like, "Oh, I can't wait to get that gift 'cause she's always come up with something weird".  Like -- last -- last year I just gave [SIGH] kaleidoscopes and like --
R:  Oh, kal-  Kaleidoscopes -- fiddle[?]
L:  -- you know you hear of them a lot but, you know, how many people actually have a kaleidoscope?
R:  [LAUGH]  That's what I was just thinking, I don't have one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  That's neat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you come from a large family?
L:  [SIGH]  No.  I have, um, three sisters.  Um, my dad's still alive but my --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- mom's dead and, [SIGH] ah, I just got married a couple of years [NOISE] ago so I've got my -- my husband's family too [PAUSE] and, ah, we have a little --
R:  Congratulations.  You got married probably about the same time I got divorced sounds like.
L:  Oh, whoops.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I've been divorced two years -- so [PAUSE] fair enough.
L:  Yeah I think they have --
R:  Yeah -- Hey, you know what -- that -- that would be my holiday, [SIGH] um, the -- divorce day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that would be a good one.  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just, you know, every -- every year you know, on the day that it was final, I'll just have -- have a celebration.
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Go find a really nice cigar, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that -- that would be a holiday that -- that I would come up with probably.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's a good one.
R:  I don't think that would be a very universal holiday.  [LAUGH]  It'd probably be just one that I would celebrate.  [LAUGH]
L:  Dif- different for everyone.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Like a birthday.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Birthdays or holidays.  [SIGH]  We have -- I have kids at school that, you know, I would never have thought of taking a day off from -- from school or work, whatever.  I don't really take very many days off but, [SIGH] um, the kids are like, "Oh, it's my birthday tomorrow, I'm taking the day off".  [NOISE]  I'm like, "Why?  You know, come to school, all your friends are here.  [NOISE]  Just, you know, it -- it'd be better --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- if you were [NOISE] in school for your [NOISE] birthday".
L:  Sure.
R:  [LAUGH]  And -- and they just like, "Oh, no I don't need to come to school.  My mom says I don't have to, it's my birthday".  [NOISE]  You know, I'm like, "What -- what kind of parents?" you know.  So, I don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that is kind of strange 'cause I -- yeah, I wouldn't -- I -- when I was growing up I wouldn't have never even thought to take my birthday off from school.
L:  I wouldn't either.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, because everybody --
L:  We used to have -- we used to have parties at school.
R:  -- would be like, "Hey, it's your birthday" you know, you -- you're kinda king of the hill that day --
L:  That's right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  It doesn't [NOISE] make much sense --
R:  That's weird.
L:  -- but a lot of kids do it.  Like that's crazy to waste a day off.  [LAUGH]
R:  No doubt.  No doubt.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know, I think -- I think parents probably raise kids a lot differently today than, you know, they did in our day.  [NOISE] Ah, whether that's good, bad or indifferent, I don't know but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not going to sit here and make a big social [LAUGH] comment about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, if I had tried something like that, I would've gotten, you know --
L:  Beat up.
R:  -- a boat load full, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  "You will go to school".
R:  Yes.  "Y- you will be there and I will call the principal to make sure you are there" you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but that helped us with [NOISE], ah, later on because there are so many people that, [SIGH] I mean even the newer -- ah, newer teachers that come to school, like if they -- they take days off, all the time.  Like, how can you do that?  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  You know, like th- they just, I don't know they just weren't brought up with responsibilities, I guess.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  [SIGH]
R:  I guess, yeah.  It seems strange to me.
L:  So, I think we're off the subject of holidays.  So --
R:  Okay, let's get back to holidays.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Christmas.  [LAUGH]
R:  Christmas, yes, Christmas, Easter, ah, July the Fourth, you know, Independence Day, that's a good one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, from the, ah, patriotic aspect.
L:  Right.
R:  I wish -- I wish people celebrated it patriotically like they should.  Ah, to most people --
L:  Well, I think this year they might.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think so.  But, ah, I think in general most years people don't even think about the, ah, significance of it.  They just look at it as a, you know --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- the summer holiday.  A chance to [SIGH] take a few days off of work and have a long weekend or something.  [SIGH]  But, ah -- but that's -- that one's, ah, one of my favorites.  Now, of course we have Cinco de Maya coming up which, ah, really has nothing to do with the United States, but a lot of people use it as a [PAUSE] excuse to get a drink so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- along with St Patrick's Day.  [MN]  Ah --
L:  Yeah.  Our teachers' lounge was just decorated with -- for Cinco de Maya [NOISE] and, ah, I guess this week is appreciation week for us, so it's a big deal.  Our whole [NOISE] faculty lounge is decorated.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Well, you probably -- ah, well, I don't know, Florida's probably more Cuban than Mexican, but you probably have quite a few, ah, Hispanic kids I would imagine.
L:  Ah, we don't in our area [NOISE] as much, although we have more over the past few years [SIGH] than we've had -- ever had be- -- this -- the particular area I'm in is, ah, [NOISE] west central and it's mostly white --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, the minorities are really [PAUSE] -- keep coming to the area.  We have a lot more Asians and, [SIGH] um, there's always been a -- a small percentage of blacks but, ah, [SIGH] they've been in -- in a -- like [NOISE] localized area so it's been ninety nine percent.  It started out with ninety nine percent, one percent black and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- there was nobody else.  And then over the years -- I've been a tea- teacher for twenty years so [SIGH] now [NOISE] it's probably ninety six percent white and then --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- maybe two percent Asian [SIGH] and one and a half percent black and [SIGH] [NOISE] and Hispanic, I think is about one percent right now.
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow.
L:  But it's -- it's getting there.  We- we're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] we're in an area that everyone's moving to [PAUSE] from Miami.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Sure.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Sure, yeah, um, my ex wife grew up in Miami.  She always says, ah, "I grew up there when you didn't have to wear a bullet proof vest [LAUGH] everywhere you went".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  But, ah --
L:  It's scary.
R:  Um, is Halloween a big holiday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for you -- for your school?
L:  -- not for me, um, it used to be when I was a kid.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, [NOISE] you know, because we'd go around but I'd -- you know, I'd be scared to death now [NOISE] with all the stuff going on --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm sure parents are the same way and they'll have, [SIGH] um, H- -- they'll have like different organizations will have Halloween parties or something so the kids don't go out.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, [NOISE] ah, walking around and, you know, [NOISE] parents will take kids out and of course the older kids will have [NOISE] their own little parties or they'll go [SIGH] door to door together as a group or something.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But it's ri- --
R:  Ah, I know lot of the churches here, in our area, [SIGH] have started doing what they call alternative, um --
L: [MN]
R:  -- type celebrations --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.
R:  -- for the kids, yeah, where, you know, if they want to dress up they can, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's not so much of the paganistic [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- type thing that, you know, that Halloween actually comes from but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, anyway.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's -- that's, ah, interesting.  So, you've been teaching for twenty years?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What, ah -- what grades do you teach?
L:  High school.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, high school.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Beautiful.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I like it better than [NOISE] primary school.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think -- I think I would too.  I think I would too.  What subjects do you teach?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, physical education mostly.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Great.
L:  But here and there different things.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Whatever they need me to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Let's see -- what holidays have we not covered?
L:  St Patrick's Day.  [LAUGH]
R:  There's a lot of the little -- yeah, St -- ah, Valentine's Day.
L:  [NOISE]  Every day.  Every day's a holiday for somebody.
R:  That's true.
L:  [SIGH]  Look at the calendars now.  And, like, this is, ah, Sewing Machine Day, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's a very good point.  [LAUGH]  It seems like that, ah, every year when you get your new calendar there's like three or four new ones --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that have been added.  You know, today is, ah, National Assistants' --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Day.  You know, it used to be Secretaries' Day.  Now, I think you know that's not politically correct and now we have to call it Assistants' Day, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, you got -- you got Arbor Day; you got Flag Day, ah --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  And -- and, ah, we have a local --
