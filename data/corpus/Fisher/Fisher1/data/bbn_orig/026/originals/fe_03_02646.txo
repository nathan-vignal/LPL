L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]  Hey, how you doing?
L:  [NOISE]  It's going good, ah, [NOISE] so the topic is, ah, holidays.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I can't hear you.  [several inaudible words]  Something's wrong with the --
L:  [NOISE]  Excuse me?  [NOISE]
R:  I can't hear you very well.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you can't?
R:  Now -- now I can.  I don't what's wro- 
L:  Oh, okay, it must be my -- ah -- ah, I'm on a cell phone.
R:  I see.  Probably just 
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what's your favorite holiday?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I [MN] don't have any favorite holidays to tell you the truth.
L:  You don't have any favorite holidays?
R:  N- no.
L:  [SIGH]  Mine would probably be [PAUSE] Thanksgiving.
R:  Why?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, a couple of reasons.  Ah, [SIGH] because you get the whole -- you know, like a four day weekend?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah --
R:  That's no -- no job. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  No [PAUSE] school, okay.
L:  [SIGH]  No job.  No school.  You get to -- to be -- you get to be with your family [SIGH].  I've two favorite holidays, actually.  [PAUSE]  But, um, I'd say Thanksgiving is one of them because you get to eat really good food.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I love food.  [PAUSE]
R:  I see.  So, because food and because you don't have to work?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  [PAUSE]
R:  But what about the meaning of them?
L:  The meaning is also important as well because it's, um, -- it's like a holiday where you can share -- you can share, I guess, food, I mean with --with people, with your family and it -- it -- it brings your family closer I believe.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have an extended family?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Do you have a big family?
L:  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  [NOISE]
R:  And all of you get together for  [PAUSE]
L:  Yep.  We get together and we have, um, a big meal and my father usually ends up, ah, making a menu.  [NOISE]  And then we follow the menu and [NOISE] we usually go out and watch a movie.  It's kind of like a traditional -- it's a traditional thing.  Even though I -- I'm not, [SIGH] ah, ah, [COUGH] -- even though I -- I don't celebrate it for religious purposes.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I just -- we just celebrate it for -- for the sake of -- of sharing the -- the experience with your family, you know.
R:  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE]  And what about, th-- the holidays?
L:  The other holidays?
R:  [PAUSE]  Sorry?
L:  What was the question?  [SIGH]
R:  What about the other one, the other holiday?
L:  The other one would probably be Christmas.  [NOISE]
R:  Christmas.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  And the reason for that is, ah, [SIGH] once again, you [PAUSE] you get to spend time with your family and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it -- it's a time when you can give -- you can give things to your family.  Um, even though the -- there shouldn't -- I -- I kind of [NOISE] -- Christmas is a funny one for me because I -- I believe that it's a little bit, ah, [LIPSMACK] corporatized.  I don't know how to explain it.
R:  [NOISE]  A meal?
L:  It's kind of -- it's centered around buying gifts.
R:  Ah 
L:  But, um, I love getting gifts and I love getting gifts for my family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's just I hate having -- I hate being subjected to buying gifts.  [PAUSE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I wish that we could just have, you know, [NOISE] we should just be able to give our family gifts any time of the year, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- instead of one year -- um, instead of one day of the year, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  But actually you -- you do that --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But we do -- do that.
R:  -- don't you?
L:  And we do give gifts and we do follow the -- we do follow the, ah, the tradition.  [PAUSE]  The funny thing is, ah, well, we're not -- we're not a religious family.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  So, even more for, um --
L:  So --
R:  -- because you used to do it, [SIGH] kind of?
L:  Yeah.  It's [SIGH] -- yeah, we were always brought up to do it and, ah, I think as kids -- as children our parents brought us -- bought us gifts and, ah, we all sat around, ah, the -- the -- like we would rent -- we would rent a -- a cabin or something, and we'd sit around the fire and open gifts.  You know, it'd be like the whole santa thing.
R:  Wow, that's cool.
L:  So, as a -- as a young kid you -- you really love the holiday, you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Because it's special.  It's -- you -- you get what yo- -- everyone in your family is happy.  People are -- are, ah, you know, [NOISE] sharing gifts with each other.  [NOISE]  And as a child --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you don't really have that, ah, [NOISE] that -- that notion of -- of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being subjected to [NOISE] --
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  -- to buy a gift, you know?  [NOISE] 
R:  I know what you mean.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause a kid is more like [PAUSE] to get the gift, ah, um --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, and everyone's happy and we're --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you go on a -- you may -- everyone has time off work so you go on vacation.  There's no school.  Same thing.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, as a child you're quite -- you're kind of, ah, protected from what, ah, [SIGH] in the -- in -- later on in life what you might have to be responsible for.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Which is -- I mean for instance, you know, a -- a scenario would be [SIGH] say you have a poor family, you know, a very, very poor family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] you're trying to celebrate Christmas.  Well, it's going to be hard for you to buy gifts, you know --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because you -- you're poor and you can't afford gifts.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, [SIGH] it -- the meaning of the holiday becomes completely different, I would say.
R:  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  Yeah -- it's --
L:  As opposed --
R:  -- it depends on the culture anyway just, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- for, um, for people -- for -- in these countries different and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  All of that.
R:  -- that country.  Even though it is the same, ah, holiday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you don't celebrate [PAUSE] with the same -- -- ah, um, [SIGH] um, traditions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in different regions.  I'm from the -- ah, another country, I'm from Columbia and [SIGH] there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, we don't use them, mm, all the fancy -- ah, not fancy -- not fancy but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the -- the gift thing is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not that +important.
L:  The consum- -- the consumer ideology, right?
R:  Yeah.  Here this country is crazy to buy stuff.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It's, ah --
L:  And that's what I mean -- it can -- it could totally --
R:  The more --
L:  -- change the way you -- you see the -- the holiday.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Like for you, for instance, if your -- I mean you -- were you -- you grew up in Columbia?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, for you, -- ah -- are you also religious?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, wa- was the holiday more of -- of a religious occurrence for you?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  The holiday is ah [PAUSE] --
L:  For Christmas, I mean.
R:  -- families to -- to -- the whole [PAUSE] family to just --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- want to be with your family, ah, express love +but [PAUSE] I'm talking about, ah, m- me.  I'm talking more about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the Christmas in Columbia.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for me a --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- holiday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I told you I don't have a favorite one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  Because for me that [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] most of them are, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- commercial, marketing thing.  Like [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- Father's Day when -- those are not holidays but, [SIGH] um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's more a -- the [PAUSE] -- the, um, create the [PAUSE] create necessity to [SIGH] celebrate something that you've really done -- [SIGH] that you can do without -- then I don't know if I -- my favorite -- you don't need the, um [PAUSE] -- you don't have the necessity to do it.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  I m- -- I mean [PAUSE] you can [PAUSE] share with your family any time.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE] --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  You say you can [PAUSE] -- can [SIGH] give them gifts any time.
L:  Any time.
R:  You don't need to -- to wait for --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- Christmas or --
L:  Why does it have to be a holiday --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that you do this?  And I think that's part of the American culture as you say.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Because, ah --
R:  It was a political thing.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  It's also a very -- very big economical reasons for -- for instance in Christmas, um, I know a lot of, ah -- a lot of goods are marked down [PAUSE] i- immediately after Christmas --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because it's the end of the economic year.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, their -- their prices -- they -- they want to get rid of all their stock --
R:  Yes, like --
L:  -- in the -- and -- and so they use -- they use the holiday as a means of marketing the rest of what's left on their shelves.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And it kinda -- it's kind of contorted because people [SIGH] are trying to go out and buy their family gifts but, um, in actuality, I mean some corporations are using it to their advantage, you know,?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [SIGH]  And, so the -- then the holiday [PAUSE] becomes, I guess -- I would say less genuine.
R:  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE]  Yes.
L:  And that's why -- that's why I said as a young kid you're kind of shielded from all that.
R:  I guess that's --
L:  As -- as a young person you don't see that and you kind of, ah -- you --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- just enjoy the holiday as -- as a -- a celebration and a time when you can be with your family and get lots of gifts and go round and play --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- with new toys and [SIGH] it's a fun time when you're a little kid, you know?
