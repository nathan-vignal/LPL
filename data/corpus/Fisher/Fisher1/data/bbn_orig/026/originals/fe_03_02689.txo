R:  Hi, h- --
L:  Hi, my name's Victoria.
R:  Hi, my name is Dorothy.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing good.  How are you doing?
R:  Great!
L:  Um, so what's your favorite holiday?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my favorite holiday is Fourth of July.
L:  Oh yeah, that's a good one.  That's definitely a good one.
R:  Yes.  What is your favorite holiday?
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I think my favorite holiday is probably, mm, Christmas.
R:  That's a good one.
L:  Yeah, it's a classic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it is.  Um, why do you particularly like, uh, Christmas as being your favorite?
L:  Uh, I think I just like being around my family and that usually happens a lot around Christmas, so I think that's why I like it.
R:  And you know the same thing with us, with Fourth of July, we -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- do not get together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because we get together in the middle of the summer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, for the Fourth of July --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everybody gets in and, um, course it's a time to be outside, it's so many of us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Un- until you know, we get outside and you know, barbeque and nobody has to be inside, because nobody has a big enough house to accommodate all of us.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it's a good chance to enjoy the weather too.
R:  Oh yeah, yes.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Uh, where are you located?  What --
L:  I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, New York City.  Okay, I'm in Mississippi.  So --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- Denver, Mississippi, it's hot and muggy on July the fourth but, uh --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- it's a better time to be outside than in December because December can be a freezing time.
L:  Oh yeah.  We get brutal winters here -- 
R:  I-
L:  -- I totally understand.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, it -- it does not get that cold down here at Christmas, uh, yeah but i- -- it's cold to us because it's so hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like the humidity's so high and you know, when it's down to thirty, you know, we think we're freezing, 'cause we --
L:  Oh man, that's nothing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  We do not get snow here, I mean, it's very rare to have snow.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh --
L:  That's interesting, mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, have you -- 
R:  Whereas I know y'all --
L:  -- I mean if you were -- oh yeah, we get it.  We get it all the time.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, do you like, have you ever been around snow?  I mean --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- I know a lot of people who haven't ever been in snow who live in the snow.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yes, uh, 'cause I have moved all over, uh, I lived in Rolla, +Missouri, which was the foothills of the Ozarks.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was nothing unusual to walk out in October and have, you know, two foot of snow.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  'Cause it was just all -- a weather path right down through, uh, the Ozarks there, that we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we'd get quite a bit of snow.  And I like snow but, you know, I like the south.  I like, uh, having very little snow.
L:  Yeah, that -- that definitely sounds like a positive.  I really -- 
R:  So --
L:  -- I don't like -- I don't like this cold weather but I love the city, so I feel like I'm stuck here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, I understand.  Yeah and I like the country, we live out in the country.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, right, yeah.  We're, uh, I guess it'd be eighty miles to the closest large city for us.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, we're definitely country.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, sounds like it.
R:  Um 
L:  Oh, well.  Um --
R:  But how do y'all usually +celebrate -- -brate Christmas?  Uh, do you like have all the family in, um, exch- --
L:  Yeah, I -- I usually -- actually I -- I visit -- I visit my mother and just my -- the rest of my family goes there and she lives in Nebraska, so 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so it's -- you know, it's a little more country there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, y'all exchange gifts and that type thing, uh, for Christmas?  Or do you all just get together more than the ex- exchange of gifts?
L:  Um, my -- my Mom has a rule that none of our gifts can cost -- for each other can cost more than ten dollars, so it's usually more of a -- like a creative -- trying to figure out what you can do that's meaningful and -- and it's cheap, and she thinks that that's like the most fun way to do it, so that's what we usually do.
R:  [NOISE] Well, yeah, that -- that would be for sure, uh --
L:  Yeah, it's fun.
R:  Yeah, um, trying to come up with a ten dollar gift these days --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's hard!
R:  -- would be quite a chore. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's usually making something.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah -- yeah, now that would be a neat thing to do, is to make things and exchange what you've made.  That would mean a lot more also.
L:  Yeah, it turns out --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it winds up being a lot of fun. 
R: [NOISE]
L:  What -- what do you usually do for the -- for the Fourth of July?  Like, do you have fireworks and stuff, or -- 
R:  Ah, yes.  Yes, uh-huh, we kind of all go in and we each bring, you know, um, a -- a few fireworks each.  And of course --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- time we get together, there are a little over fifty of us.  That's --
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R: -- the immediate family, of course, you know, I have like seven brothers and sisters.  They're all married and they have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, three or four kids apiece, and then they have kids.  So, it's like great grand kids that are coming in now, and both my parents are still alive.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, uh, it makes up qu- -- quite a large family.  So --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- we all get together, uh, I mean, everybody usually comes in, um, and, um, we all bring a few fireworks each and time each family brings a few fireworks --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- uh, then we make, uh, we go outside, have barbecues.  We -- several of us bring barbeque grills --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then we have homemade ice cream, we make homemade ice cream outside.
L:  Oh, that's awesome.  How -- how do you make homemade ice cream?  I've never, I -- I don't know anything about that. 
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]  Okay, well you do your own mixture.  You do, you know, like the milk and, you know, the sugar and the eggs, and, um, there's different recipes we use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And every family makes their own favorite ice cream --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and my favorite is banana.
L:  Oh, cool!
R:  And um, yeah, you mash up some, um, bananas just in a mush and put it in, and you know, uh, when it freezes, oh!  To me, it's delicious!
L:  Yeah, that sounds really good.  
R:  Um.
L:  I've never had banana ice cream.  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- but it's real -- homemade, you know, it's really good.
L:  Wow!
R:  Um, and of course each family does their own, and like my mother always makes vanilla, that's her favorite.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, she always makes vanilla.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, and of course at this point, they're elderly, so you know, we usually do the freezing part of it.  They're used to -- we did the old hand crank --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but we've all gotten so lazy by now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- until it's all electric, you know, stick those electric --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- you know, let 'em do their own thing --
L:  Yeah, it's lots easier.
R:  -- while we're doing the barbeque, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, but, um, you know, and it -- it's, you know, outside and you know, then when it gets dark we do the fireworks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and we just sit around and, you know, kinda visit.  We usually si- stay up 'til after midnight on, uh, the Fourth of July --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just visiting --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- because then come the next day most everybody, you know, starts dispersing back out and heading back home.
L:  [MN] Wow!
R:  Uh, so we usually try to arrange at least two days when everybody is there, and they can, you know, we -- both my parents live out in the country on like a three hundred acre, you know, farm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we have electrical outlets, so, you know, you can pull in campers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, hook 'em up to the, uh, electricity and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty big -- pretty much comfortable, you know, during the -- the heat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And of course the nights are, you know, it's kinda muggy but you know, the nights are pretty good to sit out under the shade trees and, uh, just in --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- folding lawn chairs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, enjoy the time.
L:  Is that -- how often -- how often does your family -- like your whole family get together like that?
R:  Every Fourth of July.
L:  That's --that's like -- like you don't get together for other holidays or anything?
R:  No, no because it --
L:  I imagine it would be hard, there's so many of you! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, right, and you know, they have kids and then they have grandkids.  So, you know, at Christmas they want to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either at home, or you know, with their grandkids and this type thing, so you know, you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't wa- --want to all come in.  Uh, we tried that, you know, before we got so large and it just kind of  w- -- we just didn't have enough space inside.
L:  [MN].  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, you can kind of tolerate the heat.  The coldness -- kids can't really tolerate being cold.
L:  Yeah, yeah that's understandable, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, it just makes a -- a big difference, you know, with the weather, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Outside kids don't know it's hot, you know, so let 'em run and rip at night and no big deal.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  So
L:  That's cool!  So, what's it like being from such a large family?  'Cause I'm -- I'm an only child, so I don't really know what that's like!
R:  Oh, you're kidding? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, I wouldn't know how to relate to being the only child -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because actually --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's seven of us.  There are three younger and three older than I am, so I am the -- absolutely the middle child.
L:  Uh-huh, wow!
R:  So, you know, I -- I wouldn't know because, uh, you know, I'm not the oldest, so I don't know how it would be -- to just be one, you know, the one -- or you know, the baby and that we were all gone by the time, you know, and she was home by herself, so, they can more relate to that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you know, I would -- you know, I -- I can't imagine being the only child because I mean, when we were growing up, it was like, you know, it was like a -- we always had somebody to play with, and you know, we always had things to do, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we were always into something, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's kind of pulled over into the holid- -- you know, the Fourth of July thing, you know, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all of us get together and we're all always talking about what we got into when we were kids --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and this type things, so --
L:  Wow!
R:  So, that's like kind of a major thing, you know, [NOISE] for the holiday, to discuss, you know, old times.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So.
L:  So, what is the -- what is the age range of people that get together on the Fourth of July?  Like how -- how old is the youngest person -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and how old is the oldest person?
R:  Well, my Mom, um, and Dad are both eighty four.
L:  Wow!
R:  And, uh, then of course the youngest, uh -- the last Fourth of July, uh, was only like probably about three months old.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And that was a great, ne- -- uh, nephew of mine.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it would be like a great, uh, grandchild to my parents.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- he would have been the youngest.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it -- so, the age range is from like eighty four -- this year it would be like from eighty four down to, um, let me see  If we're expecting, and I can't remember if we're expecting any new ones before the Fourth or not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know we're expecting a new one in October.
L:  Wow!
R:  But I guess the youngest one now would be, you know, uh, he'll be, uh, ab- -- about fifteen months old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ....
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R:  So, this is this quite an interesting thing, uh, you know, uh, of course, you know, I'm in my fifties.  My brothers are --
