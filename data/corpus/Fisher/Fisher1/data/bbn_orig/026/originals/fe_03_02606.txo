R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  This is Christine.
R:  Hi, this is Brian.
L:  Hello, Brian.  So --
R:  So, uh, the -- the subject is supposed to be what we should do about Iraq?
L:  Yes, and about the disarmament or weapons inspection, I guess.
R:  Right, but I -- I think we're a little past, I mean, the weapons inspections, right?
L:  Well, I think they're still going on.  Didn't they just find some things recently?  I -- I don't think --
R:  Yes, they -- they are still looking for the so called smoking gun, these weapons of mass destructions that the war was all about.
L:  'Cause they never found any really.
R:  They got close.  They -- every -- every one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every couple of days I've heard on the news that they found something that they thought could be it.
L:  An empty something or other.
R:  Right, barrels of, um -- barrels of chemicals that they thought were it and then later they found out they weren't. [SIGH] But, um, I think that considering the expense and -- and what -- considering we went to war, that they ne- -- really should find this stuff.
L:  Well, exactly.  It makes our country look pretty ridiculous that we went in there and, uh, caused so much destruction and still really haven't found much of anything.
R:  Well, I always thought the war was a little more than just about that.
L:  Well, I -- I think so, too, but [LAUGH] we have to stick to the question here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.  Well, yeah, yeah -- well, as the actual question is, yes, we should, uh, continue to look for the, uh, the -- the weapons of mass destruction.  Um, I mean, isn't it -- Iraq as big as the state of Texas?
L:  If that.  Maybe it's even smaller.
R:  So, I would think that to be able to go everywhere, 'cause it was what news item that said that the chemicals were in trailers that were relocated every six or seven days and ...
L:  Mobile, yeah.
R:  Mobile, right.
L:  Well, I mean, again, you know, we're talking about spending a lot of money to do this, to make ourselves kind of justify what we've already done.
R:  Yeah, well, we -- we've secured their oilfields.  I think somehow that offsets the cost, huh?
L:  Hoo, that's the most important thing.  Boy, we can just breathe so much easier now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  At the very least, um, getting the -- the weapons of mass descru- destruction was necessary, but, um --
L:  I was really hoping that they would have found, you know, some anthrax or some, you know, real horrible thing to make it seem worthwhile.
R:  But there were other things they found that were interesting.  Um, that guy who had -- did that terrible thing on the ship all those years ago?  The terrorist who, um ...
L:  Oh, oh, oh, uh, the -- uh, the Klinghoffer incident?
R:  Right.  I mean, they found him.  I mean, to a certain degree right there, there was some, you know -- 'cause the way it was presented, weapons of mass destruction, [NOISE] uh, also it was about harboring terrorists, too.
L:  That's right, and they did seem to flush that, uh, group out a little bit, at least get them on the move.
R:  And there were training grounds there.  So, even though that was the, you know, plan A mass destruction weapons, I think they were all out of B, Cs and Ds.
L:  Oh, I think so, too.  I think so, too.  And I mean, we're going to be there for quite a while, um, I think it's inevitable that somehow we're gonna come across something or other, you know, or nothing at all.
R:  Oh, I think they won't leave until they find something.  I mean, he sounded so convinced that they were there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right?  So, uh, you assume that it's more than just the president going on his gut instincts, that he had some kind of information.
L:  That's true and I -- I would love to be able to see a comparison with some of this intelligence, with what actually was f- -- has been found so far, like a score card.
R:  [LAUGH] You mean the actual intelligence to see how well they've done?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be very interesting because when they drop stuff on us like the Klinghoffer thing, you're saying, "Well, did they know he was there?"
L:  That's right.
R:  And they have these --
L:  Or did they just happen -- did it just happen that --
R:  Did they just happen across him and they --
L:  And get lucky, yeah.
R:  And once they round up all these people on these playing cards, they'll be telling them where stuff is.
L:  Hopefully.
R:  Um, well, they won't have much choice, I think.
L:  If they know.  Well, they did -- didn't they find some [SIGH] professor or doctor who had some kind of information or something?
R:  Which was the guy they called, um --
L:  Doctor Death.
R:  -- Baghdad Bob?
L:  Yeah, or Doctor Death or something.
R:  Right.  I assume he'll be pointing them in the right direction.
L:  Well, I -- I hope for, you know, our -- the sake of our country and just sort of being a -- a rel- -- a noble country, that they do find something. [LAUGH] That some good comes out of this.
R:  Well, I -- I -- you know, it's funny.  I'm not of the opinion that I -- I think it's -- some people may think of it, interpret it as a desperate act, um, but Afghanistan wasn't enough after the towers.
L:  Yeah, I think that people really [SIGH] are just so angry at that part of the world.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, um, yeah.  I would agree with that, that there's a big conflict of exactly, uh, what re- -- America represents.
L:  Right.  And -- and -- but what about p- -- other pl- -- parts of the world?  You know, if we hear that [SIGH], um, they have weapons of mass destruction?  North Korea, for example, or whatever?  You know, do we -- what actions are we gonna take then?  How much money are we gonna spend to find out if that's really true or not?
R:  Well, I think the -- I think that the amount of money spent is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- part of the trick bag, if -- if -- if you know what I mean.  Um --
L:  No, what do you mean?
R:  I -- I mean, it's part of -- okay, we -- we -- we beat Saddam ten years ago, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we didn't go into this war thinking we would ever lose.
L:  Well, that's true.  It was a given.
R:  It was a given we were going to win.  It was a given we'd be occupying the land and +owning -- owning his oil during that occupation.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, therefore, uh, there -- it was a no lose scenario.
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  Now, the peoples like the Germans and the French who were not thrilled with what we were doing, um, that was to be expected, too.  I think all of this was thought out in advance.  We're gonna get Europe pissed off at us, but we're gonna get this oil and people are going to know.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  And I -- I mean, I'm curious, too, whether this government or one of its agencies might even plant, [SIGH] say, weapons of mass destruction, say, "Oops, look what we found" or they may report things have been found that really aren't true.
R:  I don't know.  I would think they would have done it by now if they were going to do that kind of campaign.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there is no pressure -- at least, I don't see any pressure in the way they -- the way it's being presented, him flying on to the ship and the news conference and all that, it's not about -- we didn't go into it to prove that he had them.  We went into it to remove him.
L:  Right, because he was dangerous.
R:  Right.
L:  And he might use these --
R:  He might u- -- he -- he --
L:  -- weapons.
R:  He had used them, um, before on his own people, against the Shiites.
L:  Right.  That's right.  There was a lot of terrible things that happened over there.
R:  Right.  So, and this guy, I mean, the things that you reg- -- you read about what he did, killing his own relatives.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, that was pretty grisly.
R:  Yeah.  And what, I think Barbara Walters had a special?
L:  I didn't see that.
R:  She had, um -- when he took over, when the Ba'ath Party took over, um, in the late fifties maybe, um, he was a criminal of the state when he managed to come back into the country and take over with the Ba'ath Party.  He had been exiled to Egypt for trying to assassinate the leader in -- in his youth.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, Saddam had been -- I mean, he's a career -- I don't know what you call it.  But he's a career dictator.
L:  Yeah, that's it.
R:  And this is what he's always wanted to do.  So, I mean, in many aspects the -- the whole aspect of disarming him, no, I think once we said we're gonna go to war it's about just getting rid of him.
L:  True.  Well, it seems that we've done that.
R:  Yeah.  So, I think it's success on that level at least by the administration's interpretation of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then all that money they found in the zoos over there.
L:  That was interesting.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  That could really help those people a lot if it's real money.
R:  Well, it was American money.
L:  But we don't know if it's real.  It could be counterfeit.
R:  That's true 'cause there was a -- yeah, I read somewhere that there was about the -- the counterfeit, uh, try to destabilize the economy. [SIGH]
L:  I mean, I think it's a -- a terrible part of the world and I -- I hope that these weapons of mass destruction are not just buried somewhere and they're just gonna sort of explode or whatever they do.
R:  Well, I think weapon --
L:  You know, if they're so well hidden.
R:  Weap- weap- weapons of mass destruction, I think it's chemical warfare that was the big thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that's what he had used on the -- on his -- experimented with on -- on his own people.
L:  But we didn't find any of that stuff really.  Not --
R:  Well, not -- not yet.  I mean, you know, I -- what I saw on the news, it's only been forty three days.
L:  Right.
