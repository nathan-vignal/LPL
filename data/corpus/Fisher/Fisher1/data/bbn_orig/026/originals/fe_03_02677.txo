L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, Russ.
L:  Hi, Jenny.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  So, we're talking about ho- holidays?
R:  Yeah, holidays.  And, uh, my favorite holiday, I guess, would be, uh, Easter.
L:  Easter?  You like Easter?
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  Oh, it's a tough one for me.  Tell me why you like Easter?
R:  I like Easter because it reminds me of my grandmothers and they used to make, uh, all kinds of ethnic baked goods.
L:  What background are you from?
R:  Oh, they're -- they were -- they were, uh, Czech.
L:  [MN] And what kind of food did they make?
R:  Like, nut rolls, s- um, apricot rolls.
L:  And tha- and that's always just around Easter time?
R:  Yeah, around Easter time.  And it -- and some holiday cakes.
L:  I like Easter too but I would prob- -- if I had Easter it would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the religious reasons.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] Um, not so much for the food.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm a food person.
L:  If it had to be for food it would have to be, oh, it's between Christmas and Thanksgiving but I'll say Christmas.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] Because at Christmas time that's when we make all the special homemade items like you say, like your grandmothers would make it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We make -- we're Italian, we make e- everything homemade.  Homemade pastas --
R:  I've had all the Italian.  I've -- I have friends who are Italian.
L:  Yeah.  So, we have, you know, Christmas Eve --
R:  The pies with the pepperoni.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I've had that. [MN] 
L:  [MN] So, I think and Christmas also holidays because, you know, with kids and everything it's the excitement of getting the gifts and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being able to purchase something for the people you love.  I think I'd have to go with Christmas as my absolute favorite.
R:  [NOISE] Where are you from?
L:  Chicago.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Con- Connels[?], we're here south of Pittsburgh about thirty five miles.
L:  Pittsburgh?  Hm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm -- I'm filling in for my roommate actually.  I'm studying for a test [MN] on C.C.N.A. for a final, Wednesday.  She, uh, is working afternoon shift today.
L:  And they called --
R:  She --
L:  -- the house?
R:  Yeah.  I was just curious to see what it was like.  It said I could answer it, so I did.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  Her name's Betsy.
L:  It's -- they just want to talk ten minutes about holidays.  So, if you had to create a holiday, can you think of something you would create?
R:  Hm.  Who would I create a holiday for?  I'd say, they're all basically created.  Maybe like a family holiday, you know?  Just s- I don't know, something in the summer time.
L:  Something in the summer time, like a family day?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, I think I want -- you have Mother's Day, you have Father's Day, uh, you have kids -- they even have like a Kid's Day and you have Chris-  -- they don't have anything for single people.  Like the aunts that have done, you know, if you could throw in an aunt card at Mother's Day but how about all the people who just give, they don't have their own kids but they give time to kids and they're not exactly teachers, they're not exactly -- I don't know what you would call it, but just kind of like an Appreciation Day maybe?  Maybe that's what'd it'd be like, an Appreciation Day for anybody else.
R:  Is that ten minutes?
L:  No, I -- I don't think so.  They usually come on and say, that's probably my other line. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  They -- they -- they will -- you can, um [NOISE] -- you can say -- you have thirty seconds to say good bye to whoever you're talking to.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I was just picking up to see -- it was probably my call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that sounds -- I'd -- I'd say that would be a good holiday.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because there are -- are a lot of relatives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you appreciate.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Like my -- I have a couple, I have a great aunt that I -- and she's the, uh, matriarch of the family.  And, um, she's, like, ninety three.  [MN] At our last reunion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she, um, got up and did -- did the, uh, Jitterbug with me.
L:  Aw.
R:  And she can still move around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's a vegetarian.  She can still move around, get around and she's in good health.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah.  There's a lo- -- you know, I could understand that.
L:  That's my other phone again.  Hold on one second but I agree with that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that appreciation.  Hold on one second.  [NOISE] All right --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you can finish.
R:  Okay, that's --
L:  Wait -- wait one more second 'cause -- [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  That's weird because they called my house phone and nobody has my cell phone number.
R:  Uh?
L:  For it to ring, it was freaky.  All right, I am so sorry, 'cause we're talking about holidays and I want them to call me back again.  And I think an Appreciation Day, we're both in agreement?
R:  Yes.
L:  And you just pick somebody who has done something special.  So this way, it's -- at least you can bring in all those people who don't get a special day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then maybe, you know, people would think of them.  But of course they might think, "Well that's a nice way to say it, Appreciation Day".
R:  [MN]
L:  You wouldn't want it to be a pity day. 
R:  No, not a pity day.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  That's not a celebration.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you like want to make people feel special, you --
R:  Yeah, make 'em feel special.  Make 'em feel, like, honored.
L:  And then this way you can come out with any idea that you want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think it's right.  I think it should be in the summer time too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that it can be, you know, just a very lively, bright --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Because, ah, you have all the other holidays and the Thanksgiving and Christmas and everything take up the winter a lot.  You have Halloween and all those, so, I think, yeah.  Right in the midst of summer.  [SIGH] I'm gonna say August.
R:  [MN] Eh, I'd say June.
L:  You say June?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Cause it's -- everything is still new.  August it's so hot.
L:  [MN]
R:  You're in s- -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  You're sweltering in --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- humidity and heat.
L:  That's true.
R:  What's that?
L:  That's true, you've got a good point there. [MN]
R:  [MN] I think, yeah.
L:  And what kind of food would we serve?  [LAUGH] At the --
R:  What kind of food?
L:  [MN] The person's favorite food.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  That would be like you have to do something in honor of them and you have to find something that they like and you do that with them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then something that they like to eat and that's what you serve or you go out to eat.
R:  Yeah.  And the food from their gener- -- or the, uh, music would be from their generation.  Whatever they're into, you know?  Something that takes them back to when they were young and in their prime.
L:  I think that's good. [MN]
R:  Because, like, I was playing a lot of, uh, the old music from the, um, twenties and the thirties and the rest of the family at the family reunion didn't appreciate it.  So I'd say the music would have to be from when --
L:  For the person.
R:  -- they were in their prime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ev- every generation has its music.  That's why they have -- that's why the older generation really don't like the new generation's rap, you know what I mean?
L:  Right, right.
R:  That type of thing.  That type of music.  And, um, [MN] and r- -- you know, I think basically every family has that one relative that --
L:  That does stand out.
R:  -- everybody appreciates.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yup.
L:  Yeah, like I have aunts that have been just like moms to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, there's not a special day for them.  I mean, even though, like I said, you might get them a card or something on Mother's Day, it's still not the same.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, it's not their day.  They s- -- it has to be something just specifically for them. [MN] 
R:  But I'd say that would be about it because I'd -- I'd say we have enough holidays. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, [MN] you know, I mean, [MN] over time you're gonna get to the point where every day is a holiday. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  And then it becomes insignificant.
L:  Well, you know there's certain holi- there's certain days like just card days, that you don't even kn- -- like they started a Grandmother's Day and they start, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, Secretary's Day and all those kind of things to, you know, to tr- -- but if you had just one Appreciation Day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that can cover all those people like the secretaries and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course Hallmark wouldn't like that, just one day.  You have to have special days for everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That way they can keep their sales up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Keep them employed.  Keep the money rolling in.  But, uh, I'd say, yeah, I'd say the family.  I'd say a special family member and their music and their food.
L:  Right.
R:  The kind of food that they appreciate.  Because, you know, if it gets to the point where you get sick of ham, you get sick of -- it's -- actually, I'm just -- I'm a- I'm at the point where I'm tired of food.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  That's why I say -- that's why when I -- when -- when you asked, I said Easter.  Because that was a significant food and now that they're gone, they've passed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we don't have that anymore because --
L:  And it'll just always --
R:  -- everything's quick and easy.
L:  -- be associated with them and --
R:  Yeah, that food is assoc- associated with them.
L:  Yeah, I -- I wonder, like, if my mom died or what -- what -- would we continue our traditions or, you know, how would all that work because that's -- you know, everything revolves around her and the special things that she does and makes at all the holidays.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's, like, I wonder what would happen?
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you'll have your -- then you'll have your own kids.
L:  Yeah, you've gotta try to make your own traditions I guess.
R:  Yeah, and carry the ones on.  You know, that -- that were existing and ...  [NOISE] But you always have that special family member.  And mine is Ida. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She was English. 
L:  Mine is Elizabeth.
R:  She -- oh.  She was English, so she wasn't a hunky woman or anything or -- we call them a hunky Slovak.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Czech.  But, um, it was very -- I appreciated th- that holiday the most.  And this year I tried to continue the holiday by making a nut roll from scratch.
L:  Oh, did you?  And how'd that turn out?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I didn't make it thick enough.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're supposed to roll 'em up, roll 'em up like cinnamon rolls.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I didn't.  I rolled 'em too thin and it was just --
L:  Well, you're just gonna have to keep working on it.
R:  Yeah, well, you know what?  I -- I'll forget next year --
L:  Well, you've got all year long --
R:  -- and I'll forget what I did wrong.
L:  -- to work on it before next Easter, you know?
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I'm sure your girlfriend wouldn't -- would appreciate it if ya made her one once in a while. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd say -- I'd say she'd be more interested in me losing about twenty pounds.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  She'd say, "Forget the nut rolls". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, forget the nut rolls.  "Forget the nut rolls".  [MN]
L:  So, does -- does your girlfriend do these calls often?
R:  [MN] Yeah, she does. And today she had to go in on afternoon shift.
L:  Yeah, this is only my third --
R:  This is her, uh --
L:  -- call.
R:  -- this might be her third.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hope she's not mad that I answered it.  'Cause I was curious.  She couldn't tell me about it.
L:  No, 'cause she'll still get -- she'll still get the credit.
R:  Oh, yeah, she'll still get the credit.  And, you know, she, uh, got a -- a friend of hers to do it too, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, I mean, it's --
L:  I'm sure she won't mind.
R:  No, she'll be disappointed.
L:  She a- she'd probably be more disappointed if she missed a call.
R:  Yeah, well, I'll tell her all about it and I'll tell her who I talked to and what we talked about.
L:  And I think we came up with a great holiday, so ...
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  I think it's
