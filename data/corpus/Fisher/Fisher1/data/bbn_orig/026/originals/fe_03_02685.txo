R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Lottie.
L:  Hello, my name is Nina.  I'm calling from Brooklyn, New York.
R:  I'm calling from, um, Fort Washington.  It's right outside of D.C.
L:  Oh, Washington!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how wonderful!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Thank you.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  I know I'm going to make you laugh when I tell you how long ago I went to Washington. [LAUGH]
R:  How long has it been?
L:  Oh my go- -- that's when the World Trade Center was still up. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.
L:  The Pentagon was still there. [MN] I got married in nineteen seventy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- six, and at that time -- were you in Washington then?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, no we -- we came here in ninety nine.
L:  Oh.  Because if, you know, we were just [MN] on our honeymoon so we really were not residents, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at that time there was the bicentennial --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- and there was the free bus going, um, it was like a tram.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And it was going all over the city for free and you just --
R:  Aw.
L:  -- hop on and off.
R:  Aw.
L:  Aw.
R:  Did you enjoy the sites?
L:  Yeah, it was beautiful. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was actually so beautiful.
R:  We, um --
L:  Yes!  Well, at that ti- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think w- -- the way you said it, we're probably the same generation.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was in my, uh, in my twenties, and I'm fifty one now.
R:  Oh.  It -- we just enjoyed it.  We just recently took a tour into D.C. --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and looked at the monument.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause m- -- we were military and we decided to retire there.
L:  [MN] Ooh.
R:  It was --
L:  Are you both military?
R:  Um, I was a DA, Department of the Army worker, civilian, and he was active duty army.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And it was just wonderful.  Oh! 
L:  Oh, y- [MN] --
R:  I mean, breathtaking.  I thought we saw the world.
L:  Oh!  I -- I hope you saw the , uh, Vietnam Wall?
R:  Uh, yes.  And I -- because [MN] we're Vietnam era, um, vets, and we just stood there and cried. [NOISE] 
L:  Aw.
R:  [MN] It was just amazing.
L:  Aw.
R:  And you look at the names of the people that gave their lives --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- and I -- I feel so fond of these young people right now, I really do.
L:  Aw.
R:  They -- they're doing a justice to their country. [NOISE]
L:  Aw.
R:  And they don't know how appreciated they were.  'Cause in Vietnam we weren't appreciated --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for what we did.
L:  I tell ya, I -- I [COUGH] I personally think the Vietnam War was the worst, in -- in my humble opinion.  I never was in the Service but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my father was a [MN] a -- y- -- uh, World War Two vet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there was no question about the fact that when he left he was applauded and when he came back he was applauded --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- there was no split loyalty.
R:  I know. [MN] I don't know what's wrong with people when it came to Vietnam.
L:  I don't know.
R:  The soldier didn't ask to go there, they really didn't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They were following orders [NOISE] like they are now.
L:  Uh.
R:  And, I mean, these -- we have people losing their lives and these kids today --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take the military for a game.
L:  [NOISE] Were you working anywhere near the Pentagon on September eleventh?
R:  Well, we were actually retired but we lived so close to the Pentagon and we have friends that are still active duty working there, that as soon as, um, the World Trade Center hit, everybody was on the phone communicating.  And people from the Pentagon was calling to check up on everybody and then, um, the next World Trade -- we were sitting there watching television and the next World Trade Center building was hit.
L:  Aw, yeah.
R:  So, we're, like, in awe and then all of a sudden the Pentagon got hit.
L:  Aw, my --
R:  And everybody's, like, "Okay, where is everybody?" we know we're making phone calls, checking --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- up on people, but where are the people that's in the Pentagon? And --
L:  From where you -- from where you lived, could you have seen, like, the smoke and the fire from the Pentagon?
R:  Uh, you couldn't see the smoke and the fire, but what happened was, we all live so close to the district that police cars, even unmarked cars, immediately got on every roadway there was and turned on lights.  Um, you were completely surrounded and jets started flying over.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Um, it was scary, but it was also a safe venture because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we knew we were -- we were being protected.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Schools were immediately surrounded. Um --
L:  [NOISE] Ugh.
R:  Kids were taken out of school.
L:  Ugh. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, everybody banded together.  It was just so cohesive.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, like, now when we go on post, w- we -- we try not to because we're retired, we don't wanna --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- overwhelm the system --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because you never have to check in as much as you do now.
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- it's horrible what these soldiers are going through [NOISE] away from their families.  We've got one neighbor that was a National Guard, [NOISE] he's a DA civilian.  He was working, um, down [NOISE] in, um, [MN] Indian Head Naval Station.  He was called active [NOISE] as soon as the World Trade Center and nine -- nine eleven hit, right?
L:  Ugh.
R:  Stayed active for a year. [NOISE] Just came off of activation this last September and has been called up --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- for an additional year --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- starting next month.
L:  Ugh.
R:  But -- it's horrible.
L:  Aw.
R:  My husband even called to see if he could come off retirement status --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- but they will not pull you off a retirement status --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- unless it's a dire emergency, we've --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- lost hundreds of troops --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- thousands of troops.  Um, [MN] security is just so tight.
L:  Aw. [MN]
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  Mm.  The topic -- the topic that they want us --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry! [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's okay! [LAUGH] No, I'd rather talk about [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd rather talk about what we're ta- -- that, what -- what -- what you're saying, but I just want to let you know so it doesn't ruin it for both of us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that -- that they want us to talk about holidays.
R:  What favorite holiday --
L:  The question is, "What is your favorite holiday?"
R:  Um, I think it's Christmas because I -- I can surround myself with all my loved ones.  Um, and for us Christmas was always a big thing growing up.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We didn't get many toys but we were always together.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was a day of family. [MN] 
L:  [MN] Aw.
R:  What do you think?
L:  [MN] I tell ya, I'd -- I -- it's a funny thing that, um, you'll probably never hear this from anybody in your life --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] but I grew up in a family of nonbelievers. They were atheists because my parents are from Russia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN] And, um, they came over when it was still communism [MN].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And what happened was, they, um, [MN] believe it or not, I grew up with Christmas presents, and the way they explained --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it is that, it wasn't because of God, it was because of Santa Claus, who was a man that never had children and loves children.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, on his birthday, we get the presents. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that is wonderful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and you know where Santa Clause originated from?  Saint Nicholas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Germany.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it is so beautiful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they just leave little bundles at the door for the children.
L:  Aw.
R:  And we did ten years there and we thought it was just amazing.  Um --
L:  Aw.
R:  I think we've seen the world through the -- the eyes of the government.
L:  Actually, I -- I think that -- that holidays -- I think it tends to make people sadder rather than happier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not because of -- of the events like September eleventh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or Iraq, I just -- it makes people feel like they wish it they could be with someone that they're not with, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Exactly.  I tell ya. [MN] M- -- I --
L:  It's very commercialized.
R:  My husband and I, um, were both active duty when we married, so we were both from different states.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was always a given rule that we would drive to his parents for Christmas from Georgia to Washington --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for Christmas.  And, [SIGH] when we went overseas, I became my own person.  I felt like -- because I was able to celebrate with my children.
L:  Mm.
R:  And now that we've retired, his family wants us to get back into the fold as they say, and it's hard because I've created a [MN] -- a tradition with my children --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that I really do love, and they can't understand it yet.  Um --
L:  I think it's wonderful that you, you know, that -- that you sacrifice your personal time and your family life, people don't understand that.
R:  Yeah, they don't.  They really don't.
L:  You know?  Was it hard also for you, like, Valentine's Day?
R:  [MN] Um, it was very hard on Valentine's Day.  I remember, um, my first Valentine's Day over in nineteen ninety six, in Germany.  My husband was over in, um, Cro- -- um, Bosnia.  He was deployed to Bosnia.  And I, uh, he had called me at work, because we opened the Center twenty four hours a day, because it was considered a war time for us.  And he had called every -- all the service members were calling their spouses because they were all deployed from Germany, they were, um, to Bosnia.  They were calling the service members to say, "Happy Valentines" or "We love you" [MN] and the government sent out candy to you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Flowers, they were so beautiful.
L:  Mm.
R:  And slipped on the ice and hurt my back. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh my God.
R:  And ruptured a disk.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  [MN] And --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- and h- h- he -- well, I didn't say a word.  I -- I went to the hospital, to surgery and everything, without him.
L:  [MN] You know, I've heard of that injury, uh, but I've never had it.  Does it -- does it hurt very bad when it first happens?
R:  Oh, God!  It is so painful.
L:  Aw.
R:  You can't even stand up.
L:  Aw.
R:  And at first they thought it was a pulled muscle.
L:  [MN]
R:  And this happened in ninety six, I haven't worked since ninety nine --
L:  Oh my God!
R:  -- because of that.
L:  Oh, I'm so sorry.
R:  Well, I'm still on the government salary though.
L:  Can you walk?
R:  Yes, I can walk, um, I do things.  I have to walk slow, I'm with a cane -- 
L:  Oh, my goodne-
R:  I'm on morphine patches.
L:  Oi, mummy.
R:  But, you know, my government is taking care of me. [MN] I -- I -- they've never missed a beat on anything.  I've had all tests, surgeries, medication.  Never had to pay for a dime.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, we are so blessed in this country.  And -- and -- and I'm -- I'm glad to hear that you love this country as much as I do.
L:  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, you see, I -- I was born here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm -- I'm a native American.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] My parents came here and [MN], um, [MN] believe it or not, because they were atheists, they weren't actually persecuted.
R:  Persecuted.
L:  It's just that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the economic.  That, you know, y- y -- every part of the government gave everybody jobs.
R:  Good.
L:  So it wasn't a problem of unemployment.
R:  Good.
L:  But you could work six, seven days a week, have as much work as you want, and you could --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you could barely have enough food in the house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was horrible.
R:  It was horrible.
L:  And then you had to share your apartments, um --
R:  With the others.
L:  -- with two, three other families.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whatever stories you heard in the papers, are true.
R:  [MN] Now --
L:  You know?  And, um, they came over just for that reason.
R:  [MN] Now, where do you work now?
L:  I happen to work in the courts.  Um, I -- I started off in the police department as a clerk.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then it -- it made very little money so now I work in criminal court.
R:  Oh, very good!
L:  So, you wanna know the truth? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hate it!  I hate it with a passion.
R:  You do?
L:  [MN] Because if you ever pick up a -- a New York paper --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] and, um, I don't know if you read it on the Internet or you -- or you pick up News Day or -- or -- or whatever these N- New York papers have, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Any crime that happens in Brooklyn, New York, I somehow -- either I meet the criminal or I meet the law- --
