L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Cindy.
R:  My name's Aldis.
L:  Aldis?
R:  Aldis.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  We're supposed to talk about holidays, huh?
L:  What's your favorite holiday? 
R:  I don't -- I hate holidays.
L:  Yeah --
R:  We- --
L:  -- me too.
R:  Well, because, I mean, first of all, it's, it's, like, I live in New York City --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I live in Manhattan.  And holidays is when I don't do anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because everyone wants to do something, you know.  I mean, I won't travel on holidays cause everybody else travels --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't go out drinking like on New Year's or Fourth of July or any of those, 'cause that's when amateurs go out and drink --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, so basically, I, I just kick back and take it easy.  I go to the park or something.
L:  Well, I really like Thanksgiving, because --
R:  Thanksgiving --
L:  I love eating -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it brings together my whole family, there's no gift giving, there's no pressure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the only thing I might have to make something to bring, you know, it's, like, a pot luck, but you know, I think if I had to pick that'd be my favorite holiday, 'cause it's, you know, there's no real ritual, there's no rules, you just eat a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] see -- see, that's because you have a big -- you probably have a family that you get together with.
L:  I have a family and we all ended up in the same town, four sisters and my mom.
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and, um, my -- I have a husband -- so, yeah, if I didn't, I think I would hate every single moment --
R:  That's, that's another reason I hate holidays.
L:  'Cause you --
R:  I'm, I'm divorced.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my family, well, my mom, my mom's still alive, but she's in Sac- -- in Sacramento.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I'd -- I'd get out there once a year or something, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, if you don't have a family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's where like Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving, and Easter -- 
L:  And then God for- --
R:  -- those are all family based.
L:  -- and then God forbid, Valentine's Day.  That's a bummer too.
R:  Oh, no, that's even worse, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it said, if you could create a holiday, or something -- I -- I didn't quite catch it -- if you could create a holiday --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what would it be, and so, what do you think?
R:  Well, I actually like -- there's a Latvian holiday -- I'm Latvian.
L:  Uh, wh- -- what is that?
R:  From, from the country of Latvia.
L:  Oh, [NOISE] 
R:  -- and we have a -- we have a thing called Janvjen[?].  Which, which, it's a pagan fest, and we celebrate summer solstice.
L:  Okay.  That sounds nice.
R:  -- and all we do, we go out some place out in the country, and light bonfires and sing and dance and drink.
L:  That sounds fun.
R:  And you spend -- stay up all night.  It's usually about a two or three day celebration.
L:  That sounds fun.
R:  -- you know, and, jump, jump in the bonfire, and, you know, ah, just whatever, like I say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we eat a lot, drink a lot, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and sing and dance a lot.
L:  That sounds really fun.  Well, if I could create a holiday, I'd probably have, like, happiness day.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you could only, you could only be happy and when you caught someone else not being happy, you, you know, it would be, you could be, you could be alone, you could be with someone else, but it was just about being happy and even if things aren't going right, maybe looking on the bright side of things?  I think I do that all the time, and -- 
R:  But that's like a state of mind.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, okay, well, that's the holiday. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I get to invent it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So it doesn't matter if you're getting divorced, and it doesn't matter if you got fired.  You can, you can feel happy because the sun's shining or you can feel happy 'cause the rain's pouring down, and you could get, you get to have hot chocolate, or whatever.
R:  Yeah, it was actually a nice day today, too.
L:  I live in northern California --
R:  Where?
L:  -- it was pouring this morning.  And I drove up the coast to Half Moon Bay, and it was pouring, and then it got really sunny and beautiful.
R:  In fact, the last time I celebrated [MN] my pagan fest -- 'cause I haven't been to Latvia recently -- was at my ranch in northern California.
L:  Oh, that sounds nice! where's that?
R:  Outside of Corning, California.
L:  Okay.  I -- I live in Santa Cruz.
R:  Okay, this is by Chico.
L:  Okay, and, so, do you --  
R:  Basically, we, we, what we did, right, went to there -- I have a country place, you know, and we're -- with a lot of acres, a hundred acres --
L:  Oh, that's nice.  And --
R:  So, I -- we went and got a pig -- ro- and --  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- did, like, a luau, a luau, barbecued pig --
L:  How fun!
R:  -- and then we sit around drinking and playing volleyball all day, and then we light the bonfire, and eat pig, and drink, and sing and dance.
L:  That sounds like a blast! How --
R:  You know?
L:  So, do you still have that place?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
L:  And -- and is it just vacant when you're not there? 
R:  No, I have somebody lives there for me.
L:  Oh, that's awesome.  So, where is Latvia?
R:  Latvia is, it's -- used to be under Soviet domination.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, it's above Lithuania and below Estonia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And kind of -- Estonia's just north of Poland.
L:  And how long have you been in --
R:  I was born in the states.
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but my parents were fr- -- my parents had been here three years when I was born.
L:  But you have an accent, too.
R:  Well, Latvian's my first language.
L:  Oh, okay, that makes sense.
R:  'Cause my parents didn't speak English.
L:  Oh.
R:  So.
L:  What do you think about this survey?  Interesting, huh?
R:  I have no idea.  It's like, you know, they called me and and I, I didn't pick up -- 
L:  Is this your first one?
R:  -- when I --  the first time, I just  called in now -- yeah. 
L:  Okay, this -- 
R:  Have you done one before?
L:  -- this -- I did it last night and the topic was, um, um, [MN] it was political and I was so blown away, it was the, um, whatever of Iraq, you know, disarmament of Iraq.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I, before I had a chance to hang up, 'cause later on I read the email and it said you could hang up -- [MN] 'cause I didn't think I should, I thought, "Okay, well, I'll just do it".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was so scared! [LAUGH] but this topic was -- I just feel more laid back now.  I just -- I think it's interesting they want to see how two complete strangers can come together on a topic, that don't know each other and what they do.  I think it's fascinating.
R:  I actually got [MN] another holiday, okay? 
L:  Okay. Yeah.
R:  A holiday that you can put on whichever day you feel like putting it on at any time.
L:  And what -- um, okay, so, let's see, put on what?  
R:  In other words, you can say, I want, you know, you wake up in the morning, and you say --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- I want today to be a holiday and this is what I want to do.
L:  You know, that's kind of funny, 'cause my cousin and I, we came up with fibs day, you know, Monday through Sunday and then there's fibs day, and every time we get together we say, "Happy fibs day!" and we just decide every now and again that it's going to be fibs day -- 
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and we just celebrate.
R:  Well, see, yeah, that's what I'm --
L:  So that's just -- I -- that's [LAUGH] cool --
R:  -- talking about.  And -- but -- you don't -- you know, you don't even, you just say, all of a sudden, when you wake up, you say, "Hey, man, okay, it's a holiday today. --
L:  Would you not, would you not go to work, too?
R:  -- and this is what I'm celebrating".  No I wouldn't, no, remember, it's your choice.  It's your holiday.
L:  That -- I love it --
R:  So, you can do whatever you want! If you want to go to work, you go to work, if you just want to lay in bed all day --
L:  I love that holiday.
R:  -- and eat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you want to -- you know, whatever you want to do.  Because it's like, like I said.  It's like whenever you want it to be, and you can decide on the spur of the moment.
L:  Okay, I'm going to do it.  Are you?
R:  I -- I sometimes do that anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  I like that!
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good holiday.  
L:  That's a good one.
R:  It's not like these -- you know, 'cause some of the other holidays, it's like you're expected to do this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  You're expected --
L:  There's a lot of expectations --
R:  You're expected to do that --
L:  Well, yeah.  Like, I mean, well, Christmas, obviously, and everything's closed, even Easter, I went to, like, Office Max, I was so excited, 'cause I was going to look at this chair on sale, and it was Easter! they were closed! 
R:   Hey, Labor Day, in the US has the biggest sales, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was in Canada, and nothing's open Labor Day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and we were up in Canada, we were cruising, and we were coming back for -- on Monday, Labor Day, figuring we'd do the shopping?
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and everything was closed.
L:  Now, I would have been, I wouldn't have known that Canadians had Labor Day.  I don't even know what Labour Day celebrates.
R:  Labor.
L:  Why do we celebrate labor?
R:  That's why they call it Labor Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I mean, come on!
L:  Uh, okay --
R:  They call it Labor Day! 
L:  -- okay, and what do you, what do you do for work?
R:  What do I do for work?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was selling software for a company --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I was US sales manager for a software company.
L:  And -- and are you retired?
R:  No, God Almighty, do I sound that old?
L:  No, you sound really young, but I didn't want to, you know --
R:  No, I, um, I --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- I, I've been out of work for about a year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I just do consulting.  I was over in Latvia, did a consulting project and do some other stuff because of nine one one. And New York --
L:  And have you done myst- --
R:  -- the New York economy sucks.
L:  Are you, do, do you do mystery shopping, is that how you found this?
R:  No.
L:  I do mystery shopping, it's way fun.
R:  Yeah, but you gotta get, they gotta -- you gotta get picked for it.
L:  Well, yeah, you just keep applying to companies that hire mystery shoppers, and I do 'em all the time.
R:  Really?
L:  I -- I do, like, three a week.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they're really --
R:  I never wanted to send somebody fifty bucks to get a list of mystery companies and hope that I get something. See, most of them want money.
L:  I signed up with m- money and shopping dot com and it's, like, twenty nine dollars, and I got a list of a hundred and seventy eight companies that hire mystery shoppers --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and I -- I feel happy with it. The person who --
R:  Yeah, I, I don't, you know, I just don't believe in those lists.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't have done it if someone didn't recommend it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So let's see --
R:  I did this off Craig's List.
L:  What?
R:  Craig's List.
L:  I don't know what that is.
R:  You've never been on Craig's List?
L:  Uh-uh!
R:  Okay, you should check it out, in fact, it's based in San Francisco.
L:  What -- [MN] how do I check it out?
R:  Go to Craig's List dot com.
L:  Okay, I'll -- I --
R:  C.R.A.I.G.S.L.I.S.T.
L:  C.R. -- C.R.A. --
R:  I.G.S.
L:  I -- I.G.S. 
R:  L.I.S.T. 
L:  L.I.S.T. dot com.
R:  They have everything on there.
L:  Okay, I'll --
R:  I sell everything, apartment rentals, jobs, you name it.
L:  It sounds awesome.
R:  -- dating, I mean, you know, whatever.  They have all kinds -- [MN] it's, it's, it's an amazing web site.  And they have different cities.
L:  What time is it over there?  Five to seven -- eight thirty?
R:  I don't know, something like that.
L:  Ah!
R:  Yeah, eight thirty four.
L:  Hm!
R:  I'm actually watch the NCAA finals in volleyball, too.
L:  Oh.
R:  So.
L:  Well?
R:  But, yeah, no, Craig's -- I'll tell you how I found out about this.  But it's like I said, those mystery shopping things, people said, yeah, yeah, just send us the money and I just never wanted to send anybody the money.
L:  Yeah, I don't like to do that either and someone I really trusted said this is a really good one, that's why --
R:  But I mean, what do you do -- you get a hundred eighty seven and you got to apply to each one of them?
L:  Yeah, it's really a pain in the butt --
R:  -- and then, someone will want money again, don't they?
L:  -- you know what, I did it -- I did it -- no, none of them cost money. 
R:  Oh.
L:  But I did it in a week
