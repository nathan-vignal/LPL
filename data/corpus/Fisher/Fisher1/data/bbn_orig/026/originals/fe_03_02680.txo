L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  My name is Susannah.
R:  Hi, Susannah.  I'm Matt.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, Matt. [NOISE]
R:  Where are you, uh, where are you calling from today?
L:  Uh, I'm in New York City. [NOISE] What about you? [NOISE]
R:  Aye, in New York?  Okay, I'm in Texas.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Where in Texas? [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, in the Dallas area.
L:  Okay, I went to school in Austin.
R:  Oh, that's [MN] a much better area. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] yeah?
R:  Than -- than -- than anywhere around Dallas.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I actually did -- have you done one of these before?
L:  No, not yet.  First one.
R:  Okay.  I -- I did one yesterday for the first time, so we're both relatively new at it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [MN] --
L:  So, what, we're supposed to talk about holidays?
R:  Yes, about holidays, which one's our favorite and -- and if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you could create a holiday, how would you do that?
L:  [MN]
R:  Um.
L:  [MN]
R:  What do you think?  What -- what do you consider --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your favorite holiday?
L:  Um, Christmas.  Definitely, actually, for me.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  What about you?
R:  Uh, [PAUSE] I don't know.  I -- I guess Halloween --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- would be a better holiday for me than -- than Christmas.  Uh, I know in New York there's plenty of, like, commercial stuff going on [MN] all the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I gue- -- Ha- Halloween and New Years is always a toss up for me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause they're -- they're a lot more fun.  You don't have as many obligations as you do with Christmas, to buy stuff.
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  So, anyway ...
L:  [MN] I always liked Christmas 'cause my family always just, has a really calm time.  Like, we make a fire and we open presents at night and it's always really just, kinda quiet and -- I don't know, it's nice.  Kinda my favorite.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] You got a very different family than I do.
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I've got a four year old so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sh- she -- it's -- it's all about gifts, you know?  You -- you have to buy, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how ever -- how ever many thousands of gifts in --
L:  Well, it's that --
R:  order to --
L:  -- I don't have any kids yet, so I just go -- I'm not married, is I go over to my parents' house, you know?  And so it's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I only have -- well, I have, like, one sister, but that's not -- my family's not too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too big --
R:  Ours --
L:  -- and crazy.
R:  Ours is the -- the first grandchild on both sides.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, Christmas is always a -- a major ordeal that the -- the -- the parents on both sides trying to out do the other parents on --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH].
R:  -- what they're gonna get, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Any- anyway ... But, um ... So, [MN] creating a holiday is kind of an interesting concept.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  As -- as far as, I mean, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do we need another holiday, really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But, uh, yeah, I don't know either.  It's funny that they ask that question because I just actually, I was, like, just applying for this scholarship, [NOISE] I'm going to go back to school next year and it was -- it was, like, this Italian American scholarship, whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it said, "If you could create a holiday, what would it be?" [LAUGH] and so I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible] like, a little essay about it, but I so -- I said I would create Immigrant's Day.  And it was totally because I thought it would be a good [MN] essay but [NOISE]  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it was kinda true.  I thought it could be kinda cool, like -- like, a little [MN] Immigrant's Day where they'd have parades about -- that would kinda celebrate everybody's backgrounds, you know?  Like -- and just in school, like, everybody kind of sharing, you know, where they're from, what the traditions of their family were.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  That -- that would be a great holiday.  That would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be in- inclusive --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- uh, it's -- it's --
L:  And you'd, like, get to learn, like, celebrate your own past but then also, like, learn [NOISE] more about other people, you know?
R:  Right.  It would be a -- a -- an -- [MN] it would be open to every -- it would still be a holiday that's open to everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, they always have a big fit about Columbus Day or they have a, you know, Saint Patrick's  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Day, or whatever, that's only for one particular group of Americas.  You know, that's -- tha- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of an interesting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- concept --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  Because none of us are then, I guess, native Americas are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, originally from here --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- lineage wise, but ...
L:  Yeah, that would be -- but mostly, yeah.  That's what I thought.  I was, like, "Well, mostly all Americas" that's pretty much everybody except for Native Americas, although --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- them too with, well --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- what do they --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- like, way back a long time ago, but [SIGH] ... [MN] 
R:  Yeah, I don't know what I would come up with for a holiday.  Any -- anything where, uh, you got off work and you didn't have to do anything.
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH] 
R:  You weren't -- y- you weren't required to do anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in particular --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- other than, like, get together with family and eat.  That'd be okay by me.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I agree.
R:  You know?  There's no -- no particular meal, no, "You have to have turkey" no, "You have to buy gifts" you just -- you show up, you have a big family ga- -- like, Family Gathering Day, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just get together with your family and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- put all the -- the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the, uh --
L:  Yeah. I know what you mean.
R:  -- bad stuff aside. [LAUGH] [MN] 'Cau-
L:  I could even go for, like, a holiday on just, like, a Wednesday just for a change.  Like, I love that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you get these three day weekends, like, Memorial Day and Labor Day, but then they're all so, like, everybody's going out of town, you got all the traffic --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] If you just had, like, a Wednesday, there'd be not much to do except for, like, relax and go to the park or something, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Could be -- could be kinda nice.
R:  Yeah, that's a really good point to me.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I kinda like that.
L:  [MN] Cool.
R:  Well, I mean, that's just kinda what I -- that's what I don't like about a lot of the -- the holidays we have now, is it's all, you know, commercial.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Y- y- ya have to buy this, you have to get Valentine's Day cards.  You have to get candy and roses and all that, you know, stuff.  And then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you have to turn around and do -- you're required to eat turkey on Thanksgiving, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  You have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean even though I like New Years and Halloween, it's -- you get to be who you want and really the only requirement is you have the eat the -- the, uh, black eyed peas on New Years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the only, you know, the only requirement.  So --
L:  That's funny, that's like a Southern thing, you know?  'Cause I never knew about--
R:  Is it?
L:  I never knew about that until --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this year.  And I -- that's even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since I moved to New York.  I never even knew about it when I was in Texas.  Nobody told me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- about the black eyed peas.
R:  You -- you don't have a traditional New Years' meal?
L:  No.
R:  No, hm.
L:  No, never heard of it.
R:  I g- -- I -- I guess it's right.  I -- I've got some godparents that live in New York and they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They kinda looked at me like I was crazy when I talked about having [LAUGH] black eyed peas for luck on New Years, so I -- I -- I guess it's just a [MN] -- it may just be a Southern thing, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But at least we don't have any, uh, you know, wild party in the street like in, you know, downtown.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, right.  Yeah, I -- I skip that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's a little much for me.  I don't need to stand out side --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the middle of the winter, you know?
R:  I think the only people that go to that are people from other places.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Like, everybody from -- from -- that I know that's from New York hates going to Manhattan.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like the -- the worst thing to have to do there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So ... Are you from Upstate, are you from ... ?
L:  Um, I'm from -- well, I live -- I live in New York.  I live in Manhattan.  Um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I live though, like, [SIGH] I live at the very north part of it.  And so, it's real, like, quieter up here.  It doesn't look --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you would imagine.  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  It's sorta -- it's like --
R:  Yeah, see, I've got relatives that live out on -- on Long Island but way out Deer Park, past, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that area, way out there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and that's really [NOISE] suburban.
R:  So ...
L:  Just like [NOISE], you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anywhere --
R:  It's --
L:  -- in America.
R:  Yeah, like anywhere, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just got --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- a friend out there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] there the other week. [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  So, yeah, I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinda like that Immigrant's Day.  That's a good -- that's a good id- -- I've never had that in mind, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, uh, anyway.  Um --
L:  Where do you live in --
R:  How's [MN] --
L:  Where do you live in Dallas?
R:  It's kind of north of Dallas.  We've got a, um, do you know where Denton is?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- yeah, definitely heard of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I met a lot of people from Denton.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, north -- north Texas is pretty close up there.  Kinda -- kinda in that area.  Dallas -- Dallas and Fort Worth and Denton are all kinda --
L:  And then it's Arl- --
R:  [inaudible] together now.
L:  Arl- -- is Arlington north too?
R:  Arlington is between Dallas and Fort Worth.
L:  Oh, okay. I didn't --
R:  It's where they kinda --
L:  -- realize they were.  I've been to [inaudible] from Arlington when I was in Texas and I went there [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I didn't really understand the whole geography, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's -- it's the same.  If you haven't been there you don't -- you don't -- I mean, you know, certain places you fly in and you do whatever you're doing and then you leave.  You don't really have a concept of where it is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in comparison to every place else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... You usually have big family gatherings or -- or just, uh, just a few people when you have --
L:  On holidays and stuff?
R:  On  holiday, yeah.
L:  Um, just -- usually just a few.  Like, I guess it depends.  It depends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, but more towards the just a few.  Like, sometimes we'll go with extended family but, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes me and my family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, me and my -- just my parents and my sister and my sister and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- her children will just do something, it depends.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  You -- do you guys -- don't -- y- -- so you're not married yet so you don't have a whole 'nother family that you gotta --
L:  Right.
R:  -- feel obligated --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to drive all over [LAUGH].  Like, [MN] you don't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the grandparents on both sides --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on -- at your house.  And then the grandparents on both sides in your husband's family.
L:  Exactly.
R:  We -- we try to have a small, um, a small gathering, like, at Christmas, and New Years' Eve for one side and then New Years' Day on the other side --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so we're not having to drive all over everywhere.
L:  Right.
R:  Everybody in Texas drives everywhere.  There's no, uh, [NOISE] uh, mass transit anything --
L:  Right.
R:  Around here, [MN] you know?  Like, I drive fifty miles a day for work, you know?  And that's just -- that's, like, normal.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Anybody else would -- or anywhere else in the world you'd get on a train or you'd get on, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something that would take ya --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] right to where you're going.  But down here everybody drives everywhere you go, so, we try to avoid that as much as possible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Having to drive all over everywhere.
L:  Yeah.  How old [inaudible] you have a daughter?
R:  Yeah.  She's four.
L:  Okay.  Oh, that's cute.
R:  Sh- she's still young, so ...
L:  That's a cute age. [MN]
R:  She's getting ready to start school.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  That's nice.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Like, kindergarten in Fall, you mean?  Or starting day care?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, kindergarten in the Fall.
L:  [MN]
R:  She's way too smart. [MN] And that's -- that's always fun 'cause you gotta -- you have to teach her all the -- the meanings of what, you know, Easter is not when Jesus was born, that's Christmas.
