R:  Hi, this is --
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Patty.
L:  I'm sorry, what's your name?
R:  Patty.
L:  Pam?
R:  Patty.  P.A.T.T.Y.
L:  Patty?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, hi.  This is Sandy.
R:  Andy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sandy?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, so what do you think about the issues in Iraq?
L:  Um, I don't know.  What do you think?
R:  I don't -- I don't quite think, I just know they just need to cut it out.  I don't know -- I don't -- I'm not too much into that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know there's bad things going on over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what -- what's happening now, and I don't think they should be doing it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just don't -- I don't dig the bad stuff.  I don't dig it, you know.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's why -- that's why I don't usually have it in my mind, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Bad things always dwell and how long that war went on wasn't cool either.  It was not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I'm not a elder, you know.  You know, I'm not, like, in my forties and stuff, you know, when people worry about, you know, issues in Iraq and how it's affected me.  I have no clue, you know.
L:  Yeah.  No, I actually -- I mean, I know basically what's going on and I'm not really that into it.  I mean, you know, I couldn't sit down here and have a super long discussion with it, you know.
R:  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I know -- I know a guy that was over there, you know, but, uh, I don't quite -- I don't know his last name.  But it's -- it's just, you know, the issues that they had -- give you to talk about [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- you know, you feel the way I do.  You mean -- I mean, things go on over there, it's -- you know, I just wish it just would stop because it's [inaudible] --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- it's going on.  Well, I can do the ten minutes if you can try.
L:  Yeah, no --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I definitely can probably go on about it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  'Cause I'm -- I like to, you know -- when I talk about things like Iraq, I like to put a joke in it a little, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Make it seem not so serious.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because ser- -- how people are so serious is why reasons like this go on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  I just -- me being twenty nine, I mean, I don't have any children.  You know, it's just I don't -- I -- I just don't -- I don't dig it.  I don't dig it and sometimes people don't like talking about bad things because some people dwell on it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  Like, when they found that -- that forty million dollars in that -- in that safe, oh, my God, that was bang right there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What were they hiding -- who were they hiding the money from, the people?  They have, like, no government over there.
L:  Mm.
R:  None at all.
L:  No.  It's just, um -- it's really bad.  I mean, I -- I -- I don't know, I think that -- I don't know, I just think that we should all get along. [LAUGH]
R:  I say let bygones be bygones because, you know, if you -- if you don't it's like a person walking down the street, you know, that they would kill people walking down the street, you know --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- if you didn't live there.
L:  I think -- I mean, I think that, like, what's -- what's going on, I think that I personally was against, you know, the war and everything.  I think that what, you know, we're gonna re- -- I mean, of course we're retaliating, but I think that, you know, they're gonna retaliate and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just gonna escalate.  It's gonna escalate.  It's gonna become this big fat huge thing and I think that we're past that, you know.
R:  Oh --
L:  But --
R:  They don't know, you know.  They have no government.  I mean, imagine you living some place with no government.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  We have one here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  That's why that they're -- you know, they flee from over there.  You can't -- can they imagine that half the time most Americans wanna get away from where they are, too, and come other places?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, we don't exactly love it here.  I've been here for twenty nine years.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm -- where -- where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from New York.
R:  New York?  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, you are?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  The -- the -- the last lady I talked to was from New York, too.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, what was that?
R:  The last lady, she was Jamaican.  She was from New York, too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  Yeah, you know what?  They put up an ad for this in, um, Craig's List and so I'm sure there's been --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you know what Craig's List is?
R:  Huh?  Uh, no, not that paper.  Is that a paper up there?
L:  No, it's, um, it's like a -- actually, I think they have it in Philadelphia, too.  It's just called craigslist dot com.
R:  Com?  Oh, okay.
L:  And it's basically like a, um -- it's like you know how when people put up, like, like, bull- -- like, ads and, like, postings, like bulletin boards and stuff like that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like an online bulletin board for the whole entire city, and they have all these different things, um, you know, from, like, ride sharing to, like, personals to jobs to --
R:  Oh.
L:  For sale items, too.
R:  I got this ad out of the Philadelphia Weekly.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's a free paper that's -- that gives the daily news, but you don't have to pay for it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I saw the ad and said, "Okay, let me call this number".  You know, m- maybe there's some issues that I need to know about Iraq because I'm not really a political person.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, I like to learn other things.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like to learn other things and I would say they didn't talk right to the people that they were talking to or the other people just thought, you know, "Well, we'll talk to you any way we want".  The -- the key to a perfect conversation is not to talk to someone like they're stupid, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  G- give them their leeway.  Why -- you know, I think the whole thing was over oil, though.  Someone told me the whole thing was over oil.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, someone told me the whole thing was over oil in --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- uh, that -- that they were trying to get five percent more money --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- for the same amount of oil.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  The United States was trying to get five percent more money for the same amount of oil that they haven't been paying the five percent for.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, I heard -- I heard that, yeah.  Pretty much it, yeah.
L:  Wow.  That's really interesting, hm.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, they told -- they told me it was just about oil.  And I said, "How can it be about oil?  Why don't you just give 'em their -- you know, their money back?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then again I'm going to still tell you that I'm, like, really clueless about this. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm clueless.  I'm like, "Oh, my God".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They got us talking about issues of Iraq.  This is kinda crazy.
L:  I know.  Well, what do you think is gonna happen?  I mean, what do you think's gonna happen?
R:  I don't know.  It died down a little, though.  It died down a little.
L:  Yeah, everyone's talking about SARS and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  And it has people thinking that it's over with.  But it'll never be over with as long as humans are still here.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I mean we didn't really do anything that big.  Like, you know, I mean, whenever they -- they attacked the -- the -- the towers and stuff, I don't think anything big was going on.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And all of a sudden I was in -- you know, in the middle of nowhere we got attacked, so now that we've actually done something, you know, really bad in their eyes, I think that, you know, how can they do something to get back at us?
R:  You know what?  I wanna laugh at you right now because we are both so clueless. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I wonder -- I wonder, like, what this is for, though?  I mean, I wonder if they're actually talking about, like [MN] -- you know, this whole project, I wonder if they're talking about, like, what we're talking about, if they're talking about, like, [SIGH] how we talk or how --
R:  They're -- I think they're -- I think they probably -- they're probably basing this on, you know, reactions probably or different voice tones and everything like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The lady I spoke to, she sounded really automated.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  She sounded like, "Uh, please leave your -- spell your first name", you know, and I talked ex- exactly the same way she -- without even thinking about it, the way she talked to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just talked the same way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I was like, "Oh, my gosh, she sounds so electronic".
L:  A- and so, what were you guys talking about?
R:  Uh, just, uh, g- getting qualified for it, for -- for the study, yeah.
L:  Uh, oh, oh, oh, I see, okay.
R:  Man, what you say the name of that paper was that you got the study from?
L:  Oh, it's not a paper.  It's, um, an online website.
R:  Is a online thing?
L:  Yeah, it's called craigslist dot com.
R:  Cr- craigslist?
L:  Yeah, like the -- you know, the boy's name, Craig.
R:  Like the boy -- oh, called Craig's List.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, list, L.I.S.T.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Dot com.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I think they actually have it in Philadelphia, too.  Like, 'cause you know, they have it for -- they have it for -- it started out in California --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so they have it for -- they have it for all the major cities, so I think Philadelphia might be on there.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  But I'm not sure.  I'm not sure, but you know, it's -- it's not as big, you know.  Like, the biggest ones are -- are gonna be in, like, California.  And New York is pretty big, and I was just looking today at DC for something for my sister, and it, like, didn't have half the stuff that New York's did, you know.  Like the different categories and stuff like that.
R:  You know what I didn't dig about Iraq, though?  The guys that were over there?  The, um, the -- the POW people?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I didn't like when they were trying to get, uh -- most likely, you know, they were put in this position to f- fight with them against the United States, and when they didn't he killed them.
L:  Oh, what was that?  I don't even -- I wasn't paying attention to that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If they would get the, uh, prisoners of war to fight a- -- fight against the United States with them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that if they didn't do it that was automatic execution.
L:  Oh, oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Of course.  You know --
L:  So, like the -- yeah, brainwash the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't really follow it too much, so ...
R:  No, no.  I just -- I just -- I just don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it, you know.
L:  I mean, you know, I've always been kinda like --
R:  I don't like, you know -- I don't hear anybody talking about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've seen in the papers but I don't really hear anybody talking about it unless you're really, like, political there.
L:  No, you know what it is?  It -- like, who wants to get in a big debate?  And, like, you just never know who you -- it's like if you start talking about it with somebody and then they're just gonna get started and, like, who wants to get, you know, carried away?  Like, that happened at dinner the other day.  I was with, uh, my boyfriend and, like, three of his friends and then, like, they just -- somehow that topic of conversation comes up, and I hate -- like, I try to avoid that because --
R:  Oh.  Ooh.
L:  -- for the next forty five minutes everyone was spewing, you know, their ideas and this and started talking about everything else.
R:  And sometimes you can feel so unwanted in the conversation.  You're like, "Should I, like, be here?"
L:  I know, because they all knew what they were talking about, but I didn't.  You know, I'm like, "I'm just gonna sit here and eat my, you know, fajita". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, chicken fajitas, too.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, man.
