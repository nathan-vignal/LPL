L:  Um, hi, m- my name is Loretta.
R:  How are you?
L:  M- -- I'm good. [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Um ... okay.  D- -- have you ever, um, do you -- done one of these calls?
R:  Uh, no.
L:  Okay, me neither. [MN] so ...
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  You want to talk about holidays?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, I guess I'd take, uh -- uh, talk about Unity Day.
L:  Okay.
R:  We can all come together, cla- -- uh, classes, uh, races, all come together and just celebrate.  Not b- -- just being American, but being, oh, just one people in the world that we can unite [MN] from every aspect and really get to know one another.  And even trade cultures, and share amongst one another.  Take on practice some others to learn more about each other.
L:  That's good.  Um, my favorite holiday is Valentine's Day. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, 'cause of love.  And I just get real excited about it, uh, more than Christmas or -- or Easter or even the --
R:  Why Valentine's Day?
L:  Why?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm, because it's, um, [MN] because it's love.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it makes me happy.
R:  Oh, I hear that. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I understand that.  That's beautiful.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, I really believe, uh --
L:  Do you know of any holi- -- excuse me?
R:  Hm?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my favorite holiday is, I guess, maybe Christmas.  Uh, it's just, uh, how Christmas -- a -- the atmosphere just takes over and everybody has -- seems to have -- be in cheer and goodwill towards men.  It seems, uh -- uh, the season of it without commercialism it's just a beautiful thing.
L:  Yeah, it is -- it is an exciting time except, you know, like you said, commercialism, you know, 'cause of the money aspect. [MN] You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause if you want to start buying presents for everybody, where does it end?  But you'd really like to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you started to.  But you really don't have all the money to.
R:  [MN] Yeah, b- but I believe, though, if y- you also share, you know, feelings, it -- it's -- it's just, um, I don't know, I can talk to my sister on the phone and just share.  And I believe that, uh, you have things that you can share and -- and ca- call -- uh, just [MN] uniting and -- and take those things with you and, I don't know, just the feeling of it.  It's not -- it's really not the presents, it's just the -- the atmosphere of family and -- which is a beautiful thing.  And, uh, I -- I -- my sister's in Minnesota, my mother's in -- in the San Francisco Bay area and uh -- it's just, uh, [MN] it's just when I can talk to family and unite.  It's just a warm -- get that warm fuzzy feeling.
L:  Yeah, [MN] yeah.  Um, uh, where do you live?
R:  Uh, I'm in the South Bay.  Uh, like --
L:  You're in Cal- --
R:  -- Paolo Alto.
L:  [MN] Oh, you're in California?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, I -- I -- I live in Pennsylvania -- in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  How's the weather out there?
L:  [MN] Today it's, um, [MN] it's a little cooler than it was yesterday.  Yesterday was really hot and muggy, like in the eighties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and today it's in the sixties and wintery.  It's kinda cooler, but it's still nice.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's still pretty nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] But it's away from h- --
R:  So, what's your favorite part about Valentine's Day?
L:  Well, [PAUSE] hm [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what part of it?
R:  I mean -- I mean --
L:  Well, see it's all mental, so ...
R:  -- is it the romantic part?  Is it -- it's just the stuff, you know, the g- --
L:  No, it's just the happy love part.  It's not -- it doesn't have to be, um, like, a male female --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happiness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just that you can be in love with everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just make it special -- special for myself, and as a matter of fact I -- I, um, take a week off of work.  You know, I have two weeks vacation from my job.
R:  Oh.
L:  And one of my weeks I take Valentine's Day week. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  And I just make the whole week special.  Yeah, yeah, and the other week is my birthday.  So, they're my two favorite days.
R:  Oh, congratulations.  That's beautiful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That really is.  I'm an incurable romantic so I kinda like stuff like that.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, see, yeah, me too.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even if I don't have someone in my life at the time, I still make it special for myself.
R:  Huh?
L:  Even if I don't have, um, someone in my life, you know, a male --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I still make it special for my- --
R:  Same here.  I do the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I do the -- I don't have a family or whatnot, but I d- -- kinda do that, uh, do the Christmas thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- set up the tree, put on the lights and, uh, tinsels and, uh -- uh -- uh, all the trimmings and stuff.
L:  That's good.  Um, past few years I haven't done that and, I don't know, I think -- I think I'm m- -- coming around to that again mentally, because I -- I missed not doing it last year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] so -- so much that, I mean, I let it sort of pass by as a non-holiday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it left me feeling kinda empty by not celebrating it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I think, um, I'm gonna have to change [LAUGH] my -- change my ways.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  M- [MN].
R:  I m- I do the same.  I- I try to, you know, y- y- y- you c- -- you can easily fall into that loneliness around stuff, but I really try to feel my time and -- and just think, if I haven't -- if it's not come now, it's gonna come, so ...  You know, there're things I can do to myself and for myself to better myself as a person and -- and, uh, before I can love anybody I have to show some love to myself.  So, I just sit and study and -- and really prepare and -- and just celebrate because the whole purpose of life and the pur- purpose that I'm capable of loving and capable of sharing is -- is a gift in itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  So, I just try to work and grow to be stronger.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm -- I'm here.  I was just trying to -- I was just thinking of what else I could expand on on holidays.
R:  [MN] I know, uh, uh, well -- well, do you like sharing the holidays with people?
L:  [PAUSE] Um --
R:  Or do you --
L:  -- y- yes.
R:  -- like to share, you know, is your favorite part of being alone on that holiday and really basking in the holiday?  Or do you like, being around family or friends?  Uh ... [COUGH]
L:  Well, late -- well, [MN] let me see, lately --
R:  You know, on Valentine, do you spend it by yourself?  Do you, what?
L:  Both.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Part, I like -- I like doing it equally, I guess.  Part with family and friends and part by myself.  Because I'm getting older, too.  You know, that has a lot to do with the, um -- [PAUSE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why?  [LAUGH] I'm just thinking of why does it have a lot to do [LAUGH] with it?
R:  No, no.  I mean, well -- well, I was about to -- that was my next question.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That was definitely my next question. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I j- -- I just got myself stumped. [LAUGH]
R:  You gotcha what?
L:  Myself stumped.  I mean, I don't know the answer to that one or why [MN].
R:  Uh.
L:  Huh.
R:  Ye- --ah.  I kin- know.  I don't know.  I -- I like them quieter.  New Years, I like a quiet New Years.  Just, you know, me and the revel into the new year.  And then there's holidays where I'm -- like, Valentine's Day I like to give a rose to everybody, anybody I can. [MN] And then on, uh, Thanksgiving, I like to be around family and, uh, friends.
L:  Okay.  Well, Thanksgiving, yeah, that's a must.  The family and friends is a must.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, well, I cook. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I have to do that.  I have to have a turkey every year.  Even -- I mean, I -- I -- when my -- I had -- I have two children, right?
R:  You have what?
L:  Two children.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And even when they were little --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --would bake a who- -- a whole lot of food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and cook a whole lot of food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the -- you know, even if I didn't w- -- you know, b- I'm babbling now.  Even, w- um, if there was nobody else to eat.  But they'd eventually come.
R:  So, what's your favorite holiday dish?
L:  [PAUSE] Oh, besides the turkey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm, I guess -- [PAUSE] well, I like all the food. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just thinking of -- I'm just eating it right now in my head.  Mm, I like greens.
R:  Mm.
L:  Potato salad. [MN] Um, hm ...  I like, I guess, all the traditional holiday --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- food.  Not getting away from the traditional.  I don't want to change them up any.
R:  Mm.  And for Valentine's Day I think I -- I have a one special dessert I like to make [MN], you know, I don't know how often I do it, I think I'm gonna do it next Valentine's, I didn't do it this year, [MN] it's a red, uh, velvet cake with, uh, kinda like a sour cream icing.
L:  Ooh, that sounds good.
R:  And it is all -- it's one of them specialty holiday cakes.  And I like to bake and I like to do s- some kind of special dessert or something around every holiday to reflect the holiday and make it really special. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I kinda missed this year Valentine's Day.
L:  How come?
R:  Um, I'm trying to figure out what else I can think about holidays?
L:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, there's not much.  Do you -- do you -- do you hunt Easter eggs? [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, yeah.  I miss that old -- I guess I was talking to my dad -- I miss that old tradition where you take the kids out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you go -- really go Easter egg hunting.
L:  Yeah, that's fun.
R:  [MN] And you take them out into a patch and, uh, they --
