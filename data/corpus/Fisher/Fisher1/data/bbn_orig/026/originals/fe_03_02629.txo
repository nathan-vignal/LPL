L:  [NOISE] Hello. 
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi
R:  Um, my name's Ed B Hiller, I'm a computer consultant.  I live in Indiana. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'm twenty seven, um, -- I don't know.   [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  It's silly, this is the first time I've done this so I wasn't expecting to talk to anybody soon.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What was your name again? 
L:  Shelley. 
R:  Shelley? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where you from? 
L:  Um, San Antonio, Texas. 
R:  Cool. 
L:  Yeah, where did you say you were from? 
R:  Uh, from Indianapolis. 
L:  Oh, from Indianapolis. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see -- cool.  Um, oh, so like I said have you done one of these before? 
R:  Yeah, I did one, um, before already. 
L:  Okay so exactly what do we do?  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay so we're supposed to talk about -- what was it arms, whether the US should disarm Iraq.  [inaudible] 
L:  Okay that's what I -- that's what I thought. 
R:  Okay -- okay, uh, [NOISE] kind of a silly topic at this point since the war's over but. 
L:  Yeah, right [LAUGH] that is kind of silly.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We did that already. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um. 
L:  [LAUGH] I mean I --
R:  Uh, -- well do you think that, uh, the US did the right thing by invading Iraq? 
L:  Um, I personally do.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I'm kind of worried because they -- cause Bush said that the -- you know to start with the whole deal, he's like we're looking for weapons of mass destruction and chemicals weapons and all of that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they haven't found any yet. 
L:  Yeah, I know that's -- that was kind of -- I thought that was kind of weird too.  Yeah, -- I mean I -- I kind of -- I mean I agree going into it, but yeah, I mean I just think it's kind of scary that they never did find anything. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, so I -- yeah, you just never know what's going to happen -- I mean right now everything's good but then again you don't know -- yeah, it's kind of scary thinking about the future. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, [inaudible]
R:  I guess there's still resistance over there so. 
L:  Yeah, but, um, 
R:  Could have another September Eleven thing happen -- I hope not, but -- 
L:  Yeah.  I know that is kind of a scary thing.  [NOISE] But [LAUGH] you never know.
R:  Did you see that thing on CNN?  Or -- no MSNBC where the -- like the Navy ship was coming back into port, and it, uh, had like the five thousand Navy guys on the boat and they're all like waiting to get off the boat, and there's all of these people on the dock waiting for them and they're talking on cell phones and stuff.  Did you see that? 
L:  No I didn't see that.  Is that the, um, same boats that, um, that Bush landed on? 
R:  Yeah, the Abraham Lincoln.
L:  Oh, yeah, no I didn't -- I didn't -- I saw him when he was on it last night but I didn't see them coming into port -- was that today or -- 
R:  Yeah, that was earlier today. 
L:  Oh, okay, no I didn't see that and their families and stuff were all there? 
R:  Yeah, they're all there waiting, and they all had like American flags and stuff.  Be a pain to find anybody. 
L:  What's that? 
R:  I said it would be a pain to find anybody. 
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Too many people there. 
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  We'll be the one with the American flag. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Good luck. [LAUGH] Yeah, just the amount of people they have on that boat it is amazing that they had that many -- you know that many people on -- can be you know on a ship --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just to find someone.  [LAUGH] But, um, yeah, it is cool. [inaudible], um, okay like on this -- like how long  I mean what are we supposed to do exactly -- like my aunt referred me to this but  
R:  We're supposed to talk for ten minutes. 
L:  Oh, okay [inaudible] 
R:  And then they go back and listen to the tape -- hi guys -- and I don't know what they use it for but  
L:  Oh, okay I see and then like at the end of ten minutes do they like stop you or something and then ask you questions or  
R:  Yeah, a little recording comes on and then says -- like the ten minutes is up and you got thirty seconds to say goodbye and then it hangs up on you. 
L:  Oh, okay -- okay -- yeah, cause they tried to, um, -- tried to call me several other times and they kept missing me so [LAUGH] this is now what -- they called in and like something background, I couldn't hear -- so then all of a sudden you were on the line so [LAUGH] I was like, "Hello".  [LAUGH] Okay [LAUGH] yeah, it's kind of neat -- yeah, my Aunt had done -- she said she had done like three different ones so. 
R:  Yeah.  What, um, -- where did she hear about it from? 
L:  Um, just she -- I don't know how she heard about it, she just sent me an e-mail, um, --  it's a referral link or something so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know she is always getting different things on the Internet so [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it found -- it was posted on a bulletin and I signed up for it -- cool. 
L:  Oh, okay -- cool. [inaudible] And like every time you talk is it always about Iraq or is it different things? 
R:  No -- no last time it was, um, -- what was it about.  I can't even remember what the topic was -- it was a -- I talked to some, uh, retired woman in Kansas City -- I think it was. 
L:  Oh, okay -- different things. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's all over the country -- cool. 
R:  Yeah, -- pretty weird since it's like the University of Pennsylvania [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, -- yeah. 
R:  Well there is other people who found out about it but  
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] yeah, but this kind of topic -- I don't know it seems like they --, um, it is kind of hard to talk about cause it's already [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, it's already happened so  
L:  Yeah, so 
R:  Did you see that picture of the, uh, soldiers sitting in like this real expensive chair in one of Saddam's palaces, and they were like smoking a cigarette?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that was funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That was great. 
L:  Oh, it is [inaudible] [LAUGH] What about -- do you think he's alive or do you think he's dead? 
R:  Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say. 
L:  Yeah, I know I -- I -- all along thought he was then -- yeah, it's just hard to say -- you don't know if he's gonna -- twenty years from now you know pop up somewhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So -- yeah, I don't know [inaudible]
R:  My guess --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is that they got him, but -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- that's what I would think so too [inaudible]
R:  I'm kind of worried about the -- the whole like link between Bin Laden, and Iraq. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That's not really firmly established in my mind yet. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Seems like two separate things. 
L:  Yeah, I know, cause yeah, -- 
R:  We're gonna go bomb the crap out of Iraq because -- wait a minute [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Really no say -- yeah, cause I mean like on the other hand you know Bin Laden's still -- what if he's not dead and yeah.  [LAUGH] So it's kind of -- 
R:  Yeah, and he's not even from Iraq, he's from -- he's from Afghanistan isn't he? 
L:  Yeah, he is -- yeah, I think so.  He's from somewhere else -- yeah, [inaudible] Yeah, I know it is kind of weird thinking it's like what if -- yeah, -- what if something else happens would it -- you know like they're two different cases and you know what if he pops up and does something else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So yeah, it is kind of [inaudible] --
R:  Can't really go bomb -- bomb Iraq some more.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] What more can they do?  [LAUGH]
R:  Could bomb Syria for a while. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I think they pretty much done their do over there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Move on so -- yeah, I know it's just, uh, -- it is scary thinking but I mean we have to do what we have to do, but yeah, is that kind of a scary case.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um, that is [inaudible] [NOISE] they're still -- I mean they're [NOISE] [inaudible] then hopefully [NOISE] you know something doesn't [NOISE] pop up like September [NOISE] eleven again.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  All of that so -- yeah, it is scary thinking but  [LAUGH]
R:  Of course the other thing is I wonder is if the government's really -- if they've caught Bin Laden, or if they were for sure Saddam's dead or either way and then --
L:  Yeah, -- yeah.
R:  -- like can't tell us for some reason. 
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking like maybe they -- yeah, know more than what they really tell you and -- yeah, -- or if like Saddam's not dead and you know [LAUGH] you think he's marching all of these guys in his palace.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Tearing those pictures down.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think he was behind like a mirror. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] He's either really scared or just [LAUGH] -- or just yeah, -- or else he's planning on something but I -- I would think they probably got him.  That would be my guess. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But god I mean I would just think he's the type of person who would, um, you know if he wasn't dead would [NOISE] -- you know would come out or something you know I just -- same as Bin Laden, I just wonder about him too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is he really 
R:  If they got him in one of those caves. 
L:  Yeah, I wonder -- yeah, cause I know I've heard different, like people talking stuff and they say that you know his past history he's not the type that if he was alive he would just let -- you know you wouldn't -- we haven't even heard from him in all this time so.
R:  Right. 
L:  So yeah, so I just don't know.  [LAUGH] Keeping low or is he crazy, you don't know what -- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You don't know really what's have on their mind
