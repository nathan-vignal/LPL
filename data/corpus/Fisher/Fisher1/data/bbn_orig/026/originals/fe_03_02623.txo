L:  Patty, hey.
R:  Hello.  Debra, hi.
L:  I'm fine.
R:  How you doing?  Where do you live?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Brooklyn.
L:  [COUGH] Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, our t- --
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  Our topic is how we feel about Iraq?
L:  H- how do we feel about Iraq and was the -- was -- is -- should everything stop and what's the major priority?
R:  [NOISE] I think it was, uh, how do you feel about disarming -- the disarmament about Iraq?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  You heard something I didn't. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  'Cause I'm, like, kinda clueless but I'll try to bear with you.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, I'll be there.  Ten minutes is cool. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  They said if you can [NOISE] try to get at least eight. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, they cut us two minutes' slack.
L:  'Cause I'm, like, cool out, you can do ten minutes, you know.  Ten, eight minutes, that's cool.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  All right, so ...
R:  I -- I just think that the, uh -- you know, the United States is going into too many countries and if it's Iraq now [NOISE] who knows what it'll be next, you know?  I just feel like maybe we've become the bully of the rest of the world and --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- try to teach them how to live. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  United States just think that they're better than anybody.  They just think -- 'cause you know, we're kinda small, we're not even big, you know, we just have a lot of states --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, yeah, I don't -- I just -- I don't know.  I just told someone else, we was talking about this a little -- couple of days ago, and I told 'em, you know, there's nothing that I can say even about the disarm them -- disarming them was -- you know, that's not gonna not bring another war.
R:  No.
L:  'Cause they're gonna -- you know, they have a lot of weapons anyway.
R:  You can't disarm the entire world.
L:  No, you can't.
R:  And, um, believe me, I live in New York and I went -- I was not far away -- I was in Manhattan the day nine eleven happened.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
R:  And it was -- it was something like you never get over.
L:  That's something that nobody's gonna get over, I don't think.
R:  No.
L:  No, especially when they try to get the, uh, you know, the prisoners of war --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to, uh, to -- to fight against America with them, and if they tell them no that's instant execution, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, they didn't really have a lot of choice.
L:  And that's like -- that's really bad.  That's bad.
R:  No, I wasn't for the war at all, I really wasn't.  I lived through -- how old are you?
L:  Me, I'm twenty nine.
R:  You're twenty nine.  I'm forty seven.
L:  I'll be thirty next month. [LAUGH] This month, rather. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, happy birthday.
L:  The fifteen, yeah.
R:  And I lived through Vietnam --
L:  Yeah, I figure --
R:  -- and I -- I know what a mess that was --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- and so just -- I was really worried getting into another war.  Not only --
L:  I hadn't --
R:  -- would it be --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I figured it would be long drawn out, and I figured we'd go in, they'd gas the shit out of us -- oh, I don't know if you're supposed to say that.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And, you know, with chemicals and things.
L:  Yeah, yeah, they got a lot of chemicals over there.
R:  I mean -- I mean, thank God they didn't get the chance or the opportunity to be able to use any of 'em, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm sure they're there.
L:  I mean, the -- the Twin Tower bombings were, you know -- [MN] I'm like, "I just came from New York not two weeks before that happened".
R:  Oh, what were you doing in New York?
L:  Me, I was there just visiting.
R:  Oh.
L:  Just visiting 'cause I was living in, uh, Spanish Harlem for about, uh, six -- like, two weeks.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and I left there, and, like, two weeks before nine eleven I just came from there.  And I said, "Stop playing".  What are they trying to do, you know?  When we decided we didn't wanna do anything -- I mean, disarming them wouldn't be -- you know, disarming them wouldn't do no difference because the key to a perfect conversation is, you know, not to talk to someone like they're stupid and don't disagree, you know.  Agree on something that's funny.  Put a little bit of funniness along with, you know, if you're feeling angry, do that, too, that way that person can know how to laugh and be angry at the same time but not take it so hard.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and disarming them, now we've got, like, over a million Muslims that are angry at us.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, and -- and what happens when all these disgruntled Muslims start deciding they're going to join up and become very anti American?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, all the money we've spent --
L:  [MN] So un-USA, huh?
R:  -- I mean, all the money we've spent, what was it, eight- eighteen billion dollars?
L:  Eighteen billion, yeah.  I heard about that.
R:  I mean, we could've, like, enclosed the United States for that kind of price. [LAUGH]
L:  And the forty million that they found there in Iraq --
R:  Right.
L:  They found forty million.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How -- how -- what the -- okay, so that's the fine print right there.  Who -- who -- what --
R:  Where did this money come from?
L:  Where did this money come from?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.
R:  Well, you -- you can't even trust Americans 'cause there are -- there are some Americans that --
L:  Oh, man, you put shit in a can, they buy it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, that's very true.  Consumerism at its best. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  Let's sell them something else they don't need but they'll buy. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, crap.  Oh, my God, jelly fish.  And they have no spines, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  I mean, look who our president is, you know what I mean?  Last name Bush --
R:  No, this --
L:  -- and what just happened?
R:  No, this man is nothing but trouble.  I did not vote for Bush.
L:  Yeah, his dad was nothing but trouble, too.
R:  I'm doing this -- [NOISE] I'm doing this for money. [NOISE] Okay, have a good time.  I'll see you later.  Um, no, I didn't like his father.
L:  Huh?
R:  Uh, I didn't like his father.  I'm not totally anti Republican.  I will vote for the best person for the job.
L:  Me, I'm real- -- I'm -- me, I'm -- yeah, exactly, 'cause me, I'm not a Republican and all like that, I'm -- I'm a independent and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it's like, you know, either --
R:  You a registered voter?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  And the whole thing is that I can't vote totally Democrat and I can't vote totally Republican because --
R:  Right, 'cause being independent you don't get into the primaries.
L:  Yeah, because some people, too, that are also, uh, um, Republicans don't like Democrats for some reason, and I don't wanna be categorized as being either one, you know.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  So, I can be on either side anyway.  I'm a delegate.  Keep me -- keep me out your business.  I'll get in it when I want to.
R:  [LAUGH] Good for you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't drag me into that. [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty much.  I'm like a judge.  Look, I'm not your judge.  I'm my judge.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you know, it's just some things -- me, I like to laugh a lot.  I have no children, you know, and it's like I like to laugh a lot.
R:  Ah, so do I.  I have no children either.
L:  And some people that have no sense of humor, you're supposed to have variety speak.  Variety speak is the best kind of conversation.  You can talk about good, bad, ugly, you know, down in the dumps, depressed and everything, and still have a nice conversation with another person, you know.
R:  I -- I agree.
L:  And --
R:  Because, uh, now you know why my mother always told me, "Don't discuss politics or religion".
L:  They -- you know what?  Some [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd never discuss religion.  I'm -- I don't have no religion.  I don't have a religion, but I'm not atheist, you know what I mean?  I believe in God, my heart is a believer, okay.  Religion to me is only enhancing my belief and, you know, when they pass around that plate in church, why should you get my money?  I'm believing enough, my heart is beating, I'm walking around breathing and eating to say that I believe in God.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay, so, you know, religion, they just there that that's for somebody else to collect money with.  "Oh, since they have our religion they -- we can pass around the plate since everybody are zombies now" you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Come on now, I don't wanna fi- --
R:  And look at -- look at what the Catholic -- the Catholics is like.  The -- 'cause Catholicism is, like, the -- the -- they have the most money.  It's like their own country.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  The Vatican has millions, millions.
L:  My God.
R:  And -- and look what they've done with themselves.  You know, they can -- they got a lot to brag about right now.
L:  And half them, uh, people in Iraq are [SIGH] -- they [SIGH] ...
R:  Well, see, they're religious zealots.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they fight and they kill.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, they --
L:  I couldn't even say nothing.  I'm like, "Argh".
R:  They could be Christians and if you're -- you're -- if you're a right wing Buchanan type of Christian, well, you scare me, too.
L:  [MN] Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.
R:  You know, and I'm a born again, but these right winger Christians scare the crap out of me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, imagine what we're gonna do with Muslim zealots that hate America.
L:  Oh, man.  Now, see --
R:  Talk about disarming, forget it.
L:  [SIGH] Disarm --
R:  We don't have to disarm them.  There are millions of 'em.
L:  Disarming, you know that only makes people upset for those that get upset when they talk about disarming.  This is kinda stupid now to talk about disarming when the war is, like, kind of over.  You know, kinda over disarming [MN].
R:  All they want is for the people in Iraq with the guns left that are shooting at marines to stop. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, just stop, and stop taking our people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They didn't ask to be in the armed forces, you know.  And they didn't ask for you --
R:  They don't even get paid enough.
L:  They didn't -- exactly.
R:  God bless 'em for going over there --
L:  God bless them.
R:  -- because they do not get paid -- look at their families are receiving care from Feed the Children, for God sakes.  What does that say about this country?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We'll send our men -- young men off to die but we won't support them enough financially for their families to live?
L:  And how can -- and how can you disarm a -- a country like Iraq when they have no government telling them what to do?
R:  Yeah, all they've got is this --
L:  How can you tell them that?  They gonna look at you like you're crazy and throw a -- and -- and throw a cocktail at you.
R:  Oh, it's just America --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- has really gotten way too big for its britches.  We are in everybody's business.
L:  I think America has given everybody some of -- of a bad name, that they're like throwing off their --
R:  It's like we want to --
L:  -- their -- their -- their little stink on a lot of people.
R:  It's like we wanna go off and conquer all these other countries and then put all our troops in there.
L:  The only thing different about us, we have little places called states.
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yo, wow, this is like -- and I'm twenty nine and I knew when I was seventeen, I looked out the window and saw this really bad cat fight and these girls were -- and the one girl bit the girl's breast and spit it out, and I said, "I actually have to deal with these assholes in life".
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, and I said, "I don't want any kids".  I cried for this world about twice in three years and I felt bad, you know.
R:  There are -- there are -- there are so many children out there.  If you wanna have a kid, go out and adopt one.
L:  Go -- go adopt one, yeah.
R:  That's what you need to do.
L:  Yeah.  I was telling somebody that.
R:  Stop people -- people get so many benefits just from --
L:  From adopting kids.
R:  No, not just --
L:  For just by having a heart, you know.
R:  Not -- well, that's -- that definitely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but these people that have to procreate and create little monsters of themselves --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and they get all these financial benefits.  They get tax write offs for what?  'Cause you produced this thing?
L:  'Cause you produced this?  Oh.
R:  What for?
L:  It's just like them wanting a ovum from a woman --
