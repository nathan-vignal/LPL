L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Dianne.
R:  I'm Kerryn.  How are you?
L:  Okay, okay.  Now, what was the subject agai- -- it was --
R:  I didn't really -- it was something about what we thought was worse --
L:  W- -orse --
R:  Um, taking --
L:  Smo- --
R:  -- caffeine, or taking alcohol --
L:  Right.
R:  Or not exercising.
L:  Uh-huh, right, right.  Okay, um --
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Oh, now we'll figure it out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, anyway, um -- let's see, out of all those what do we think is worse?
R:  I don't know, I -- I'd have to say the caffeine.  Okay, like excessive caffeine in the form of like pills, I would think would be worse than --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I'm not talking about like excessive coffee.  I know [several inaudible words].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I, um -- well, I mean, I -- I think that overeating, um, kinda gets ya -- I mean, it's just -- it just leads to such -- to so many different kinds of health issues and stuff like --
R:  Yeah, could've[?], yeah.
L:  -- that, you know, that -- that's another --
R:  Heart problems and --
L:  Right, you know, so --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  In terms of, uh, trying to [NOISE] -- trying to, uh -- you know, a- again --
R:  The same old [inaudible], yeah.
L:  I mean, the caff- the caffeine too is -- is a, um -- you know, it is a bad habit but, uh, and I mean, I certainly know it can make it people crazy. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Me -- me being one of them at times, but, uh. 
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Uh, I -- I mean -- I mean, especially[?] all those things are damaging but with moderation like everybody seems to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- seems to even out anyway.
L:  Right, right, but, uh --
R:  And the alcohol obviously to extreme is --
L:  M- --
R:  -- severely detrimental as well.
L:  Right.  No, I mean, yeah, I mean, there's -- there's something to be -- there's -- there's something to be said for each -- each one of them and it just --
R:  Yeah.  I feel like everybody kind of does want to be out there in some point in their life anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, [several inaudible words].
L:  Right, right, but, uh -- okay, one second, okay?  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, haven't quite explained to my kid yet what I'm doing, so --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm on the -- actually in a -- in a car just like travelling down to a, um --
L:  Now, wh- where are you?
R:  I'm in New York City.
L:  Oh, okay, and I'm -- 
R:  I --
L:  -- I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I'm originally from Long Island, so --
R:  Um, really?  I'm from Maine, so --
L:  Oh, are ya?  I was --
R:  I'm a -- I'm a college student. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  So, what are we supposed to do now?  Do you have any --
L:  I -- I guess we're supposed to try to talk about the subject for ten minutes or so, but --
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I think that's what it's supposed to be and that's the -- how it is.  Um, how did you learn about this anyway?
R:  Well, one of my friends, um --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- she's -- she's involved in it and she told me it worked[?] for her, so I went and I checked it out and it was very interesting so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, no, same -- same thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- another friend of mine who I, uh, you know, we- where I was trying to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find stuff.  We have kids at home and stuff, so you're --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- trying to find -- find ways to earn money and all that k- --
R:  Yeah, and it's --
L:  -- kind of s- --
R:  I mean, it's cool that they offer it to anybody who's willing to talk on the phone.
L:  Mhm, right, exactly.
R:  I'm always willing to do it, you kn-. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, but, um, um --
R:  Yeah, still kinda gets me with the the topic 'cause I'm actually -- we just finished up with our classes.  We're heading downtown for happy hour, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so is that why you didn't pick alcohol? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I think so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, uh, I'm in a different phase of life.  I'm headed -- I'm headed to a baseball field, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I got -- I got little kids and --
R:  So, you just watch the kids?
L:  -- and again -- and you look at the kids on the -- on the fields and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, again that's where over- -- I'm also -- I also -- I have a nutrition business, so -- so ov- over --
R:  Oh, really?  Well, then that would explain the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- overeating [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, like again, none of them are -- are good, so, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's just -- again the way that everybody, you know, the nation as a whole continues to eat and we have larger sizes and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Supersizing everything.
R:  Everything. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, it just -- you know, you have -- you know, the heart issue, the cancer issues and all -- all the chemicals that are in the foods and stuff like that.  So, you know, most people who are overeating aren't overeating vegetables, you know, so --
R:  Exactly.  It's more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more, uh, detrimental.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, it really, really doesn't, uh, you know, n- n- none -- none of it helps in that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- regard, so, um, but, uh, and again, we know what alcohol does.  We know what caffeine does and, uh --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  I forget what they said the other things were, so --
R:  I c- -- I didn't hear the other things.  I -- my phone was breaking up, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  [LAUGH] So, uh, but anyway, so -- so -- where -- where part of Manha- -- I worked in Manhattan for twelve years, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I go to school at Fordham, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, around the [inaudible] uh, Columbus --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then actually I go to the campus in the Bronx.
L:  Mhm.  Oh --
R:  In, um, Belmont, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  That's kinda neat.
R:  [MN] Headed downtown to hang out with some friends and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, [inaudible] vices. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  No, it sounds good to me.  I -- I can remember those days. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good old -- I -- I -- I did plenty drinking in Manhattan in my days, and, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And in -- it -- it's so funny when you're -- when you're like me now.  I'm -- I'm forty f- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Forty four years old and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm married --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and have two -- two young boys, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And of course as they're getting older, you know, all those kinds of habits take on a whole different, um, perspective. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, also that's a point in my figuring.  Like for me right now it'd be m- -- like the caffeine isn't -- [NOISE] is an issue for some friends who, you know, are trying to stay up all night if you're trying to finish finals and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that's -- that's why I was talking about the pills because people, you know, get crazy and find they need to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somehow keep themselves up and --
L:  Right.
R:  Also, you know, alcohol's always an issue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- any college here, so --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  I think, depending on your point in life it's different as well.  I mean, if, uh, overeating goes from throughout your entire lifetime then it obviously becomes a huge problem.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes, it definitely can.  And like I said, uh, you know, I have the opportunity now to [LAUGH] -- to, you know, to see young children and, you know, sometimes you go -- go up to school, go to a baseball game or something and you're just looking at them and saying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my g- -- you know, y- you know these poor kids are set up for a lifetime of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know -- and as -- as we j- -- you know, I mean, my husband can be -- primarily because of the type of business that we're in and we're more conscientious about, you know --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- it, um, you know, you try not to but, I mean, it's just so easy, you know, when -- when it's hectic in your life to just fall into --
R:  To go to McDonalds. [LAUGH]
L:  -- the trap of like, "Let's just drive through and, you know, move --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on our way".   So, it's -- it's really like, like right now it's four twelve and I'm making dinner 'cause we have to be out of here by quarter to five and --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just like -- it -- it took me a while to get into that mode of, okay, you really do have to eat dinner before you leave because otherwise, you know, you're always gonna be feeding these kids fast food, you know, or --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, it just kind of, um, you know, and that's un- unfortunately --
R:  And that's tr- --
L:  Yeah, my kid is over here saying, "I like it when you feed me fast food". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  And the prices of food like also plays a major impact as well.  Like if you don't -- if you can't afford to buy organic, or if you can't afford to buy a lot of [LAUGH] -- like for me we -- we have our apartment and, you know, you buy what you -- [LAUGH] what you can afford.
L:  Afford, right, right.
R:  You know, boxes of macaroni and cheese are lot [NOISE] cheaper than buying salad in a bag --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or buying, you know, that kinda stuff.
L:  Right, right, no.
R:  So, money plays into this, so --
L:  Mhm, no it does make a huge, um -- right, that -- that -- that impacts so much too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is -- is -- is what y- -- what you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can afford.  'Cause even -- even as healthy as I eat some- -- I mean, and I'm not saying I'm perfect, believe me. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But a friend of mine just said like from the local grocery store, she goes -- she goes, "I'm only buying organic meat from there" and I go, "You are?"  I go, "I -- I can't go there yet" [LAUGH] I can't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't spend that money yet.  I said it's just like, you know, we'll live with those steroids a few more years, you know.
R:  Yeah, and it's so much -- I mean, in -- being in the -- in the Bronx it's sort of like you can see there -- there's a -- there's a big -- there's a problem with, um, obesity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, because -- in -- a -- a matter of money as well.
L:  Right, right.
R:  'Cause people can't afford to, you know, go -- go to a good -- a nice restaurant to have a dinner with the family.  It --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ends up being in Macdonalds --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [inaudible].  A cheaper --
L:  Definitely a direct [NOISE] --
R:  -- type of --
L:  Right [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Direct correlation there betw- between the two, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, anyway, so -- and, uh, you know, and again it's just trying -- it's very difficult with -- with all the things that they were mentioning to, um, you know, it's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything in moderation is really what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what you kinda have to go back to and --
R:  And to find the balance of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- was caffeine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and alcohol --
L:  Right, right.
R:  What you can -- what you can handle and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you can --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, keeps you in control. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  P- pick your worst vice, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's really difficult, but, uh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, so, it's -- I think we have about another minute [NOISE] or something.
R:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
L:  Right on the clock here.  I'm like trying -- trying to eyeball it and see [NOISE] but --
R:  So, your kids, they -- they have a baseball game tonight?
L:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I have a twelve year old and ten year old.  Both boys, so we --
R:  That's fun.
L:  We do lots of baseball during this time of year, so --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  It's --
R:  I used to play baseball.
L:  Did you?
R:  Good times.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's -- it's really nice.  Is it nice out there?
L:  Yeah, it's pretty today.  It's --
R:  Seventy degrees.
L:  Seventy degrees, yeah.
R:  Good day for a game. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, tonight's a nice night.  We've had a couple of really, uh, co- -- gosh, a couple of weeks ago, I think it was the Thursday before Easter, it was like thirty with a wind chill factor of twenty and they had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- these kids out there playing and I'm like -- we were all wrapped up in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- winter coats and everything and I go, "This is not what baseball's all about". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  We've got some really random weather patterns here too. [NOISE] It's -- it -- it was eighty degrees one day and then the ne- -- after the weekend ended we got a snow storm. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh, right.
R:  [LAUGH] Three days later it was seventy again, so --
L:  Right, oh, it's -- it's crazy, uh, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what part of Maine are you originally from?
R:  Farmington.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's in the Western Mountains.  It's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- about an hour from Can- -- the Canadian border and about --
L:  A- --
R:  -- an hour and a half from, or an hour and forty five minutes from, uh, New Hampshire, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow, so you --
R:  Kind of like up in the Western corner.
L:  Yeah, you're really up there, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's nice though.  I'm excited [inaudible] for part of my break, so --
L:  Right, right.  Now, so, y- y- you --
R:  Get out of the city for a while.
L:  -- certainly have it right.  Change of lifestyle going from --
R:  I
