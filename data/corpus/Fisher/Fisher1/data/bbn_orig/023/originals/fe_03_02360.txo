L:  Emily.
R:  Rae.  How you doing, Emily?
L:  Hi.  Fine.  I actually just had this [LAUGH] one.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I've had this one before.
R:  Oh, so you're an expert at this by now?
L:  No, I hope not. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, [LAUGH] you'll be leading this conversation.
L:  No, you --
R:  Well, that was -- that was a long list of m- mumbled, uh, um, uh, variables that, you know -- I didn't take notes, which is --
L:  Do you wa- --
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  Do you want me to go first?
R:  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, um, well basically what I told the last person was that I'm a nurse, so really all of these are bad for you health. [LAUGH] 
R:  Could you y- -- could you go over which -- which -- what they were?  There was smoking, give me -- give me what you recall.
L:  Um, gossiping.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Caffeine -- excessive caffeine intake.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, overeating, not exercising and, I think, dr- drinking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that was it.
R:  I think that's it, yeah.
L:  Um, but the one that I'd have to say the worst would be smoking, just 'cause, I don't know I just think it's nasty and you stink and your windows get all yellow and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just gross.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's just gross.
R:  Your windows?  Your car windows? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, haven't you seen people who smoke?  That their car windows are --
R:  I said, "Windows, gee windows is an interesting --"
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- interesting word for teeth, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I said, "No, she can not have [inaudible], no".
L:  No, but that's true too.
R:  I went from teeth to eyes and, "No your eyes don't get -- no she must be talking about a car, okay".
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Emily, you've got a -- uh, um, a singular type of thinking and, uh, and I'll try to key into it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where you located?
L:  At Indianapolis.
R:  Indianapolis?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh, and, um, where do you think I'm from?
L:  Uh --
R:  From my, uh, from my voice and my accent, if there is one.
L:  Huh.
R:  You can, mm, either you can come back to that or you can --
L:  Yeah, I'll come back to --
R:  -- uh, pass on that also.
L:  I'll come back to that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'm a former smoker.  You, uh, uh, you sound like a -- a never smoker.
L:  Um, I've never smoked.  Huh-uh.
R:  You don't.  Have you ever smoked a cigarette?
L:  Oh, when I was a teenager. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  How many -- how many cigarettes have you smoked?
L:  Probably in my lifetime -- I'm only twenty four, so --
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- a half a pack maybe my whole life.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  Oh, more than one.  More than two or three, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- y- yeah, you've, um, you've gone back to the well to -- it's like, um, what is it?  Um, it's like, um, something like salmon.  Um, I've tried salmon.  I keep thinking I'm gonna love salmon and every couple of years I go back and I try it and I say, "Gee, I still don't like it" [LAUGH], you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, but I said -- the last time I had it I said, "Gee, this is really good", but, um, but, uh, you said all of them are bad for your health.  I don't know about gossiping.  Is gossiping bad for your health?  How is that?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  How is that, Emily?
L:  Because it, um -- when people gossip and stuff -- and -- and I know this from first hand just because my sister and my mother have been through many sev- several jobs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what they have to do -- deal with.  It's just like everybody gossiping -- and my mum's come home crying and anxious --
R:  Mm.
L:  She's had to go to the hospital with chest pain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because everybody, you know, it's just like all the gossiping and stuff that goes on in an office, it really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- puts a lot of stress on people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and I guess it just depends on how you handle it and everybody's different on how they handle stuff.
R:  Mm.
L:  I tend to let it go in where -- one ear and out the other but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- other people really take it to heart.
R:  I'm on -- I'm on the serious side when it comes to that too.  And that -- and that reminds me because, um, I mean to actually to, um -- I left a job in a bit of a [SIGH] -- a scandal, uh, ten years ago, something like -- something like that.  Just me overly traumatic and I recently came across someone who -- I -- I s- -- I bumped into them on the street and, um, it was, "Oh, how nice -- how nice to see you", and "Oh, and I -- I keep in" -- she says, "I keep in touch with so and so and, you know, I'll be -- I'll say hello, I'll, you know, I'll -- I'll say that I saw you and yeah, you look good.  Whatever, whatever", and I re- I just realized that I just had a dream that in fact this so and so was a former friend who kinda -- we s- -- we didn't con- continue contact.  I had a dream that in fact we were talking, you know, and I -- and you know, you think it's real and then you -- and -- and then it's, uh, it's like a h- a half memory and then something brings it up and you say, "Hey, that never happened.  That's a dream", you know.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yes and, uh, I just, um, I just, uh, you know, had that thought come into -- to my head.  I mean, reference to gossip and people and talking and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but, [SIGH] --
L:  Overeating makes me sick too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, does it?  Uh-huh.
L:  I always tell -- oh, my gosh, yesterday -- I hope you're not like seriously overweight. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But these people were very -- I mean, they were very overweight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it just made me sick.  But we had twenty four doughnuts on the table at this meeting yesterday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There were eight of us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Only three ate doughnuts and they ate the whole box and they --
R:  What --
L:  -- were all like really o- obese and it -- I seriously wanted to go to the bathroom and throw up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was just about to get sick.  So, that -- it bothers me, but that's like -- it's not gonna kill somebody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  But smoking, second hand is not good and, um, like overeating or overdrinking, that can obviously --
R:  Are you saying that three people ate eight doughnuts each?
L:  Yes, in five hours. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow, that's --
L:  And it, oh my gosh --
R:  That's excessive, uh --
L:  Yeah, it made me sick.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, well that is -- that is e- e- -- you know, it's -- it's one thing to -- to sort of do it privately, not in a company place, but to do it in a --
L:  Yeah, if you wanna pig out on your own time. [LAUGH]
R:  -- in -- like that, yeah.  Wow.
L:  In front of people.
R:  Not in front of some, you know, some -- some skinny little, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- skinny little people that would be, "Oh, [MN] [MN] [MN], tut tut tut --"
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  That ain't -- that's no good. 
L:  Oh.
R:  No, think of your arteries and all that stuff".
L:  [LAUGH] No, but those -- really smoking is probably the only thing that really --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- as far as other people's personal habits --
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  But --
R:  'Cause it really does invade you.  I went to a -- a -- a club, um, last night and I know the -- and -- and we recently outlawed smoking in clubs.  I'm from New York, um, by the way.
L:  I was gonna say Boston or New York.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  After I heard you talk. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm ra- born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and, um, that's where I live now and, uh -- but I was in a club in Manhattan last night and there's no smoking allowed any more in clubs and most places in -- in Manhatten and New York, uh, City and, uh, it's a whole different experience.  I mean, you come home and you take off your clothes and, you know, like you bring your shirt over your head to take it off and it doesn't smell from smoke any more.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a whole -- it's a whole new thing and it's --
L:  But do you think -- I mean, because they've made that law, has it decreased the amount of people that go to the clubs?
R:  It's -- it's brand new, this law --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about bars and clubs, it's --
L:  Is it because of the fires and things that they've had in the past, or --
R:  No, it's -- it's, um -- it's an air -- it's a health issue.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's -- yeah, and it's, um, you know, New York has not had those major fires, uh, in clubs like some other cities --
L:  Cities have.
R:  'Cause we've got this incredibly strong, um, fire code like, you know, the -- the one of the harshest in the nation and, um -- but yeah, this one's a health issue.  The -- the Mayor is p- is particul- -- is a rabid anti smoke person and, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  And so they -- he helped initiate some of these laws.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but yeah, some of the people are complaining that, uh, the first week or s- -- literally it's in the bar- -- in the bars and clubs.  It's only like three weeks old.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, three weeks ago they were talking, you know, some of the people on TV and stuff were talking about, you know, the bars are clo- -- they're quiet, their bars are empty and about three weeks ago I went to one and it was kinda quiet and my friend said, "Gee, it's usually not this quiet on a Monday night", but it was only a Monday night too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh -- but I think people -- I think people that are -- go to bars, they'll still go to bars, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'll -- they'll settle into their older habits, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and what's wor- -- I guess smoking is the worst for that[?].  It'll be -- in a couple of a months it'll be ten years since I smoked --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- a cigarette, yeah.  So, that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- imagine [LAUGH] all these people I see that smoke for years come in the hospital and they can't breathe any more and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, you know, you're like, "Well ..." [LAUGH].  Of course they didn't know back then that -- all the dangers.
R:  Well, yeah, I think, uh, I think your -- that your -- your job is to not be repulsed and not be, um -- not be, uh, you know, pointing fingers, but just to help what you can and to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you know, I mean, honestly the -- the idea that y- you know, you wanna throw up because somebody is overeating on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- some- -- it's sort of -- it's a little too judgemental for me.  I -- you know, try to look away and if it bothers you, try to realize that it's not your life.
L:  No, no.
R:  Is the way that I -- I feel, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is -- you know, people ha- have the right to be respected for whatever the hell they do, you know --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  They wanna eat a dozen -- a dozen things, well --
L:  They have to be accountable for that.  I mean, you know what I mean.  It's their own ... but yesterday it just drive me nuts for some reason. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know females.  They're in a mood that day and it just carries on. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, did you -- how come a- -- how come of all these people, only three people ate doughnuts?
L:  Well, I didn't feel good and I didn't really feel like eating and then the other girl -- you know, of course we're all skinny bitches, so there you go. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Skinny bitches, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're really hungry like a mother[?] -- like a mother and, uh --
L:  So, they only had three le- left and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was obviously, but, yeah, no, um, but maybe --
R:  I like -- I like the idea of people consuming what they wanna consume.  They -- go for it.  Enjoy yourself.
L:  Well, you know, and maybe --
R:  That's excessive though.
L:  Maybe it wasn't so much the excessive eating either.  Maybe, I guess, maybe it was actually their personal, like the way -- their mannerisms -- like how they ate --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- was, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In front of people they're eating like pigs and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- then they got icing all over their mouth and ... [LAUGH] 
R:  And then them [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  So, maybe it's not so much the excessive eating bo- -- that bothered me, it was just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their manners, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah, you know, it's -- it's an interesting thing though in this -- in this world that, you know, in so far as like sexual attraction there's people that love heavy people and there's people that love skinny people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and you know it's beau- -- and, you know, blacks and whites and you know, it -- it -- w- w- what one person
