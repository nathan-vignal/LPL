L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Betty.
R:  Hi, this is Marie.
L:  Hi, I had the phone call, like, b- about ten minutes ago --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and was cut off --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- so it didn't count, so I had to do it again.
R:  Oh no [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Did you switch over or try to press another thing?
L:  No, it -- we were talking, and boom, she was gone and I was gone off her line.
R:  Oh go- maybe she did something.
L:  Oh.
R:  Maybe she hung up or did -- something happened with her phone so they probably disconnected the both of you.
L:  So I gotta start all over again.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh gosh.  Um, so what did you talk about last time -- was it just --
L:  Um, it was which do we think is worse --
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, smoking, gossiping, excessive drinking, ah --
R:  Okay.
L:  Over eating --
R:  Was it -- okay.  Did you -- what did you think?  What did y-
L:  Well, t- th- the point we were at I was saying that I thought the worse of the evils --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was ah, excessive drinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you're consuming, um, something foreign in your body, you're actually causing the harm.
R:  Yeah, I definitely agree.  I either agree with that or with the smoking.
L:  Well, the -- the smoking can go the same way.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly how it is.  It's --
L:  So why are people suing the tobacco company?  Because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- th- it clearly says it can be harmful to you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And why are they winning these lawsuits?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I can't understand.
R:  I don't -- I really don't understand the whole thing with the tobacco company and how they really do select the target market as the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and their ads are towards kids, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, just even walking down the street you see kids that don't even look like they're eleven, twelve years old and they're -- have cigarettes in their h- like, mouths, it's --
L:  I know, it's ridiculous.  To me, it's like taking five dollars and setting it a fire.
R:  Exactly.  Oh, and prices!  I don't understand how people afford it any more. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh God.  I -- I remember um, cigarettes, when I was growing up were, like, forty five cents a pack.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Something like that, and -- and to me I thought it was a waste, I'm like, what can I do with forty five cents?
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Instead of burning it up.  Or just think what five dollars --
R:  -- five do- yeah, and just think how much people smoke and if it's like, a pack a day, that's five dollars a day, if not more.
L:  It's ridiculous, oh God, oh is it ever ridiculous.
R:  It's incredible.
L:  And in Europe, cigarettes are like, twice the price what we pay.
R:  Wow.  I didn't even know that.
L:  And they do, um, smoke.  We had a friend in Europe --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- while we were stationed there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he was German, and he would ask us, "Would you buy cigarettes for me off of the American, um, facilities --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- "and I'll pay for them".
R:  Wow.
L:  Where we would pay, like, twenty dollars a carton --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- they were paying forty five dollars a carton.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But they wanted it.
R:  Yeah, that's -- I mean, I guess it's very addicting.  I mean --
L:  I- I-
R:  -- it's incredible, and I agree, with alcohol too, alcohol is a very addictive drug too.
L:  But, um, alcohol, you -- you know it's killing brain cells --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and everything, why would you introduce things to your body that are so harmful?
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] I -- I really don't know, and I -- I mean, I guess sometimes people think its okay to have one social drink here or there, but still, it's -- it's the excessive social drinks --
L:  Right.
L:  -- it's the excessive, everything when it goes into excess, I mean --
R:  Th- the eating.  Everything --
L:  Yes, ex-
R:  -- harmful --
L:  -- mhm.
R:  -- people come on television, um, saying, "I'm six hundred pounds and I'm dying.  I'm -- I'm -- I can't move".
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  --Lose the weight!
R:  [LAUGH] exactly, it -- it's not that ha- I mean, I guess sometimes people think once they get to be that big, like what do they care any more?
L:  I've got a bad back and I mean, I only weight a hundred and sixty pounds --
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  -- and my back is so bad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I take morphine --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- but, I, you know, I -- I -- I'm not going to give up on life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  exactly.
L:  -- and -- and eat myself to death --
R:  -- exactly --
L:  -- or -- or -- or drink myself to death --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I take my medication, I try and stay active --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I can live a little bit longer.
R:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, these people, I just don't -- they're putting things into their body, also, like, the food they're eating, they're just -- and no exercise whatsoever --
L:  Oh God, I know.
R:  They can barely get up and down half the time without breathing heavy and --
L:  Heavy, I know.  They look like they're going to die of a heart attack any minute now.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, exactly and, I mean, I give credit for people who are trying to change but how did they get that big in the first place?
L:  Y- yes.  Thank you.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Y- you gotta change that habit if you're going to survive.  You really do.
R:  Mhm.  It's not just a mind set, maybe one day I'll try it and give it a try, it's -- it's a life long thing that you have to work for and you only have one body.  I mean, [LAUGH] it -- it's your life and your choice what you're going to do with it, but --
L:  But I know how drug addicts feel now because if I don't take my medication --
R:  It's wow.
L:  -- I go through withdrawals.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- I -- I wear a morphine patch --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I have to have that patch on me or I can't even function.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know, it -- it helps my back pain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it just makes me feel drunk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't even say nice --
R:  um --
L:  -- because I -- I was talking to my daughter last night on the phone --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and actually fell asleep during the conversation.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  An- and that's in --
R:  That's scary [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I know.  I -- I'm scared to drive now.
R:  Oh my.
L:  -- my husband -- we'll be going somewhere and I'll fall asleep.
R:  Wow.
L:  For, like, ten minutes.  So --
R:  There's nothing that you can't get off of it or try, like, reducing the medicine of it, or is it just --?
L:  Every -- about every six months to nine months they have to change the medication to another drug --
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  -- because I've built up a tolerance to it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it doesn't work.  Ah, but if I don't take it I can't get out of bed.
R:  Oh --
L:  I can't function.  My legs -- I have -- I've lost feeling in both of my legs --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- um, an- and this was an accident at work.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  It's horrible.  Just -- just one little accident cause pain, so why do people inflict pain on themselves voluntarily?
R:  Yeah, that's [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what I can't understand.
R:  Yeah.  That's [SIGH] that's incredible, that's scary.  And it's --
L:  If -- if they had to live the life of someone that really, you know, people with cancer that had no choice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and suffer with pain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [several inaudible words] it's just hard on me.
R:  Oh gosh.  I'm sorry.
L:  Or, you know, I've gotta have a cigarette --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've gotta have my caffeine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or I'm just not gonna make it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- excuse me!
R:  Well, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly, yeah.  That's -- yeah --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry --
R:  No, no, no, it's okay.
L:  I'm monopolizing, I'm sorry.
R:  No, no, that's perfectly fine.  It's just -- that's just -- some people think, like, I'm going to die if I don't have a cigarette, like, do you want to see what the lives of other people are like, someone -- who -- who are really dying. [LAUGH]
L:  How about these people that, like, ah, well, I don't know if you smoke, but I don't --
R:  No, I don't smoke either.
L:  I've got a stake in that second hand smoke.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, gosh yes.  I am so happy they just recently passed a law here, um, in New York City with the [LAUGH] the no smoking in the bars.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They did do that?  That's good.
R:  Yeah, so it's incredible now, I just feel clean, I smell clean --
L:  [LAUGH] I like it.
R:  I'm just -- it's just, everything.  It's just -- and it's just incredible when you're not breathing -- 'cause I would come home from like, a night out or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I couldn't -- the next time I came in I couldn't breathe -- I was like, coughing, I was --
L:  Yo- yo --
R:  -- the next morning I would just wake up and I'd just hav- feel terrible and I'd feel like --
L:  Your clothes would have to just basically stay outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To air out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you couldn't even wash the smell out, really.
L:  Exactly.  Like, I just would breathe an- yeah, it just -- it just everything all over y- and no one has respect either, they just walk around hitting you with their cigarettes and --
R:  I know, straight -- just blow the smoke in your face --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm like, I'm not trying to consume this, can you try not to help me consume it.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's why a- all the people here are complaining that, like, I don't understand --
R:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- how come we can't smoke, but -- y- you're bringing chemicals into places --
L:  right.
R:  -- like, why should people have to breathe, those who do not want to breathe those --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's your choice --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that's --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- your consequences, so --
L:  I know.
R:  So 
L:  But, um, they all are evils and they all have their consequences.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, and it's just I -- I -- I can't weight one more than the other, I really can't.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it -- it's extremely hard, it -- it's -- it's extremely disappointing, and these people, I think the scary part is they're doing it and then after they do it, oh why did this happen to me, why did that happen to me?  Well [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, like look at some of your lifestyle and your lifestyle choices and --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- that's why and, I mean it's sad that they don't even realize half the time, and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- until its too late then --
L:  I know.  It's horrible.
R:  Yeah.  And I think --
L:  What are they thinking about?
R:  Yeah.  That's it.
L:  I -- I just hope my children have enough sense to notice that we don't do it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so they shouldn't pick up the habit --
R:  Exactly.
L:  --those habits.
R:  Exactly.  But --
L:  I really do.
R:  There's a lot of peer pressure, especially at that age.  I work at a school, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- seeing kids, like, sneaking out just to get a cigarette and you know, I -- I always -- I make sure I like, tell them, and you know, like, if it happens, like, I won't report them right away but after that it's just not right.
L:  But you know something that's strange?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  People will give you a cigarette, they can bum a cigarette off of you but they won't give you food.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Does that make any sense?
R:  No, not at all.  Not at all.
L:  I do like -- I do like what some people are saying now that there's a -- we live in a DC area --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and there's a lot of beggars, right --
R:  Okay, yes.
L:  -- and they'll say, um, you know, need money for food --
R:  Need m- okay, yes.
L:  -- and you're saying, okay, I know you're not going to be doing that.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I know what you want it for.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But you'll see a couple that actually say, I really want the money for a drink.
R:  Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH] 
L:  An- and at least they're being honest.
R:  At least, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  There was one guy when we first moved in the DC area, every
