L:  Katie
R:  Hi, it's Gabe.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. 
L:  Okay, so what do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first time I've ever -- I've doing this, so, maybe it's something I'd be --
L:  Well, this is my first time too.
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  What do you think is worse? [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's about, we have to decide what's worse, smoking, drinking, or, actually I haven't heard the last of it, so it would be --
L:  It's smoking, drinking, gossiping, over eating and exercising.
R:  I think, ah, gossiping is definitely very bad because, ah, it creates, er, impressions of other people that will, ah, last for a long time, but um, other things are bad as well.  What do you think?
L:  I think the same thing because the other ones affect you personally, but gossiping affects the other person too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's more harmful to other people.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it affects ah, oh, the image of that, ah, people have about their character, so basically it's a character assassination.  No?
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  And it affects other people besides just the person you're gossiping about.
R:  Exactly.  So --
L:  So, of the other ones, what do you think's the second worst?
R:  Dr- oh, the second worse?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, maybe drug use is really bad --
L:  Yeah, the alcohol?
R:  Alc- alcohol is bad too.  I mean, I think it's basically about ah, how people use it, like, if they use it very lightly and very in- infre- infrequently, then obviously it's not that bad, but if somebody is an alcoholic or a drug addict then it's -- it's another problem altogether.
L:  Yeah.  I guess smoking and alcohol use could also affect other people by, like, if you were drinking too much it affects your family or --
R:  Yeah, and second hand smoke --
L:  -- and smoking affects other people --
R:  Yeah, and second hand --
L:  -- second hand affects other people too.
R:  Yeah.  Second hand smoking is really bad too.
L:  Yeah, so, I still think gossiping is the worst though.
R:  Gossiping is horrible because it actually -- actually destroys other people but the person who is a gossip, he or she is being destroyed -- by -- by -- by the actions that he or she takes because ah, basically, if you gossip, then it means you -- you don't have any other things to do.  In other words you are probably a boring person, no?
L:  Yeah.
R:  If somebody's not, not you, but I'm talking about somebody [LAUGH] who's gossiping.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, but here, I mean, I'm -- I'm talking from New York, ah, in New York they basically banned, ah, smoking in all restaurants and all that stuff, so --
L:  Yeah, us too, for the most part of it, in Seattle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think the, ah, the over eating one's that bad.  Do you?
R:  Over eating, um, yeah, because at least you enjoy it and you don't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you don't hurt others.
L:  Yeah, and it's your own personal problem --
R:  It's your own personal problems --
L:  -- and not anybody else's.
R:  Exactly.  Of course, if somebody's extremely overweight it could be a problem for others because, for example, if they sit on a bus nobody can sit next to them, but that's another problem. [LAUGH] 
L:  Or, like, when you have to buy two seats on the airplane. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, nowadays you have to buy two seats, that's right.
L:  And it used to be that you were a parent or something, and it was like, your child, probably.
R:  Absolutely.  For example, y- if your kid is overweight obviously you don't feel too good about yourself, how come that you created a monster or something like that. [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No, I mean, obviously I -- I -- I'm a little bit ironic but it has some truth in it.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then ah, the last one was ah, not exercising enough.
R:  Not exercising enough --
L:  I think everybody --
R:  That's related to overweight isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's related to being overweight, because ah, obviously if you don't exercise too much then eventually you're going to be overweight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah and --
L:  I think the majority of Americans don't really exercise enough though.
R:  No.  But it's interesting because, ah, there is a culture of exercise in the United States and it's very strong, so you would think that um, most people are exercising, but it's not true.  It's just the image or the perception of the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.  And then you get people who exercise too much.
R:  That's true and then they look like, I don't know, Schwarzenegger number two, or something like that.  I don't know.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Hungary, originally.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I've been living here for twelve years, in New York City, in Brooklyn.
L:  Wow.
R:  Are you in Seattle?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, so I heard it correctly.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I just um, I just find it on the internet, this program, so that's why --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  I decided I'm going to do it.  So, exercise, let's talk about a topic otherwise they think that we don't want to talk about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  I was like, where was I, okay, so, again to recap our conversation --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The number one is gossiping, that's the worst thing one can do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  After that, um, drug abuse.  The third one is probably drinking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the forth is ah --
L:  Smoking.
R:  -- smoking, yeah.  Smoking, then being overweight and not exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, which one do you think you are guilty of [LAUGH] if I can ask you? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, probably a little bit of all of them. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah?  Well --
L:  I exercise a lot though.
R:  I used to smoke.  I don't smoke any more because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it my lungs couldn't take it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  and ah, drinking, not too much.  Sometimes, if I go out I drink a little bit, but exercise, obviously, n- not obviously but it's obvious for me that I'm not exercising too much at all.  So I don't think I'm overweight, maybe I have a little stomach, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- stomach is a little bit bigger th- but it has the advantage that I don't fall, you know, when somebody [LAUGH] -- doesn't matter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what else?  Oh, smoking no --
L:  I think for me, probably the alcohol one would be the most that I'm guilty of, though.
R:  Yeah?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Are you on a campus or something?
L:  Yeah.  I'm a college student.
R:  Oh, that's it.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If you're on a campus then it's a bum, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, because it's like, a culture of drinking.
L:  Definitely, definitely, yeah.
R:  Do you --
L:  I've been drinking since I was fifteen though, so --
R:  Really?  Fifteen.
L:  [LAUGH] yes.
R:  Holy mackerel.  Well, you know, it's funny, because I'm from Eastern Europe and Eastern Europeans are drinking like crazy, but for some reason I'm not that, ah, I'm not into that, although my cousins are drinking a little bit, I mean, a lot, actually, over there.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's another topic.  So, what else?  Do we have to wait until they say it -- it's over, or what's happening?
L:  Yeah, they come on and they say that, ah, it's been ten minutes and then we're supposed give, like, review or comments about the talk, I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  So --
R:  So, have you heard it -- ah, have you heard about it, ah, on the internet?
L:  Yeah, I was linked just by somebody else.
R:  Hm.  Me too, I just found it today in Craig's list.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a good --
L:  I need some money.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I mean, everybody -- I mean, I um, I assume everybody needs some.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm sure they're going to use it for good -- good purposes.
L:  Hope so.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, so, ah --
L:  I don't know what to talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I mean, could talk about other things, but then maybe they want us, you know, they would say that we shouldn't talk about other things, I don't know, so, probably we're going to be enlightened very soon.
L:  Yeah.  I think we're almost done, so --
R:  Yeah.  So, in any case, ah, I hope you're going to have a nice day.
L:  You too.
R:  And um, it's sunny here in New York.
L:  Oh, it's raining here in Seattle. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I heard it's raining a lot over there.
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  It's like a tropical forest or something.  Not tropical, but a rain forest, no?
L:  Yeah.  Did you like this topic?
R:  Ah, it's interesting.  Obviously, there are more fascinating topics as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, it's interesting.  If they can use it for a good purpose then I'm -- I'm happy about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would like to -- I can talk about politics or languages but that's another story, probably they're going to call be about it too, if they like this conversation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I had to indicate that speak another language, so, maybe they're going to call me --
L:  Yeah, that would be interesting.
R:  -- from Hungary or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from a village to explain how they live there, or I don't know [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That'd be interesting.
R:  That would be fascinating. [LAUGH] I'm just getting -- okay so, maybe we have to wait until they say it's over.
L:  Yeah, I think we have a couple more minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Okay, so let's fill it up.  
L:  I don't know what to talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, which -- which -- which university, or college you going to?
L:  I'm in Seattle Central.
R:  Oh, okay, I unfortunately I have no clue where th- wh-
L:  In Seattle. [LAUGH] 
R:  I went to Brooklyn College because I live in Brooklyn.  Actually I'm in Brooklyn now.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Which is ah, a funny place, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of people from all over the world.  I don't see too many Americans here [LAUGH] that's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  What else about the topic can we talk about?
R:  Smoking, smoking, other is there?  There is the price of ah, cigarettes here in New York State, so it's very, very expensive.
L:  Yeah, it's five dollars here for a pack.
R:  Five?  Over here it's sometimes even six fifty.  Can you imagine?
L:  Wow --
R:  That's a lot of money --
L:  See, that affects people too, because if you're poor and you have an addiction to smoking then --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you're spending your money on cigarettes and you're not spending it on food or your family --
R:  That's true.  I have a
