L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Toni.
R:  Toni? 
L:  Yes.
R:  My name is James Bradley.
L:  Hello, um --
R:  And where -- wh- where you live?
L:  Illinois.
R:  Illinois?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  I live in Texas.
L:  Oh.
R:  I live just north of Dallas.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband works for a company that's main base is in Te-, uh, Texas.
R:  Where abouts?
L:  Um, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] His check just come from Texas.  That's all I know, um --
R:  Well, it's probably either --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Houston or Dallas, or San Antonio.
L:  Yeah, wherever the waste i- -- uh, [NOISE] corporation is, I don't know.
R:  Well, okay, Toni, I, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I didn't ge- catch all these things that she was talking about -- these personal habits, did you?
L:  Yeah, we're supposed to s- [NOISE], uh -- what do you think is worse, gossiping, smoking, drinking, or having excess caffeine, or the way you eat and exercise?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which is supposed to be like, I don't know, the worst, I guess?  I --
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, l- let me tell you my situation and, uh, then we'll go from there.
L:  Okay.
R:  I am seventy nine years old.
L:  All right.
R:  Uh [COUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] How'd you get into this? [NOISE]
R:  Well, with an email friend of mine in San Antonio.
L:  That's how I got into this. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd never heard of it before but she been doing it since, uh, J- January.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I -- I -- I did my first discussion yesterday, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, so I -- I'm -- I know I've gotten a bunch of my friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- involved in it too, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Anyway.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, I, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have been an insurance adjuster for fifty three years.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, in that line of work --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and travelling as like I did, I did lots of drinking and lots of smoking. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You name it --
L:  So, the --
R:  -- and I did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it.
L:  So, those wouldn't be considered, in your opinion, the worst habits to have then.
R:  Well, let's put it this way, since May the fifteenth of nineteen ninety --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I haven't had a cigarette or a drink of booze.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's good.
R:  So, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I'm a type two diabetic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I c- control that with diet and exercise.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, you get down to it, I don't know, I guess the w- -- what I'm thinking about maybe the best -- the worst thing I can think of right now would be gossiping or, what was the last one?
L:  [NOISE] Um, exercise and diet.
R:  Well, I do that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the time.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I'm on an eighteen hundred calorie a day diet, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Wow.  Well, my aunt got me into this through an email and I did too have my first conversation yesterday.
R:  Really?
L:  With a -- with a man named Josh about illness and, uh --
R:  Where -- where'd he live?
L:  I don't know.  I didn't ask him.
R:  Oh, really?  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty nine.
R:  Oh, twenty nine.  Okay, you're still in your twenties.  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] Barely. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, June I'll be thirty, so, unfortunately [NOISE] --
R:  Well, no, no, no, no, no -- I -- y- -- 
L:  And --
R:  This is a good time of your life.
L:  [LAUGH] And I smoke, but I don't drink.  Um, I don't diet or exercise.  I have no need to yet.  [NOISE] If you're gonna go --
R:  Well, I would imagine you being in your twenties you -- yeah, that's right, you -- you -- you probably don't need to.
L:  If you're gonna go to the bathroom, you have to stay on the potty.  Sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's all right.
L:  [NOISE] No, you can't have scissors. [NOISE] No.  He's -- we're potty training.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  That would be like -- I think gossip would be the worst 'cause I don't like gossipers.
R:  I don't either.
L:  I mean, if you're gonna talk, you should at least know what the hell you're talking about.  I -- it's --
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  [LAUGH] And if you don't know -- I mean, and hearsay, and saying, "Oh, well, so and so did this and so and so did that" I -- I figure all that does is mess up with other people's lives, you know, 'cause you usually don't te- -- you ain't telling the truth either.
R:  Well, uh, one of my --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- favorite expressions is, "Don't talk l- d- -- don't like an expert on something you don't know a damn thing about".
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm a very straight forward person, you know, so basically, you know, I've had people gossip about me because it's like, if you ask me w- how you look, I will tell you truth, whether it's, "You look good", or "You look like shit", you know.
R:  Well in other words, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you don't want the truth, uh --
L:  D- --
R:  -- don't ask you, huh?
L:  Exactly.
R:  That -- that's the way my wife was.
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause it's like, I'd rather be told the truth than have let's say, "Oh, you look so cute" and you go out looking like a dork, you know, it's like --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- "tell me -- tell me what you really think, or don't say a word", you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so -- and I never really got into those little girlie clicks where they did all that gossiping and chattering and stuff --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- 'cause I just found it really annoying.  So, I guess out of the whole list of weird things she gave us, that would probably be the worst thing.
R:  I don't -- I don't think really that I have ever been a gossiper, uh.  I guess I have really heard more gossip since --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- uh, about, uh, let's see a couple of years ago my two sons decided -- they said that dad needed to get into the twenty first century --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  So, they bought me a, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- computer.
L:  Oh, lordy.
R:  So, I am knee deep in computerese.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I g- -- think I've heard more gossip since I've been involved in this, uh, computer 'cause I've got about a hundred people on -- in my address book.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  I don't think [LAUGH] --
R:  And, uh, I'm always hearing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something.
L:  Yeah, with a hundred people. [NOISE] It's your own --
R:  Yeah, I -- I have -- I have a -- 
L:  [NOISE] little community.
R:  -- I'd say a minimum of a hundred people in my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- address book.  And it's all --
L:  I have four. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's people -- for the most part it's people that I -- th- that I know, personally.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Or some, uh, uh -- some of 'em I have become a- acquaintances, uh, just through email.
L:  Oh, well, I think I have four people in my address book. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And there's just a couple of the girlfriends I still keep in touch with from High School.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I hate those chat rooms.  I just [NOISE] can't get into it.
R:  I -- I don't mess with those.
L:  [NOISE] Can't get into a twenty way conversation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it's like, I email my friends, they email me and that's like the extent of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm the same way about the chat rooms. Uh, of course, I -- that's nothing but gossip --
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  -- and, uh -- but there's so many people involved in the -- in the -- in the chat room that, uh, you -- you -- you try to talk to a certain person and you lose track of 'em.
L:  Exa- -- or -- or they're comp- -- or they just disappear.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And [NOISE] -- and some of 'em where, you know, you start talking to one person and you're having a decent conversation, but between all the smut and, you know, just rudeness of the others, it's like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you don't even wanna deal with it.  It's like, "If I wanted to hear that, I'd turn on HBO".
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH] It's like -- I mean, I certainly ain't gonna sit there and type it.  I mean, I don't wanna watch it.  Why would I wanna sit there and type it?  Are you done?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All right. [LAUGH]
R:  How many children do you have?
L:  Three.
R:  Three?
L:  Yeah.  Got a twelve year old, an eleven year old and a three year old.
R:  A twelve year old and you're twenty nine years old.  You're -- you started having yours about the same time that my wife and I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We had three boys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two years difference in their ages and the oldest one turned sixty last month.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Goodness.
R:  My -- my -- my -- my grandchildren are your age.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, I take it back.  My grandchildren are -- I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two grandchildren that would be forty, uh --
L:  They're older than me. [LAUGH]
R:  They're -- they're -- they're much older than you.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  No, there's no crocodiles in the potty. [NOISE] 'Cause they can't fit. [NOISE] Because they're big. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, is your -- is your wife still with you?
R:  No, my wife died seven years ago.
L:  Oh, I -- I figured the way you talked past tense, but I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- didn't wanna assume, you know.
R:  We married real young, uh, I -- I had just passed seventeen -- I just had my eighteenth birthday and she hadn't had her seventeenth birthday.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, uh, if, uh -- if she had lived, we would've been married fifty five years.  She died in April and, uh, we were married in December, so the -- we lacked, uh, oh eight months of being married --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifty five years.
L:  Wow, that's a long time.  That's good --
R:  But she was another one like that -- just like you said, if -- if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you didn't want the truth --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't ask her.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, me and my husband are going on fifteen years.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, then you married young.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, before -- before the first one [NOISE] was born and I had him a month before I turned eighteen, so, y- --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Y- y- you're doing with your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kids like we did.  W- we always said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we grew up with our kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, y- you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- darn sure growing up with yours.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] All right. [NOISE] Yeah, w- -- and we never let 'em have babysitters and --
R:  Well.
L:  I just -- I don't.  While I was nine months pregnant and y- -- they did that first special on, uh, that, uh, twenty twenty where the babysitter's sitting there smacking the heck out of the like three month old kid 'cause it wouldn't --
R:  I saw that.  I saw that.
L:  And I'm sitting there going, "Heck no.  Never.  I would be in prison if I was w- the mum watching that video tape" [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  And so, yeah, so, we just kinda --
R:  Well, we were lucky w- for the most part, uh, when our -- when our kids were real young, we lived close to both our parents, so we had a built -- we had built in babysitters.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I technically -- we still live with my mother.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because, um ...
