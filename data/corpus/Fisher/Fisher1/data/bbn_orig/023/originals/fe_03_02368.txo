L:  My name is Tania.
R:  Hi, this is Katherine.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay, and yourself?
R:  I'm good.  So, um, what do you think is the worst of the subjects?
L:  Uh, actually I only heard the first three and --
R:  Really?
L:  I c- -- didn't really hear what she was saying.  Gossip --
R:  I think it was smoking, drinking alcohol --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, drinking too much caffeine, overeating and e- -- not exercising.
L:  Okay, um, shoot all of 'em are pretty bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But I think, um, I guess I would probably go with, um, smoking.
R:  Yeah, me too.  That's exactly what I thought, smoking.  Because that kind of affects other people as well, not just yourself, uh --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like you bother other people with --
L:  A -- a lot -- other people can be affected by it.
R:  Yeah, like second hand smoke and stuff.
L:  Yeah, and then smoking can cause more than one thing as well.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and it's probably the one that's most likely to kill you or give you like some kind of serious, um, illness or something, um --
L:  Right, it can -- yeah, lead from one thing to another --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I was thinking when she said smoking.  'Cause alcohol you can -- you know, it depends on how you drink or --
R:  Yeah, I guess you have to --
L:  -- consume[?] it or --
R:  -- w- you have to drink like a really excessive amount for it to like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hurt you badly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you d- -- you don't smoke, huh?
L:  Huh?
R:  You don't smoke?
L:  Oh, no --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  I'm a non smoker. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm a non smoker, non drinker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Do you have people around you that smoke or --
L:  Uh, no.
R:  -- any of your friends or anything?  Yeah, I don't, I mean --
L:  No, I don't really associate with a lot of people but the people I'm around are more -- more or less non smokers.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  I have a br- one brother that smokes but he's not normally around.
R:  Do you try and tell him not to and stuff?
L:  Yeah, well -- but he's grown now, so --
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but he won't listen. [LAUGH]
L:  You -- you can -- you can --
R:  Yeah, I have a brother too that smokes.
L:  [LAUGH] You can give out the information but what people do with it.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  You know, it's up to them.
R:  Yeah, it's crazy because when you try and tell people not to smoke they -- it's like they just don't get it.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you're just telling them everything that's wrong with it and you think that they would be like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I'm never smoking again".
L:  It -- a- --
R:  But for some reason they don't seem to get it.  You know what I mean?
L:  No, 'cause most people are like it has some- -- it has to personally affect them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- touch them real -- something real close to home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has to affect them before they stop doing something that we might think is negative and they don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most people are like that, you know.  
R:  Yeah, I guess they're --
L:  What --
R:  -- thinking, "Oh, I won't get cancer" or, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, "It won't happen to me, it will --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "--happen to someone else". 
L:  Or, "I'll quit when they say, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or this, or -- or --
R:  Or if they're young and they think, "Oh, nothing's ever gonna happen to me", you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they say, "Oh, I'll quit when I get to thirty or forty, or whatever".
L:  Or something like where they'll say, "Well, I don't know anybody who got cancer from smoking" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, "My mum and dad smoked" or something, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  "And they didn't -- nothing happened to them", so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I mean, I don't -- you know, 'cause I see how it -- I can't walk past somewhere that was -- someone was smoking or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're going to a restaurant and it's really smoky, I'll eat out because --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- then your clothes smell like you've been the one that was smoking.
R:  Yeah, in your hair, uh --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it's hard to get the smell out.
L:  Yeah, I go home and take a shower and all that sort of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it wouldn't have happened if, you know, I wasn't around that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type of, you know, or some --
R:  Do you think that less people are smoking now, or like the same, or --
L:  Well, everywhere I go I see somebody with a cigarette --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somewhere, or outside of a building or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it seemed like that --
R:  And you always hear people saying they're trying to quit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they don't, you know, "Oh, I'm trying to quit", you know.
L:  Yeah, then they show that one commercial, "You can quit in three days" and all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm thinking if that's really true and if you really wanna quit, more people would try that and they wouldn't be running that commercial as often.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you -- they g- -- they would try it more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And r- -- you know, if that's something they wanna do.
R:  Yeah, I guess people -- 
L:  And then other --
R:  -- are just h- hooked, uh, like, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Then other people think more or less like, "Well, you've gotta die from something so why not smoking cigarettes", you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  People have, "I don't care" attitudes.
R:  Yeah, it's really expensive as well, huh, cigarettes, I think. I think it's very expensive.
L:  Yeah, I seen that this man [MN] -- I thought he had bought a whole lot of stuff and he was in front of me in the line and he, um, the man told him seven dollars and some -- some change.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  [LAUGH] And he only had [NOISE] a pop and a pack of cigarettes [NOISE] and I was like, "Okay --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- that's a lot of money for some cigarettes".
R:  Yeah, and it adds up 'cause they smoke it every day, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- so what do you think would be the second worst one on the list.
L:  It's -- okay, we had, um, may- or -- or was it, or something, was it --
R:  I think it was, um --
L:  Smoking --
R:  Drinking too much, or drinking too much caffeine, or not exercising or, um, eating too much, I think.
L:  Well, [inaudible] for me would probably between eating [NOISE] too much or not exercising --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  'Cause that -- that can be a hazzard in itself.
R:  Yeah, 'cause that -- then you're not going to be healthy, huh?
L:  Right.  You're -- anyone, um -- some people eat and don't gain weight, other people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eat and then gain weight and then some people --
R:  Yeah, I think everyone's different, huh?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Their metabolism or whatever.
L:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause like for me, uh, out of all my mum's kids I'm the [NOISE] skinniest one that she had.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And I'm eating all the time.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, and they say like -- I stay at a normal weight, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like all the time and --
R:  You're lucky. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yes, well I think the only time I've ever been bigger than my weight is my two pregnancies and that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- my daught- --
R:  So, do you exercise?
L:  Y- Yeah, I did exercise I  -- 
R:  Yeah, that's cool.
L:  -- walked around a lot.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  Always walk or -- I used to run a lot before my first pregnancy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, shoot, that's been almost sixteen years ago. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  And my ba- baby's eight --
R:  Yeah, I run.  I love it.
L:  -- they're fifteen years apart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but, I think that overeating can be a problem 'cause it can cause other things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In your healthwise that can, um --
R:  Yeah, I think it's, um, like lately it seems like a lot of guys are saying that they like bigger women, or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it probably encourages some -- some women to like, um, not worry about their weight.  Do you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you think?  Have you noticed that?
L:  But they're still not -- they're still not healthy.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like it's not healthy for them 'cause they're thinking --
L:  It's not healthy for them.  They're thinking it's cute to please somebody else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the long run.
R:  I know and that's wrong, you know.
L:  It could cause heart attack, diabetes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cancer, lung disease.
R:  They get all kinds of health problems. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they're thinking, "Oh, you know, my boyfriend likes a big butt, or whatever, and -- and it's cute".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so they don't bother to like exercise or like watch what they eat and then in the future they'll probably --
L:  Yeah, the future, yeah.
R:  -- have like health problems and stuff.
L:  Health problems, 'cause you can overeat and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you can get heart disease.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Get diabetes.
R:  And it's kind of bad 'cause the guy is like not worrying about that he's --
L:  Yeah, when -- when -- then when you're sick, you know, they started moving all away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Done moved on to the next candidate, you know.
R:  Yeah, and it's --
L:  Now then --
R:  -- like he -- he's just worrying about what pleases him rather than actually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- caring about their health or anything like that.
L:  Now, when he moves onto them and then she's still not gonna be healthy because either she's moving away or overeating and then that cause stress.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, and that causes a- all other kind of problems too, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's probably what I think, um, not exercising follows in that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because if you're not getting the proper exercise --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you are overweight, you still can come up with some of those other kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- health problems.  Yeah --
R:  And you need to like have your heart healthy and stuff like that, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, like I know some over weight people and it's like when -- when they walk and stuff, you just --
L:  Yeah, they're tired[?].
R:  -- hear their breathing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's like, [SIGH], you know, and you feel like, "Oh, my god", like, "He's gonna die", or "She's gonna die", you know, because, um --
L:  Yeah, or, uh --
R:  -- they're so unhealthy.
L:  -- you offering 'em water and they're looking at you like you're crazy 'cause --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause you're concerned, you know.
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because there's a lot of overweight people and stuff as well, they feel like it's okay because it's like normal or whatever because it's, you know -- there's a lot of people like that, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They should think about their health.
L:  People that the -- the most -- most people I find today have this, "I don't care" attitude.
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- like the "Whatever" attitude.
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Okay, so whatever, I'm fat, whatever, I eat --"
R:  Yeah, and they're like, "Oh, well  --"
L:  "So what I smoke".
R:  I -- I'm happy the way I am", or whatever.
L:  Yeah, "So what, I smoke.  So what, I drink --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  As long as I'm not bothering nobody el-", you know.  I don't know, it came across as -- yeah --"
R:  But they're not thinking about their health and stuff.
L:  I then ran across a few people that has type of attitude that doesn't really care if they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, "Well I'm gonna die with something", type attitude.
R:  Yeah.
L:  May it be overweight.  May it be me not eating enough.  May it be me smoking.  May it be, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, alcohol or, you know, stuff like that --
R:  And they don't care, huh?
L:  But they gotta stand back and realize that other people wouldn't say anything if they didn't care.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know.
L:  So that's when it really is [inaudible] and is -- 
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  I guess you gotta have a open mind to everything or things don't seem to pan out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause if you just have that attitude where, "Oh, well I'm sm-
