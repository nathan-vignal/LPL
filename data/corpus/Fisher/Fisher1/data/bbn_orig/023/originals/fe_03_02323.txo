R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Laura.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Alan, and your name is ...?
R:  Hi, I -- I'm Laura.
L:  Laura, pleased, uh, pleased to talk to you.
R:  Yeah, nice to talk to you, too.  This is kind of interesting this survey thing [LAUGH] whatever -- whatever it is.
L:  Yes.
R:  I think it's a survey.
L:  They --
R:  What did they say the topic was, when seasons change -- 
L:  It's --
R:  -- when people get ill?
L:  Yeah.  That's, uh, that was, uh, the -- the topic and, uh, I don't know myself if it's necessarily when -- when they change, uh.  It seems to be -- seems to be a lo--
R:  You don't -- you don't have allergies or any or asthma or anything like that?
L:  No, I don't but I do -- I -- I work on the telephone to make a living and I find li- I do get a -- I do get, uh, sore throats, uh --
R:  Oh, well, I have asthma so, yeah, when seasons change it makes a -- a difference to me.
L:  It does make a difference to you? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kin-  uh, what -- what kind of changes --
R:  But I --
L:  -- do you see with that?
R:  Well, I'll start getting more asthma attacks than usual.  Usually that happens only when it gets windy, if it gets windy or, um, when there's a sudden change in temperature.  I don't, you know, I -- I live on the West Coast and it's usually sunny over here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, that's what I'm used to, but then once in a while, like yesterday, it just started raining for nothing [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, right in the middle of the day.
L:  Where are you on the West Coast?
R:  In California.
L:  Ah, I'm up in Seattle and, uh, --
R:  Oh, you are -- oh, I have three friends over there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, and we certainly, uh, certainly know about rain up here, uh, --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- so --
R:  I know.  So, do you know what?  Does it -- how -- really does it rain like every day?
L:  No, no.  That's, uh, that -- -- that -- that's a myth that we are, uh, propagating to, um, to keep --
R:  In [LAUGH].
L:  -- more folks, uh, to not move up here, uh, --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- but, uh, but no it's -- it rains often but when it's sunny it can be very nice and there are even times during the year where you'll have several days where it doesn't rain, but there -- there are times where it just does seem to be, uh, unrelenting.
R:  Ah, well, --
L:  So --
R:  -- I like the rain.  We -- we don't get it that much over here but -- but I really like the rain.  I -- I remember --
L:  Which part of California --
R:  Um, I --
L:  -- are you in?
R:  -- in the San Fernando Valley.  It's not too far from Los Angeles.  It's actually --
L:  Uh, oh.
R:  -- part of Los Angeles County but we don't like to say that we're part of Los Angeles [LAUGH].
L:  I see.  So, which -- which season changes is worse for you?
R:  Mm, spring.
L:  Spring?
R:  Mm, yeah, when it changes from -- from, you know, maybe m- see what March is?  M- March is the worst.
L:  March -- March is the worst.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How that m- that must be really hard.  I -- I -- I like s- I like s-, uh, spring starting so much myself because up here it really makes a difference, being, you know it's been cold and rainy and no leaves on the trees and things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it just, you know, it's the returning of life and all the blossoms and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all that k- all that kind of good stuff so it would be hard to have health problems, uh, associated with that.  What -- what do -- what do you do for your asthma?
R:  Well, I have in halers --
L:  [MN] Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I use.  I have, um, sometimes I have to go on steroids but I haven't been -- I haven't had to do that for about half a year.
L:  I see. [MN]
R:  So, I'm happy about that.
L:  They've been, uh, on the -- uh, on the radio up here they've been having a series of, uh, advertisements trying to encourage people to get, uh, to find out if they have asthma and get treated for it, saying that the -- the treatment has improved a lot and they can help a lot more than they used to be able to.
R: Yeah, well, plus -- and they have some, um, medications that they now -- that they're using now that they haven't used before.
L:  I see.
R:  They're a long time ago they didn't need, you know, they didn't use some of the ones that are out there on the market now through prescriptions, so, you know, but a lot has to do also if you're overweight, 'cause --
L:  I see.
R:  -- recently I -- I -- I just lost sixty one pounds and -- and I've had --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- less asthma attacks than --
L:  Congratulations.
R:  -- before.  Thank you.
L:  It does -- it does seem to have -- have an effect, uh, on --
R:  It does, it -- it really does, so now before when people would say, "Oh, you know, my doctor would say, "You have to lose weight and you'll get less asthma attacks"" and I was just like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah", but it's true.  [LAUGH]  It -- it really is true because, uh, it's working.
L:  Yeah, I had -- I had no idea that was -- that -- that was related to -- to, uh, asthma.  Um, I think -- I think if I think about it maybe I -- maybe I can get, uh, more colds when it's going from fall into winter.  It's, uh, I think it's partly psychological, maybe 'cause it's --
R:  It could be, you know, I was --
L:  -- so -- it's so depressing 'cause it gets so -- it gets so dreary here in the winter.
R:  Well, you know what?  I was wondering if it was, uh, maybe psychosomatic or something because a lot of people just, even when the holidays come, they'll, you know, they get ill or it's a, um, you know, just changes a lot of things for them.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, uh, I can -- I can see that, and for -- for me I started a new job recently and it seemed like I came down with, uh, [NOISE] I came down with a -- a sore throat, uh, soon after starting the new -- the new job, and I'm sure it was just stress and --
R:  Yeah, and do you usually work on the phone -- you said you -- you work on the phone, right?
L:  Yes, I do [NOISE].  Yeah, I w- I -- I work on the phone and --
R:  Yeah, I used to only -- those were the only kinds of jobs I used to do.
L:  I see.
R:  Working on the phone, which I'm pretty comfortable with.
L:  Well, you have a good phone voice.  It just sounds like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it would be a natural thing --
R:  Well, thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  -- for you and --
R:  Thank you.  Yeah, I -- I -- it -- it's -- that's what I'm most --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comfortable with.
L:  [MN]
R:  Just, uh, I used to work for AT&T for a little over four years and then I went to Pacific Bell, but I don't think you guys have Pacific Bell over there.
L:  No, we're just Quest up here.
R:  It's Quest, oh, g- well, over here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have you ever -- have you heard of Pacific Bell --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- or SBC?  Yeah, [COUGH] so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then, um, about a year, um, uh, maybe two years ago -- no, I guess three years ago in two thousand I quit, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was happy to do that. [LAUGH] Not because I didn't enjoy working on the phone but I couldn't stand working for Pacific Bell anymore.
L:  Uh, some companies can be, uh, can be, um, uh, pretty bad sometimes.
R:  Oh, they're -- it was -- it was terrible.  Oh, my gosh.  The thing is that no one could quit because they would pay so well and the benefits were so great that it -- you became so dependant on -- on working there.  I mean, I -- I know everybody's dependant on their job but I- I- I don't know, they even would make you think that [LAUGH] it was like the only thing you could do was -- it was crazy but it would not be, you know, I -- I -- I can't even tell you how many times I've seen people have a nervous break down at work and then the ambulance has to come and get them.
L:  Wow, that's -- yeah.
R:  That's pretty bad [LAUGH].
L:  No amount of money is worth, uh, worth that, huh?
R:  No, it's not.
L:  Worse than -- worse than, uh -- worse than, uh, the changes brought about by the seasons changes [LAUGH] chan- changes brought about --
R:  I know.
L:  -- about by, uh, by heavy handed, uh, management, uh, so --
R:  Yeah, you know, it was just real stressful.  They used to monitor the calls all the time, and I mean all the time, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you -- because we were regulated by the PUC we had all these guidelines.  It was just really, really hard.
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm, yeah, that's quite -- I -- I worked for Quest up here for a little bit and they're -- they're really bad.  They're re- -- you know.
R:  Yeah, they just --
L:  Questionable ethics and --
R:  -- expect perfection --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- seems like.
L:  Yeah, I have a -- they cer- -- they certainly can, so, uh, wh- where you -- where you are is there really, um, as far as this -- this season -- seasons thing is, uh, that much of a -- of a change in the seasons?
R:  Well, you know, we don't get all of, you know, our winters.  We don't really get a real winter.  We don't, um, we don't [NOISE] -- it just -- it doesn't -- it doesn't seem that das- that drastic.  Um, let me see.  Well, I know around December [LAUGH], November, December, I usually get sick [LAUGH] at that time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I think, I don't know, I think it's just because maybe the colder air is colder than usual.  Usually, where I live in my city it's -- it's a little warmer.  When it's colder, when it's cool in LA it's colder here, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when it's hot in LA it's w- --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- a lot hotter here where --
L:  So, what's it --
R:  -- I live in the valley.
L:  So, what's it usually like in -- in December there?
R:  Um, --
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
R:  -- it's about, let me see, it can -- it can be anywhere from maybe seventy five.  For us it's really cold [LAUGH], and then it sounds like oh seventy five, but [LAUGH] it's pretty cold for us, um, because we're used to being like maybe eighty five or eighty six degrees.
L:  Mm.
R:  Even in the winter.
L:  So, yeah, I mean that's just so -- so different.  You would, uh, uh, --
R:  What is it -- what is winter like over there for you?
L:  Um, typical day, uh, rainy and high of about forty.
R:  Oh, my gosh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- forty?
L:  Forty and, you know, forty to forty five, something like that, and --
R:  Oh, my gosh [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's, uh, it's a little different.  I mean we -- we melt when it gets over eighty degrees in the summer, you know, w- --
R:  Wha-
L:  -- we're just not used to it, uh, and it doesn't get over eighty that --
