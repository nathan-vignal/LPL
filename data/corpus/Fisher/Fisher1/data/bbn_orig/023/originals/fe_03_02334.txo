R:  Hi.  This is Patty.
L:  Hi, Patty.  This is Teresa.
R:  Hi, Teresa.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, just fine.
R:  Good.  That's an interesting topic.
L:  Yes, it is [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Kind of complex.
L:  Well, I'll tell you what, it is, and with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seasons going the way they have this year it's been strange.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, wildly.  What was the first part of the question that she said about, uh, if you go to the doctor it lasts for five days?
L:  Right, and if you don't it lasts for a week.
R:  For -- for a week, yeah.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.  I never go into the doctor if I had a cold.
L:  W- well, I don't unless it turns into bronchitis because I have a propensity to pneumonia --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so then I go, but if it's just a normal head cold, you know, it doesn't --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't seem to do any good, you know.  It's going to run its course.
R:  Well, yeah, it'll run its course --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or it'll be over by the time you get to the doctor.
L:  Absolutely, [LAUGH] that's for sure.
R:  [MN] So where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from Alabama.
R:  Okay, well, I'm calling from California. 
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Soon to be a Texan.
L:  Whoo, both [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, so you take vitamins or anything to try to stay healthy?
R:  Um, sometimes I take vitamin C.
L:  Vitamin C.
R:  Sometimes a B twelve as well.
L:  Yeah, that's pret- --
R:  Yeah, those are the best things I think.
L:  Uh-huh, that's what I do too.  I do both of those, just a good multi vitamin, uh --
R:  [MN] Yeah, multi vitamins are good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It depends.  I, um, I have a medical condition which prevents me from taking like antioxidants and things, so ...
L:  Oh, I see.  I have a bad immune system so I have to try to keep it up as good as I can [LAUGH].
R:  Mine's the opposite.  It's over active.
L:  Over active?  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have one of tho- -- I -- I have MS.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  We're stri- -- we're still trying to find out what exactly I do have [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We -- we haven't --
R:  [LIPSMACK] You're still in the process?
L:  Yeah.  I have been for about five years and we just --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Yeah, we can't find it.  I had lost my sight.  It seems that my body attacks my organs similar to what lupus does but I don't have lupus.
R:  Okay.
L:  So i- it's weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've got them doctors stumped all over the United States [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, that -- that can happen in MS also.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did it take a long time to get a diagnosis?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  What to -- to get a doctor?
L:  Huh?
R:  No.  [LIPSMACK] To -- to get a physician?
L:  Right.
R:  No.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Well, I -- I used the Internet.
L:  Oh, well, that works.
R:  Yeah, we used the Internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what was the other part of that question?  I -- I had a hard time understanding that.
L:  I -- I think -- yeah, I did too but I -- I noticed that they said something about what do you do in between to prepare for the next season to stay healthy, I think it was what it was talking about.
R:  Okay, to prepare and stay healthy for the next season?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would suppose not get sick [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH], exactly [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Stay away from the sick people [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, stay away from the sick people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Eat lots of vegetables and fruits, lots of tomatoes --
L:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  Got to eat right.
R:  Tomatoes are -- yeah, tomatoes are real good for you.
L:  Yes, they are.
R:  Matter of fact I ate about seven of 'em today [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness [LAUGH].
R:  I'm -- well, I got these new tomatoes, these Camparis.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're little ones and [SIGH] they're the best.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, we call them little cherry tomatoes.
R:  Yeah, the- these -- these are a little bit bigger than a cherry tomato but smaller than a -- little bit smaller than a Roma.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're, um, they're real tasty and real good.
L:  Oh, have you ever heard of an Italian tomato?
R:  Uh-huh, those are Romas.
L:  Oh, they're Romas?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, I didn't know that.  I just -- I thou- -- I had a friend this weekend that had a dinner party and she stuffed 'em and they were beautiful [LAUGH], you know, just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had never heard of it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, they give you Roma tomatoes.  They can also be the yellow Romas.
L:  Oh.
R:  But they're usually Romas for Italians.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, see, I'm -- I'm just a southern cook here, you know [LAUGH].
R:  A southern cook [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I had my share of that growing up [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, this one happened to have come from California so she's familiar --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- with all that cooking.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Goodness.  So, have you done many of these studies?
L:  This is my third call.
R:  [MN] Okay, and that's all we're allowed to do, right?
L:  That's what I heard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my second.
L:  This is your second?
R:  The first one was on food.
L:  Ah.
R:  Now this one's on what do I do in between the seasons?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just I guess take vitamins, eat well and, uh, sleep.
L:  Right, right.
R:  That's the only thing you can -- and stay active.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  And, um, to --
L:  I -- I stay in front of my computer too much [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] I -- I play -- do a decent amount but I have a son who's a year and a half so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- doesn't allow that much time.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.  Mine are sixteen and eighteen, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Oh, so you got more time.
L:  Yeah, I got more time now [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm running after him, chasing him off the chair --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- off the table.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So lifting thirty pounds here --
L:  That dangerous stage.
R:  [MN] You lift thirty pounds a hundred times a day and --
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- yeah, you get your work out.  
L:  There you go, you're getting a good work out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was trying to think what my first call was on.  It was something weird and I started not to even accept it but I can't remember -- you're the first female.  I've had two males --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I've talked to.  Yeah.
R:  No, two females here --
L:  Ah.
R:  [MN] And --
L:  'Cause I was wondering about --
R:  -- the first gal was from Philadelphia.
L:  Huh?
R:  First gal I talked to yesterday was from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I talked to a guy yesterday.  He was from Texas.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, and the other one was too, come to think of it.  Both of them have been from Texas.
R:  Really, well, that's where I'm moving to in two weeks.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah, moving up in North Dallas, north of Dallas.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mineral Lake area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Wow.
R:  But I was born and raised here in California.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Southern Cal- Los Angeles.
L:  You're gonna be in for a switch with this humidity [LAUGH].
R:  It's not too bad where I'm moving to.
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- it -- they have a much different climate.  They average, you know, five to ten degrees cooler than Dallas.
L:  Oh, well that --
R:  And they don't get the -- the -- quite as bad humidity.
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it'll be nice.
L:  That'll help with health problems too, not to be in that humid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- climate.
R:  They say the dry but then the heat kills me, so ...
L:  Oh, yeah, I can't stand heat.
R:  I'm kind of screwed either way. [LAUGH]
L:  Give me an air conditioning and I stay in as much as I can in the summer and I love to be out in the winter [LAUGH].
R:  Yep, same here.
L:  Uh, don't like the hot weather.
R:  [MN] Well, I don't get sick too often though.
L:  I don't anymore.
R:  Usually, once -- one --
L:  I used to but I was on Prednazone and I had gone through a chemotherapy trying to get my sight back, which worked.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, it did?  Good.
L:  Yeah, it did. I was -- I was blind for three years and my --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, I got it back and, um --
R:  That's just short of a miracle.
L:  [MN] I'm telling ya.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I mean, they had told me over and over, "You will never see".  An- and I just never gave up hope for a minute, you know, uh-huh.  I will, too.  Don't know how but I will. [LAUGH] And I did, praise the Lord [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I was, uh, thrilled.  [MN] But I -- I have to keep my tr- my immune system try to get it built up, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- taking the vitamins.
R:  Antioxidants are good for building the immune system and so is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so is a B con- uh, B fifty.
L:  Yeah, I heard -- I just heard that one actually.  Did not know that one.
R:  Did you?  Yeah, B fifty.  I can't take 'em.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, yeah, for an immu- inadequate immune system, definitely B fifty, vitamin C.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Make sure to have your D.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A and D.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but if you're taking a multi vitamin I would just kick it with like a B twelve also.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's what I'm --
R:  A thousand micrograms.
L:  Right, right.  Well, I'll have to get some.
R:  Just -- just on top of that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  'Cause that really, that's -- it's really good for your immune system.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't like to over --
R:  And of course vegetables.
L:  -- take anything in the vitamins.
R:  Right.
L:  I think you can carry it too far, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN] Well, the good thing with C is that your body just gets rid of what it doesn't need.
L:  Gets rid of it, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love that.  I actually take the estra[?] C 'cause it's easier on the stomach.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  But, yeah, if you, uh, take your multi and then just take it [MN] with a small B --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like a B twelve you -- you should be doing pretty good.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good.  Are you -- do you have to take the -- any kind of steroid?
R:  No.
L:  No.  Good.
R: No.  I -- I take, uh, uh, Copaxin, it's an injectable, every day.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It actually decreases my immune system.
L:  Right, right.  Oh --
R:  So, I've had -- I've had it -- I've been in a state of constant cold for a month.
L:  Oh, my goodness [LAUGH].
R:  But it keeps the, uh, relapses away.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah, so I can't complain.
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  If I get a little stuffy nosed, so what. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Other than that I feel fine [MN].
L:  Well, that's great [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a good thing.  Mm.
L:  How -- how long have you been diagnosed?
R:  [MN] Uh, back in ninety three.
L:  Ninety three.
R:  Ten years ago, but didn't take any -- didn't take any measures till my son was eight months old and I was in hospital for five days.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And then I said, "Well, you know, I think it's time I do something about this so it doesn't happen again". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So, I -- I have it very mildly compared to -- compared to a lot of people so I'm very lucky.
L:  Oh, I'm glad.  That's great.
R:  So, I'll just cross my fingers it doesn't take a turn for the worse and that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Move on making plans as normal. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, so.  Oh, goodness.  Ten minutes of talking on, uh, what you do in between seasons.  I think we covered it.
L:  Yeah, I think we covered it about as good as you can.  I -- I think sometimes they give us a tough s- tough subject and then try to figure out what we are going to talk about [LAUGH].
R:  You think that's it?  [inaudible].
L:  I'm telling ya.  Whoo.
R:  [MN] Oh, goodness.  So, whereabouts in Alabama are you?
