L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Mindy.
R:  Hey, Mindy.  My name is Dan.
L:  Hi.  Have you ever done this before?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I've done it like, uh, two or three times.
L:  Oh, have you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  This -- this is kind of a hard topic --
R:  Uh, w- --
L:  -- for me anyway [LAUGH].
R:  What was that -- what was that quote at the end?  I didn't hear it right.
L:  Um, something about if you -- you'll keep a cold seven days if you don't go to the doctor and --
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought --
L:  Something else? [LAUGH]
R:  -- I thought they said a cold can last seven days if you don't go to the bathroom and I was like, what's that supposed to mean.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't think that's what they said. [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  Well, that's good 'cause I would really get things started off on the wrong foot I think.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so illness and colds I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, yeah.  I don't -- I don't get sick that often luckily.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  So, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you, ah, are you a pretty healthy person then?
L:  Well, I mean I -- I think I'm average.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- I mean, I guess I -- I get the occasional cold but I know some, you know, a lot of people get like flu shots and stuff at my work and I don't do that, but --
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  -- I don't seem to get sick that often.
R:  They offer flu shots at your work?
L:  What was that?
R:  They offer flu shots --
L:  Not at -- no, not at my work but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, like a lot of people at my work go and get 'em from --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- their doctors every year.
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I worked at a -- I worked in an old folks' home and they offered flu shots right on the spot 'cause they had a nurse, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I thought maybe you worked in something similar.
L:  No, no.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [MN] But anyway how 'bout you?
R:  Well, I would say, uh, I have very strong immunity especially for a smoker.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, like, uh, I get sick probably once or twice a year and even then it's just a little cold that lasts a week at the longest.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, you're lucky too then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I can't remember the last time -- well, I guess --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a couple of months ago I had a little cold but I -- yeah.
R:  Did you stay home and rest?
L:  I don't get sick that often.  I did, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  That's good.  It's -- it's good not to go to work when you're sick.
L:  Yeah.  At our wor- ah, my work the- it's a kind of strict rule, not just because -- just because they don't want everyone getting sick and --
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  [MN] Yeah, that -- that is a good rule [LAUGH].
R:  Well, and it sounds like, uh, sounds like you have some integrity 'cause a lot of people, uh, go to work and pretend that, you know, they're okay when they're really sick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then everybody else gets sick thanks to them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jerk.
L:  Yeah, that is bad.  So, what -- what was the other --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- things they said to talk about?
R:  Uh, well, let's see.
L:  Besides illness.
R:  It was, uh, the changing of the seasons and how that impacts --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- uh, getting sick.
L:  My -- now, my husband gets that.  He, like -- he always gets sick when the seasons change.  But he has, um, [MN] he caught this virus, um --
R:  Was it SARS?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, this is a long time ago [MN] before --
R:  Oh, okay.  That's good.
L:  -- there was SARS, but he caught this virus a long time ago, um, when he was -- they had these floods and he was, um -- [LIPSMACK] anyway he was do- doing some service and helping people at the floods and he was out in the water, and there was some kind of bacteria in it.  He gets this -- so he has this virus in this bacteria and like every time the seasons change, like twice a year, he g- he gets really sick.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, you know, it's kind of sad but --
R:  [NOISE] So what --
L:  -- he actually -- it w- y- it was really bad.  Like, he almost died and then he --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- actually went -- yeah, he tried like all these different medications and all these different, um, you know, te- the doctors test him for all these diseases and all the stuff.  Anyway, the only thing that helped him is he went to this, um, Chinese medicine doctor and gave him these --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- herbal supplements.  Yeah, and so every time he -- every time that the season changes he takes these, um, this herbal medicine and he doesn't get sick.
R:  Wow, well, I can honestly say, uh, I didn't put much faith in witch doctors but that's pretty convincing.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  It was amazing.  Well he, you know, none of the doctors -- they just kept giving him like pain killers and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --you know, they had no idea what it was and --
R:  Those creeps.
L:  -- yeah, so [MN] -- ah, you know, they didn't -- I mean, they believed him, they could see he was in pain but, you know, they were just like, "Oh well --"
R:  Sure.
L:  -- there's nothing really we can do because we tested you for everything".  So that was like really a blessing that he was able to go to that.  And he was a skeptic at first too.  He was like, "Well, I don't know".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But it turned out to be really good, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Excellent, so, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  Floods?  What -- what part of the country do you live in?
L:  [MN] Well, we live in [LAUGH] we live in the North West.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  We live in Vancouver, Washington, yeah.
R:  Oh, really?  I, uh --
L:  But --
R:  I'm from Seattle myself.
L:  Oh, are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we go to Seattle a lot.  But this was actually when he was living in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, back, you know, way before we were married --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he was -- they had really bad floods down there that year and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, he was in the flood water helping people get their stuff out of their house and kinda [MN] caught some sort of bacteria.  I don't know.  It's kind of a mystery.  We'll never really know I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've h- I've heard about stuff like that before --
L:  Really?
R:  -- on talk shows, like, uh, people that, you know, get a splinter and then all of a sudden they have, like, a flesh eating virus that --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- almost like kills them and it takes, like, half their arm and, like, three of their --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- legs and ... [LAUGH]
L:  That's horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We -- we won't go on any talk shows or anything but [LAUGH] -- but, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Like yours is a more modest story, I think.
L:  Yeah, well, more, not so flashy. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well, it's probably a lot easier to stomach anyways, uh, than people that have a flesh eating virus that --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  --eats half their face off like the people I saw.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  That's terrible.  So, uh, every time the seasons change he has to -- or he -- he takes these, uh, the Chinese drugs?
L:  Yeah.  It's just -- it's [LAUGH] it's just like, ah, some kind of herb, um, that -- he's actually -- the doctor he gets it from is actually German, um, but he's a Chinese medicine doctor.  I mean, you'd think he was Chinese but he's German.  That's kind of interesting I thought.
R:  Is -- is he an Asian German?
L:  No, he's not.
R:  Oh, that's, uh --
L:  It's interesting, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  I know, it's kind of interesting.  But anyway, yeah, he just takes his -- this medicine that he gave him, these herbs, and he stays pretty healthy.
R:  Excellent.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  What else can we say about illness?  That's kind of a hard topic for me 'cause I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's, uh, it's not something that really makes your blood boil or it's something that you can think about a lot of stuff to talk about --
L:  Yeah, there's not --
R:  -- with.
L:  -- like a controversy or anything about [LAUGH] illness.
R:  Yeah, I mean the --
L:  It -- it's sad.
R:  -- other ones I --
L:  Nobody wants to get sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, or else, uh, like one of 'em that I took was, uh, how did nine eleven make you feel?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, let's see, how do you feel about family ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so on and so forth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But those diseases, yeah, they'll do you in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nobody likes those things.
L:  [LIPSMACK] No.
R:  [LAUGH] So, um, is it, uh, is it pretty cold up there right now, pretty snowy?
L:  Um, it's not snowy.  It hardly -- it never really snows here.  It just rains all the time.
R:  [MN] Well, I guess Vancouver is only a couple of hours away from Seattle.
L:  Yeah, it's like two hours -- 
R:  Yeah, it's been --
L:  -- away from Seattle.
R:  -- it's been --
L:  It's --
R:  -- gorgeous in Seattle.  Can tell you that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  We -- I was just up in Seattle, uh, last weekend was it, or the weekend before I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, yeah, it was nice that day.
R:  Did you go up for business or pleasure?
L:  Um, for pleasure.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My best friend --
R:  Excellent.
L:  -- lives in Seattle. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, she lives in Redmond area, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They actually just moved so it's nice to have her close now and we can go visit her all the time.
R:  Well, that's great.  Uh, does she get sick a lot?
L:  Um, she doesn't. [LAUGH] Ah, my husband's the only person I know that gets, you know, that has like some sort of [MN] illness where --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they get sick often.
R:  Poor guy.
L:  [MN] Yeah, it's -- it's rough.
R:  Do you take good care of him when he gets sick?
L:  Um --
R:  Bring him some orange juice and stuff?
L:  I try.  It's hard, you know, 'cause I'm -- I'm at work all day, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  [LAUGH] But I try.  He hasn't gotten sick since probably for about five -- like really sick where he can't get out of bed and his --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- joints lock up and stuff for like five years, so ...
R:  Oh, well that's [NOISE] -- that's good to know.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  Getting so [NOISE] -- oh, yeah, so what do you do to keep healthy?  Ah, do you eat pretty healthy?
L:  [MN] I try to eat healthy.  I mean, I'm -- I'm not like, you know, crazy about it like some people are but I try.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I try to eat healthy.  I w- I try to exercise but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's hard after working all day.  I'm not too motivated sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Like, it's -- it's peculiar because, I mean, I -- I'm a college student so obviously I don't --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- eat that healthy, you know, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eat ram
