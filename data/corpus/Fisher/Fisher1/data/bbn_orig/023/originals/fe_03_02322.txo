L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Sheila --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I'm from New York. 
R:  Hello, my name is Sheila, also.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Okay, we got different seasons here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, what do we do for a cold?  Uh, changing seasons.  We have had a very bad winter here so we've had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of, uh, snow, uh, and, uh, you do get colds --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and if the only way to protect yourself is to stay away from people that do have colds --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because that's where you would be getting it from.  You're getting it from others that have it.  You agree, right?
R:  I do agree, and I'm in Los Angeles where we don't have a change of season and it doesn't snow, except for in the mountains, and, uh, I was born in the Midwest so I have experienced, uh, seasonal changes [NOISE], um, but it still does seem to me that there is,  [NOISE] um, illnesses that are related to the s- seasons, um, although they're not as severe as in other parts of the country this year.
L:  Well, I think in New York you do get more colds and more illness because you've get freezing weather, you do, and I came to -- back from Florida and the change in weather you do get sick [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  And there's really nothing that you can do to protect yourself except to stay out of crowds.
R:  Yes, I agree.  Um, of course dressing warmly in cold weather and, um, here that would be in the evening, uh, 'specially in the fall.  Uh, around those months it does get pretty cool at night, but un- unless you encounter the germ you're not likely to -- to succumb to a cold or anything like that.
L:  Right, that's how your, you know, your immunity is also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some people are more susceptible.  And the second question was about how we wait seven days.  Do you go to a doctor [LAUGH] or do you just wait out your cold?
R:  I usually just wait it out.
L:  Sure.
R:  I -- I'm not one to go to the doctor unless I'm really sick.
L:  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't go either.  I mean especially now for a cold.  The only time I mean, you know, if it was one of my children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the cold is really going to the bronchial tubes then you need an antibiotic, but otherwise there's nothing really that you could do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You have to wait it out.
R:  That's true, yes.  I -- I do agree.  Um, [MN] chicken noodle soup and orange juice [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all those wonderful things help. [LAUGH]
L:  I have a lot of things here that I bought though.  I did have a cold about, oh, it was in January, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When I came back from Florida I got a beauty, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was taking Dimetapp and I was taking these, you know, four hour cold tablets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think they worked.  I think they masked it though.  I don't think they really [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah, sometimes they do, um, uh, have an effect on the symptoms, maybe the runny nose or the cough, but you may still actually have a cold or, uh, I'm not sure how that works but, um, --
L:  Yeah, I have them here.  I have Dimetapp, and then I bought a cough, god, I got Vicks and all this stuff, but thank god it didn't go into my bronchial tubes.  Then I -- then I think I would have gotten some medical help. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, exactly, yeah.
L:  But the cough, I mean you've got to be very careful that you don't give it to anybody else.
R:  Yes, that's true [MN].
L:  I mean there were studies that were done on this.  You could take [MN] thirty men and put them in a room in their underwear and only give them [LAUGH], you know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cold water to drink with a, you know, fan on them?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They wouldn't get the cold, but -- but the same thirty people in a room with someone else that has the cold, they're going to get it.
R:  Exactly, yeah, that's a very good point. [COUGH]
L:  But the changing seasons really though, I think the weather you have there in California is more stable.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Here in New York, um, I don't know.  We can have some days that even during the winter where it was sixty degrees and then we could go down to twelve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And then the wind chills and we'd wake up and we'd have like, you know, twelve feet of snow.
R:  Sure.
L:  And you'd get frost bitten hands, you know, really it's, uh, very bad.  You really can't protect yourself that much.
R:  Yeah, sure, it's -- it's no telling what will happen, I mean in terms of how the weather will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be that day, huh?
L:  Right, it would -- and I think this year was the coldest winter, and more people were sick with that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than anything else.
R:  Sure.  Do you think allergies are also included in the seasonal illnesses, or ...?
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah, okay, yeah.
L:  Definitely.  My son has asthma [NOISE] --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and he's only affected on it surprisingly not during the winter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The snow is good.  It's when all the grass comes out and everything and then the symptoms --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are just like a cold.
R:  Sure.  Yeah, that's happened to me before in another state.  I lived in Michigan for a while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's when I found out I'm allergic to, uh, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cut grass and ash trees and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- certain pine trees, a lot of other things because in the fall it just really affected me.
L:  [NOISE] Did you go for all the testing?
R:  I did. I was -- I was really fortunate and they had a very good, um, um, center there at the hospital and they were able to test me for all the different, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- allergens and that's how I found out.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, but you know what?  It really doesn't help you for them to tell you you're allergic to timoti[?] grass [LAUGH] --
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  -- because what are you going to do?
R:  How can you avoid it, right?
L:  You can't avoid it, I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] It's true, yeah.  That -- that's a good point [LAUGH].
L:  Do you know, it's -- it's, you know, it's in the -- well, I took my son too and he was allergic to flour and all this stuff but I don't think it really has that much difference.  I think it's the season when it's all that, you know, the pollen in the air.
R:  Right.
L:  It will just trigger off -- same symptoms like if you have a cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're sneezing and you're coughing.  You're having difficulty breathing.
R:  Right.
L:  Then the flour comes into part, but the winter is better [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for those that have allergies, [NOISE] and it's really something.  It's just like you really have a cold.  The same thing is even with a dog or an animal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that some people have the allergies towards them, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they look just like they have a cold.  Their eyes get watery, their mou- you know.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's really bad.  Um, it -- it -- that was the reaction I had.  I felt as though I had a cold or the flu and, um, I didn't have a fever or anything, and I come to find out it was just allergy reaction, uh.
L:  [NOISE] Well, there's a lot of medicines that you can take --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for that too.
R:  That's true.
L:  I mean I only get the over the counter, 'cause as I say I don't go to the doctor for a cold or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I believe --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- there's more people are suffering from allergies now that medicines have improved.  They're a -- a lot better.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It used to be they'd make you drowsy and you couldn't really take 'em during certain times --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but now they're much better. [NOISE]
L:  Yes, there's a new drug out -- [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  -- Singular.  That you take one pill a day and it's supposed to ward off attack, and there's w -- and it's supposed to really make you better.
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  Then after on this three months you might not need the inhalers.
R:  [NOISE] That's great.  That's very good.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, um, yeah I -- I read about it.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, this is one, because the other ones is that you're on pills for the rest of your life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You're on pills and you're on -- then you offer to take shots.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, you see my son just looks like he has a cold [MN].
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  So, for me I don't like the winter, but for [NOISE] those that have asthma or any type of allergies they're better off.
R:  Sure, that's true, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] In a colder climate.
R:  [NOISE] Even for, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was thinking about pollution [NOISE], um, you know, air pollution --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's better in the winter, um, because it doesn't have the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, at least out here the heat, the sun in the middle of summer, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- creates the smog effect.  It helps the smog along, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Do you know, you know, you're talking to someone from New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Last year I was here for September eleventh, okay [NOISE]?
R:  Oh, my goodness, yeah.
L:  Right, and, um, [NOISE] I was in Brooklyn, like, it -- it -- maybe not a hundred, maybe fifty miles from the city.  I was nowhere near where it happened, [NOISE] yet the air you're talking about pollutants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was awful.  You went out and you smelled [NOISE] smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You saw it in the air, I mean, and there was difficulty breathing.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  And, um, I -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now it's, you know, it's -- b- j- over, way over a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's -- yeah-
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people had a lot of breathing problems then.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  I'm sure.
L:  So a cold was, you know, minimized --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as this goes, so, um, --
R:  Yeah, I can only imagine, um.  Here we deal with smog every day, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but if -- it gets worse at certain times of the year, uh, but I think something, uh, like nine eleven is just, uh, s- tremendous, uh.  Y- I mean the -- the air pollution effects and everything else it's amazing, [NOISE] you know.
L:  [NOISE] Right, and a lot of these things too just made you feel like you had a cold or you're breathing the same things and [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but thank god they cleaned this all up.
R:  Mhm, definitely.
L:  There was still empty buildings in the city though.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Anything within, um, like a ten block radius --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is empty.
R:  Is that due to, uh, some restrictions or are they just --
L:  Well, the  all the damages damaged the pipes and, um, --
R:  Oh, I see, yes.
L:  -- and the apartments whatever it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like you talk about pollutants were still in the air and still in the apartments, and they thought it was a health hazard so everybody was out of that.
