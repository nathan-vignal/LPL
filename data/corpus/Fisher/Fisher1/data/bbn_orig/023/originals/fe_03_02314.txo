R:  I'm okay.  How are you doing?
L:  Oh, fine, fine, fine, and the weather's changed. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes, very --
R:  Definitely.

R:  Well, over here it's, you know, it's kind of windy, warm windy, and --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in New York.  Are you in New York?
L:  Oh, New York.  No, no, I'm in South Carolina, man.  I was raised in the Bronx.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, and where the weather -- where the weather had the tendency to, you know, but uh, weather's changed all over the planet now.  Weather's not like it used to be when I was coming up.  I was -- I'm sixty years old now.
R:  Well.
L:  And it used to be -- it used to be when winter came it used to be winter.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, but it's not that way anymore.  How da weather in New York today?
R:  Oh, it's that -- it was actually pretty good --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- except for a little bit of rain, like drizzle and that.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Kind of ruined the day actually, 'cause it was all nice and sunny and then it just started raining.  I don't know, uh --
L:  It was hot here on the hill -- I'm in South Carolina in a little place called Macona, South Carolina.  Man, it was hot here all day.  It was -- it was hot here today and it's hot here now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, matter of fact we have the air condition on.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, so you know it's hot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you got to keep fresh.
L:  Huh?
R:  You got to keep fresh.
L:  Well, it's hot.  It's hot, man, I mean if it -- if it wasn't -- if it wasn't as warm today we wouldn't have it on, because I don't fe -- I don't -- particularly don't like cold weather but this time it's real warm here.
R:  Yes, definitely.
L:  So, I mean, how does the weather affect you, I mean, how -- what do you do to, uh, protect yourself from one season to the next?  I no- I notice a lot of folks, the first warm day if there's even a -- during the so called winter time, a lot of people take off all their clothing.
R:  Yeah, well, I usually, you know, like I never listen to like, I listen to the weather but you never believe the weatherman, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I usually just, you know, set aside a couple of outfits for when I think the day's gonna be nice, you know.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  So, you know, and besides that --
L:  Well --
R:  I'm always wearing a jacket, though.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I make sure, you know.
L:  Yeah, well New -- New York, yeah.  Well, I -- I'm, you know, I -- and I like I say when I was coming up, the snow, d -- you don't have any snow in New York like they used to have snow.
R:  No, definitely not.
L:  Huh?
R:  Definitely not.
L:  I remember when you couldn't walk outside, man.  I mean it would be all wet to the stoops door.  You know you could -- just couldn't, I mean it was a helluva -- first of all, how old are you?
R:  Me, I'm twenty -- I'll be twenty six next month.
L:  Oh, you're a youngster.  Oh, I have about five or six children your age.  
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, so d- d- so- the- so, I guess that the most you know about snow when it used to snow a lot was riding round on your pop's back or something like that, huh?
R:  Yeah, more or less.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, what part of New York are you at?
R:  I'm -- I'm in Manhattan, but I'm from Brooklyn.
L:  Okay, um, Brook- okay, okay, okay, okay.  Yeah, so the weather says it was raining up there on most of the day today, huh?
R:  Yeah, more or less.  It was like -- I mean it wasn't like an ugly day 'cause it was still pretty nice outside.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But something told me that, you know, walk outside today with my raincoat.  Something just told me to do that.
L:  [MN] Well, that's that -- that's that -- that's that -- that's that real self speaking to you.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And you obeyed the command.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You got something going for yourself if you follow that mind all the time.
R:  Tell me about it, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes siree, and so, wh- wh- so, what part -- so, what -- where in Brooklyn, what part of Brooklyn are you in?
R:  I'm in Bushwick.
L:  Okay, Bushwick, okay.  I lived on Nostrand Avenue for about ten years six eight eight Nostrand, down between Nostrand and Saint Marks.
R:  Oh, yeah, I know that.
L:  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Then my wife is from Ghana.  She lived this way.  All her family came to Brooklyn naturally --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- from the islands, so ...
R:  Well, so how did you get to move out there?
L:  Well, my -- I moved to North Carolina first.  My mother, well m- -- you know, naturally most of us are immigrants from the South.
R:  Okay.
L:  My mother was from North Carolina.  I moved to North Carolina first, and when my family divorced, and I met my wife here in this part of South Carolina, so I moved here.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I really don't like it.  It's too small for me.  I'm not used to small towns.  The weather, like I say, the weather here, though, I mean, a- all throughout the South, I mean, and not only the South, New York, weather's basically the same throughout -- through -- up and down the East Coast now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, it's basically the same, but it -- it -- it -- it was extremely warm here today, man.
R:  Mm, I could imagine.  You -- you -- it sounds like it was warm over there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?  Yeah, i- i- it was -- it was ah -- it was at least eighty five degrees here today.
R:  Wow.  It was just like seventy eight over here.
L:  Yeah, it was, yeah, I mean, you know, and it's, uh, -- well w- [LAUGH] it was hot like I said.  Uh, we have the air condition on here now, and that's how hot it is in this house.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, tomorrow, you don't know what.  You may go out there tomorrow and it might be sixty five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and -- and that's pneumonia weather --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because o- often during the change of the season like this with the weather fluctuating like it does, you know, you can easy get sick.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  You can easy get sick.  What's your name?  Matter of fact, I don't know -- what was your name again?
R:  Jose.
L:  Jose, Jose, okay, Jose, okay.  I have a couple of friends named Jose.  You Latino?
R:  Yes.

R:  Yeah, two sisters.
L:  Okay.  Everybody still in Brooklyn?
R:  Yeah.  I was the only one that got out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I was the only one that got out.

L:  Okay.  You know when I move -- when I -- when I moved to North Carolina, uh, uh, I had friends that followed me there from New York.
R:  Oh, yeah?

R:  I hear it's nice over there.
L:  Huh?
R:  I hear it's real nice over there.
L:  Man, it's -- it- i- look [LAUGH], it's nice a whole lot of places, man.  New York used to be really New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, New York has, uh, a- a- you know, uh, i- it is going through a transition now, but I --
R:  Big transition.
L:  Yeah, but I remember when you could, uh, on -- during the summer time there, you could, uh, you could go sleep on the fire escape.  The guys who fly pigeons, he'd go on the roof, man, and you could take a lodge out there, and sometimes you wake up it's two, three o'clock in the morning.  You didn't have to worry about no -- you know, you just didn't have to worry about the things you have to worry about now.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  You understand, so that's -- tha- that's the New York that I remember, yeah, but I still kind of miss New York sometimes because of the cultural, uh, things are so available, and you -- you do miss some things from there, but once you move to the South --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the different climate and the temperature, it's -- it's kind of hard, and once you go back there to stay, [LAUGH] it -- it's hard --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's hard to stay for a period of time though, man.
R:  Well, I'm actually trying to get out of here.
L:  Huh?

R:  Oh, I'm a model.
L:  A- a- a model?
R:  Yeah.

R:  Definitely.

R:  Well, just like, since the beginning of the year, it's like I've been, I've switched agencies, so it's been, you know, I had to start all over again.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  But, for the past two years, I -- I've worked pretty much.
