L:  Hello, my name is Roland L. Johnson, junior.
R:  Hello, my name is Dwayne Keith Klausau.  [PAUSE] How are you doing Roland?
L:  I'm doing all right, how are you doing Keith?
R:  Good.  Good.  So, um ...
L:  Is it Dwayne, or ...?
R:  It's Dwayne.
L:  Dwayne, okay sorry.
R:  Yeah, that's my first.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm doing pretty good, only I'm stuck in traffic on the stupid expressway, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh that -- that'-- that's uncool.
R:  Yeah, where are you?
L:  I'm in Alatha, where are you?
R:  Um, in Philadelphia?
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm in -- I'm in -- I'm at home in my living room.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well you're lucky. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah. I beat the, ah -- the, ah, afternoon rush hour already.
R:  Oh, good, good, good.  So, our topic is, um, which is worse?  So, I'm a real an- I'm a real anti smoking person, myself.
L:  Ah, so am I.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah, to the utmost, yeah.  I've got six kids and I just -- I don't like smoking any way, shape or fashion.
R:  Yeah, I agree completely.  I -- especially, I don't know if you're familiar with it or not, but New York and California, yo- you're in Philadelphia, are you, or ...?
L:  No, I'm in Alatha, Kansas.
R:  Oh, you're in Kansas, I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Oh Kansas, oh wow, um, yeah, in New York and California they recently passed laws that make it, ah, illegal to smoke in any public place.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Which is pretty amazing, so you don't have to deal with even, smoking in bars or restaurants.
L:  You know, that is awesome because there's still, you know, restaurants and bars and, well, my wife and I, we don't go to bars or anything like that, you know, but w- I mean, just restaurants in general, like, if we, you know, all go out to eat as a family, you know, I don't want to have to inhale someone's smoke while I'm eating.
R:  I know.  I find it disgusting --
L:  I can -- I can really -- I truly appreciate that law that was passed, you know, not permitting people to smoke in public places because, you know, whether people tend to believe it or not, second hand smoke is the most dangerous, you know.
R:  It's dangerous.  It's very dangerous and it's also just -- I just find it just really unpleasant if you're going out to spend money on a -- on a nice dinner or something like that it's just, ah, it's just s- something really -- it seems very intrusive to -- to do that to somebody else, smoke near somebody else and I don't -- I -- I -- since I've never smoked myself, have you ever smoked at all?
L:  No.  Well, see, when I was about eleven years old I tried it once and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- never again in my life, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I -- I smoked one of my grandmother's cigarettes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you know, I -- I smoked it so fast I got a headache really, really bad and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you know, even before then, you know, I was just a kid, you know, being curious, ah, you know, I never really liked cigarette smoke but I just wanted to see, you know, why every body was doing it and I -- I didn't like it, you know, I was choking for, you know, minutes afterwards and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, y- you ever notice when you kiss a person that has smoked, it's like licking an ashtray.
R:  Argh.  Sure, I know.  I've never -- I um, fort- I -- I dated -- I dated one person who, um -- I only dated one person ever who smoked and she um, she -- she tried to keep it from me, not that I'm a judge -- I really -- I -- I have nothing against people who smoke in general, if they want to smoke in their own homes, or in their own cars or whatever, I really don't have a problem with it, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she -- she tried to keep it from me and, ah, it was, but you know, it's impossible because everything does smell like smoke, eventually you get around to it.
L:  Exactly, yeah, and ah, case in point.  I used to work at th- this was, like, about in nineteen ninety, I used to work at Tom Thumb, it's a really upscale grocery store --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in D- in Dallas, Texas --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they've got a smoking break room and a non smoking break room, right th- 
R:  Okay.
L:  They're painted exactly the same, except when you go in the smoking break room where you can smoke, the walls are yellow from the cigarette smoking --
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I couldn't believe it, you know, how the -- it's just that, I mean it -- it's crazy --
R:  It's pretty amazing, yeah.
L:  You know, people want to smoke, and you know, what it does to your lungs, I've [COUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  It's amazing that it's legal actually, in a way.  I mean, really what it comes down to, and I guess -- I guess c- certain things, I'm not really a -- a drinker, either, but, ah, you know --
L:  Y- y- yeah, neither are we.
R:  I do have, um -- I do have friends and I'll have, like, an occasional glass of wine or something like that, but I've -- I've never been quote, unquote, drunk or anything like that, but --
L:  Right.
L:  -- certain -- certain things to me, like, um, drinking and smoking, it's amazing are -- that they are -- that they are actually legal when all the health hazards, plus, you know, public safety hazard as well --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess they're legal, probably pretty much because there's a lot of money in 'em, sure that's why they're legal.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  But then some other things, like, um, marijuana smoking which is just as dangerous as -- as alcohol in a lot of ways, is -- is completely illegal. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is kind of frustrating, um, it -- it -- it g- it seems -- seems a bit hypocritical.
L:  Right.  Very.  I mean, I just, it -- it's crazy, you know, how, you know, they can allow people to do this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if -- if alcohol was, you know, if it was illegal, you know, we wouldn't have people killing people with their vehicles, driving drunk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Absolutely.  I was involved in a car accident, I was hit by, ah, by a truck from a dr- a truck driver who was driving drunk and lucky to even make it out, you know, I had sixteen stitches in my head and the whole nine yards --
L:  Oh, man, that was a blessing.
R:  Yeah, very much a blessing that I made it through.  I thought, you know, incredible, it's -- so therefore that's why -- I think that's one of the reasons since -- that happened when I was six, seventeen, I never really tend to -- I never decided I would drink at all.  I -- I've never had a drink in a bar even though I um, I travel around for a living --
L:  Mm.
R:  --and um, but you know, I j- I -- I told myself I would never drink, and get even one drink and get behind the wheel of a car.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which is just, ah, it's just incredible to me that, you know, that -- that -- that's even allowed in this day and age.
L:  Yeah, I know, it's -- it's -- it's really crazy, then, what do you think about, you know, peop- oh, are you there?
R:  I'm here, yes.
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] I thought the phone hung up or something.
R:  No.
L:  Um, ah, what do you think about people and, you know, their, you know, habits?  I see some really disgusting habits on the freeway.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Particularly people with very nice vehicles.  I catch them picking -- picking their nose.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You ever seen that?
R:  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Sure, I know, I don't -- I don't get that.  [several inaudible words] it's just people feel like they're -- I think they feel, like, they're by themselves in there in their cars, you know.
L:  E- exactly.
R:  Not realizing that everybody can see everything that they're doing --
L:  Exactly [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when they surround them.  I know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, um, and cell phones are another thing th- they should, I mean, that's something that I'm talking on right now as we drive, but I'm talking on, like, ah, in a -- in a -- in a headset type thing.
L:  A headset?  Great, yeah that's the safest way to do it.
R:  Yeah, which is actually a law in New York now, too, um, so you have to wear -- use that when you talk on a head phone -- o- on a -- on a cell phone.  But that's -- I mean, they cause more accidents than -- I mean it's very difficult if you're [inaudible] it can be very distracted like that.
L:  Right.  You know, because you can get very emotional on the other line, like --
R:  sure.
L:  -- say you're talking to this girlfriend that wants to break up with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and you're flying down the highway at seventy miles an hour, your eyes full of tears, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that could be pretty dangerous.
R:  That's a good point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A good point -- I don't --
L:  I've seen it. [COUGH]
R:  Oh yeah, I've seen people getting into, um -- I -- I-- I've almost had it happen to me a couple of times, when someone calls me and you're reaching for your phone and trying to get it together and you realize that, you know, you're not -- you're not paying attention.  It's --
L:  Exactly, yeah, yeah.
R:  Where -- where I'm, like, driving -- where I'm driving right now it's just -- it's wall to wall cars and um, you know, and then you look and every other person probably is on a cell phone talking to somebody.
L:  Yeah.  That's the way it is down here.  I mean, everywhere you look, no matter where you look, what car, truck, you know, se- your semi's even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, those -- those big things, you see talkers on -- on their cell phones, you know, just talking away.
R:  I actually see truckers reading a lot when they're driving.  I don't know --
L:  Yeah, we've seen that too.  Actually, we was almost run over, well, sideswiped by a trucker that was -- that wa- --
R:  Really.
L:  -- yeah, he was reading something, he was doing something, but he w- no, correction, it was a woman --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that was driving a rig and she was all over the road.
R:  Really.
L:  You know, yeah, it was scary.  It was really scary.  We were going to -- to Cedric to go to my wife's m- ah mother's house and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it was -- yeah, an eye opening experience, let me tell you.
R:  Wow.  So where in Kansas are you?
L:  I -- I -- I'm in Alatha --
R:  Is it near --
L:  Alatha is -- Alatha, it's next to Kansas City.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got you.
L:  Yeah, I'm like, twenty minutes away from Kansas City.
R:  I wasn't too -- I was near there not too long ago.  I drove back -- back across the country, right through there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  It's a beautiful ah, [several inaudible words] just fun thing to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's something that, ah, me and the -- the wife and the kids will have to do because, you know, we like take road trips like that.
R:  Oh yeah, well you're right in the middle.  You can go -- you can go pretty much any direction.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. We -- we've been to, you know, we've been to Florida, we've been to Mississippi --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you know, ah, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado.  We've been to Vegas, even.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, that's where we got married, but --
R:  Oh, you got married in Vegas.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well that's a neat place.  I -- I liked Vegas a lot.  It's actually a great place to bring kids these days --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- because I don't know if you've been there recently but it really has in the past um, I was just there this past Oct- this past October and they really have um, catered towards -- towards families.  There's a lot of outdoor things there --
