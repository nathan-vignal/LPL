R:  Hi, my name is Jessica.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name's Mary.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How're you doing?
R:  Good. [LAUGH]
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I was just going to ask you that.  New York.
L:  [MN] Oh, I'm in Massachusetts.
R:  Okay.  New York.
L:  D- -- oh, okay, not far.
R:  Are you -- are you near Boston or ...?
L:  Yeah, I'm just south of Boston.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My friend actually, um, goes to school there so I've been going there a lot lately [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Where does she go to school?
R:  Um, she goes to BU but she goes to the grad school.
L:  [MN] Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My son's friend goes to BU.  My son's in there practically every weekend.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm probably going --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there Memorial Day weekend [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I miss her.
L:  Oh, she doesn't -- she doesn't get to -- does she live around here?
R:  She lives in Long Island.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, I went to -- actually I went to, like, under grad with her, so [MN] we're trying to get, like, a bunch of us together just to see each other 'cause we haven't seen each other in a while.
L:  Where did you go to school?
R:  Binghamton.
L:  Where's that?
R:  It's upstate New York.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  It's a SUNY school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband would like to teach in Upstate New York.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Thinking maybe -- yeah, he's going to school for his Masters right now [MN] and, uh, he's thinking he'd like to be a college professor.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But, yeah, but who knows [NOISE].
R:  It's so different though upstate than, like, the city or, you know, Boston [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  My cousin lives in Boston now too, 'cause he went to Brandeis.
L:  [MN] Oh, really.  My husband's cousin works at Brandeis actually.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe they know each other [LAUGH].
L:  They might, yeah.  Oh, isn't that funny?
R:  I hear an accent though.
L:  You hear my --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- Boston accent?
R:  I -- I don't -- it doesn't sound like Boston.  It sounds like -- 'cause over the past few days I spoke to, like, people in the south and stuff --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and you can totally, yeah, I could totally hear the accent.
L:  Yeah, but I don't sound like I'm from Boston?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  You don't -- you don't say, um, certain words [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I don't know.  That's funny.
R:  You're from Boston originally?
L:  I'm from, uh -- well, let's see.  [NOISE] I was born -- this is a -- a program I signed up for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hon, okay?  My husband's like, "Who are you talking to?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Who are you telling your life long [inaudible]?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's like --
R:  Your life story to?
L:  -- "Who's she you talking to?"  Um, I was born out in Washington.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  And when I was like one and a half we moved back here 'cause my father's from here.  Um, [LIPSMACK] about twenty miles south of Boston.
R:  Okay.
L:  But most people say I have a Boston accent.  That's funny.
R:  Yeah, like, maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause it's over the phone so it's [NOISE] kind of, like, weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If that makes sense?  Like kind of hard -- hard to hear?
L:  That could be.  That could be.
R:  Because I spoke to someone yesterday from Pennsylvania and I'm just like, [MN] "You have an accent".
L:  Would you -- oh, real -- no, I went to summer camp for years when I was a kid down in Rhode Island and everybody in Rhode Island sounds like they're from New York.  It's like the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- same type of accent, you know, water and coffee and stuff.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  And tha- --
R:  That's me [LAUGH].
L:  That's what, yeah, that's definit- -- I could definitely pick up on that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm from Queens, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like my whole life, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like right near JFK, so ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You definitely, definitely hear it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what are we supposed to be discussing? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  The question was --
R:  The personal --
L:  -- which did we think was worse?
R:  [MN]
L:  And I forget.  Was it smoking or drinking?
R:  Um, smoking, drinking.
L:  Not exercising.
R:  Overeating.
L:  Overeating.
R:  And there was something else but I don't --
L:  And something else 'cause I think that something else was what I thought was worse, too.
R:  'Cause I don't think -- [MN] [SIGH]
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think anything's, like, horrific. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [MN] E- everything in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, let's see.  Probably overeating.
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  If you overeat too much and you get huge.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would say that's, I guess, the worst out of all of them.  But I think it's kind of weird how they're, like, in the same grouping of topics, they're doing something like drinking and then something like not exerci- --  Like, I don't know.  It just -- it's kind of like a broad range of habits --
L:  Bad habits.
R:  -- that they're talking about.
L:  Yeah, it is.  They're all totally different.  Yeah.  None of them are good.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're all okay in [NOISE] moderation. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think it said excessive drinking.
R:  True, I mean --
L:  So, uh --
R:  -- everything has its, you know, ramifications.
L:  Yep, yep, that's true.  [MN]  But being overweight I think is bad 'cause there's just so many health things related to that.
R:  True.
L:  Yeah, and it leads to so many different problems.
R:  I mean, if you're going to, like, kind of say something like that, I mean, I smoke but smoking you could say the same exact thing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you smoke?  Really?
R:  Yeah, well, more socially but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All my friends, uh, used to smoke in high school, so I would try it.  But I never took to it.  [MN] I'm so glad I never took to it. [LAUGH]  Even my ex husband -- I have, um, I've been married twice, and my first husband used to smoke.
R:  Really.
L:  And still I never picked it up.  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think if I was like, um, married to someone who didn't smoke I would smoke so much less.  Like, I -- like whenever I date someone who doesn't smoke, I won't smoke around them.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And now it's illegal anyway in bars to smoke, so ...
L:  Is it illegal everywhere?
R:  Um, not everywhere  but --
L:  -- in New York?
R:  In New York?  Um, not yet because I know, like, Long Island, like, the beginning of Long Island it is but, like, once you get to, like, Suffolk which is kind of going more out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- i- it's not --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- illegal yet but it's going to be.
L:  Yeah, that's what's happening even here in our town. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, they're considering the smoking ban in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- restaurants and bars.
R:  [MN] I think it's crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's so crazy.
L:  I know.  But it kind of cracks me up when you go into a place and they say, "Would you like smoking or non smoking?" and the non smoking is right next to the smoking so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think, like, restaurants and stuff that that's, like, totally different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or any place with food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] see, they're kind of like banning a habit right there [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda including -- yeah, I know that [NOISE] they --
L:  There is, there's a lot of public places where you can't smoke now.  A lot of buildings where you can't smoke and ...
R:  I remember when I went to Boston, like, no one was smoking in the bar and it, like, wasn't ill- --
L:  Oh.
R:  Like, I felt like a lot of people don't smoke there as opposed to New York.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, I've never noticed that.  In fact, um, we just had a party for a friend of mine.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  We had it in a bar, um, it was her fortieth birthday, ah, and the next day my throat was so dry.  It was killing me because everyone was smoking there.  And I, you know, I was breathing in all that smoke.
R:  That's so weird because --
L:  No, I definitely haven't noticed less smoking around here.
R:  When does it become illegal there?
L:  Um, I think, like, i- it's, uh, I think it's place by -- place by place, like, I'm not quite sure.  I haven't been in Boston for a long time.  [MN] I don't smoke so I don't pay attention so, I'm not sure if it's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- banned in Boston.  [LAUGH] But I know here in our town, um, they're considering it so that might go through.  [LIPSMACK] And there's several other towns around here where it's banned in restaurants and bars.
R:  Oh.
L:  Seems kind of silly in a bar, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, that's my con- -- that's exactly how I feel 'cause I think it kind of goes together.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, like, restaurants I understand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely understand.
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's families and things, yeah.  So, a little different.  [MN] So you having nice weather in New York?
R:  Um, today, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  In general, no. [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, real -- yeah.
R:  It's been a really bad --
L:  It was a bad winter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  This is a really tough winter.
R:  [MN] I know you guys it hasn't been good either.
L:  No, and like where we're at [COUGH] we're just south of Boston, we're almost near the Cape and we -- we were like right in this pocket that just got hit.  Every snow storm that we had, we got hit the worst, [LAUGH] [MN] so ...
R:  That's so crazy.
L:  Uh, yeah, and if it wasn't snowing it was really cold so you didn't want to go out.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So today's really nice though.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's in the sixties here.
R:  All winter here I was wearing, like, two jackets. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah, I know.  If you had an errand to run I would -- I would just put it off 'cause I didn't want to go out.
R:  That also causes me to think that the summer is going to be really hot.
L:  I know.  Last summer was hot though.  Did you have a hot summer?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We had that, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And everybody kept saying we were going to have a bad winter because of that.
R:  [MN] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so I wonder ...
R:  It was funny.  I don't know if you did this yesterday but the topic yesterday was do the changes in weather cause sickness?
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And I was just like oh, yeah.
L:  It does, it does.  I know it -- my father caught pneumonia from [LIPSMACK] -- he delivered, um, bread products to grocery stores.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  So he would be out in the hot --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- summer air and then go into the cold in the grocery store --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and he got pneumonia that way, so I can see why --
R:  [MN] Yeah, I mean I totally --
L:  -- everyone's getting sick, yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Li- like in the -- like, 'cause I'm at work now, like, in the office.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everyone -- [NOISE] it kind of goes in, like, circles with people being sick.
L:  Oh, that's hard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause you can't get away from it [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Like, every -- like, all the groups are kind of sectioned off so like -- once like one person gets sick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, um --
L:  Then passes it around.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.  So, I agreed with that topic. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  [MN] This topic was like too long. [LAUGH]
L:  It was too what?
R:  Long. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, they're like -- they name, like, so many different, like, things, then [MN] I didn't think it would that intense.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  N- not intense but, like, that many things.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] Um --
R:  Anything
