L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Bonny.
R:  Hi, this is Barbara.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Barbara, fine.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my first time I've ever been called, so ... Is this your first time also?
R:  No, actually it's my third time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And even though it is, I mean, you're gonna see even at the next phone call, you're not really gonna know. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But I guess y-, you know, like we just have really been winging it and they want us to talk about, you know, what we think are the worst habits, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess that's what, you know, [LAUGH] we should do.
L:  Well, as far as I'm -- 'cause I just got my email today that said, "You will be called", but I didn't know they were gonna do it one minute after four. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, you can call in, uh, 'cause this is my third call and I -- like, you know, it's too much just to sit and wait --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you can call in and you put your pin number in and get the call and you don't have to wait for the calls.  Like you do it when it's convenient for you.
L:  Oh, is that what they meant about you can do three calls?  What, a day, or ...?
R:  I -- I guess you could do them all in one day.  U- Um, I don't know if three is the limit.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, but they did say three but then I hear some people -- like, if you look in those forums some people are getting six calls a day.
L:  Yeah, I have to go back in there today and check it out some more.  Well, as far as the topic today I'm pretty much -- I have all those bad habits.
R:  I do too.
L:  I'm a smoker.  I don't -- I don't exercise.  I overeat and I drink a lot of coffee in the morning.  
R:  Yeah, me too and --
L:  I don't gossip though.  I --
R:  That's right.  That's what I was gonna say.  That's the only thing that I really and truly don't do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is gossip, but I do smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do -- you know, um, very bad at exercising --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  I was great when I was younger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I just kinda got out of it.  You get too -- you get so busy and you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just too tired.  I don't wanna do it.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- hit forty and I'm like argh. [LAUGH] But I guess -- I guess I should exercise, but as -- as far as gossiping and -- I'm the type of person if you stay out of bus- my business, I stay out of yours.  If it doesn't --
R:  That's how I am.
L:  -- concern me or my family or -- you know, then I really [LAUGH] don't wanna hear about it.
R:  That's how I am and I guess probably I would probably think that smoking is probably the worst out of all the habits because we know, as we're smoking, you know, what it's doing to us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't really deny it any longer.  When I was a kid and I started smoking, at that time you could go to your doctor's office and smoke in the doctor's office.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Grocery stores --
R:  And no- --
L:  -- everywhere.
R:  -- nobody ever told you, "Don't smoke because it's good -- it's bad for your health".  They told you, "Don't smoke because it was an adult --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- thing to do".
L:  Yep, exactly.  Exactly and --
R:  So --
L:  -- and I guess we're supposed to speak of personal experience.  Um, I -- I had a heart- -- two heart attacks about two years ago.
R:  You did --
L:  And I still --
R:  -- at such a young age?
L:  Yeah.  And I still continue to smoke and every day I say to myself when I'm coughing, "Oh, I gotta stop.  I gotta stop".  But I have no will power.  If I did I'd be a hundred and five pounds too, you know.
R:  Wow, well you know, [COUGH] when -- what was it, right after the holidays I decided, "That's it.  I'm gonna quit smoking".  Number one I can't afford to smoke any more --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I'm still doing it.  And number two, I mean, I hear myself coughing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the time.  
L:  And people look at you in public and stuff when you're coughing and they look at you like, "Oh, god". [LAUGH]
R:  And everybody keeps saying to me, "You've gotta stop smoking" and I keep saying, "It's my sinuses.  It's my sinuses". [LAUGH]
L:  You know what?  Oh, my god I got the same excuse.  I -- I -- I cough and go, [MN] "Oh, my nose is clogged". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  But I --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- stopped for a week.  For a whole --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- week I didn't touch a cigarette and I don't know what, I don't know why, I just went out bought another pack.  After a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I went out bought another pack --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just said, "To hell with it all" and I was -- I mean, I went through the seven days.  They say ten, you know, ten days.  The first ten is the worst.
L:  Were you a real bitch?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I was really -- I was very bitchy and so I needed to be alone a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I would blow up.  I'd be in the middle of a happy conversation, laughing, and all of a sudden I'd get mad and I didn't know why I was mad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but whoever I was talking to I'd get real snippy with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I guess it's the -- your -- your craving, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I just went back and I said, "Nuts[?], that's it I'm smoking".  Been --
L:  And --
R:  -- smoking for what?  Thirty five, forty years already.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  I've been smoking since I'm sixteen.
R:  -- no not -- not.  Yeah, I've been smoking since I was about fifteen or sixteen and I'm fifty two years old.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.  It's a long time.
L:  I always say to myself, "This is gonna be the last pack" and then I -- then I'm down to like five cigarettes, "Oh, I gotta run.  I gotta get another pack".
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  It's like dessert too.
R:  That didn't scare you enough when you had the heart attack either?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  It didn't scare you enough when you had your heart attack, to stop?  
L:  Um, I gue- -- no.  I -- I was in intensive care for seven day- -- well, about a week, whatever, and I didn't smoke that whole time and you know I came out and started smoking again.
R:  Isn't that something.
L:  It was the idea that, "Oh, god I -- I survived a heart attack", you know and [LAUGH] I'm just gonna keep on living.  
R:  Yeah, the --
L:  The doctor even said to me he doesn't realize why -- why I'm even still here.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I'm like, "I don't know either.  I guess I'm just either strong willed or -- or there's somebody up there watching over me but, uh, but I have no clue.
R:  Do you smoke a lot?
L:  Um, you know what?  I say, no, but, uh, uh, being a smoker I say no because I -- if I'm sitting around I'll light one up and then get up to do something and come back to it and it's burned out.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I don't know, truthfully how much I smoke a day.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't say a pack, or two packs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I may start up my second pack in the middle of the evening, but I really haven't sat down and smoked the whole pack.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I know -- I know exactly what you mean and that's where y- you know, you can't -- you can't keep track.
L:  No.
R:  And you're not really enjoying that cigarette either.
L:  Oh, there are times that I don't.  I look at it and -- and -- and it's like, "Why am I doing this?  And I -- I but it out halfway through and it's like, "Ugh", but then I just go +right back to it again.
R:  Yeah.  I was starting to get where it was actually skeeving[?] me.  I could smell it on myself all the time; I could smell it when I walked in my house; I could smell it in my clothes closet.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And it was driving me nuts and I think that's what gave me the incentive to stop, but now that I have started again I don't smell it any more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it doesn't skeeve me any more. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I know it's like the weather.  I don't know where you're -- where you're from, but I'm calling from Pennsylvania and -- and the -- this week we've been in the seventies and the eighties so we can open up the windows.
R:  Ah, get a break.
L:  That's okay, but in the -- in the winter time --
R:  When you're all closed up.
L:  When you're all closed up and you walk in and it's like dampness and smoke and two dogs, two cats, it's like, "Oh, god" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would just like to have a fresh smelling house.
R:  Yeah, well we live in Florida and most times of the year our house is closed up too because it's too hot actually to keep it open.  You gotta keep the air conditioning on.
L:  Yeah, my parents just retired to Daytona -- South Daytona.
R:  Oh, yeah?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do they like it?
L:  Um, they -- well, this February I guess they're there a year this February, but, um, they weren't -- they're -- my mum's not quite used to the heat.
R:  Well, she will get used to the heat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I knew I would because I hated the cold, so I didn't have a problem with it but my husband was one -- we lived in New York and my husband was one that walked around in just his shirt sleeves, a tee shirt in the winter time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he was never hot and it could be ten below zero and we could be taking a four hour car ride and the windows had to be open.
L:  Oh, god.
R:  Yeah, he -- he loved the cold -- the cold air he thrived on it and, um, now that he's here -- it took him like really just about a year to re acclimate and now that he's here he's worse than I am.
L:  Mm.
R:  "Oh, it's too cold in here.  It's too cold in here.  What've you got the air conditioner --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on for?  It's freezing.  You don't need the air conditioner on it's beautiful outside".    But it's ninety degrees --"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and the humidity is ninety percent, you know.
L:  Well, my brother's been down there fifteen years and he's -- he's kinda like that.  As soon as the temperature hits like seventy, he's got a flannel shirt on and a -- you know.
R:  Well, seventy to us is cold because we're not used to it now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so I guess a- -- I guess it's how you accl- acclimate, but as -- you know, I lived in New York all my life but as I got older, as the years went by -- even when I was a kid I didn't like the cold.
L:  Me either.
R:  But as the years went by and I got older and older -- from my twenties to my thirties, from my thirties to forty, uh, I couldn't -- the cold -- I -- it drove me insane.  I- i- it got worse and worse and worse as I got older.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I can't take it but being here in Florida, you're in the house with the air conditioner all the time so I'm still always cold, so you can't win --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But at least I can go outside and warm up. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, at least -- at least you can open up your windows at pretty much any time of the year and air out.
R:  You really can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You really can.  You really can.  That's the one thing, you know, like even in -- in this -- in summer time when it's really hot and humid I always open up the windows for an hour or so.
L:  Yeah, I like the fresh air.
R:  Yeah, even if -- even if I leave the air conditioner on, you know, I just -- I have to have -- yeah, I have to have some air.
L:  Some circulation.
R:  Yeah, and it makes the house smell nice.
L:  Yeah, then I'd like nothing better like even with being smokers.  I can't tell now, you know, you can smell smoke but in the winter time you can and I like to
