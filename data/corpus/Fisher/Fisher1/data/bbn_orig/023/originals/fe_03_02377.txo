R:  Hello, this is Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle, this is Bill.  How are you doing today?
R:  Okay.  I'm doing fine, how about you?
L:  Good.  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  It's -- this is my first call as well.
R:  Okay, well this ought to be interesting then.
L:  [LAUGH] yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What -- so, what do you think is worse out of those topics th- that the robot mentioned?
R:  Oh, that's like, a really difficult thing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, because common sense tells you that, um, none of them are really good for you.  Um, oh, um, you know, I guess the standard answer would be non exercising, 'cause I don't think people move around as much as they should.
L:  That's what I was thinking, too, even though I smoke and I know it's not good --
R:  Oh, so do I.  So that -- I kind of, like, stay away from that, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, th- th- that is one thing that I know a lot of people are going to say, yeah, it's the smoking.  Um, because so many people are against it.
L:  Well, no, it- it's -- I'm -- I'm fifty seven, so it's starting to show now.
R:  Oh, you're fifty seven?
L:  Yeah, so this stuff is starting to show now, you know.  How old are you?
R:  I'm forty four.
L:  Yeah, well, a few more years you start -- y- yeah, you start to spitting up the junk in the morning --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you start coughing after the cigarette, you start huffing and puffing, you start wheezing, yeah, in the last couple of years it's gotten worse for me.  I used to ride my bike a lot more than I do now, so, th- the smoking, um, I can really tell by not riding my bike, I'm not in as good a shape, and I- uh, it takes a little more energy to do less walking and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So as you get older it starts to show.
R:  Well, thank you.  Well, I already know that because I live on the second floor and sometimes bringing groceries up the steps, it's like, all right, this is it, I'm quitting.  Um, you know.  What about caffeine?  Let's -- let's leave us smokers alone.  What about caffeine?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I drink coffee too.  I drink coffee an- and ea- and smoke cigarettes.
L:  Oh, you're just a horrible person all the way round, aren't you? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  But -- but I walk -- I walk a lot. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I pr- yeah, I walk a lot and I -- I mean, I don't drink coffee but I drink tea, like, non stop, you know, so --
R:  Well they say that's supposed to be good for you.
L:  Th- th- well, I don't know.  Um, I worked with a gentleman who, um, was like, a high, um, u- he -- he was a high stressed person.  He ended up having a heart attack and he was, like, um, we went to a couple of meetings and h- I would, like, order tea, and he's like, "That's just as bad for you as coffee.  There's more caffeine in tea than there is in coffee", and it's like, "Oh, give me a break".  You know.
L:  Well, I heard -- I heard it's supposed to be better for you --
R:  Well --
L:  -- that's what they suggest, it's good for -- it helps -- what is it?  Green tea is the one that's healthy --
R:  Green tea, yeah.
L:  -- helps you with not getting cancer, stomach cancer or something?
R:  Right, and it's also supposed to be, um, helpful if you're trying to lose weight, yeah, green tea's supposed to be, I guess, like, the new miracle type thing.
L:  Yeah, that's what I heard.  I -- I don't know.  I had some, um, tree tea the other day.  I went to this Arbor Day celebration and they had, ah, pine -- I forget what kind of t- it was the -- the tip of the ah, tip of the leaves, ah, tea.  It was really good.  It was very light and -- and offered a -- a gentle taste, but it was sort of the ul- ultimate natural kind of thing where you get it for free, you just take the tips of these buds off the trees and you make your own tea.
R:  Mm.
L:  But yeah, I -- I don't know why I don't -- I have tea here and I bought it, but I haven't had it, you know, I always have to have my coffee though, and I -- I know I'm addicted to bad health.  Give me -- give me ten hours without coffee and I'm starting to get headaches, you know.
R:  Yeah, well, if I don't drink tea, um, I get headaches.  You know.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, if -- an- and I always used to think it was, you know, well, just a headache, but then I started noticing, um, if I'm some place where I don't have access to -- c- I -- if -- I don't drink hot tea, I drink iced tea.  And if I don't have access to it I do get headaches, and drinking anything that's caffeinated does not help.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know.  So I don't know, I guess -- guess all of those choices, I think everything is not, you know -- how do you pick one that's -- that's the worst?
L:  I don't know, but, like, the exercise one, that's the one I -- I think, from w- my own personal notice is -- is the worst.  That -- that's had the strongest influence on me in terms of being able to do stuff.  Because I -- I walk a lot.  I work with the census bureau and I walk around a lot, knock on doors and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I live in San Francisco, so we got a lot of hills here and, boy, I -- I won't even take some of these hills.  I just won't -- won't do it anymore and I know that's psychological, but I also -- I -- I did a couple of months ago, I did a -- I climbed up the side of this hill on a bunch of stairs and I was dying by the time I got up there.  So, I think it's lack of exercise, and -- and some of these are combining factors, and then there's smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is the one, but all the doctors -- and then I've been talking to other patients, ah, I talked to one guy, he's in his early fifties and he had this artery in his neck that they cleaned out and -- it's unbelievable stuff I've been hearing!
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they -- they cleaned out this article, it was filled with something, and that was one thing, and then I met this other guy the other day, he's got these arteries in his legs and they've been cleaning these out for a couple of years now, and they even, um, they go in and just slice these things up and clean it all out, and it collects back up and he's quit smoking because his doctor told him that it's worthless to keep doing this and um, and -- and for him continue smoking.  So, I don't know, I -- I -- I think the exercise one for my own personal stand point --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- but boy, you know, it -- you're right, it's like, whoa, wait a minute, each one is bad.  What were they?  Smoking, caffeine, exercise and -- there were a couple more that I didn't hear.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was trying to remember myself because those were the three that, like, stuck out, um, for me.
L:  Yeah.  We hear -- we hear wh what you's are doing or something, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we al- we both know that what we're doing is not the best of things, right?
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  Do you exercise at all?
R:  Um, not on a regular basis, no, but, um, I work in -- in a hotel, um, so I'm constantly running, um, all night long.
L:  Oh really?
R:  You know, like, t- back and forth to rooms and stuff.  So, that's probably about the most exercise and I guess, that I live on -- on a second floor in a second floor apartment so, you know, several trips up and down the steps some days.  But I don't know, I just never was one -- I like to walk.  Ah, I work third shift though.  Um, so I find myself, like, you know, sleeping during the day time when I should be out exercising, or doing something.  You know, so --
L:  I try and walk t- I try and walk to the store and like I say, my job takes me around where I walk a bit.
R:  That's -- that's good, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't -- you know, and I don't think when people say exercise I don't necessarily think it has to be some kind of regiment.  I mean, even like, you know, with your job, you said you walk, so that -- that's exercise.
L:  Yeah, but you know, I tell you, I can really tell the difference by not riding my bike.  I -- I could ride my bike for a couple of hours and boy, I tell you, I feel really good.  I -- I s- I -- I just dr- ride my bike and spit up all this gunk and garbage and stuff and after about two hours, man, you talk about feeling good.  Man, I, you know, and those cigarettes they -- they just are so delicious after a couple of hours of riding a bike.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You would not believe, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I would believe it, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would, honestly.  I would, because, I think when my daughter was younger and you know, was doing a lot more with her, um, you know, yeah, I didn't smoke as much.  Now she's twenty and, you know, I ca- she doesn't want to go to the park with me to play on the swings any more.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know why, but you know.  So, you know, yeah, I mean I used to get a lot more exercise then than I do now and I realize this, and I'm trying not to be a cough potato, but sometimes it's difficult --
R:  Yeah. Yeah, it's the motiv- and then you keep smoking more cigarettes, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you go light o- I'll light one right after another.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you probably have to have a cup of tea in between your forth or fifth one, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I have to have a cup of coffee between my forth and fifth one --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because the taste is weird and, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I guess we- what we're really saying is -- is the smoking is the one, then, isn't it?
R:  I think -- yeah, I think that's -- okay, let's put that at the top of the list.  That's like, got to be worst.  And then followed up by exercer- you know, not exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the caffeine, like, there's so much caffeine in everything any more, because if you have, you know --
L:  Well, I don't drink sodas.  Do you drink sodas?
R:  Very, very rarely.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and if I do it's usually some- you know, um something that doesn't have caffeine in it, like --
