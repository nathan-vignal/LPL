L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Sharon.
R:  My name is Corrine.
L:  And I'm calling from -- I'm in Oregon.  Where are you at?
R:  In Los Angeles.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Long, long ways away.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not a long way but a long ways.
R:  Mm.
L:  Very good, so, uh, what is your thought on illness?  I agree that [MN] if you go to the doctor it lasts seven days, if you don't it lasts a week [LAUGH].
R:  Er, you know, I haven't ever really paid that much attention to it but I guess I would -- I would have to agree since, well, as I've gotten older sometimes it looks like the colds are more, you know, tenacious.  It's harder to get rid of 'em.
L:  Yes, that's for s- --
R:  Yeah, they last, mhm.
L:  That's for sure.  Well, I get a c- flu shot every year, so -- 'cause I have several different illnesses and so I get a flu shot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- every year and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sure does make a big difference.  I used to always say [SIGH] I would never get a flu shot 'cause they were silly but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after I got one the first year and didn't get sick that year and it sure did make a big difference with me 'cause I -- I don't like to get sick.  I get -- I have a raspy throat as it is and when I get sick it always goes right to my throat and then I lose my voice and it's just not a fun experience, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- definitely like my flu shots, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you have any other illnesses that you take care of?
R:  Well, yeah.  I have -- I do have some things that I got -- need to be dealing with that I haven't really, uh, you know, uh, worked on like I should, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  When you get a little bit older sometimes yo- they seem to pop up when you don't expect them for sure.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Well, one thing I was thinking about -- about a cold was I remember when I was, um, right now I'm sixty years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I remember when I was around twenty maybe one or something like that, there was a lady at work that had a cold and she was just coughing and everything and then I noticed that her nose was peeling --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- and -- and, you know, I -- I really didn't think a lot about it at the time.  I -- I mean, but I noticed it.  I think that was the first time I'd seen somebody's nose like peeling.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then after I got older then my nose started doing that like, you know, you blow it so much --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'll say.
R:  -- and then the +skin dries out --
L:  Dries out.
R:  -- and starts, yeah, flaking off.
L:  Right.
R:  And then it gets kind of tender, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I hate having a cold.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  But I've never had a flu shot though.
L:  Well, yeah.  Like I say I -- I did- didn't have until up ab- about three years ago and I started having some heart problems, and so when you do that well then they start giving you ever -- everything they can possibly imagine, and a flu shot is one of the things they usually give you and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I got a flu shot.  And like I say it really did make a big difference and [MN] -- and it really -- like I say I live up here in Oregon and it's -- we have so many allergy type things up here, so many different kinds of -- of plants and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that is in the air that causes people to have allergies, so if you have any kind of allergies at all and you're here, you're definitely going to get a cold or a runny nose.  And I find that that even -- even helps with that is -- I haven't had near the allergy type problems that I've had in the past before I got my flu shot so ...
R:  I'm -- I've never been to Oregon.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm from Chicago.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  That's where I'm from but I -- but -- but I moved to L- LA from San Francisco.
L:  Ah.
R:  Mm.  I lived there for years and years.
L:  And how long have you been in LA?
R:  'Bout four years and I'm ready to get out of here, too.
L:  [LAUGH] Are you really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have family down there?
R:  Oh, well, yeah, um, I do have family.  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  Did you have family in San Francisco?
R:  Nah, um, actually no, no.  Mhm.
L:  No?
R:  No, but I know -- the people that I know there, they -- they're just like my family, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been knowing 'em so long, you know.
L:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I --
R:  Matter of fact I used to tell 'em, some of 'em [LAUGH] I -- I'm closer to 'em [LAUGH] than I am to my -- my own family.
L:  To your own family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, sometimes it works out that way.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, I've been up here in Oregon for, oh God, it's been, [SIGH] oh, what?  Probably [MN] well, close to about twenty five years this time.  And I -- my kids are here.  I have three grown kids and -- with families and, well, two of them have families an- and I just -- I would love to leave Oregon because it rains so much up here and --
R:  Oh, well, I heard -- I heard that about Seattle.
L:  Yeah, Seattle it does rain --
R:  What --
L:  -- a lot in Seattle, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I do feel really -- I -- the -- the weather does make me feel really icky and miserable but I just -- I wouldn't leave because my kids are here and my kids wouldn't go anywhere else, so consequently --
R:  Well, if you were to leave where would you want to go then?
L:  I don't know.  You know, they asked me the same thing and I lived in -- down in Los Ange- -- my husband was in the Marine Corps and so we were in the Santa Anna area for a lot of years and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I really liked it down there but I don't know whether I would move back down there at this point or not.  It's -- it's not what it was twenty years ago, needless to say, so I don't know whether that's where I'd go.
R:  You -- you mean --
L:  I don't know where I'd go.
R:  Well, if I -- if I could go somewhere else I would -- I would go down South, uh --
L:  Yeah, I've been down there too.
R:  -- to -- to --
L:  We -- we spent, um, a year and a half in North Carolina.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I loved it there.  I begged my husband to stay there when he retired out of the Marine Corps and he didn't want to.  He wanted to come back to Oregon 'cause this is his -- was his home and, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he passed away six years ago so I don't have him anymore but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like I say, my kids are here and I just -- I just wouldn't leave my kids.  But North Carolina, I loved it in North Carolina.  It is really pretty down there and the weather is -- is your seasons.  I mean, you have your summer, winter, spring, fall and -- and it -- you know what's going to happen when it's going to happen and we're -- like here we -- we still -- it's probably like forty degrees out tonight up here, and for this time of the year that's really cool.
R:  Yeah, that's cold anyway, all right.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Now -- now down here, uh, let's see now.  I imagine it's about, let's see here.  I don't know, uh, maybe about sixty, sixty five or something like that --
L:  Oh, God. [MN]
R:  -- maybe.  And I don't think it's seventy but maybe about sixty five or something.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it -- and we had -- we -- yesterday was -- sun was shining but today it -- the sun started out shining this morning but then by this afternoon came it -- it started raining again, so ...  And I, like I say, I just hate the rain 'cause it does make me feel -- I have arthritis along with all my other aches and pains and --
R:  Well, there -- you don't nee- -- it's too bad --
L:  -- it does.
R:  -- you got to be in that weather.  If you was down here you -- you -- you would probably feel a lot better.  I have, uh --
L:  Yeah, I would.  Oh, I know.
R:  I have arthritis --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I don't feel -- I don't hear from it a lot down here in LA.
L:  Right, right, yeah.  I know I would because we have -- I still have several friends down there and we were down there just a couple of years ago.  And I did, I felt so much better down there.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that's what I keep telling everybody, "If you guys would just move to where it didn't rain so much I'd feel so much better".  But my [MN] son in law b- has a good job and they just wouldn't -- I know that they -- I mean, they just wouldn't move.  And like I say, I wouldn't leave my grandkids, 'specially I have one that lives -- we have t- a two -- a piece of property and we have two houses on the property and my daughter and her baby live in the front and I live in the back.  And -- and I just wouldn't leave that baby, at least not now 'cause she's five and she's right where she --
R:  Are -- are -- are you -- you not one of the ladies that don't tell your age, are you [LAUGH]?
L:  Eh, ah, no, I'm sixty one.
R:  Oh, are you?  Oh, you're just --
L:  I'm not -- yeah.
R:  You -- you the same [MN] almost the same age as me.
L:  Yeah, I'm sixty one.
R:  I'll be sixty one this year.  Will -- will you be sixty two this year or ...?
L:  I'll be sixty two, uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'll be sixty one this year.
L:  Yeah, I'll be sixty two in September.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll be -- I'll be sixty, uh, o- one in October.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, do you still work?
R:  Me?  No, no, I don't.  Uh-uh.
L:  No?
R:  Not right at the moment.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  I'm getting ready -- I'm getting ready to move and, uh, maybe to Palm -- I'm supposed to move to Palmdale this weekend --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and, uh, --
L:  That's really hot.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's what I'm thinking and I'm wondering --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't know if I want to do that or not but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've got a nice little place up there.  But you -- you been up there before?
L:  I have.  Well, we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --were down there for -- like I say, we lived down there for a lot of tim -- a long time and --
R:  Mm.
L:  But it's been many, many, many, many years ago and so it's been probably, oh, probably twenty six, twenty seven years ago since I lived in LA and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But Palmdale even at that time was hot 'cause of your --
R:  [MN] Well, [inaudible].
L:  Heading out to that desert, you know, and that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- that's hot.  Bt if you like the heat.
R:  No, I don't really, you know, not -- I -- I'm not really crazy about no heat.  And my God, I don't know, uh, [MN] maybe [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, it's a little one bedroom's kind of, uh, weak, then -- then another thing I don't like -- I don't really like living by myself [NOISE].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I would be living by myself so I don't even know if I should do it or not.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you're not living by yourself now?
R:  No.  I live in -- [COUGH] I live in a big old house, um, down here with somebody.
L:  Oh.
R:  I live in a grun- a grandy old -- what they call a rambling like house [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mm.  So, we gets ten rooms in it.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Mm.
L:  That is a big rambling house.  Do you live right in LA?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  I live on West Boulevard.
L:  Oh, I know where that is.
R:  Yeah, on Fifty --
L:  About where that is.
R:  Fifty Fourth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right off -- not far from Crenshaw.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I know exactly where that's at.
R:  And I, you know, I -- like I said, I probably would like LA, uh, s- uh, wher- a lot but I -- I don't like what goes on down here.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm just fed up with even hearing about it and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  A- a- -- you know --
L:  I can --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- understand that for sure.
R:  We -- we talking about a lot of illnesses, aren't we [LAUGH]?  I said we talking about a lot of illnesses, aren't we [LAUGH]?
L:  Right, we are.
R:  I don't know what i- you know, I didn't-- when I heard him say illness I said, "My God, who wants to talk about illness?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's --
L:  Well they -- the -- the topic was supposed to be do you think that the weather -- people have more illnesses when the weather's bad, according to the weather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And yes, I do.
R:  Yeah, they do, they do.
L:  They do.
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  'Cause, ah, you used to be -- see, I grew up in Chicago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you could always count on all those colds when the -- when -- when the winter came.
L:  Right.
R:  Sniffling and runny noses and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hot chocolate and aspirins --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  And like I say, up here the -- because the weather is so variable, I mean, one day it's hot, one day it's cold.
R:  Mm.
L:  It makes the kids have more illnesses because they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they just get their winter clothes ready to go and then it's time -- then it's warm and they wear their ho- hot clothes to school and then by the time they get out of school they've got all hot and sweaty and it's just it's -- it
