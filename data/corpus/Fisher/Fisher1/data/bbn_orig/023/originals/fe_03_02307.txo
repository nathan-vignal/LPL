R:  Hi, I'm Tiffany.  
L:  Hi.  I'm Daniella.
R:  Hi, Daniella.  
L:  Okay.  I've never done one of these.  Have you?
R:  Never have I, so let's just start.
L:  [LAUGH].  Okay.
R:  I have allergies really bad in the spring, so I have to go in to the doctor usually several times to get drugs, new -- new prescriptions.  This season I had to change.  What about you?  Do you get allergies a lot?
L:  I do.  I actually um take shots, self administer on a -- every other week.
R:  Does that make you sicker once you take the shots, or does it get better during the spring?
L:  Um, I believe it gets better.  I've been taking it for, like, seven years so I don't even remember how it is for the health --
R:  Really?  
L:  I just --
R:  Yeah, I have -- I get -- I take Allegra D, or Allegra now.
L:  [MN].  Mhm?
R:  And that helps during the spring.  See there in the fall and all, I don't really get sick.  It's usually just during the spring I get colds and sore throats and everything else from the allergies.  But during the --
L:  [MN].
R:  What about winter?  Do you get sick during the winter?
L:  Ah, I do.  But I don't think that's allergies.  I think that's just -- you know, it's --
R:  Yeah, just a cold and stuff?
L:  -- freezing outside and -- yeah, didn't bring a hat.
R:  Yeah.  But you do -- do you, like it asks, do you wait the seven days and then go to the doctor, or you just wait until you break a fever or --
L:  In -- I currently don't have insurance, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- unless -- unless the arm is falling off the body or, you know, it's --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, unfortunately.  But --
R:  But see, that's me too.  I just don't want -- even want to go in unless it's absolutely necessary.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Right.
R:  So I just don't even want to do it because it's so much hassle to get in and see the doctor and so usually I just wait till I'm deathly ill and have been running a fever for four days before I go in.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Nobody even -- I -- people usually come out sicker, just sitting in the waiting room --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- for an hour with people --
R:  Exactly.  Well, the -- but see, I try to stay to stay home if I'm running a fever because I don't want to take it to work.  You know?  
L:  Right.
R:  Because -- then there's the people that come to work, bring it to work, and then they spread it around and then everyone gets sick, so then that makes the whole office, you know, sick and that's not fun because then you start running --
L:  It --
R:  -- even a higher fever and, you know?  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So --
L:  It -- that -- that kills morale, however, it's a shame to waste, uh, you know --
R:  Vacation time?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH].  I know.  It's like a -- win -- it's a lose, lose situation, either you know, stay home and lose the pay or you go to the doctor and get sicker, so I don't know.  But, yeah, normally the spring is when I usually get the sickest, which I think is all related back to allergies 'cause during the winter I'm not bad and the fall I'm not bad, and summer, well -- you know how that is?  You're just to busy during the summer to go do anything.  I mean, to get to even go anywhere to get sick.  
L:  Right.
R:  Uh.  What about -- do you have kids that get sick?
L:  No, I -- I -- I'm not mar- I don't have kids.  Um --
R:  No.
L:  -- I'm a kid myself, I like to think, so uh --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  But my dogs -- my dogs sneeze a lot though.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh, so I don't -- yeah.  I -- I understand dogs can get allergies as well.
R:  I would believe that.
L:  So I've been told.  
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I wonder -- see, my dog -- let's see, they've gotten -- but here we're talking about dogs.  It didn't say we had to talk about pe- just people, did it?  [LAUGH].  'Cause, let's see, my dog when we adopted him, one of um -- one of our dogs we adopted him, we uh, had been on that certain food and it -- he got sick 'cause we started feeding him something else 'cause our -- the food didn't get delivered and we had to take him to the doctor and he had stomach stuff, so it was not fun.  That's another thing.  Stomach stuff.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's a -- stomach bugs.  Now, that's the worst, you know, 'cause it -- I mean -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you can't -- even if you go to work, you can't really do anything.  You either have a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trash can up to you or you're in the bathroom.  How gross is that?  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know?  So you might as well stay home and not give it to everyone else.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, I -- you can pretty much find an excuse to stay home every day, if you --
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's always something.
R:  My throat hurts bad [COUGH] yeah, that's it.  [LAUGH].  So what else did it say we needed to talk about?  We're on the illness, so we talked about -- mm, going to the doctor, which neither of us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like to do unless we're deathly ill, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just being sick, period.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I wonder if we can move on to other topic -- or it has to be illness.  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Let's see, last time I was sick, uh, well actually last week I had laryngitis.  I had -- my sore throat --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was so bad I had laryngitis, and couldn't talk at work.  Oh, it was great.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sorry, I can't answer the phone, I can't talk to customers.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:   
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You'll need to do it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- that -- that could work to your advantage.
R:  Yeah.  I would think.
L:  Yeah.  No, I -- coincidentally, I was sick as well last week.  I was um dehydrated.
R:  Oh.
L:  And in bed for, like, three and a half, four days.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So you just hadn't been drinking water and you'd been doing exercising or -- 
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  You've been exercising and not drinking your water or --
L:  I -- I am training for a marathon and I just did -- you know, a ten mile sprint and yeah, and -- and drank alcohol that eve- --
R:  You were training for a marathon?
L:  Yeah, and then I had alcohol and I think the combination of --
R:  No fluid.
L:  -- no fluids together -- exactly.
R:  Plus -- oh my word.
L:  Yeah.  So I -- yes.  On -- on the upside, though, I -- I now take it very seriously, to hydrate.
R:  Wow.  
L:  So --
R:  I'm impressed just with that.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].  What you just training for a marathon.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah, just the training for the marathon.  That kinda threw me off for a second.  I was, like, what?  Wow.  That's cool.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Well, I -- I -- my understanding is that -- I mean, it's for some training, but um, usually the body -- the immune system just gets lowered 'cause there's such wear and tear on the body.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially as the miles are increasing.  Like, I think up to fifteen mile mark, it just -- yeah --
R:  So is --
L:  -- it's very easy to get sick and --
R:  So is your trainer forcing vitamin C and stuff on you or what?
L:  No -- not yet 'cause I'm only at, like, the ten miles.  It's just not -- in -- in the jogging world, that's nothing to even brag about.  But uh, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, but it's -- it's -- they -- really they're advocating -- they will start advocating, like, the vitamin C and you know, stay off alcohol and just sleep and -- and stuff like that.
R:  Wow.  Huh.
L:  'Cause it's --
R:  Yeah.  I can -- my husband, he used to be in the military and he would come in after their reg[?] marches and stuff -- he was a combat medic, so he would have the [LAUGH] bags of IVs and stuff.  They'd just hook them up while they were running.  You know, go off to the side for a few minutes, hook them up to an IV, let them re hydrate and then keep running.   So he -- he would come home several times when he hadn't had one and he was ill, ill, ill from not being just hydrated.  So, like wow, that's neat.  I mean, neat that you're training for a marathon.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm just kinda shocked -- not neat that you were sick, no, that's bad.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Shame on you, Daniella.  You should not -- take care of yourself.  There, is that enough mothering there for you?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Thank you, I think 'cause I don't -- I don't get it from my mother and grandmother, so yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And all my friends.
R:  Yeah, don't tell them that, that you were that sick from not drinking water, you'd -- or not drinking anything.  You -- yeah, they would not be happy.  [LAUGH].  Mom, yeah, by the way, I've been in bed for three days.  I didn't drink enough water, so you know, hey.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  
R:  Wow, that's impressive.  So -- well, once the immune system goes down, suppose -- I mean, you -- you start just getting colds and stuff, or -- or what?
L:  Um --
R:  Did he say?
L:  It -- I didn't --
R:  Or the trainer say?
L:  You know, I -- I didn't -- I didn't really ask so much about it.  I have friends that have trained and they -- they said that, um, it's pretty much colds a lot and just -- it -- like, they're susceptible to everything.
R:  To sinus infection, cold, whatever?
L:  Pretty -- yeah.  Pretty much.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  Pretty much, yeah.
R:  I never -- see, that never would of crossed my mind, that because you're working, your metabolism's working so hard and so much overtime that that would drop your immune system.  It never even occurred to me.  'Cause you would think --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- since you're exercising, your white count would be up and all that stuff, but hm.  Wow.
L:  Great.  
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Well -- 
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, I guess, okay, I'm about done on the illness thing.  That's a bad thing.  I don't get sick, so it's hard to talk on it.  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I -- that's -- that's a good thing, that if -- you know?
R:  Well see, my husband, though, he'll -- he'll wait till he's -- he won't even go to the doctor.  He hates going to doctors from all the I guess poking and prodding that he had when he was in the army, because if you had a sniffle, they you know, made him always go.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, he waits un- -- let's see.  He finally went to the doctor -- I had to force him to go to the doctor 'cause he fell at his job and popped some tendons in his leg.  That was the first time he'd been to the doctor, I think, since he'd gotten out of the army which was five years ago.  
L:  God.
R:  And he just went and he just twisted his ankle and really bad and sprained it, but he won't go either.  I mean, he can be running a fever and -- and have the flu and he won't go.  Well, not the flu, but you know, like a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- bronchitis or something and he won't go.  It's like, "Husband, that's -- you're sick.  Go to the doctor", so guess we could pretty much -- uh, the doc- no one likes going to the doctor, for the money reason and for the fact that you usually get sicker when you go.  Hm.
L:  Right.  
R:  So anyway -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does your family or any -- do -- does your family have any illnesses?  Like, genetic?  
L:  Um, I'm actually -- I -- it's quite silly, I don't -- I don't think so.  I actually -- interestingly, I'm a carrier for two genetic diseases.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, which is -- um, I'm actually Jewish so it's a -- it's kind of a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's within the Jewish population.  Usually before --
R:  Enlighten me, 'cause my mom is um converting to Messianic Judaism, so enlighten me 'cause she has --
L:  Well --
R:  -- um -- or friends --
L:  Okay.  Well, this -- this is genetic, so she can't -- she can't get it --
R:  No, no, but I'm saying --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she has the genetic -- or she has friends that are Jewish.
L:  Pretty -- it's more of an Eastern European primarily.  That concentration --
R:  Huh.
L:  Um, and so there's -- there's like seven main diseases, um [inaudible] familial disorder, nomia[?] [inaudible], it's -- it's -- I don't remember all of them, and see usually um, when people marry kind of within that same -- uh, other people from that same background --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- um, they usually go for a blood test prior to marriage --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to make sure they're not a match, 'cause if they're both carriers, there's like I think like a twenty five per cent chance that their kids will --
