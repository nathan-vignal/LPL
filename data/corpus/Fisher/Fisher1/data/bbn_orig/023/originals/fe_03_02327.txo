R:  Hi.  It's Ivan.
L:  Uh, Simon?
R:  Ivan.
L:  Ivan?  Hi, I'm Alison.
R:  Hi, Alison [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about, um, --
R:  [NOISE] Illness, right?
L:  Illnesses and was it something about, uh, change in the seasons and people becoming sick?
R:  Right, right.  Uh, that many people believe that happens.  Um, what do you think [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think so, but I think it's mostly in the spring because of, um, you know the allergies and stuff like that.  I'm in Texas and --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- i- it gets really, really bad over here in terms of the, um, pollen and stuff like that, but other than, um, allergies and things like that I think people say that if -- when it gets really cold or really warm very quickly that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for some reason they get ill.  I've never understood that myself.
R:  Well, um, is the weather over there kind of temperate, I mean, mean --
L:  Yeah, Texas is very, um, it's very unpredictable, um, in terms of getting hot and cold really quickly.
R:  Right, right.  Oh, we -- here it's, uh, I live in New York and the weather's always kind of bad [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially during the winter and stuff so most of the time people get sick during the winter when winter comes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, whe- and we tend to have the allergies all year round but we're mostly --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- susceptible to like the flus and the -- and the viruses and that kind of thing.
L:  So, during the winter does everybody have like, um, a cold like all the time?
R:  All the time, um, especially as there's so many of us, you know, jammed together, so if you went on the train to work, you know, you're pretty much close to everything.
L:  So, do -- do people just have constant colds for like four months out of the year?
R:  Yeah, yeah [LAUGH].  Um, --
L:  You would think they'd get used to it after a while.
R:  You do but l- like a lot of people just like, uh, like little older people or the younger people and stuff like that, they tend to -- to hold onto a cold and I guess that has to do with diet too.  Um, but wha- what was the -- the other component we had to talk about, that saying they said, that a cold lasts seven days if you go to a doctor or a week if you don't?  That kind of thing.
L:  Oh, um, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know a cold is a cold is a cold.  I -- I -- I --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't necessarily have a cold that just lasts seven days, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I've had some that have just lasted for weeks on end but in terms of going to the doctor, I don't think I've ever gone to a doctor for a cold specifically --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless it becomes a sinus infection, and then you've got a whole another problem at that juncture.
R:  Right, right.  I think that's when -- when you got a cold when you have an allergy too and you get infected that way.
L:  Yeah, it happens.  People have it really bad.
R:  Right.  You see, I used --
L:  So do you keep --
R:  -- I used to believe that, uh, if you -- you get -- you catch a cold for three days and then you have it for three days and you ge- get rid of it for three days, so I thought it usually lasts like nine days the whole thing.
L:  [MN] -- and in New York you just catch it again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there you go [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] So, do you go see the doctor a lot for your colds or since you already know in the winter everyone's going to be sick constantly?
R:  Well, yeah, we kind of -- we kind of expect it.  I mean, um, people with health insurance go to the doctor and get shots, the flu shot, but everybody else is like on their own [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you think generally people on their own, do they just suffer through it or what do you think they do about it?
R:  Um, you know, Macwell [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Macwell.  Over the counter drugs.
R:  We do a lot of Macwell here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, and those things, you know, it's like special teas you get with the -- the, you know, over -- over the counter stuff, like, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like, uh, alka seltzer teas, that kind of thing.
L:  So, how -- how often do you think you actually get sick since you live in that kind of climate?
R:  Um, well, I've been pretty lucky where we, I mean I used to get sick about, uh, maybe three or four times, just like a cold like regular stuff.  Um, really sick I get maybe like once every few years, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've been -- I've been pretty lucky.  I guess of course if you keep your diet up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then that has a lot to do with it too or if you clean your hands after you, you know, after everything like even if you go on the subway, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wash your hands afterwards and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that kind of thing, you know.  A lot of people forget to do that.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it gets really bad.  Um, see with the temperate climate that we have generally we don't get sick that often.  I mean like having a winter cold, I mean in fact I have a winter coat that I think I've worn twice in the past --
R:  Really [LAUGH].
L:  -- three years.  Yeah, you never wear -- you never wear out your winter coat, and then it gets outdated and you have to throw it out, but, um, we don't actually get sick that often here.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, [MN] it's just again the allergies, and right now it's just really, really terrible --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, um, --
R:  What do you -- what do you take for it?  What do most people --?
L:  I'm sorry, take -- well, um, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it depends, it depends on exactly how bad it is but, you know, right now just with maybe more pollution and stuff, uh, my, uh, home is actually pretty close to a farm area, --
R:  Right.  Oh, wow [LAUGH].
L:  -- but as -- well, yeah, in Texas you can, I mean I work for a major corporation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but literally I can drive three -- three or four minutes outside of the corporation past my house and then I'm in the middle of a farm.
R:  Right.
L:  And so, but, um, as it gets more and more polluted that people's allergies act up more and more and so, you know, I'm finding myself at one point never having to worry about it, and then now taking Claratyne, and I've gone from that to Zyrtec --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, you know it's just kind of gone on, and then people around here have to take a lot of sh- allergy shots just because of the -- the type of illness, but I do feel very sorry for folks who have it all the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like allergies because they're constantly having respiratory infections and constantly going to the doctor, and then they're just never well [LAUGH].  It's like --
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- it's in -- in -- somewhat incapacitated in fact from all that.
R:  Right, and there's a lot of people here who for other -- who for whatever reason, uh, they're -- they're immune system's compromised anyway, so they're always -- they always have some little thing going on and that's kind of, uh  -- there's a lot of people like that here, you know.  Like I have a few, like, family members who fall into that category.  They just always got to, you know, live with it, you know, seems to me [LAUGH].
L:  It's unfortunate too because I think -- I think people's quality of life, uh, starts to -- to really suffer.  I had -- I had a friend whose, um, whose husband is not only under -- like a very type A stressful type of individual, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just is real susceptible.  I -- I think, you know, what's -- what's -- what's first?  The chicken or the egg?  Is it the stress --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that makes his immune system go down or is it because he's sick and then it causes stress?  I don't know what the deal is, but, uh, ever since, strangely enough, ever since they married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he ended up -- he ended up being sick a lot, like constantly, you know, every week.  He goes to his job.  He -- he works really hard.  He does sixty, seventy hours a week.
R:  Right.
L:  And then on the weekends the guy can't get out of bed all weekend.
R:  I think it's the sixty, seventy hours a week that's doing that [LAUGH] so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, or it's the type of personality or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then you're out of kilter and then he's -- he's sick all the time and every weekend, you know, he never makes it to church because he's sick all the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's just, it's really very unfortunate, I think, for a lot of folks who -- who have, uh, quality of life issues, uh, with that.
R:  Yeah, but if, you know, what's the alternative [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, what's the alternative, exactly?
R:  Yeah, you -- you live with what you have and hopefully it's just like an allergy or a cold and nothing bad that [several inaudible words], you know.
L:  Yeah, it doesn't get any worse.
R:  Do people near farms get sicker than other people? [LAUGH]
L:  What did you say?
R:  Do people who live near farms, do they get sicker than other people?
L:  You know what, I don't think they necessarily do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, because I think in general their lifestyles are so much healthier in terms of getting out, getting away from the office air --
R:  Mm, oh, okay.
L:  -- and -- and they're used to, and I -- and I think really, they're really used to much more difficult conditions that -- I think it's just a healthier environment.  I mean that's why farmers can eat, you know, three eggs and --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- nine pieces of bacon and [LAUGH] they c- -- and, you know, biscuits with lard in it and they can do it day after day after day and then --
R:  Probably the Atkins diet [LAUGH].
L:  Um, yeah, the Atkins diet [LAUGH].  But and then there -- there's -- there's ju- -- they're just incredibly healthy.  It's because, you know, they're out exercising, getting fresh air and stuff like that, although I guess the d- the downside is that -- that people who are office workers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- generally will not get an arm cut off from a tractor [LAUGH].
R:  That's -- that's true [LAUGH].
L:  They'll just get sick from the poisoned air in the offices [LAUGH].
R:  I wonder if -- if you -- if you like, you know, traded places, you know, it's like the farmer traded places with the office worker for a while, like a week, would they get sicker and would the office people get better or would they just be sicker or something like that?  I wonder if the environment is that much have to do with it or just the constitution, you know?
L:  You know, I -- I -- I've -- I wonder, um, I -- I think that probably the farmer would get more sick in an office environment --
R:  Really?
L:  -- um, and I think ye- -- but [LAUGH] the problem is if you get a bunch of city office workers trying to get on the farm, I mean, they are most likely -- they're just going to hurt themselves, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other than just physical damage to their bodies I think that they probably would be healthier, but that's just -- that's just me --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- having grown up out here.
R:  I wonder how much alcohol has to do with, uh, people getting sick?
L:  I'm s- -- how -- how much what?
R:  Alcohol?  Um, like, you know, people who are hard drinkers if they get sicker than, you know what I mean?  I mean, does it do anything, 'cause I've heard in New York we hear that if you -- people who are [MN] alcoholics get less colds actually because their blood is so thin all the time or something like that.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know about that [LAUGH].  Sounds like -- sounds to me that's like an excuse just to have a party --
R:  Oh, really, yeah [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, I don't know.  [LAUGH] But, um, no I think, uh, I think probably if you had -- I think the alcohol generally because it's just going to lead to a poor health -- healthy const- --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- constitution, and you probably going to get worse, but then, you know, they've got all the studies that if you drink, what is it, if you drink one beer --
R:  Oh, and like one glass of wine, yeah.
L:  -- or one -- one glass of wine or something like that it's supposed to, um, not only lower heart disease but there's other diseases it's supposed to lower.  I don't know what the deal is.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and they said there's a --
R:  So, maybe there is something to the -- if, you know, helping your blood a little bit.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Maybe there is something to it, helping your blood just a little bit, you know, the alcohol.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, maybe [LAUGH].
L:  But it -- but it was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that if you drink, you know, you drink something once a day, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  But, um, it doesn't stop me I think I'd have a Coors Light open right now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, that's -- that's ...
