R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is Karen.
L:  Hi, I'm Mack.
R:  Mack?  Matt?
L:  Mack.  How are you doing?
R:  Mack, okay, I'm fine.  Okay, what -- well out of that list what do you consider the worst?
L:  Um, either -- either talking excessively, or um --
R:  I think -- wasn't that eating excessively? [LAUGH] 
L:  I think there were -- I think there was eating [LAUGH] excessively and talking excessively.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Ah, there was one other that I forgot, th- it was a long list. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  I think it was, like, drinking, smoking, not exercising, eating o- eating excessively, um, something like that, anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, out of that -- out of what you remember, which is the worst?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think -- I th- well, huh -- probably over eating.
R:  Over eating?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I --
L:  You know, people -- people start looking stupid after they drink, so that could be annoying as well.
R:  True, not to say -- wh -- well the whole list ha- to me, the whole list has -- the whole list is personal choices --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to a degree.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and to me, out of the whole business, it -- gossiping would probably be about the worst because --
L:  That was one of them.
R:  Because um, you're not doing it -- actually you're bringing bad comment to yourself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you're actually doing something to somebody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- you know.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I -- I really don't know.  I know that nobody likes to be a part of gossip when half of it is, you know, if you've got something to say, go to the person --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.
R:  -- be open and honest and if something's bothering you say, "Hey, I saw you with so and so, you know, is it true or not?"  I believe you always give that person the option of looking you straight in the face and telling you the truth or telling you a lie.  Y- you know --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- but, okay, now, I'm not -- we've got to carry this on for ten minutes --
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  -- I was with -- I was with -- I got disconnected.  I -- I actually was on this topic with an- with a lady and we got d- disconnected halfway through so I called back --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, um, you -- you said that --
L:  It w-
R:  -- over eating.
L:  Y- Yeah, but see, gossiping was what I was trying to remember.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] 
L:  That was what I was trying to remember and I --
R:  Okay, then -- okay what are your thoughts on it then?
L:  [inaudible]
R:  What are your thoughts on it then?
L:  Yeah, gossiping [inaudible] it ends up there's -- there's -- it's not a victimless crime, without being somebody who gets hurt in the end.  Ah, and it's [inaudible] happen, you know, um --
R:  It gets complicated doesn't it?  Okay, now, how about alcohol?  Over excessive alcohol.  How about the alcoholic family?  They're hurt.
L:  Alcohol what?
R:  Suppose -- are you on a cell phone, or what?  Because you keep looping out.
L:  I'm on a cell phone.
R:  Okay, how about um, over indulgence in alcohol?  Okay --
L:  Over indulgence -- yeah.  Okay.
R:  Okay.  What you do is, I -- I would think what you do to yourself is your own business but when there's other people involved, um, how about family members that are hurt?  You know.  I -- I think everything has to be --
L:  Alcoholics anonymous [inaudible]
R:  Um, true.  The twelve -- have you actually ever check out a twelve step program just for your own --
L:  Oh, I've -- I've -- I've been to --
R:  Okay.  Me too.  I've been to AA meetings.  My ex is a -- well, he's a recovering alcoholic.  I think he's sent -- he was clean and sober like, five years, but I used to go to AA meetings and actually I um, went to Al Anon and I really, really, really enjoyed both of them.  They gave me a complete new perspective on the alcoholic and I -- and I found out I was not powerless.  I allowed -- I gave my power away, y- you know what I mean?  Your choice and power, it's all -- it's all up to you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I'm a firm believer that the whole world, if they worked a twelve step program and believed in accountability and um, checked their motives, that everybody would at least get along a little bit better. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean -- I -- I actually ended getting -- getting forced into AA meetings.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Um, n- never been an alcoholic --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Never really drink and you know, pot smoker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah, and my [NOISE] parents [several inaudible words] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for smoking and then they took me to an AA meeting, like, every night --
R:  Okay.  Well the --
L:  So --
R:  But, okay, how did you feel about that?  I mean, I would hate being forced, but how did you, actually once, if you opened up, did you like the meetings?
L:  I didn't feel so great, I just --
R:  Did you really?  'Cause I did.
L:  I always felt out of place.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I felt -- I felt that they were great, I just wasn't part of them[?]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I personally just felt out of place with them.
R:  Yeah.  I can -- I can -- I can understand that too, but what I liked was, hey, these people are there and they're just -- hey, this is who they are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is how they're getting by.  This is how they're living --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and some of these people were clean and sober years and years and years and years, but what I learned there too, it's a daily choice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I think that's how life is lived is -- is just every day it's a -- it's a choice for this or choice for that and if you stop and think about how many choices you have to make, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it's really overwhelming and when people say, well you don't make -- you know, y- you don't make decisions, well yes you do, [LAUGH] you decided to get out of bed this morning [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You decided [NOISE] Oh.
L:  Oh.
R:  Are you there still?
L:  I'm there -- I'm here.
R:  Okay, good.  Well you carry this -- carry this -- th- the -- a little bit, because we were talking a little bit about over weight too.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- I was ov- I just trying to think of af- after you listed them off.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  There was -- there was ah, only a few that I -- I think I -- I think caught --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and out of -- out of the few that I heard were listed I think -- oh -- ah -- eating excessively --
R:  [LAUGH] Excessively, yeah.
L:  Because, I mean, even I do it, you know what I mean, like --
R:  Oh we all do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, I- I'll tell you what, it doesn't matter, I am -- I don't gain weight, so I've stayed what I am for past twenty years and I probably will stay this -- this way the rest of my life, so I don't worry about it, but for other people, yes, because it does damage -- it -- it does, um, oh, what?  It -- it -- health wise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Cholesterol levels and all that business.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, well you talk. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'll talk.  I -- I'm not a big talker.  I [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, this -- I think this study is pretty neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I th- I think it really is.  This is my second call and I really -- I really enjoy it. I don't mi- you know.
L:  This is my first.
R:  Is it? Oh well, then -- then, okay, hey this is pretty cool, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't know, but we're supposed to --
L:  -- they just take -- and then they make you talk about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda -- kinda different, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh I like it.  I do.  Um, the topics are interesting too because it gets other people's point of view.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But I have another phone to answer, hold on.
R:  Oh, okay, but we're supposed to keep this up for eight minutes.
L:  Nobody was on the phone.
R:  [LAUGH] See. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It was ringing but nobody answered.
R:  Oh, really, oh yeah.  But um, okay.  Alcohol, we've covered that a little bit, but out of all that we've covered, the gossip --
L:  Oh, and there was exercising too.
R:  Yeah.  I mean all these things are, you know --
L:  See --
R:  -- what -- you know, what is the worst.
L:  That's kind of weird with the -- with the exercising [inaudible] most people wouldn't think exercising is a bad thing.
R:  No, a lack of -- lack of exercise.
L:  Lack of exercise.  Was it lack of exercising?
R:  I think so.  I think so.  It wasn't over- it was not over exercising, it was lack of.  Yeah, I think that's pretty bad too, especially if you're an over eater and you just gobble and gobble and just hang around --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and let the fat roll and then gossip about [LAUGH] somebody and drink your booze.  [LAUGH] No, and smoke!
L:  Exactly.
R:  Smoking too, okay, smoking was -- it was just what did you feel was -- was one of the worst, and for me it was the gossiping.  I usually allow people to do -- be who they are and whatever and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and try to draw the line with gossip, if I do something or share information, y- I don't know, there's a -- there's a fine line between sharing information and gossiping.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  True, when it's gossiping it's --
R:  It --
L:  -- one person that's being gossiped about is --
R:  What I -- what I think though too, is if people resort to that -- if people have to resort to saying something bad about somebody else all they're trying to do is make themselves look better.
L:  But I don't think gossiping is necessarily that.  I think gossiping is just -- is you know, [inaudible] basically [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah, true.  But it has to be -- it has to be based in some insecurity or, for some reason to point a finger at somebody and say did y- did you hear about the latest about so and so --
L:  It only ends up getting [inaudible] off ah, who's gossiping, you know [inaudible]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so brings the new news in and everybody forgot about what was talked about her --
R:  Oh, sure.  Oh sure.  Well then, then actually some of the -- the -- the evening news stations that gossip because they don't always get their facts straight. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
