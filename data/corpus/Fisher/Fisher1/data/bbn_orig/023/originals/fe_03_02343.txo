R:  Hi.
L:  This is Glor-
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is Michelle Taylor.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, this is Gloria Harvey.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  That's good.
R:  This is the first time I've ever done anything like this. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Well, the topic of the day is; which do you think if worse to use, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I believe that alcohol drinking excessively would be very harmful to a person.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I had a, um -- my dad was an alcoholic.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yep, and after he -- he finally quit and got hisself together and then --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- two years later he was diagnosed with colon cancer and died, so ...
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very sorry to hear that.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, you know, alcohol damages a lot of people's lives and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's happened with me -- I have a alcoholic brother --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and, um, he had tried to rape me --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- under the influence of alcohol.
R:  Bless your heart.
L:  Yeah, it was very, very --
R:  That is terrible.
L:  -- traumatic experience for me and, um, it caused a lot of damage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to the family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and as far as our relationships with each other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, it's -- it's something whereas, um, he's not trying to stop drinking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he's really-- you know, his drinking is like his -- it's like how we brush our teeth.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Is for him, drinking.
R:  Right, well --
L:  You know.
R:  It took my dad to get hit by a car before he stopped.
L:  Wow, unbelievable.
R:  I'm -- I'm glad he finally did and he was able to get things right with g- -- with god and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, another nasty habit is smoking, but I finally quit about two years ago. [LAUGH] A little --
L:  That's something I'm trying to do now.  
R:  Really?  Well, I got pregnant --
L:  Slowly, but surely.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I got --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- pregnant and then as soon as I found out I was pregnant I quit and it's been two year -- a little over two years.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I was pregnant I couldn't, uh -- I couldn't smoke cigarettes either --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But as soon as the baby was born and everything afterwards --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I started and picked them up right back again.
R:  I thought that I -- I've -- I've -- I'm still fighting the craving. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, i- -- I hear that --
R:  So, it's hard.
L:  I hear that that patch works pretty good.
R:  Really?  I didn't even use it.  I just quit cold turkey.  I don't know how I did it, but --
L:  Well, that's good.  Don't go back to 'em 'cause --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- they're too expensive. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, I think what, they're like four or five dollars a pack now?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, they're -- now they're like seven dollars.
R:  Really?  Is it that much?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, they're seven dollars a pack, but you can get 'em for five in different places, you know.
R:  Huh.  In North Carolina --
L:  You have to send away for 'em.
R:  It's cheaper in North Carolina to get 'em.  Like, so whenever I go back home I'd go I -- I would used to get 'em.  I don't do it any more, but --
L:  Oh, so you're from North Carolina?
R:  Mhm.  I'm from Rocky Mountain.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I live in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  I live in New York.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have some family that live up there.
L:  Yeah, it's been -- it's been wild here.
R:  Mm.
L:  Ever since nine eleven, we just been going through so many changes, you know.
R:  I know.  I c- -- I can imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you live in -- in the city of New York?
L:  Yes, in the Bronx.
R:  Really?  Wow!
L:  The county of the Bronx.  Yeah.  And it's really it's -- it's, you know, it's to the point where you just wanna leave 'cause it's so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- traumatic here.  Everything is just so wild and so many different things happening and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's sad -- it's sad how we have to go through so much changes.
R:  Mm.  Mm, Mm, Mm.  Well, uh --
L:  Um, what else were we supposed to talk about?
R:  [NOISE] Supposed to keep it on bad habits, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, bad habits. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have a bad habit of nail biting.
R:  Oh, really?  I -- I --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- do that too. [LAUGH]
L:  I nail bite.  I -- and -- but if I put the fake nails on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I won't bite them.
R:  Well, I have to say I did that for a long time --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and it -- the artificial ones, um, messed up my nail bed and I finally --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- had -- it took me like a year for my nail beds to grow out --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- to where they were healthy again --
L:  Wow. 
R:  -- so I -- I decided not to put 'em on there any more.  When I was pregnant I had really good nails and after I had her -- had my daughter, she -- they still stayed really good, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now that she's almost two years old, I think I'm back to the biting stage again. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I bet.  You know, you -- you know, you find yourself really nervous and you start biting --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I've never really been able --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to grow my nails unless I had the fake ones on.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  Takes a while.
R:  You could take -- instead -- when they -- when they get long enough too, you could --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- put acrylic over 'em instead of using a nail.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So -- that'll keep 'em stronger.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, and --
L:  So, this is the first time you're doing the research study?
R:  Yeah, um, somebody --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- somebody emailed me the other day and said, "Try it", and I -- they said it paid ten dollars for a call, I said --
L:  Right.
R:  "Hm, I'll try it, yeah".
L:  Right.
R:  I've -- they've -- I think they've called me three times and I haven't been home until today.
L:  Oh, well this is my first time too.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, the --
L:  +Especially[?] doing it like this, you know.
R:  Huh?
L:  This is my first time doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and it's kinda cool.  I like it, you know.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a neat way to meet people. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.
R:  I did -- I don't think I every caught what you said your name was.
L:  Gloria.
R:  Gloria.
L:  And you are?
R:  Michelle.
L:  Michelle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay --
R:  Well, it's nice talking to you .
L:  So, now we know each other. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, um, I sell, um, pamper[?] chests for a living.  That's what keeps me at home with my daughter.
L:  Right, right, right.
R: So, um --
L:  That's a good thing.
R:  -- and I got -- that's how I got this email.  Somebody on m- -- one of message groups had -- had sent this and said that -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that to try it and I figured, what the heck, may as well.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  If it [LAUGH] -- if it keeps me home with my child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Keeps me from having to go back to work.  'Cause that's another bad habit --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Working. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes it is.  I'm not working right now, so every little dollar I can make any other way I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to do, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this seems like a pretty good way to get a couple of dollars, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  L- -- every little bit helps, that's --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- for sure.
R:  Mhm, um --
L:  Yeah, so we gotta talk about, um, bad habits and, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let's see.
R:  We have a bad habit of getting off the subject. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we get off [LAUGH] -- that's a bad habit, right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, they said caffeine.  I love coffee.
R:  Oh, I love Coke, so --
L:  I have to -- oh, yeah, and I love Pepsi.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes, a- and caffeine is another thing that I just have to have, you know, like if I don't have it like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- one day out of the week I'll try not to drink any soda or have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any coffee --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I find myself just the next day I'm just grasping for it, you know.
R:  I get a c- -- I get a caffeine headache if I don't have it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I notice my head starts hurting too, 'cause a couple of days I went without some Pepsi --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I didn't drink any coffee --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and I was drinking water most of the day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, "I'm gonna drink more water", 'cause the doctor had suggested that I drink more water.
R:  Ooh, I think they tell that to everybody. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and, um, you know, that day my head was hurting.  It had like a low kind of a dull headache, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I noticed that [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I guess that's what that's all about, yeah.  Not having the caffeine.
R:  Mhm, caffeine withdrawal, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My husband, he quit drinking Cokes for a long time, or Pepsis or anything like that and -- and he's [NOISE] -- won't drink nothing but water but he's, um -- [NOISE] every so often I'll -- I'll c- c- -- I'll catch him in the kitchen and they're drinking my Pepsi. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Isn't that something?  Yeah, well, you like -- that's how I am too.  I have to keep a Pepsi in the house --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- because whenever I start feeling like that dull headache --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'll go and drink some Pepsi and it'll go away.
R:  Yeah.  It's either that, or, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if I don't have Pepsi I'll try to switch the tea every so often.  That way I'm not getting all the carbonation and stuff.
L:  Yeah, I've been switching to tea too.  I drink --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- tea, uh --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- hot tea.
R:  -- got less sugar than Cokes do.
L:  Yeah, but that has caffeine too, doesn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you -- you can get decaffeinated tea now too, but I don't -- I -- I tried the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- decaffeinated cold brew and then I didn't like it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I haven't tried any other decaffeinated tea yet.
L:  Right.
R:  And I probably won't --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- because I like my caffeine too much. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, I like my caffeine too.  It gives me a little jolt, you know --
R:  Yeah, and you --
L:  I'm able to get up and move around a little better.
R:  You can also get caffeine in chocolate too.
L:  Huh?
R:  Caffeine's in chocolate too.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I do love snickers bars. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's -- what's that -- that overeating habit? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was another one [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Candy.
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah, that's --
R:  Sweet.
L:  -- that's something else that I do.  I do overeat 'cause sometimes I'll skip breakfast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just have coffee.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the next thing I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm eating.  By the end of the day I'm really hungry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm eating more than I'm supposed to eat, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm eating things that I shouldn't be eating, you know.
R:  Yeah, I think that's a problem with a lot of people in this country. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then the size of the food is also a problem too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they're making everything big and, you know ...
R:  Mm.
L:  The bigger it is the more it is to eat.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  My weakness is Italian food.  I love Italian food.
L:  Oh, yes.  I love spaghetti.
R:  Pasta, mhm.
L:  I love spaghetti.  Yes, I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I -- I can sit down and eat spaghetti like three or four days of the week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's how much I'm crazy about it.
R:  Yeah, my husband when we first got married, I think that's all I fixed for like the first six weeks [LAUGH] -- was spaghetti or lasagna.
L:  Yeah, I like lasagna too --
R:  [MN]
L:  That's very good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it's very expensive to make.
R:  Well, it depends on what you make it with.  All I put in is, um, Ragu, sauteed onion and garlic -- is my spaghetti sauce that I use --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I put, um -- I use Dalbeta[?] cheese and mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's all and then I found the hamburger meat and the lasagna noodles.
L:  Well, I use the mozzarella with the ricotta.
R:  See, I don't like ricotta cheese.
L:  Yeah, and, um -- and there's another cheese.  I put a little American in there, cheese whiz.
R:  Mhm, is that Dalbeta?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's what I do.
L:  I love that in three. [MN]
R:  Yeah, okay, [inaudible].
L:  So, now, how long we supposed to talk?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Has it been ten yet?  No?
R:  I d- -- I don't know and I'm -- I don't know what we're supposed to do after that. [LAUGH]
L:  It s- -- it says that somebody'll come on and, uh, c- --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I think they'll c- -- you know, let us know that the time is up.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or something like that.  I think --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that's how it goes.
