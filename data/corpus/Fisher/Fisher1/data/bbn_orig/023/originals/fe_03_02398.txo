L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Jane.
R:  Hi Jane.  My name's Jennifer.
L:  Hi Jennifer.
R:  So, where are you calling from?
L:  Dallas, Texas.
R:  Oh, I'm from Los Angeles.
L:  Oh well, okay.  So you're a couple of hours ah- um, behind me.
R:  Yeah, just a couple.
L:  Okay, all right.  So, did you understand all that they said; which was worse, smoking, over eating, no exercise.  I didn't catch all of them, I can't remember.
R:  Gossiping --
L:  Gossiping, okay.
R:  And um, did we mention over -- over eating?
L:  Over eating.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, so what do you think?
L:  Oh, I th- they're all bad f- alth- for each of their own reasons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but I d- I don't know.  Um, we have a -- a mayor here in Dallas, Texas, that just instituted a law that you cannot smoke in any public areas.
R:  Oh yeah, because that's --
L:  -- in any restaurants, and of course, you've had that for a while in -- in LA, right?
R:  In California, right.
L:  Yeah, so um, I -- it's really cutting into -- into um people going to restaurants and -- I mean, you can't even smoke in a bar now.
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's um, they just did that in New York.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm from New York originally and they just did it there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  People -- but you know what, in California?  Somehow they got -- I've only been here for almost three years but somehow they got used to it.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, eventually, over time um, people are able to get used to that new rule.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, I mean, you know, I don't think -- but people, even though the rule happened here, I thing originally when that rule happened, people, you know, were up in arms and then a lot of people were happy, but people still smoke outside, so, in public places here.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I'm a smoker and I don't even smoke in my own home.
R:  Yeah, but I don't -- you know --
L:  I go outside an- and, you know, I mean, I used to go outside in -- in the winter time when it was twenty two, twenty five degrees and still be out there smoking, going why am I doing this? And --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, still, you know, [LAUGH] do it later in the day.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, so, but I enjoy not having smoke blown in my face when I'm trying to eat, even though I am a smoker.
R:  What about bars though?
L:  Well --
R:  Do you frequent bars at all?
L:  -- I do, yeah, I -- you know, I -- I- d- I'm not one to go to happy hour every night after work or anything, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, once in a while I go meet my girlfriends or something and we'll wanna drink and I like to drink and have a cigarette.
R:  Right.
L:  But um --
R:  See, that's where -- I -- I smoke too.  And [COUGH] it's that -- but I notice here that I -- since I've moved to California I can't really -- I can't go to bars with girlfriends of mine, because we all smoke socially --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we smoke more than socially, but it is a -- it's such a -- what do you call that?  It's a like a tandem to smoke and drink.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  in -- in-- in -- actually, drinking certain drinks with cigarettes, it kind of enhances the fun of it, I mean -- I mean, and then you talk.  It's like having coffee for some people --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- and you can't do that here.  But when I was living in New York and in Chicago, I mean, that law didn't exist, so that's how, if I had to go to a bar now I would have to have it amended that you can do that, or you'd have to find one of these secret[?] bars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where you can do that.  But there are -- you know, you have to really look for that here.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- I -- That's why, you know, when I was listening, well, you know, smoking yeah, they're [several inaudible words] and also that's bad, I know it's -- it does awful things to us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- but at the same time [COUGH] --
L:  It's a relaxant.
R:  It's a relaxant for me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I mean I do know if I -- if I ever develop lung cancer it will be my fault --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's as relaxing to me as drinking coffee [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I will do that also and um, you know, but -- but listening to all those choices, I thought -- but I would never over eat.
L:  No, I don't -- I yeah.  
R:  And that thing -- because to m- well for me though, I chose that as being the worst, because um, it tends to be when I'm in a bar smoking and drinking I tend to be gossiping too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, I'm doing all these bad things already!  But the over eating part, I, there is an immediate response to the body.
L:  Yeah.  You sa- well I think of people, since I'm not, you know, I -- I think of people that over eat are lazy and slothful and they don't have jobs or they're poor --
R:  Yeah, it's like -- it's a negative --
L:  You know, I put -- I put them in a category.
L:  -- right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's like a negative connotation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with over eating.  And that is kind of what I -- I mean, it's not true of everyone, but it is -- it's the first flash idea that comes through in my mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's actually bad conditioning, you know, because we, as -- as this culture with TV showing us that and with movies and then, just every -- everything's catered towards very slim people --
R:  Tall and slim, yeah.
L:  -- and people who are not overweight, then that even conditions more whenever you hear over eat, it's bad.  It's bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, I'm sure that has something to do with me even saying that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because if we were in a culture that s- that did the same exact thing with smoking being very bad, I don't -- I think I would have listed that first.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  But in Asia, like, my friends in [inaudible] here's one, in -- in Ghana, I've friends that live in -- in Africa and they are um, they are professors of mine, they believed that it was very, very, very bad to gossip. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
L:  They really, like, you shouldn't talk about your friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they would put that -- I guess th- they would see over eating as bad, they would see smoking as bad, not -- you know, just like we do, like, there are bad things -- to each -- there are worse things for each um, choice, but they really felt that gossiping was over the -- over the limit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You sh- you shouldn't even think about doing that.  And um, so I think it's cultural.  I think if I grew up in Ghana, I would be different.  If I grew up in Tibet, where that too, is a really bad thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's super bad.  It's so cultural though.  And, yeah, I mean, I've friends in France and they eat all the time but they're not obese.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know why that is but they don't see overeating, I don't know, let me thing.
L:  Maybe because they take a long time to eat.
R:  Yeah, it might be that, th- they spend a lot of time over conversation and food --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they do a lot of drinking though, and they don't think drinking is bad because, I mean, a lot of my friends are from France, or who have lived in France, have said you don't drink to excess that you get, you know, smashed, but you can drink a lot if you're eating a lot, it -- you just kind of a mix, there's nothing bad about it, you're enjoying the cuisine of a country.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Well you come over back to New York or back to Texas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're like, well, you know, drinking, that's bad and then people who don't drink start to think, oh I had a g- I had two glasses of wine, that's probably bad.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I mean I've gone from -- from work after not having eaten all day long because I've been so busy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and gone and had one drink and just been totally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, drunk.
R:  Mhm. Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and then I've had maybe um, you know, a good meal throughout the day, gone out at nine or ten o'clock and had one beer and then like, totally in control --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know, um --
R:  Right.  Has to do about the food.
L:  -- but then I've gone to restaurants, where I've eaten you know, for three or four hours at a -- um, there's a Texas Day Brazil which is a um, a -- a um, th -- you know, the restaurant for Brazil, with that kind of meat?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you sit there with your friends for three or four hours just talking and eating an- and taking breaks and -- and all that kind of stuff and you're -- you're not full and you're not drunk and you're just, you know, satisfied.
R:  Right.
L:  And so, I -- I think it's a different style of eating.  Here, everything's fast food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And fast drinking, fast smoking [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] I think we're bad. [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  So maybe that has a big difference, you know, but you're right, gossip- gossip is bad.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it starts to become slander if you go into the professional sense and in that way it's really bad because there are -- there are federal um, you know, you can prosecute someone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But also, then you start to think, morally should you be, you know, i- is this what you want to pass onto other people that it's okay t- to really gossip about others.  I mean, I do, a little, and I used to more so when I was in college because it just seemed to be my age.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, then it depended on the crowd that you were with. I just happened to be a teacher, and teachers gossip about everyone else.  It was awful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know --
L:  But it's so hard to tell what gossip is now --
R:  I suppose it starts off as --
L:  -- because there's all kinds of TV programs that talk all about the stars and all that kind of stuff and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it only bec- it just becomes, you know, natural to talk.
R:  Yeah, there's, I mean the lines get blurred.  You don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and often, you don't just know, oh we're gossiping --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it really starts off very innocent.
L:  Uh- huh.
R:  And um, it can really progress [LAUGH] it really can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It can a- also change a tenor of a friendship.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So that if you find that all you do with this one friend is gossip about other people, you have to really re-evaluate what kind of friendship is this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is this just a gossiping --
