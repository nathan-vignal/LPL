R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi.
L:  Hi, um, I guess, um -- I'm Christina. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name is Dawn.
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  I'm in New Jersey. 
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, this is like my first call, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I didn't [COUGH] -- excuse me I have a cold, so --
L:  Oh, that's fine. [LAUGH]
R:  -- my voice.  Okay, um, um -- no, I did one earlier because, you know, within this hour.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I spoke to a gentleman before from Boston.  The second -- so, this is really my second call.  I was referred by a friend.  How about you?
L:  Um, yeah, I was on a pregnancy forum --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- a friend emailed me about it, so ...
R:  Yeah, and we might[?] know the same person because she -- it was from a woman's site.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe it was. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, like I go to -- I do sweepstakes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, she, um -- and we do like surveys and different things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, and she told me about it.  But, um, let me see here.  Like, um, Women Connect.  Is that, um, p- -- the place that you went to?
L:  No, um, about dot com.  They have like pregnancy forums and like --
R:  Oh, wow.  Wow.
L:  -- all kinds of stuff.  That's where I heard about it at.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  I'm not actually pregnant, but I've been on there since I was pregnant, [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.  Now, [inaudible] which one do you think is the, um, the worst?  Gossiping, um --
L:  Well, I don't think gossiping [LAUGH] is.
R:  No?
L:  Um, no.
R:  Smoking?  Or --
L:  I would say like smoking or like excessive alcohol.
R:  Yeah, excessive alcohol.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what was the other one?  Um, not exercising.
L:  Yeah, I think, and overeating was the other one.
R:  Exercising, yeah.  I honestly, um, I think, um, gossiping, because --
L:  Really, you do?
R:  Yeah, because you know why?  Because when, uh, people gossip about other people they're not there to protect themselves, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, and I feel like if anyth- -- if you have to s-, um, say anything about somebody else, if you are willing to talk about them behind their back, you have to be willing to talk to them and actually say it to their face --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they ever confronted you too.  So, gossiping I don't think is, um, I don't --
L:  And you think that is worse than -- than smoking or like an alcoholic or something like that?
R:  Well, smoking and, um, and alcoholism is like -- is an addiction.  So, yeah, it is -- it is worse for your health wise, but willingly to gossip; it's, um, not harming anybody but the other people that are -- are not around this time.  The -- the smoking and, uh, drinking -- yeah, like you're hurting yourself.  Smoking you're hurting other people around you, but you know, it's really hard to choose between, I guess, those three.
L:  Actually, n- I never would've thought of gossiping that way.  I mean, [SIGH] --
R:  Well, I work in an office --
L:  Yeah, it's bad, but --
R:  I work in an office, [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, I'm sure -- I guess -- I'm a stay at home mom --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I'm not around it any more. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.  Just, like my mother in law died of cancer.  She didn't smoke, but I -- just from her dying and all that kind of stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I'm just like, you know, we're really strong in like not, you know, not letting people smoke around our son and stuff like that.
R:  Well --
L:  I mean, my parents smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, it's really hard because they have to like, you know, go outside when he's over there and stuff like that.  So, I see that as more of a problem because that's what I deal with every day.  I mean, not every day but --
R:  Yeah, when you visit 'em.
L:  But, when I'm sitting at home nobody's really gossiping about me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  See we- -- you know, I -- I -- I mean, I was a stay at home mom too for -- for a long time but then when -- when I went back to work, I mean, you see it all.  Um, and I work for, um, you know, a company that there's many women.  And even men gossip.  So -- and I see what it does when they -- um, to the other people when they -- when they -- when they do it, so I guess --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, 'cause to think out of all three -- no k- -- gossiping will not kill you in that form, but yeah, smoking and not exercising and excessive drinking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess that its worse.
L:  [NOISE] Well, then like the drinking thing.  I just -- I had a friend that was killed in a car accident because he was drinking --
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I see that as [NOISE] being pretty bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, but [NOISE] I mean, I haven't actually been in like a gossiping situation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably since high school.  I mean, college wasn't really like that, but --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly, see I --
L:  But I know a lot of people say that the work place is just like high school because [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because [COUGH], excuse me.  I -- I have that cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think of -- yeah, exactly -- when I see, um -- I mean, we all -- it's in our nature to gossip, but when people gossip it's like, you know, I feel like I'm a child.  You know, it's -- same thing that you just -- you expressed.  Like you feel like you're in high school.  It's the same thing.  That's what it is.  It's a whole bunch of people talking.  It doesn't change.  You know, like you were in high school and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Same thing.  You know, but, um --
L:  That's pretty sad. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it is, you know, 'cause they have nothing else -- it's like they're benefiting from somebody else's poor, uh, poor circumstances.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're benefiting and getting some kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- self +glorification --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in something like this.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I understand about the, um, the alcoholism because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you know I had a relative I grew up with that was alcoholic --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, you know, so it does --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do things to you and, um, if y- -- you know, it's hard to control unless they get h- -- you know, tha- that person fortunately came from a long -- long family of alcoholics so they were able -- th- they were actually the only one to, um, not be an alcoholic to this day, so --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  You know, they came out of it.  So, [MN] [SIGH] anyway.
L:  Well, that's funny, that [LAUGH] what you said about the gossiping I never really -- I don't know --
R:  You never thought of it.
L:  I thought the others were worse, but gossiping y- -- actually you have nothing to do with and you have no control over, so that is pretty bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, that's when I had a look and I observe and, um, and then when people come to me I'm like, "Well, I don't think that" and said, and you know, and then, um, and then I'll say -- they say, "So, you know", but I -- whatever I have to say, I'm willing to say to their face and everybody knows me and how I am about that subject. [LAUGH] So, it's just real funny that the topic was that.  But, um ...
L:  So, do you have problems at work then?
R:  Oh, me personally?  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, honestly me personally, no.  But it's just like I feel bad for the people that I see in my office because, you know, there people have nothing else better to do.  And it's hard enough to be around it because you're right there anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's like they talk to you.  But honestly, no.  I mean, I probably am [LAUGH] that I don't know about.
L:  Well, I just wonder if you have a problem because people know that you won't, you know, bad mouth other people just for the fun of it.
R:  Right, or get self, um, glori- you know, they have -- or they're bored, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And I -- you know, I'm the type person that would actually tell them, "We- well, why are you saying that?  Did they say this to you?  Or ..."  I said, um, you know -- you know what I mean?  Along those lines.  I tell them like that. [COUGH] Excuse me.  But, you know, anyway --
L:  Well, I'm kinda glad I don't work right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well I think it's like that all places and like -- I mean, even my husband where -- where he works and he works, um, in a school and, um, even there --
L:  You know, I wouldn't think it would be -- well, it's usually all women at school.  That's -- I have an education degree.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I would just think that teachers could like rise above something like that. 
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, they all gossip about each other and I said, "No".  He says, "Yes".  And the funny thing is they gossip to my husband. [LAUGH] Because he's like a manager there so they all go and tell him stuff, you know, at his school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so, um, it's really funny that, you know, at --
L:  That's funny.  You're supposed to be educating kids about --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- not doing the same thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's just like --
L:  It's pretty hypocritical. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's just that -- I think it's just part of our nature that some people, you know, can't control, but --
L:  Well, I can't say that I've never, you know, not gossiped about somebody.
R:  No, of course not.  But I never, um, did it, you know, where I know -- to hurt that person or -- or not willing to say it to their face if I had something to say.
L:  Well, most of the stuff I say, I'd probably say to their face, but --
R:  Yeah.  Just got[?] to[?] --
L:  -- that's just because I don't care.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, n- [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What are they gonna do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if it's the truth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Anyway, so, like what other, um -- any like, um, wh- what was the first subject on, same thing right?  When you called up the first -- oh, this really your first call?
L:  This is my -- I did have another call and I was talking to the guy for about two minutes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think he was totally trying to like, you know, hook up, or -- I don't know what. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  He just was, uh, pretty nasty, so I ended the call.
R:  Oh, good.  Yeah, see --
L:  I mean, I just -- I cannot believe somebody would you use something like -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, like this?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Did he say where he was from?
L:  I think he said he was from Dallas.
R:  Oh, yeah, no, I talked to the -- with my first one was from a gentleman from, um, Boston and he said that he was helping out the company because they didn't have enough participants and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he actually worked for the company.  So, it --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so it was interesting, you know, talking to him about the subjects.  But I -- you know, I've been doing surveys for years.  I just never did it, um, where talking really with people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I only did it like the on line surveys or the mail surveys.
L:  I do a thing where you scan your groceries every week when you come in. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you accumulate -- you call it in and it has some kind of voi- or noise code or whatever that it does over the phone.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, and then when you, um, accumulate so many points you can get like free stuff.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Like I got a free high chair for my kid. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  That's good for you.
L:  I mean, you get like good stuff.  It's called like HomeScan.
R:  HomeScan?  
L:  Yeah, I don't know if they have a website 'cause that's not how I --
R:  Oh, yeah I do.
L:  They do?
R:  Mhm.  It's called, um --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- I go to Yahoo.  I go sweepsmaster --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's my E group.  Have you ever heard of it?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, you just go to Yahoo, E groups --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- 'cause it's free to join and -- and my group, um, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it for several years and we're -- we're just all like sweepstakes [NOISE] and free offer
