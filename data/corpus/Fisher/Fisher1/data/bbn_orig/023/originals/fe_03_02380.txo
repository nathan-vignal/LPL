R:  Hi, my name is Marina.  I am from LA and I think we're going to have a chat now.
L:  Hi, my name is Chris.  I'm from Pittsville, Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  So, let's talk about personal habits.
L:  [LAUGH] I was hoping I'd get a girl. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know, which one do you think is worse?
R:  Um, actually I think pretty much smoking is the worst one.
L:  I smoke, so, and I don't drink, so I think drinking is the worst, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How come you think, ah, sm- ah, smoking is not as bad as drinking?
L:  It -- ah, smoking doesn't alter your, you know, how you act and everything else, so ...
R:  Oh, you mean your, like, mental stability?
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't impair your -- you or make you act stupid or anything else. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Don't you think it depends on how much somebody drinks, like, if somebody, let's say, only has a beer, like, twice a week?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, do you think that's bad too?
L:  Ah, no, no.  See, my problem is I -- my husband drinks too much, so I see a stupid side of him then, when I used to drink I drank too much, so that's why I don't drink any more.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That's why, you know, I'd like to have a beer but you don't know when to stop, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's why my mind is set against that way and that's why I don't drink any more, so ...
R:  What about -- what was the other one, caffeine, right?
L:  Yeah, caffeine.  Oh, I need my coffee in the morning. [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, I don't know, I ah, really like the taste of coffee --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, I don't know, I was told that it causes [MN] oh, it's bad -- really bad for your skin.
L:  Oh yeah, I didn't hear that.  No, I didn't hear that one.
R:  You've never heard of that one?
L:  Oh, smoking is bad for your skin though.
R:  No, um, so, first I switched over to decaff, but then, um, my [LAUGH] my doctor told me that, I don't know, it's -- it's also not good, because there's something in the coffee that -- that's kind of bad for your skin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] so I switched over to soy milk and I really miss my coffee. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, I -- I wouldn't be able to function all day without my coffee. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  Like, you have to have at least one cup to get my -- my head out of -- out of sleeping.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I still have one in the morning but that's it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I used to go to Starbucks, like, two or three times a day and get coffee --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- hm, not any more. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I usually stop at two because then after that I get really jumpy and it's just doing the opposite for me, so ...
R:  Do they have Starbucks in Pennsylvania?
L:  Ah, n- actually I don't know of any.  There might be some down toward the bigger cities, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I live in a smaller town and we -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- the best thing we have is Dunkin' Donuts. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Yeah, that's about all we have.
R:  And do -- usually when you, um, when you have, like, your coffee, do you buy it or do you make it at home?
L:  Um, it depends, ah, now if I can get it from Dunkin' Donuts, maybe once or twice a week I'll do it, but usually I'll just have it at home in the morning.
R:  Okay, but only in the morning?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, that's not bad then.
L:  Yeah, I know if -- if I -- I usually get up early so my cut off point is, like, noon and then it's like, okay if I didn't have it by then [inaudible] it just doesn't taste right in the afternoon, to me.  I can't drink it with meals either. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know, I'm strange that way. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, no, most people are.  But, um, I think maybe, um, what was the other one they were talking about?  Not exercising?
L:  Exercising and -- there was one more.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I can't remember any either.
L:  I don't exercise either, [LAUGH] so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, not me.
R:  No?
L:  No.
R:  I don't know, I'm lazy too but then I started um, ballet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I -- um, dancing in a ballet -- I'm actually still dancing in a ballet company --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'm kind of like, forced to exercise a couple of hours a day. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's not too bad when you actually like it but for me to go to a gym --
R:  Yes, I felt the same because --
L:  It's like a big -- yeah.  Make myself go.  I can't do that [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's the same thing, because before I was doing ballet and I wanted to just exercise for the sake of exercise, I couldn't do it.  I hated it.  It was so boring.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's probably how you feel, right?
L:  Yeah, I always thought about, maybe I'll go out and run a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, right [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I went, no, I don't think so.  Too cold out. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's probably cold.
L:  It's too hot.  I always have a reason why --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] So --
L:  I actually bought the Tai Bo tapes too, but I gave them to my daughter.  I didn't even try it once, so ...
R:  Wh- what did you say?  What were you trying?
L:  Those Tai Bo tapes that they have out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I actually bought a set of them.
R:  Oh.
L:  I think there was five in the set and never -- I never even watched them.  I gave them to my daughter.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She got use out of them, but I -- I never even seen five minutes of it, so ...
R:  So, is -- what would you say is like, the um, main personal habit you have y- you would like to work on or give it up?  Is there any of them?
L:  Ah, smoking, definitely.
R:  Smoking?
L:  Yeah, because I've been smoking since I was twelve years old.
R:  Argh.
L:  And I'm thirty four.
R:  Oh, that's a long time! [LAUGH] 
L:  I know you start out when you're a little kid and then you just keep the habit and now you can't kick it and you try to slow down and you just can't.  I think the more you watch what you're smoking the more you're smoking.
R:  You think so?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I started smoking early, when I was thirteen and I stopped it when I was eighteen.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.  And it was --
L:  How did you do it?
R:  Um, I started, like, I was smoking, like, anywhere some- sometimes I was only smoking, like, two or three cigarettes a day, but there were times wh- where I would smoke a pack.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, I started coughing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it wouldn't go away.  It wasn't a cold, so I was, like, no, I have to stop, and I just all of a sudden, I um, totally stopped, and now I have a cigarette, like, I don't know, once a week or so when I go out or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's it.  I just stopped al-
L:  I wish I could do that. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah, I was really surprised because most people say they have really a problem getting out of the habit and they have -- you know, they try all kinds of stuff, but for me, I just quit.
L:  Yeah.  I was -- I tried one of those pills but I got sick from it.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I don't think it worked, so I was going to try the patch but they said that if you even, like, sneak, even a drag from it when you're on the patch, you get really sick, because that's, like well that's scaring me because I don't know if I c- could actually stay away.  I don't want to end up in hospital, so that's [inaudible] right there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And, um, wa- was -- what was the other one, was it food, or something?
L:  I th- I just can't remember that.  I don't think it was dieting.
R:  No, I don't think it was either.
L:  No.
R:  Then what about caffeine, 'cause, um, it's not only coffee.  What about Coke, do you drink Coke?
L:  Every now and then.
R:  So, occasionally.
L:  Yeah.  I just drink water usually.
R:  Yeah, that's good though.
L:  I don't like to have soda in my house because of my two kids, the little one, she's -- any kind of sugar makes her crazy --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah, so.  She likes water too, actually, so ...
R:  Mhm.  Th- that's good though, because I had a hard time liking water and I kind of like, forced myself to drink it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I actually like you know, diet Sprite or diet coke, I just like it better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But water is definitely better for you.
L:  Yeah.  Actually if I have -- if I have a Coke I have to have it with caffeine in it, because I figure, well the reason I'm drinking it is trying to get a kick, because like I said I don't like --
R:  Really?
L:  I don't like coffee in the afternoon, it's only in the morning, so if I -- if I need a pick-me-up it has to have caffeine in it, so usually --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's about the only time I drink soda.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um ...
L:  I -- I don't -- I can't remember for the life of me what the other one was.  Smoking, drinking --
R:  Let's -- let's go back to the alcohol then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whoops, I dropped the phone, are you still there? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] See, I just noticed when I um, sometimes when I was drinking alcohol, like actually there was times when I was drinking -- are you there?  Are you okay?
L:  Yeah.  There's a little kid jumping on my back.
R:  I'm just going to keep talking for the -- you know, for the machine, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, there was times when I would drink, like, three times a week or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I would have, like, two or three drinks but I just felt [NOISE] -- hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I just felt that, um, my energy the next day, was like, lacking, like, I would sleep like, ten hours instead of seven and I'd f- feel a little tired --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I just sort of let go of it.
L:  The drinking?  Yeah, so -- so did I, after -- just, if I go out the next day I would feel so horrible I couldn't even do anything.
R:  Oh yeah?  It was that bad?
L:  Well, you couldn't function, I know when I drank, I smoked more, even, it was, oh my God, I can't even breath, and--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, so, you just couldn't wake up the next day after you drank.
R:  Yeah.  I notice that too, that it -- it just took away from, you know, the next day too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I was like, no, I need to -- and then my friend told me that, um, it just makes you um, age faster.
L:  Yeah, I heard that too.  Yeah, I heard that too.
R:  Yeah, that's what she said too an- that, you know, it would like, not necessarily and so I was like, no I don't want to [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but I still have a like, a crave for it, I like, still sometimes when I go out, I feel like I want to have a drink, so I still like it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just don't, you know --
L:  I don't think it's too bad if you can do it in moderation, but I just -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I -- I never actually -- once I started having a drink I'd keep going and keep going and then I'd be drunk, and it's like, oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But one day I just -- just stopped drinking.  That, apparently is hard to do[?], but I got to smoking hard though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think smoking is harder to do than drinking.  But see, drinking if -- if you, I mean, smoking is -- is -- is only long term dangerous for your body  but it's not.
