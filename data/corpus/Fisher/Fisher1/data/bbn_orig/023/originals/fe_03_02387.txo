R:  Melissa.
L:  Ah, this is Linda.  H- Have you done this before?
R:  Yeah, I have.  Have you?
L:  No, this is my very first time.
R:  Okay, I've only done it one other time.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's not that bad.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, anyways, ah, we have to, ah, I guess, give our personal view of what we think is worse of the options that they gave.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, do you wanna go first, or do want me to go --
L:  No, you can go first.
R:  Me?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, well in -- in all honesty I think alcohol consumption is worse.
L:  Ra.
R:  Because, um, you know, smoking, in my opinion, has its detriments on other people, as well as the person that's smoking, um, but, and, you know, over eating, in my opinion, um , somebody who over eats, that's something that's within themselves, that, you know, they can control, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and in my opinion, somebody who is an excessive eater and just continually eats, um, and then gets upset because when they go out in public, if, you know, they're extremely overweight, or, you know, like, a young la- you know, if a woman goes to a McDonalds and orders, like, you know, four Big Mac meals, that's a little excessive and I -- and, you know, to be totally honest, if I saw a woman do that, or even a man do that, I would be like, whoa!  That's just, like, a little too much!  Um, and then, what was the other one?  I --
L:  See, there was smoking, alcohol, over eating and gossiping.
R:  Yeah, well, gossiping -- I'm the type of person you know, where, if somebody doesn't like who I am, then they don't need to be involved in my life, and ah, if you wish to gossip about me, that's, you know, all good, I'm not going to let it affect me or bother me and, you know, anybody who, you know, [several inaudible words] talk about me, I guess, in like, a insincere way and insulting, you know, I -- I wouldn't want them to be a part of my life anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean, there are people out there who have a real problem with how people think of them an -- and they base their lives on, you know, what people think of them.  I'm just not, you know, one of those people, so gossiping, to me, is like, nothing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm nosey!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and I like to, you know, hear the gossip and everything like that, but then, you know, when somebody -- if a neighbor of mine comes to me and tells me, you know, oh, by the way, you know, the guy across the street, you know, got caught doing something or whatever, I don't go and spread the word.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so, I'm like, the type of gossiper who takes in the information but I don't put it back out there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Well then you're not a gossiper you're just a gossipee.
R:  I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I'm like, you know, the -- the other end of -- of the gossiping team.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then alcohol -- I have a heard time with, because both myself and my spouse came from alcoholic families, um, my husband more so severely than myself, but um, you know, what, you know, what happens, you know, with me it ended up happening, where, you know, I had absolutely no relationship, ah, with my dad, who was the person who abused alcohol.  So whereas smoking, you know, the person, you know, that you're involved or people in your life, or whatever, you know, can pretty much say to you, "Listen, if you're going to smoke, go outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, or don't do it around me", you know, and that's, you know, great.  When I was a kid, and I started smoking, you know, my mom said to me, "Listen, you're not going to be smoking in -- in the house or anywhere near me until you're at least fifteen", you know, "and if I ever catch you smoking then there's going to be a problem".  So I respected that, you know, she really didn't have much right telling me that I couldn't smoke, 'cause both her and my dad did smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but like, you know, my husband, he doesn't smoke.  He doesn't like the fact that I smoke, but when I met him, I smoked, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he didn't ha- you know, he may have had a problem then but he didn't voice it and, you know, for about -- when I got pregnant with our daughter, he tried very hard to get me to quit, to the point where I was like, all right, I quit, you know, and I hid it.  And then I got caught, and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now he's just at a point where, forget it, I'm not going to, you know, I'm not even going to bother --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, with it, but with alcohol, you know, and -- and, you know, you can smoke a cigarette and its not like you're gonna -- if you get into a car, the -- the effects of smoking a cigarette aren't going to impair you, per se, um, in -- in a short, you know --
L:  No, not at that moment.
R:  in a -- in a sh- right, you know.  Whereas, like, you know, I've -- I've seen it hundreds of times, you know, with alcohol, you know, I mean, I -- I drink, not that often, it's very seldom like, maybe once a year, you know, around New Year's Eve, Christmas time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, or, you know, my husband and I go out to dinner, you know, and it's a place that serves alcohol, because wh -- where I live a lot of places don't even serve it --
L:  Where do you live?
R:  New Jersey.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, you know, I'll get a drink and that drink will still be, like, half full by the time I get done with my meal and we're getting ready to go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  So, what's your take on it?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I guess, um, my first thought was, many of those things, it depends on the degree, and so I imagine that they really meant, um, that you're doing all those things excessively and which one would be the worst if you were doing them excessively, and I -- I guess I'd have to go along with the alcohol also.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's amazing how many of us are from, ah, some sort of alcoholic background somewhere.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And um, you can see how that just, um, just --
R:  Hello?
L:  -- [inaudible] hello.  Call waiting.
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, it can just destroy -- destroy the entire family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, while smoking is, I think, is, and I -- and I keep trying to quit, I've quit about five times --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] and ah, I've quit for, like, a year and a half --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um --
R:  What made you go back?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  Nothing.  You know, a couple of times there was something big but a couple of times there was nothing.  It was just --
R:  Because I've only, you know, I've been smoking now for probably about fourteen, thirteen or fourteen years and I really -- other than in situations where I had to quit and I had no other choice but to, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I only voluntarily quit one time and that was when I was pregnant with my son and I stopped smoking when I was three months pregnant with him and then I didn't resume smoking until probably after he was about two weeks old and I resumed smoking because he was very colicky, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then it -- it's weird, because I've been in -- in ah, situations where I've had no other choice, I -- I didn't, you know, smoking wasn't an option --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me, it just, it wasn't allowed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know in the situations where I was at, and, you know, mentally, I -- I'm one of those types of people when I'm ready to quit smoking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'll just say, all right, that's it, I'm done.  You know --
L:  Yeah.  And I think that -- that -- that's true of -- you can't quit for anybody else, you can't quit because somebody else wants you to, it's just something that's got to click.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's what's happened to me before, I just, this is it.  I've had enough, I'm quitting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, and I would, and -- and it's hard every single time, um, but there is -- there is just something that clicks within you that makes you want to quit, for, you know, for some reason, you -- you [several inaudible words] um, you know, the health ramifications, or ah, the smell, or um, the cost, or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I can't seem to stay away from them altogether, so -- and both -- both my children smoke, and see, and that -- that, after all, like, I'm responsible for that, um, and because I really think it's a terrible, terrible habit, I am absolutely convinced it's, ah, one of the worst things you can do for your health.
R:  Right.
L:  But again, ah, I don't think it destroys your life and the people in your life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like ah -- like alcohol can do.  Now, if you just drink a couple of drinks a day, I don't really have a problem with that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I think so often that people, for some reason can't hold it to that.
R:  Yeah, no.  Like, I -- I don't -- I don't have a problem with people drinking, I, you know, I really don't.  I have a problem with people drinking and then their attitude changes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they drink, you know.
L:  Well some people's who personality changes.
R:  Right, right.  I mean, like, I will be the first to say, like, you know, I mean, you know, when I was in high school I did my share of partying, you know, and all that, you know, all that stuff and you know, unfortunately I -- I came from a big family and none of my siblings, you know, I guess, ever got caught as -- as often as I did drinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so my mom was one of those women who was in complete and total denial, you know, about what was going on with -- with my dad, but was like, wait a minute, you know, here, you know, Melissa's getting, you know, busted drinking constantly, continuously, she's the one who's going to have the problem, so they ended up sending me to a rehab, you know, for just the normal reasons that like, you know, any teenager just goes out and party's, you know, just to have a good time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just just, you know, I was, you know, the oddball in the family and just really didn't care if people knew I was drinking, you know, but I mean, now, you know, like I said, I -- I rarely drink.  My, you know, my dad ended up dying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, this -- this February of this year from, you know, cirrhosis of the liver --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so, I know what it can do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know and like --
L:  Well, you know, not only can it kill you though, it can destroy so much of the quality of life while you're alive.  That -- that's the part that, to me is almost even worse.
R:  Right, you know, and -- and it's like, you know, it's weird because, you know, my, you know, watching, my you know, my dad went through the rehab, you know, all that other stuff and, you know, you know, you -- you do that family intervention thing where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know i-
