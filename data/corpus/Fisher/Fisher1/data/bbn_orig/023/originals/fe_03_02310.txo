L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Terry.
R:  My name is Brenda.
L:  Hi, Brenda.  How are you today?
R:  I'm fine and you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.  Um, did -- did they say that [LAUGH] I'm like maybe I was hearing wrong.  If you go to the doctor within seven -- if you don't go to the doctor your cold lasts seven days and only a week if you do.  Is that what they said?
L:  What they want you to do is I guess talk about what you do -- personally do when the change of seasons and -- if when you begin to feel you're ill.
R:  Right, right, I understand --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that but I'm like, I know they [LAUGH] didn't say -- okay [LAUGH] I'm on drugs [LAUGH].  Um, I go -- um, I dunno, um --
L:  I personally don't get sick from the change of the seasons --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- other than specific illnesses like when there's a high count of pollen and I'm -- my sinuses may act up.
R:  Right.
L:  But then I know it's my sinuses so therefore I usually take over the counter drugs.
R:  Right.
L:  So, as far as --  I know some people catch colds when it changes from you know summer to fall or fall to winter, winter to spring or, they seem to -- I don't know [SIGH].
R:  Mm, right, and I are the same way.  I have -- I suffer from a lot of allergies and stuff so you know I al- -- you know, when there's a high pollen count like you said, um, you know, I'll start to, you know, sneeze and everyone thinks, "No I'm not sick", you know, its just, you know, allergies, you know.  [SIGH] But I don't tend to get sick like a lot of other people do, you know, that the regular illnesses, the -- the seasonal colds that you know people seem to catch [LAUGH] every few months, I'm like I -- I'm feeling fine I know, you know.
L:  I think that people sometimes get colds mainly because of -- well, colds are transferred by not washing hands and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things like that and I'm one of those people that [MN] tries to keep my hands -- if I know I'm gonna be in a public place and gonna be touching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like all the elevator doors or lots of doors or things like that then I'm -- try to  make sure -- remind myself not to do -- put my hand near my face until I have a chance to wash them.
R:  Right.  I carry around the hand sanitizers.  Yeah.
L:  Well, hand sanitizers they say can work to a certain extent but they don't work as --
R:  Well, as they as -- oh --
L:  -- well as they should.  Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah, mhm.
L:  But you're probably better off keeping the -- like the little -- little wipies[?] --
R:  Yeah, I have some of those too.
L:  -- 'cause they work better.
R:  Mhm, yeah I carry those around too.
L:  But as far as going to the doctor it depends upon -- it -- I think what they're looking for is how often when you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do have an onset of an illness do you go to the doctor --
R:  Okay, so right away, yeah.
L:  -- right away, or do you wait a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to see if you get better before you go --
R:  Mhm, right --
L:  [LAUGH] to the doctor.
R:  Right, well --
L:  Well, I think to me it depends upon exactly what's wrong. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, you know, 'cause going to the doctor, you know, they're gonna tell you take a couple of aspirins, stay in bed, drink this and you know.
L:  Well, I think it depends upon what you're feeling, what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the illness is.  I mean if I have, um, oh, I dunno.  Trying to think of a specific thing that would make me go to the doctor.  Let's say if I thought I sprained my ankle, or my hand, or --
R:  Oh, oh yeah.
L:  -- my arm then I probably go to the doctor right away because I know that I'm getting a brace or an x-ray to make sure it's not broken, is probably the best --
R:  You see that's not an illness.  That's an injury --
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  -- and that's different.  You know, um, and I would hope most people [LAUGH] --
L:  Um, but, um, when I have come down with cold then [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]  I know --
L:  It's probably if -- er -- uh -- I do probably wait a week before I go to the doctor, in -- it --'cause I know th- -- 'cause I feel it's probably a cold and the cold -- over the counter medications help then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --  I prefer you doing that rather than going to a doctor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I have to go to the doctor get my blood checked on a regular basis anyway so --
R:  Mhm, right.  Yeah, um, I tend to go, um -- I'll only go if instead of getting better it starts to get worse, you know, and usually if the week wears on it usually starts getting better.  If it starts getting worse it means I have some kind of other infection.  It's not just a regular cold.  It's --
L:  The only time that I would go to the doctor right away is if my temperature got over two -- over a hundred and two.
R:  Well, yeah, you see I would have to go right -- right about -- probably before then anyway because my temperature's little bit more than normal anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, when I [SIGH] -- when it hits like a hundred, hundred and one you know it's like I'm -- I'm usually down for the count anyway, so --
L:  But nowadays with like the SARS thing.  I would probably -- as soon as I hit a hundred I probably go just to make sure that it -- that wasn't an issue.
R:  Right, right, so, so --  well and then, um, what part of the country do you live in?
L:  I live on the East Coast.
R:  Okay, West Coast, okay, so California. [LAUGH]
L:  I live in Maryland right outside of DC.
R:  Okay, oh so I guess, I guess the coast don't really matter.  I -- I think it's just how the person takes care of themselves, you know.  Um, I drink a lot of fluids.  I drink lots of juice.  I drink lots of water.
L:  I don't drink as much juice.  I do drink a lot of water and I do drink a lot of tea so, um, I always have something, and I'm drinking all day long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's normally either hot tea or iced tea or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- water, and then its usually unsweetened tea.  It's not sweetened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I drink juice once in a while but I'm just not one of those people that go out and buy juice to drink juice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Usually the time I drink juice or something like that is what usually, you know, when I'm out for breakfast or something like that.
R:  Right, right, yeah.  Well, I -- I drink juices, you know, I try to get, you know, the one hundred percent juices because I don't like a lot of the fruits, you know, to -- to bite into some of the fruits and, you know, bananas, apples, [MN] strawberries, um, you know [LAUGH] living in Calif- --
L:  Yeah, I love fruit but I also like -- I also take, um, multi vitamins so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I get my vitamins that way rather than -- rather than, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drinking the fluids or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, but I eat -- eat a pretty good variety of, um, vegetables and things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like that anyway --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- so --
R:  Vegetables are another story.  I eat meat.  You either have no vegetables but, uh,  but I don't hate vitamins.  I -- I -- every time I try to take vitamins, you know  -- you know they say you should try for a couple of weeks, you know, to get your body acclimated but even then, you know, I just, I -- I seem to get more groggy or tired or something so I -- I --
L:  Maybe the type of vitamin that you're taking --
R:  Well, I try dif- --
L:  -- is, um, trying to get it out of your system.  You might, believe it or not, you might wanna try just taking a child's chewable.
R:  Mm, mm, never thought of that, yeah.
L:  Because sometimes that it is -- it -- it -- they -- they dissolve a little bit quicker.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And they're mor- and even just that little -- even if you don't take the full amount, even if you only taking lets say sixty percent requirement or fifty percent requirement of your daily doses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it still helps.
R:  Right, right.  Mhm, yeah, I just, every time you know I just always switch up and I take, um, like, you know what -- and then I go, you know, then I go for my check ups 'cause, you know, after you get a certain age, you know, you should go [LAUGH] and I go and get blood work done yearly and, you know, I'm fine, you know. [LAUGH] My -- all my blood levels and, you know, protein, um, iron and all that is where they're supposed to be for someone my age, and so I'm like, "Well, I guess I don't need vitamins [LAUGH] anyway".  Somewhere I'm getting what I need, you know, but, um --
L:  Right.  How old are you?
R:  Forty three.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Why?
L:  Ah, I'm fifty.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, because I've been talking to so younger kids, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I feel better now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh dear.
L:  I was gonna say you're making me -- you make -- you make yourself sound so old and I'm thinking, "Well, she can't be any older than I am".
R:  Well no, well because I was talking to like twenty year olds, you know --
L:  Over the last -- last couple of times?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, and I'm like okay, I feel, you know, I feel every one of these grey hairs [LAUGH] now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah -- but yeah, um, so after you know turn forty, you know, well I, even before then I, you know, I'd been getting regular blood check ups, you know, because --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know, being a black woman too, you know, you -- you know, you -- you just have to, you just --
L:  I always have to get blood checks because I have other issues.  I have, um, thyroid problems and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- diabetes so I have those -- those -- those issues.  That's the reason why I probably don't enjoy the juice because of -- of the sweetness and stuff, so --
R:  Oh okay, yeah.  Yeah, diabetes runs in my family and that's when I -- you know, why I make sure I get that tested, you know, yearly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and things.
L:  But I think what they want to talk about is -- is like --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- the getting back to the issues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is how long you know so, but you -- you wait, you wait the week or unless you're -- you reach a certain temperature or something like that.
R:  Well -- well, no I don't wait the week, you know, it, um -- because I'll usually know within a couple of days, you know, which way its going --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and usually if its not cleared up in a couple of days then something else is wrong, and I need to get myself [LAUGH] to the doctor so -- because the one time I waited -- gosh I waited, it was when one of those flus was going around.  I was like the last person to get it, and [SIGH] I waited almost two weeks or something and ...
