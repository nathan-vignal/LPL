L:  Hi, it's Rod.  [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  [NOISE] This is Rod.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Good.  Um, I -- I didn't understand the question that they asked.  What -- what was it?  Which is what?
R:  [PAUSE] I don't understand.
L:  [NOISE] Well, there was a -- there was a question and then a list of things that we're supposed to choose from and I didn't -- I didn't understand that.
R:  Oh, I think it was, um, like habits, like w- -- like what annoys -- something about habits. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  Things that like, um, [LIPSMACK] like -- I don't even remember [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, and -- and we're supposed to discuss? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think it -- I -- I -- I remember, like, one of the things was like something that you'd find annoying about other people.
L:  Right.  Like there was overeating --
R:  Smoking.
L:  -- um, smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, doing drugs, [NOISE] um, I don't know.  A lot of those things are just like things that are -- they affect them mostly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And upsets -- you know, fine with me if somebody wants to overeat or do drugs, just don't let it bother me. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Don't make me do it. [MN]  Yeah, [MN] huh.  [NOISE] I don't know.  What else was on that list?
R:  Um, [MN] [PAUSE] I think [MN] --
L:  They should say it again.
R:  Yeah, they should.
L:  [LAUGH] Anybody there?
R:  I think it --
L:  Can you read what's on the list?  Huh.
R:  I definitely remember, like, the smoking one, the drinking, like, overeating.  Those are --
L:  Well --
R:  Those are like the only three that I can remember [LAUGH].
L:  Some people are -- some people can -- can, like, drink too much and it's okay [NOISE] and other people can't.
R:  Definitely.  I think [MN] like certain people can just be overly annoying if they drink too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or other people that if they drink then they have a personality.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] yeah, all of a sudden.  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some people think that you're your real self when you've been drinking.
R:  Yeah, but then when you find --
L: [inaudible].
R:  -- out the next day how much of an ass you made of yourself [LAUGH].
L:  What was that?
R:  Then you h- -- then you hear the people that the next day think that they've made such an ass of their self.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, or can't even remember.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Right.
R:  Or there's photos to prove.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, hm.  Right, um --
R:  So, I don't --
L:  -- what else were they talking about?  [NOISE] People who eat too much, [NOISE] drink too much, do too much drugs.  I don't know.  I really don't have any other problems with people aside -- aside from that [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Uninteresting people, people who blather on about, like, nothing.
R:  People that blabber about nothing?
L:  Yeah.  People who have dull jobs. [MN]
R:  People who have dull jobs.  Well, I guess it de- it depends on the person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause like, [MN] you know, people that sit in front of a computer all day could be pre- pretty dull --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, you know --
L:  Right, and then they, you know, and then on the weekend they're cliff diving or whatever.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah, that's what I don't like.  It's -- okay, here's something I don't like.  People who do scary things just because they're scary.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they think they're so hot.  [NOISE] But, um, if they do it 'cause it's fun I -- I can respect that, but if they do it because they think people are impressed then that's not. [NOISE]
R:  But do you think you'd ever find out about it?
L:  What's that?
R:  Do you think you would find out about it?  How- -- I mean, do you think people just say, you know, like, "Oh, I went bungee jumping because everybody else did"?
L:  Oh, well.
R:  I don't think that they would necessarily admit it.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it's -- you mean that they do it because they think people would be impressed?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  Well, um, yeah, that's true.  They're just hoping people will do -- will be impressed.  But I can see doing some of that stuff just for the fun of it.  You know, bouncing up and down on a rubber band.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or jumping out of a plane.
R:  That's true.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's fun.  It's like flying.  [NOISE] Well, I wonder if we're discussing anything that [NOISE] we're supposed to be discussing? [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea.  They -- they should, like, remind you --
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  -- of the question.
L:  Yeah, huh, [NOISE] well.  And then after eight minutes they're going to interrupt us?
R:  I think so.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, well.
R:  I guess something else that annoys me would be like dri- people that don't know how to drive.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's probably on that list.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  Like stupid people.
L:  Stupid --
R:  Like, that nothing annoys me.  That- that's probably, you know, I don't mind people that smoke, I mean, that doesn't bother me.  But people that don't know how to drive, they should just be, like, eliminated from the --
L:  [LAUGH] There should be a law.
R:  -- driving population. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah, there should be, um -- well, my dad used to -- whenever we'd, ah, drive past like a -- a -- an overpass that was under construction he'd say that was for stupid people.  They would -- they would just leave it like that and then dumb people would -- would, uh, just d- drive off into the, you know, into the bay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah, there should be something like that where, uh, like a place that [NOISE] no sign points to so that only stupid people who aren't following signs end up there and it just crunches your car up into little pieces.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That'd be great.  And it -- people who, um, people who, ah, try to be courteous and, I mean, I don't mind courteous people but they -- they give you the right of w- -- try to give you the right of way when it's really theirs and that just wastes people's time 'cause I just want them to follow the rules and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just [NOISE] go when they're supposed to go and then I can go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- instead of them being nice. [NOISE]
R:  Like at a four way stop?
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, 'cause then you waste, like, a minute at least.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, go, go, no you go, no you go.
L:  Yeah, right.  Oh, [NOISE] and people who honk too early at lights.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like as soon as it turns green they're honking behind you.
R:  Yeah, I'm probably guilty of that.
L:  You know, and you're a- -- oh, you do that? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause people should be paying attention.
L:  Well, a- but -- but there's -- there's a -- such a thing as too early, you know, honking too early, like as soon as it turns green and you're, like, five cars back and you're, you know.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, and sometimes there's pedestrians in there, that kind of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Where do you live?
R:  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, outside of Philly.
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  What about you?
L:  Uh, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so I don't actually drive.  But, um, I mean, I -- I used to when I lived in DC but I don't -- [MN] I drive anymore.  I just, uh -- oh, you know what?  You know what else annoys me, speaking of getting around but not driving?  Is, um, people who stand on the left side of, um, escalators and moving sidewalks.  That drives me insane because it clearly, you know, you're supposed to walk on the left and stand on the right.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] And people who don't even have anybody else with them or whatever.  [NOISE] They just stand on the left.
R:  See, I cou- -- I think I've only encountered that, like, in airports and stuff.  Or in Europe, they're all over Europe though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  People that do that.
L:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.  There's too many smokers in Europe too.
R:  [PAUSE] Well, in New York they d- -- you can't smoke in any of the bars anymore in New York, right?
L:  Right, yep.  Which is -- it's good in a way.  But, I mean, I don't smoke so I -- I kind of -- it's nicer for people like me but I think there should be a place where people can go and smoke if they want to.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Sure.
R:  Well, see here in Philadelphia they -- you can do whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, [MN] the way -- the way it went in California when they -- when they outlawed smoking in bars is, like, everybody did it for a little while and then people would start to smoke after a while, then certain bars have a reputation as places where you can go and smoke.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Um, and they're much smokier than they used to be -- [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  -- because those were [NOISE] places where you can smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is fine and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, because if you don't like smoke then you just don't go to those places and you go to the other places.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  You know.
R:  [NOISE] But there has to be something for, like, say you just want to go get a drink or whatever and then you reek like cigarettes.
L:  Yeah, that's true, 'specially if you have a sweater on.
R:  Yeah, or if you're, like, a girl with long hair --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then it's, like, you reek.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't like that either when you're -- when you, um, you- you're trying to drive home or ride home and your, ah, and your eyes are watering 'cause your clothes are fuming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Um, oh, someone's at the door.  Okay, she's getting it.  Huh.  [NOISE] Yeah, oh, people who try to get into your building who don't live in your building --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and buzz you.  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Strangers?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, or people
