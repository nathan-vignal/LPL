L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Celeste.
L:  Hi, this -- my name's Arthur.  How are you doing today?
R:  Okay.
L:  You know what?  I -- I didn't hear what the topic of the -- of our c- call is supposed to be.
R:  You know, I couldn't get -- I couldn't understand it either.  It had something to do with habits and I heard --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- something about smoking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- alcohol and everything else was mumbled.
L:  Oh, well, I -- oh, jeeze, I was just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- switching phones when the [LAUGH] -- this is my first time calling.  Is it -- is it yours?
R:  It's the first time, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so, we're two rookies.  Well, hopefully they'll be able to, uh, to use our little conversation here nonetheless.
R:  I don't know whether or not they're actually using the topic that we're speaking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or if they're just trying to get speech patterns.
L:  Right.  Well, you have a beautiful way of speaking and, um, so they'll just have to take what they can get.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's very nice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, but, you heard -- I -- I -- y- -- I heard, "Personal habits", but you heard a little bit more.  You think it has, um, do with smoking and alcohol?
R:  Alcohol -- it says, and I -- I wasn't quite sure 'cause it w- -- it came through mumbled.  Something -- I don't know whether or not they were asking which one was worse, or how would you rate these?  Or what it was, you know, like the way they were talking.  The way I would almost figure it; is it smoking is worse than drinking?  Or is drinking worse than smoking?  Or do you hate both of them, or what? So, [LAUGH]
L:  Let's -- let's flow with that.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that -- I could -- I could deal with that.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Where -- where you located, Celeste?
R:  Up State New York.
L:  Uh-huh and I'm, uh, down State New York.
R:  Oh, +where -- where -- where?
L:  I'm in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Brooklyn?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, I -- I've originally come from Long Island.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I, in fact, was drinking last night. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's a good day.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- and now -- and now here in New York City you can't smoke in bars, so, it's a whole nother -- a whole new -- a whole new atmosphere, you know.
R:  See, I don't think that that's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we have a little tiny diner in our town --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, um, everybody goes there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's really, for a non smoker, it is obnoxious to go into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I will not -- I will not go into the place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But people that smoke, they can go there, they can enjoy it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I think that the owner of the facility should have the right to decide whether or not he wants a smoking or non smoking.
L:  And there -- there is no -- there is no law at all in your, uh, in your town, right?
R:  They're trying to en- enact one, but I'm not sure whether or not it was passed or not.
L:  I think it's -- I was -- I'm a -- I'm a form- -- I'm an ex smoker.  Nothing worse than an ex smoker.
R:  That's what I am also.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] congratulations.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How long has it been?
R:  Oh, I'd say pr- close to ten years.
L:  Oh, likewise.  So my anivers- -- my ten year anniversary is coming up this summer as a matter of fact. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's incredible, so ...
R:  It is, but my husband smokes.
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  So, I still get the [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The second hand smoke.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's still -- it's still -- you know, as much as they talk about second hand smoke I -- there's, uh, nothing worse than first hand smoke.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- got -- gotta be the truth.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I would figure, so ...
R:  But I would think that of the two; alcohol or smoking, I would say smoking is the worst.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because not everybody who drinks is an alcoholic who is addicted to alcohol but everybody who smokes is an addict to nicotine.
L:  Well, y- -- I -- I went to, uh, last night when I was drinking, uh, which is not something I do very often, but I went to something last night which was a trip.  I mean, since we're both calling this thing probably because of the money and secondarily for the educational, um, betterment of the world --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, then you probably would've loved this too.  I went to a thing last night, given by the Johnnie Walker -- uh, by the way, I'm just talking as -- as if no one's listening, you know, and no one's, uh --
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, not that I'm gonna be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- indiscreet or anything, but I was, um, I -- I was, um, uh, I aw- -- made aware of, um, Johnnie Walker Black, the -- the Scotch company is hosting various parties in -- in Clubs in Manhattan and around the country in the major cities and -- and you go there -- and I went there last night and I hadn't been to one before and you go there in a -- in a nice Club that I'll probably never be -- go to again, um, uh, just, you know, 'cause it's not in my circle, uh, of an hour's worth of, uh, open bar and, um, hors d'oeuvres passed around and then you sit down to a Scotch tasting.
R:  Oh, that sounds really cool.
L:  Y- yeah, really.  Absolutely.  And they have --
R:  Since I'm -- since I'm a Scotch drinker. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, huh, well unfor- -- are you -- you say, how -- how far up State are you?
R:  You know where Syracuse is?
L:  Syracuse, uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  It's in that area.
L:  Mhm.  And is Rochester there also.
R:  Rochester is about, um, forty five minutes away from us.
L:  Mhm.  So you're -- so you're not even, um, yeah, you pro- -- um, if y- you wanna look at what's -- what's the website is, it's Johnnie Walker RSVP dot com.  You can just check it out if you like, um --
R:  Yeah, I might.
L:  And it's Johnnie -- if you're a drin- -- if you're a Scotch person you probably know it's a an N. -- N.N.I.E. not N.N.Y.
R:  Okay.
L: [COUGH] Uh, but, uh, they -- yeah, they don't they -- I don't -- I think New York City was the only New York City -- New York State City in New York State --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they were doing it in.  But various, you know, major cities around the country.  But what a -- but what a trip it is.  But the reason why I bring that up actually, is in response to what you said and that had to do with, um, people that smoke are addicted to smoking and people that drink are not necessarily so, because I was, w-, um, we met and were chatting with and sitting with and -- with these, uh, people from France and [COUGH] they -- they were abso- -- the three of them -- three young people in their twenties -- they -- each of them were smokers who just smoke either when they drink or only at night time.  One or the other.  They said -- one they said, "I don't drink during the day.  I don't smoke during the day at all" and the other one is, "I only smoke when I'm -- I only smoke when I'm drinking" and the other one said something like, um, "I only smoke when I'm on vacation" or something, so --
R:  I've known a couple of people like that and I tried it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I tried just having -- well, you know, when I stopped smoking and then my husband was continued to smoke.  I -- when we were out I would have one of his cigarettes just when we were having a drink.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Or just when we were here, or just when we were there, but it snowballed with me.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I -- you know, then it was like, well have one every night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have one every time you come home from work.  Have -- so I could never be that type of a smoker.
L:  Nor I, oh, no, absolutely not.  In fact when I quit smoking it was, uh, only the second time in my life that I tried and the other time I only tried for a day, you kn- I -- I made the mistake of trying to quit coffee and cigarettes on the same day and it was like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My head exploded [LAUGH] I think -- but only -- yeah, only that one day and I -- yeah I've been smoking -- do you know what the average age is when people start smoking?
R:  Start?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would probably say about thirteen or fourteen.
L:  Yeah, absolutely right, yeah.  And that's when I started in fact and, um, and I s- and I'm now forty six or so, um, amazingly so.  And, um [LAUGH] I can't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't believe it.  But -- 
R:  It -- it -- it catches up with you, I know.
L:  It does kind -- it gets up there.  Um, and I -- I, you know, I smoked every -- just about every day in my life until, uh, s- you know ten years ago.  Um, but the thing is that -- that once I quit I just knew that I could never smoke another cigarette.
R:  That's it.
L:  And -- and you know it's easier that way.  It's the -- it's like, um, it's absolute.  And in fact I have a little mantra that I used for many years which is, "I will never smoke the first cigarette.  I will never smoke the first cigarette".  And the truth is if you never smoke the first cigarette you'll never be a smoker.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is true.
L:  Yeah, and I probably won't be a heroine addict either for the same reason, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's too expensive.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that is true.
R:  Both habits.  Heroine and cigarettes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I've -- I've tried one and, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And the other's out of the question.
R:  Oh.
L:  But -- but cigarettes is, uh, yeah, I would say that cigarettes is worse than -- than alcohol too though.  Though both can do awful danger- -- awful dangerous things to your -- to your body.
R:  Yeah, but, um, I -- I think most people that are drinking, they're doing so, you know, maybe one drink a night or something -- something very modest --
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, maybe on weekends or something like that, whereas most of smokers I know it's just constantly.  You know, at work they'll run out and they'll, uh, have their cigarettes during their break.
L:  Oh, i- in your workplace there's no smoking allowed?
R:  No smoking at all.
L:  Oh, uh-huh, what kinda workplace is that?
R:  Hospital.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And [LAUGH] I've often said the only reason that smokers get pneumonia --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- is because they have to go outside and smoke.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, a, um, a s- hospital close to me, um, not too far from me is Coney Island Hospital.  They built this glass enclosed structure outside the main -- one of the main e-, uh, entrance areas for people to smoke in.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, do the patients go down there and smoke?
L:  I only saw it once.  I -- I don't think so.  I don't think so at all.  It's -- I think it's for -- I don't know.  You know, I -- I only saw it once, you know --
R:  Because a lot of times some of our patients will actually go in their bathrobes --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- outside --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and you c- -- you're not allowed to smoke in front of the hospital, you have to go -- it's like almost across the street.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Across the circle whatever you wanna call it.
L:  Right.
R:  And they actually go out there because they're not allowed to smoke any place in --
L:  Huh.
