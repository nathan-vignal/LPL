L:  My name is Dave Adams.
R:  I'm Craig Booder.
L:  [MN] Yes, um, you care to start first, or ...?
R:  Well, I guess the topic of the day is -- is illness and how you take care of yourself.
L:  [MN] Right, and changes -- ha- having to do with the change of the seasons.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Um, well, I live in California [LAUGH] so, um, fo- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fortunately I don't have that problem as much as I used to.  Uh, where are you located?
R:  In Wisconsin, so I have quite a bit of change of seasons.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  I used to live in Chicago for eight years so I -- I know -- I know the drill.  I know what it's about.  [MN] And how do you keep yourself well?
R:  Basically all I do is just [MN] take a vitamin a day and try to eat well.  I generally don't get colds or sick too often.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I then -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when I do I ra- very rarely go to the doctor.
L:  Um, do you -- do you attribute that to diet or just, um, good -- good genes or, um, just tak- taking care of yourself, or ...
R:  Well, it's actually probably luck I guess.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:   [MN] I -- pro- probably more luck than anything I guess.  I don't know.  As far as --
L:   [MN]
R:  -- good genes would go my -- my parents weren't exactly in the best of health [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- when they were alive, so I don't know [NOISE] about that but ...
L:   [MN] Right.
R:  [NOISE] Because I -- I smoke too, so it is probably just pure luck.  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that sh- I -- yeah, that -- that sounds pretty lucky. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm thinking back to when there were actually four seasons.  Um, yeah, I -- I guess I didn't have the problem as much as well, um, but when I did, um, you know, I tried to increase my -- my zinc intake, my vitamin C intake, as well as, um, actually I went a while just doing raw garlic which was quite amazing 'cause I never got sick at all [LAUGH] with raw garlic, so ...  But, you know, then again people avoided me like the plague, you know, at that.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can take garlic pills which don't have the same odor I guess but ... [NOISE]
L:  I- I'm sorry?
R:  You can take, like, gar- garlic capsules, I mean, capsules like --
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure if those are as ef- I -- I don't know.  I've read different things.  If they are as effective or not, so I'm not quite sure there.  [MN] Um, I'm trying to think, um, uh, d- the, um, [LIPSMACK] second part of the, uh, question?  Did you -- did you understand all that?
R:  It was about seven days you -- if you go to the doctor after seven days or not, I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Right.  It was some sort of, um, [MN] some sort of phrase or saying. [MN]
R:  'Cause myself generally when I get a cold I just get like over the counter stuff and treat it myself.  I don't -- I don't go to the doctor unless I really absolutely have to.
L:  Sure, sure if -- yeah.  I -- I totally agree.  Um, [MN] I'm definitely more in the mode of treating it yourself, um, you know, I think it's just a h- good habit to -- to get into unless you're, you know, you really feel like your -- your body's telling you to get to the doctor.  But, [MN] you know, other than that I believe, you know, that we could take care of ourselves pretty well as, you know, as well.  [NOISE] And I think vitamin C is -- is a big -- big part of that.  [PAUSE] So, um, yeah, like I said, in California this is not as much of an issue as it was when I was back in Chicago [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, your seasons don't really change all -- too much out there.
L:  No, not -- not really.  I mean, uh, we have a -- we have a winter and it's, um, [MN] basically we get a bit more rain and the skies are very clear and it's quite -- it's quite nice actually, and, um, [MN] getting slightly off topic, um, [MN] it's actually this is kind of a mountainous town an- and the -- the mountains around here can be, you know, quite beautiful and snow --
R:  So you live in --
L:  -- snow capped --
R:  Northern California or ...?
L:  I- I'm sorry?
R:  Do you live in Northern California or ...?
L:  No, in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, Los Angeles. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah, so ...  But back to the -- the topic.  I suppose, uh, one of the big issues is seasonal affective disorder.  A- are you familiar with this?
R:  Y- SAD, yeah, that's where [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know of a lot of people in -- like in this part of the country get it, where its lack of daylight.
L:  Absolutely, yeah.  I think I was, you know, affected by that definitely in -- in Chicago.  And I know Wisconsin's pretty much the same.  [MN] Um, November and December seem to be the worst and now as far as, you know, the question they asked us as far as that goes, that was a little tougher to take, you know, because it wasn't so much, ah, somatic as, you know, something mental that you had to take care of.  Um, and, you know, y- y- you get like sometime four or five days of sunshine a month and you just really have to work at being happy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's kind of tough, you know.  And I know in some of the northern climes, um, Minnesota, Wisconsin, they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, light -- light therapy.  [NOISE] [MN] Are you familiar --
R:  I know [inaudible] that but I've never gone for that, but I think up -- up here more and more -- more after the holidays is when it starts to g- -- is when they talk about it getting worse, because after the holiday rush gets over, too, that's when it more starts attacking people.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  And also it's, you know, it seems like its dark all the time and so it's -- it's not so much your -- your -- your, you know, physiological symptoms as much as your mind that you have to watch so [MN] how do you deal with that?  Do you -- do you have this problem?
R:  I -- I don't think so.  I mean, if I do it's just -- it's -- it's just mild but ...
L:  Okay, I see, yeah.  The winter blues and stuff.  I think what I do is I try to keep busy.  I try to work as much as possible and, you know, if you -- if you're working, you know, eighty hours a week you're not even thinking about that type of stuff.
R:  Well, like I work in retail, so when you work in retail after the holidays it's kind of a -- for the -- the month of January's not too bad.  It's when February comes around 'cause for a while you're -- you're -- you're happy to have, ah, the slow up so to speak.
L:  Right.  You -- you look forward to it? [MN]
R:  Basically, yeah.  You -- you just start enjoying the holidays and they're over with almost because [LAUGH] ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- that must be a tough -- tough thing for you, you know, working retail, that you aren't really -- you're -- you just want the, ah, the holidays to be over, I bet.  Is that true?
R:  Kind of, yeah.  It's -- it cha- it varies from, uh, day to day actually [LAUGH] during the holiday time.
L:  I see.  Sure.  Are -- are you in, um, Milwaukee?
R:  [MN] No, I'm up, way up in the -- in, uh, not quite the sticks but almost, in, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in Northern Wi- Northern Wisconsin, North Central Wisconsin actually.
L:  What's the -- what's --
R:  So [inaudible] Wausau'd be the closest.  Don't know if you've ever heard of Wausau?
L:  Sure.
R:  Or Eau Claire, it's about a hundred miles west of, um, the Twin Cities?
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, that's -- that's pretty country up there.  [MN] Um, I -- I don't -- I'm not sure if we answered the [LAUGH] -- the question about the -- yeah, I think we did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  About the, uh, doctor.  It was some sort of saying, a saying that I hadn't heard of before.
R:  Yeah, well I -- I was reading the thing that -- that I got from -- in the email I tried to print it off but what they -- the topic they gave us to start us out with, well, we don't have to actually stick to it per se.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  They said they gave us -- [inaudible] is they realize the conver- conversation of strangers have goals and whatever and we try to elect these -- conversations suggest- suggesting topics in and whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's just to get a -- get it started and [inaudible].  It's kind of hard to talk ten minutes about being sick but ...
L:  Right.  Right, so it's -- it's not so much to stay on the -- the topic as --
R:  I don't think so.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It- it's to get you started and to see how strangers converse I guess.
L:  Got you.  I see.  I see.
R:  As far as I can tell anyway. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right.  [MN] So -- so, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] I guess going back to the topic [LAUGH] just a little bit.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, wh- what is it -- what kind of retail is it?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is it a, um, like a cloth --
R:  The product line I sell -- I work for Kmart --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I work for K- Kmart.
L:  Oh, I see, okay.  Okay, they're -- they're not closing the shop up there, huh?
R:  No.  We're, ah -- actually it's the K- Kmart out of, um, Medford which is a town I'm sure you've never heard of.
L:  Medford?
R:  It's a small town [inaudible] it's the only game in town actually.
L:  Medford, Wisconsin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it seems like I have actually heard of that town.
R:  Which is sixty miles north, um, west of Wa- Wausau.
L:  Is that where Ge- -- Have you ever heard of the Gerald Washburn?
R:  Washburn?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's -- actually I go on vacation up that way every summer.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Washburn -- Washburn, Bayfield and the Apostle Islands.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  That's really nice up there.  It's really nice up there.
R:  That's tourist country.  To me that's north.  Here is just -- around here it's all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When you get up towards Medford it's more, um, tour- more, um, forest but around here it's a lot of cows [LAUGH].  So I --
L:  It's more what?  More what?
R:  Yeah, I live in dairy land a- around here.
L:  Oh, I see.  I bet -- I bet it's pretty nice.  Are yo- are you a Timber Wolves fan by chance?
R:  No, I don't -- no, I usually don't -- I don't follow as many sports.
L:  Oh, okay.  I- I -- I'm just -- I -- I thought that was kind of topical because I'm sitting here kind of watching that, you know, with the volume off, uh, the -- the play off, the play off game here, so ...  [MN] I'm, ah -- I don't have cable so this is a -- a treat for me to see actually, you know, basketball on regular TV [LAUGH].  But it -- but it is -- it must be pretty over there.  [MN] I think Wisconsin's a very pretty place actually.
R:  [MN] I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Around here -- actually the reason I live here is if -- +I, like, took over my pa- I inherited my parents' house and land.
L:  I see.
R:  That's why I moved back over this way.  I lived in Wausau for -- for twelve years which th- to me that's about the right size town.  Right now I live in rural --
L:  Right.
R:  -- country line, which i- which is fine but ...
L:  [MN] Well, my -- my ex girlfriend's, uh, brothers used -- they both lived in Madison.  She had two brothers that lived there and we used to go up there a lot and that was a good time.
R:  It's just that around here there's no lakes or nothing re- no recreation [inaudible].
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  No, it's mostly -- like I said, its farmland basically.
L:  Oh, I see, yeah.  But, ah, [MN] you know, ah, like I said, I think Wisconsin is a -- a pretty place.  You know, those rolling -- rolling hills and stuff like that.  Is it -- is it like that, rolling hills and barns and stuff like that and cows and ...?
R:  Not around here actually.  Actually, I -- I'm not trying to talk down where I live but around here it's pretty flat.  It's --
L:  Oh, is that right?  Okay.
