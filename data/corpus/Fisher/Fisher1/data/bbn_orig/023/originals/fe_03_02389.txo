R:  Raymond.
L:  Ah, hi, Cathy.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Maryland, and what about yourself?
L:  Oh, I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Hi.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  Same here. [LAUGH] 
R:  N- nice to talk to you, anyway.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  Excessively, any of those, you know, isn't great. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, you know, most, like, the two or three we were given, ah, smoking I think would be -- I don't know if you smoke or not, so I --
L:  No, I don't.  I don't smoke.
R:  But, you know, smoking is the -- would most of- is the most offensive one because a lot of people do it in areas where other people don't -- don't smoke, they don't like smoke --
L:  True.
R:  -- and then there's second hand smoke, they don't realize that smoking is harming their body by -- by them breathing that stuff up and putting all the pollution in the air is hurting the individual who had to absorb that into their lungs even though they don't smoke.
L:  Right, that's true, because you're harming everybody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- besides yourself, with smoking.  If you -- if you drink a lot, you're only harming yourself.
R:  And -- an- something -- another thing I feel about that, you know, [several inaudible words] and they say that when employers -- employ -- employers have people smoking for him, they have l- less -- less time in the office with people who smoke quite a bit out for this and that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or they don't feel well, they more susceptible to diseases and something like that, the colds --
L:  Mhm.  That's true.
R:  -- so, that's why I feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the things they gave us, that's most harmful one, and besides, it's irrit- irritating because I don't smoke and it irritates me, or not my -- not irritates me, irritates my nose when someone else is smoking and -- and if you're eating round it, it makes my food taste like smoke and that --
L:  Right.  Yeah --
R:  -- and that --
L:  I didn't think of it before until you said it, like, the other things are just harming that person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but smoking is harming everybody.
R:  Well, I mean, you could say alcohol affects people, I mean, not to the point where, yes, it hurts the individual, but I -- I would like, hate to get off onto another subject --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but alcohol, also, you know, t- to the person that -- that drinks it or something it to the liv- -- cirrhosis of the liver and stuff like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's hurting them, but you know, that's only individuals --
L:  Right.
L:  -- it's not -- there are no fumes getting off anybody or nothing like that.  But when it gets to the point where alcohol -- a person drinking alcohol gets behind a wheel, now --
L:  That -- that's bad.
R:  -- it becomes not only dangerous --
L:  -- right, only they abuse, or they abuse other people when they're drunk, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah [several inaudible words] like, there's a lot of domestic problem because of alcohol, I don't know, I used to -- I just [inaudible] it, I would never, ever drink or nothing like that, but some people, when then get, ah, when they touch drink or something, they just very d- d- you know, some -- and then some people, they get all masculine, oh I can do this, I can do that, or something, or --
L:  They get violent.
R:  -- even females, like, they get all, I can do this, you can't tell me nothing, so that's -- when they get to that point when they start inflicting harm on somebody else or killing other people when they get behind a wheel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of a car or something, that's dangerous too.
L:  Right.  That would be about the second thing.
R:  Yeah.  But you know, the irritating -- the cigarettes, I mean, yeah -- people -- you can't stop people from drinking, 'cause peo- 'cause remember we had prohibition one time try and stop people from drinking --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Then they -- because they didn't do it, but smoking is something that if you're going to do it, go outside in an area where --
L:  --away from everybody else --
R:  -- where only other people that smoke like to do it --
L:  -- right, be considerate of other people.
R:  Yeah, when they had that [several inaudible words] with evils of smoking and restaurants stuff like that, you see everybody get offended --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but nobody tell me, I like to have a cigarette when I get -- after I get fin- eating or something like that --
L:  Or they go outside.
R:  -- but what about the people who's eating there and don't like to have a cigarette?
L:  That's right.  But, ah, yeah, I think cigarette smoking, I guess if -- you know, like, we had to explain, it does hurt everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Alcohol second, because that can hurt people --
R:  Because it's harmful r- r- --
L:  -- right.  But exercise, you're only hurting yourself if you don't exercise.
R:  Right.
L:  So that would be bo- at the bottom of the list, really.
R:  Yeah, yeah, they want to categorize it, like, you know, but people -- but eating excessively and everything and just sitting round doing nothing, yeah, that -- if they want to categorize it, there's nothing like smoking, I feel, the most offensive and --
L:  That should be at the top, right.
R:  -- and it can be harm- it can be harmful to other people who have to inhale second hand smoke, then there's drinking where people get violent or get behind a wheel --
L:  Right, that would be second.  Yeah, that would be the second thing.
R:  But [inaudible] like, when they go to the bottom of the list, like you say, ah, eating and stuff like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because --
L:  Yeah, because you --
R:  -- that's hurting you.  It's not hurting anybody else.
L:  No.  Just you, right.
R:  I mean it makes people have low esteem or something because they say, oh, I can't lose weight, but no, you can't lose weight because you don't want to.
L:  That's right.  I just lost twenty seven pounds. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I got a little weight and I'm walking and running every day now and try and get back down to my, where my playing weight, when I used to play ball --
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  It's harder when you're older.
R:  Yes it is.
L:  But you gotta stick to it, that's all and that's something that you, you know, that you have to be able to do yourself so, like you say, it's -- you're only hurting yourself if you don't do it.
R:  Yeah, it's like -- that's why -- that's why I listed smoking as number one, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you don't have to.  I mean, you're hurting yourself, that's -- that's ah, by surveys and by what the doctors and everybody says --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- all the different chemicals in cigarettes, yes you're hurting yourself but you're hurting everybody else when they have to breathe your second hand smoke.
L:  And they've proven that and people still don't, you know, they still don't care.
R:  Yeah, and what bothers me is all the young kids now, here I mean, one time smoking used to be the thing to do because --
L:  That was the bad thing -- that was --
R:  -- everybody did it, but -- but they wouldn't know -- they wouldn't know -- survey out saying smoking hurts, now they got all these --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the kids, "Oh, we gotta die of something --
L:  -- and they still start.  It doesn't make sense, it really doesn't.
R:  "-- well you got to die of something".  I hate that, "You got to die of something".  If I want to die of anything, I want to die of old age.
L:  [LAUGH] right. [LAUGH] Sure do.  But, yeah, it -- it amazes me with the price of cigarettes alone --
R:  Oh, don't y- don't even go there!
L:  If I -- if I ever smoked at all, which I never did, it -- the price would make me stop.
R:  I remember when, ah, I used to work at Seven Eleven when I was coming up -- when I worked through high school during the summer, and I remember when the cigarettes went from a quarter to fifty cents a pack --
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  -- I said, "God, if I ever smoke", I said, "That'd be one reason to stop".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And now it's over five dollars a pack! --
L:  Oh, I know!  I see the signs --
R:  I said, "You must be out of your mind!"
L:  -- like forty dollars a carton for cigarettes and I think, you've got to be kidding.  People that smoke a couple of packs a day, I mean, you go to work just to smoke!
R:  [LAUGH] you got to work two jobs just to support your habit of smoking.
L:  Mhm.  It's rid- and plus you're killing yourself.
R:  And then, if you drink, oh now you got to support yourself drinking --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- support yourself smoking, and I say, God --
L:  -- and you're going to die.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah, I don't understand people, just like, you know, with the drugs and everything these kids, they hear everything that's going on and they still try them.
R:  You know, but you know, they say more education, more education, but I don't bel- I don't buy that because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we have a lot of education that's here now and people going to do what they want to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just -- and a lot of stuff is peer pressure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like smoking and drinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's peer pressure because they -- I've got to do this because I wanna be accepted in this group --
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you got to do that stuff, your self esteem is so low because --
L:  Right.  That's right.  I know, when I was growing up, that was the big thing, you smoked, but one time I tried it and I didn't like the taste it left in my mouth.
R:  I didn't either.
L:  And I said, "I'm not -- I'm not going to do this, you know, y- it smells bad, it tastes bad, why would you want to do that?"  
R:  Yeah, because I -- I, you know, I got smoking, like, a guy had a cigarette one night, had a pack of cigarettes and I said, "Give me a cigarette," [COUGH] I said, "God", and [several inaudible words] was no good, it almost gagged me, I say, God --
L:  And they didn't have filters and stuff like that when I was growing up.  You know, there was a r- it was a strong cigarette.
R:  Yeah.  I remember those Camels and [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- and Lucky Strikes and Camels, yeah.  My father smoked Camels and then he stopped, you know, a- a- for a long -- you know, he didn't smoke any more after, like he smoked when he was younger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and when I was young -- young and then he stopped and he never smoked again, but I remember he used to smoke Camels which was a bad cigarette [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, smoked Camels and ah Lucky Strike, those were awesome cigarettes --
L:  Uh-huh.  Strong, too, they -- they -- they'd kill you, for sure.
R:  But you know, like, I was saying about education, well they put education up there and tell you what's in the cigarette all these chemicals and everything in there --
L:  Right, and they still do it.
R:  -- and people out there oh, well, they don't notice it just what they say, I say, good.  You see people now trying to get -- collect money for all the years they been smoking, oh, "I want to sue this company or sue that company because they had me addicted --"
L: Oh, yeah!
R:  But now, ten, fifteen years they cared they've died of smoke, or I got emphysema or I got this.  I want to sue -- no, you can't sue nobody because --
L:  You can't because you knew --
R:  -- the message was out there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's not like forty years ago when people didn't know it was like this.
L:  No, that's right.  They didn't know then but now --th- I mean it's all over the place, they tell you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it just, like, ah, I have a couple of girlfriends that smoke but when we are together, they go outside.
R:  Yeah, I don't have no- because you know, everybody got their own habits and everything.  You can't stop people from doing something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you're going to do something that offences somebody else,
