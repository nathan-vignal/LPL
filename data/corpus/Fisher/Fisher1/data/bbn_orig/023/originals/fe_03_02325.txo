L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  This is -- this is -- my name's Amy.
R:  My name's Erin.  I'm from Texas.
L:  Really?  Where in Texas?
R:  Uh, Dallas.
L:  Really?  I'm in Wichita Falls.
R:  Cool.
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  Is it --?
L:  -- all about Texas weather and illnesses.
R:  Oh, w- is it -- is that Texas?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Wichita Falls?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I'm about two hours from there.
R:  Cool.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, no, okay, what's our topic?  Illness? [LAUGH]
R:  Illness.
L:  Illness.
R:  I don't -- you know, I never get it -- all I have is like allergies.  I don't ha- get like colds and flus.
L:  I --
R:  I just have a constant drip going on, you know.
L:  Yeah, well, my so- my son, he's got asthma. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And his only trigger seems to be that, the weather [LAUGH] here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, when we went from eighty to thirty back a few months ago --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he was just sicker than a dog and has been ever since. [NOISE]
R:  Aw, that sucks.
L:  So, it's like, "Oh, okay", [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  How old is he?
L:  He's nineteen months.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Asthma at nineteen months?
L:  Uh, he was diagnosed at seven months.  They wanted to wait till he was after two.  It didn't work.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was -- it was bad [LAUGH].
R:  Well, how did he get it?
L:  Uh, personally, I think it's probably from him swallowing some fluid at birth.  He was in the hospital for two days after birth [NOISE].
R:  Oh.
L:  So...
R:  Wow.
L:  But now he's -- he's -- he's had scarlet fever and everything else this season [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  Oh, that sucks.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, he handles it well.  He's --
R:  Well, obviously it'll get better when he grows up, you know.
L:  I- I'm hoping so, you know.  So far it just gets worse as he gets older with the weather and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, he's -- he's taking his meds and he -- he knows how to give himself a breathing treatment.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  W- we went into --
R:  At nineteen months?
L:  At nineteen months.  He's been doing it so long it's just natural. [NOISE] It's like he walked -- oh, we've had to go to the emergency room last week.
R:  Oh.
L:  Doctor walks in, boy lays down [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he's just -- it's Texas weather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the allergies here, I don't know what's up with that.  It's just gotten everybody this year [NOISE].
R:  I know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- I like -- I'm like in a constant state of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, blowing my nose, you know.
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Go through lots of boxes of tissues [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's just be- it's -- it's been a big mess [NOISE] and with -- with [NOISE], you know, everybody [NOISE] complaining about the weather [NOISE] being cold up [NOISE] north and stuff, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm like, well don't complain [NOISE] at least your weather stays constant [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And you go from eighty to twenty to [NOISE] fifty to sixty to -- [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  I know.
L:  Hey, bug [NOISE], so ...
R:  But then -- but then we'll be, you know, in summer when it's a hundred every day --
L:  [NOISE] Tell me about it.  Right now it's so hut and muggy I want to -- are you all getting any rain?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Have you all gotten any rain?
R:  Yeah, we're actually about to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something bad.
L:  Yeah, we just got finished with the thunderstorm.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I kind of figure that was --
R:  See, I'm not used to this.  I -- I'm from South Texas and we get a lot of rain but we don't get like tornados and stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no, we get thunderstorms.
R:  Oh, horrible.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I know -- I know when it's going to rain because his nose starts running.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, and he'll -- he'll develop a little bit of a cough [LAUGH].
R:  Hm.
L:  So, but --
R:  Well, can you give him a- give him allergy shots and stuff?
L:  Uh, they want to wait till he's two to test him.
R:  Oh, I see, okay.
L:  So, you know, it's like, "Okay, do something for him now".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] No, he's just been so, so sick. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, well, so, do you have allergies and stuff?
L:  I -- the last couple of years [NOISE] I've developed them.  I have a tree in my backyard.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's just making me miserable [NOISE].
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Every time I go near it I sneeze [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's such a pretty tree.  I don't want to cut it down [NOISE].
R:  What kind of tree is it?
L:  I don't know.  Something with purple leaves or purple blossoms [NOISE].
R:  Wow.
L:  So...
R:  That's pretty.
L:  Smells good [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah?  Yeah.
L:  If you don't mind sniffling and sneezing, your eyes watering and -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  What -- is Wichita Falls like big or -- I can't remember.

R:  Oh, that's pretty big.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, as far as they go around here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's quite big [LAUGH] so, no, Wichita Falls is -- is, I guess that's two hours from Dallas. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, I was just through there.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I had to go --
R:  I just moved.  I just moved to, you know, downtown Dallas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm just like there's no vegetation anywhere, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah, no. [NOISE] It's all rock and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- its buildings, but that -- that cuts down on the allergies [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, but then you have like the mould and the dust and the --
L:  Yeah, we have the --
R:  -- all that crap.
L:  Yeah, we had to move 'cause Logan here, that poor kid, he just  -- [LAUGH] we were in an apartment and they had a flood prior to us moving in.  There was mould --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he refused to fix it so we moved.
R:  Well, they have to fix it, don't they?
L:  Well, technically.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You know, but he wanted me to pay, and pay, and pay, and I went no, and no, and no, not till you come to fix this problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but with -- with the humidity here and everything, you know, the mould and stuff just grows.
R:  Yeah, and flooding.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that happens. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah, you know, it's just --

L:  I think I know one person named Bethany [NOISE].
R:  Oh, really.  You sound exactly like her, and I -- and I haven't h- I haven't talked to her in a long time.

R:  I think she has a kid named Logan.
L:  Really?
R:  That's what's crazy.  Yeah.
L:  Huh.  Yeah, no look --
R:  Maybe not Logan but something like that.
L:  Yeah, well, Logan's become a popular name.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you ask his daddy he's named after an ex-man and a Prince of Amber out of a book.
R:  [LAUGH]

R:  Yeah, I hope --
L:  I love my son but this poor kid --
R:  Well, how old are they?
L:  Ten, eight, three and nineteen months.
R:  So, do your other kids get sick like that, or ...?
L:  My oldest, she had similar problems but without the asthma, 'cause Logan's already had tubes put in his ears, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- because he had so many ear infections, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Elizabeth had a -- had 'em when she was two --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because she kept coming down with ear infections.
R:  Mhm.
L:  From the time she was three weeks old she was an ear infection.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They couldn't get em to go away, and, you know, she's -- she's got so many allergies it's -- it's unbelievable.

R:  Wow.
L:  No, I have my kids.  I'm perfectly content that way [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, people look at me like I'm crazy but I have no desire to have that man around right now.  Tried that, you know, even without the marriage certificate. [NOISE]
