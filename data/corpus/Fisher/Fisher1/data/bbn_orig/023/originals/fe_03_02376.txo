L:  Hi, this is --
R:  Hi, this is Sue.
L:  Hi Sue, how are you doing?
R:  Hi, how are you?  I'm from Philly.
L:  Hey, I'm in LA.
R:  Oh, all right.  Well, what's your bad habit?
L:  Um, my bad habit, ah, I drink a little bit --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- and ah, yeah, smoking, caffeine -- I'm pretty -- ah -- avoid those.
R:  Oh God, smoking is mine.
L:  Smoking is yours?
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- and I'm trying to stop, and I'm making settlement on a house on May thirtieth, so that's my goal.
L:  Okay.
R:  My date to stop smoking is May thirtieth, [LAUGH] and my bad habit's junk food too, but I don't know if that's one of the topics.
L:  I'm not sure if it is either, there was one of them I sort of couldn't hear.  But ah --
R:  I think it was -- I think it was, like, over eating was one of them.
L:  Oh, over eating?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That can be -- I suppose that can be a bitch --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it depends on the person.
R:  [LAUGH] Did you say LA you were from --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- or Louis- ?  Oh, LA, how's the weather out there?
L:  Oh, it's ah, gorgeous as always.
R:  Yeah, we got some nice weather, too.  We got, like, eighty degrees.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  I know, I know, it's nice.  So, this is my first time doing this, so ...
L:  Um, mine too, actually.
R:  Oh really, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, how long have you been smoking?
L:  Ah, I don't -- no, I don't smoke -- drinking.
R:  Oh, drinking.  Yeah, I -- I do have that habit too.  But I -- I -- I don't do that excessively.  I smoke excessively, though.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I really have to stop doing that because I'm not a healthy person.  Be- before smoking I had multiple sclerosis --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, the smoking does not mix well with my medicine.
L:  Oh, then, yeah, that's -- do you have, ah, people around you that it bothers or anything like that?
R:  You know what?  I go outside, and I've always gone outside.
L:  Oh.
R:  I've always been, you know, a closet smoker around my family and I go outside, because even when I'm around people who smoke, I -- I -- if I'm in somebody's house and they smoke, I go outside to smoke and I'll feel comfortable in the house.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you know what drives me nuts, is when I see people driving with kids in the car, and they're smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  I hate that.  I just want to pull them over because I have such bad memories of that when I was a kid growing up and my parents smoking in the car.
L:  Yeah, I had the same thing.  My dad always smoked and he would crack the window but, you know, the whole car still always smelled like smoke.
R:  Ah huh.  I know, [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm so- [LAUGH] That was probably my family [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, do you have kids?
L:  Ah, no.  No, not yet.
R:  Yeah.  D- do you have a bad habit of drinking, or -- or ...?
L:  Um --
R:  -- are you trying to stop?
L:  No, not -- well, I used to drink a lot more, um, back when I lived in South Carolina, there's really nothing else to do but drink.
R:  You know what?  That is such a coincidence, because I just came back from South Carolina this weekend.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I drove down to South Carolina, my daughter got married in September and she lives in South Carolina.  She moved down with her husband and they work at the Western, in Greenville -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I don't know if you're familiar with that?  He's the executive chef and she's the manager of the, ah, restaurant in the -- in Greenville.
L:  Oh, very nice.
R:  At the Western.  Yeah, so, and I know, there really is nothing there to do except for smoke, drink and eat. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was in law school there and there is -- you know, all they do is play golf and drink, and I don't --
R:  Oh yeah, and they have their -- their business meetings and ...
L:  Right, and I don't play golf, and ah [LAUGH] it's the only social thing there is -- is -- you don't decide to go to a bar with your friends --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you just go to the bar and your friends will be there.
R:  What's your drink of choice?
L:  Ah, bourbon and ginger.
R:  Bourbon and ginger, yeah, I like bacardi and coke myself.
L:  Good drink.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good drinks have the ingredients and the name.
R:  What's that?
L:  A good drink has the ingredients and the name.
R:  That's right, that's right, it does -- is that -- what -- you know, my husband is a recovering alcoholic, so I can relate to the drinking.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, and along with the drinking comes the smoking, so whenever I drink, which is not, you know, too often, I can get through a pack of cigarettes just sitting at the bar.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Because I was -- I smoked when I was younger and eventually I quit and after I quit, the only time -- I still smoked but the only time was when I was drinking and eventually I had to just sort of put it into [inaudible], because once I was in South Carolina drinking six nights a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that worked out to too much smoking, too.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, I know.  And -- and now with the cigarettes up here, up North, they're like, five dollars a pack.
L:  Yeah, well that's what helps me cut down my drinking when I moved to LA --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you go to a club here and it's ten, fifteen dollars for a drink.
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh my God, I thought five dollars a drink was too much here.
L:  Yeah, it's ah, that's -- it doesn't allow for much drinking if you're living on a tight budget.
R:  Mhm.  Well, m- my, ah -- my husband just stopped smoking in, ah, September actually, and he started saving his money and he bought himself a digital camera with the money that he saved from not smoking.  So, I was really surprised because I didn't know that he was saving this money, and ah, it came time for my daughter's wedding and he said, "I'm going to get a digital camera", and I said, "We can't afford that", and he said, "Do you want to bet?" and he pulled out a cigar box filled with tens -- fives, tens and twenties, and I said, "Where did you get that?" and he said, "I told you I was going to stop smoking and when I did, I was going to start saving my money".  And he had four hundred dollars in his cigar box!
L:  Wow.
R:  And that was only seven months.
L:  Most people don't have the discipline to even realize how often they used to buy cigarettes.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  I'd sure like to save that money.
R:  I know, and you know, you always find the money somewhere, you know, when you have a habit like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I've been smoking since I was thirteen, you know.  I can still remember the first time I -- I inhaled, my -- my friend taught me how to smoke -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she said, just -- sh- she scared me. Sh- 'cause I was puffing the cigarette and, um, sh- I wasn't doing it right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, this is back in nineteen seventy three, and she said, she scared me from the back and I [MN] you know, and that was the first time I did it and I've been smoking ever since, but damn, I'm really trying to quit.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm going to do it, I say, you know, and May thirtieth is my goal.  They -- they say don't just quit cold turkey, you know.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  Just do it, you know.  Set yourself a goal and --
L:  That's what you have to do, it -- it's -- it's like, when you're in bed and you're really tired and your alarm's going off --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, I don't know if you're an anti morning person like me, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you're sitting there and saying, oh, I have to get up but it's so hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, actually doing it -- you just do it and, you know, then you can do it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I want to do it.
L:  And sm- quitting is the same way.  It's entirely a issue of focus of your mind.
R:  Oh, it truly is.  It really is.  You know, if I --
L:  And if you just absolutely decide it, you can, but -- but I know it's not easy to do that.  I've, ah, girlfr- -- Connie, my girlfriend, smokes and wants to quit but doesn't want to quit quite enough to actually do it.
R:  Does -- does -- now, does that bother you?  Does she -- does she smoke in front of you?
L:  Ah, it doesn't bother me so much, um, I wasn't -- when I smoked I wasn't really addicted, so it doesn't -- it's not a problem for me like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I smoked long enough that the smell of it and everything else doesn't bother me so much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but ah, what bothers me is the fact that is -- you know she's an unhealthy person, you said you have MS?
R:  Yeah.
L:  She has something called the shed syndrome which is, ah, is equally serious and her smoking really harms that.
R:  What is it called, again?
L:  It's called the shed syndrome.
R:  What is that all about?
L:  It's fairly rare.  It works sort of like, lupis --
R:  Okay.
L:  In which it causes your ah, -- it's triggered by a virus and it causes your immune system to react against the virus but then against itself.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, that is sort of like MS.  MS is an overactive immune system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah and they don't know how it's caused with the virus -- is there any kind of treatment that she's on?
L:  Ah, they have some drug treatments that are supposed to help breakouts but nothing that cures it, of course, and ah, some people just live their lives with it and some people die from it.
R: Oh no.
L:  You know, it's one of those --
R:  Yeah, that is rare.
L:  -- yeah, it's --
R:  -- um, I mean, I -- I was a nurse and I never heard of it.
L:  Yeah, most -- most of the time when we go to the hospital she breaks out[?] and we have to take time to explain to the doctor everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they usually don't know.
R:  Right, right, but you know, along with a chronic illness comes a lot of stress, too, and that makes it doubly hard to stop these bad habits that we have, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I know.  How old is she?
L:  Ah, she's twenty nine.
R:  Oh gosh.  Yeah, that sounds like it's a young persons disease like what I have.
L:  Yeah, I think it first manifested in her when she was, like, twelve or fourteen, something like that.
R:  Oh, really.  Wow.  That's something that I never heard of, an- an- being -- being from the medical field.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, but ah, yeah, I mean smoking's the last thing she needs to do with her --
R:  Oh, I know, I know
L:  -- for that.
R:  Now that you're talking about having a drink I kind of want to have a drink now [LAUGH] and a cigarette. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Can I have a drink and a cigarette and eat some potato chips, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, you're a lawyer?
L:  Um, actually I -- I'm not licensed yet but I am a lawyer.  Did I tell you that or something?
R:  You just -- what's that?
L:  Oh, no I told you law school, right.
R:  Law school, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you said you went to law school in South Carolina.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  Then, what did you -- did you take the bar yet?  You're just trying to get licensed in California?
L:  Ah, I took the bar -- I don't know if I passed it yet.  I'll find out on May twenty third.
R:  May twenty thi- well, I'll be pulling for you.
L:  Thanks, yeah, they -- they take about four months to give you your results.
R:  What kind of law do you think you're going to do?
