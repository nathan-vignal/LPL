L:   -- excess, ah --
R:  Hi, this is Sherry.
L:  Oh, hi, I'm Grace.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  So, we're talking on, um, personal habits.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And on bad, um, bad habits, basically. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  What they said, um, I didn't write down the list, so --
R:  Well, I'm a nurse and I'm at work [LAUGH] doing this.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  But, smoking is bad.
L:  Yeah, I would -- I was thinking that, um, out of all of them, smoking is the one that is the worst, I would think, just because it affects other people.  It affects the -- negatively the health of other people, so it's a personal habit that is really selfish.
R:  Right, and if it's a bad addiction it's hard to stop.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they all are, I mean, over eating is hard too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] And um, drinking, people have a lot of problems with that.  There was something else, there were a few others.
R:  I forget.  Non exercising or something, I don't know.
L:  Right.  Just having a -- an unhealthy lifestyle.
R:  Is there just me and you on this phone?
L:  Yeah, and we're being recorded.
R:  Oh.
L:  They wanna see what um, you know, what we talk about in regards to the list --
R:  Well, my husband was a smoker, okay?
L:  Oh.
R:  And ten years ago he tried to stop by himself and he couldn't do it, so he had to go to um, Smoke Enders.  Did you ever hear of that?
L:  Yes, I have.
R:  And ah, he was successful.
L:  Oh, that's good.  So they helped him?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But -- but you know, he plays golf now and once in a while he smokes a cigar, [LAUGH] so I don't know if that counts or not.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess it does.  
L:  [LAUGH] As long as you're not in the room, I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, he won't smoke it in the house.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, um, yeah, smoking is vile, [LAUGH] it's pretty vile.  Um, and it is very difficult for people to stop.  I smoked only as a teenager and -- but I smoked for a long time and quit three days before my twentieth birthday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah, cold turkied it.  And it was tough.
R:  Hm.
L:  Like, I really know how hard it is to quit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, it's truly possible.
R:  Right.
L:  People, I think -- I don't know, I just had this, you know, I had to quit and so there was no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  I didn't want -- I wanted to always say that I smoked as a teenager.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I couldn't, you know, in three days from then, I you know, I would have not been able to do that, so, like, that was my goal and sometimes people don't have, like, such strong goals, you know, like, I have to quit.  My dad quit because he had an emergency triple bypass --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] you know, that's like, his goal, and then it became after forty years of smoking, then he became this stubborn, you know, non smoker.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Y- You know and everything, but he was one of the lucky ones in the sense that um, you know, it's kind of Russian roulette, some people can smoke their entire lives and some people get, you know, lung cancer at forty, so you really don't know, um, but ah, he had no problems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- except, I'm sure if affected his immune system.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.  But then -- but then I've worked on a alcohol detox unit too.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where people have been addicted for years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you've ever seen them come off alcohol, it's horrible, with a physical, you know, it causes so many physical problems.
L:  Like the DT's when they --
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  So, you know, and -- and -- and -- and, you know, people have to go through a lot of -- usually a lot of rehab.  U- Usually I see people, you know, if they only go once, then I -- I don't know, they -- they go back to drinking and you see people going back and forth to rehabs until finally, I think -- [SIGH] Some people wh- who have strong belief in God, they usually, you know, do better. Y- y- you know, they um, I don't know, like, t- they become religious.  M- m- I don't know, I see when people become religious, then they're able to have something to hold on to --
L:  Y-
R:  -- and they come off alcohol better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know that sounds strange, but it's true.
R:  Yeah, I um, I think that um, you have to really want to change for yourself.  You gotta really -- y- like they say, um, you got to be sick and tired of being sick and tired.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then the faith just naturally comes because if you -- you realize you can't do it alone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then some sort of dependence upon -- I mean, like, we all have crutches.  I mean, that's the interesting thing, is that, you know, I mean, you live your life and we all have crutches but it's like, how far to the extreme you take it is how detrimental it can be, like, self sabotaging yourself --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and um, so replacing it with faith is a healthy crutch.
L:  It -- it -- yeah, it helps people, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or other people, you know, they go to um, AA meetings --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they -- they have a friend or a sponsor who really care about them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they seem to do better, also.
L:  Yeah, and -- and um -- and it's through, like a lot of people -- I've noticed that people that um, abuse things, in particular like, ah, money or sex or alcohol, tend to have no faith at all.  They tend to be like, well, you know, I grew up with it and that's very well and nice but that's not for me.  I -- I know this with so many people.  And the good thing about like the twelve[?] star[?] programs is that it introduces faith to somebody, or spirituality, or whatever it is, to somebody who has always been kind of afraid of that.
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a way that they can deal with it.  And then they can find their own way.  I mean, I think that that's what's so good about the -- the twelve star program --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is that it helps them -- I don't think it's the be all and end all, but I think that it's a great --
R:  It helps people to cope.
L:  Right.  A great -- exactly, a great way to um, to -- to be able to deal wi- to be able to find a solution for themselves at that moment and -- and to grow from there.  But I don't believe in the whole "I'm sick for the rest of my life" thing.  That's just me, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't believe that.  I think that you make a choice and you decide whether to do it or not and you find whatever you have to do to do it and faith in other teachings[?] seems to be the best way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, some people are stronger than other people, too, you know.
L:  Or have more faith. I -- I think it's trust.  If you trust people then you feel safe and if you can make it through a moment, you know, if people break it down to like, in the beginning, like you said and, like, minute by minute, being able to get through, not drinking or smoking and then --
R:  Or gambling.  That's another addiction.
L:  Gambling is a -- mhm.  That -- that's a strong one and it's kind of like, um, what's interesting about gambling is that it's not very um, like, you don't usually don't know until it's like, way too late. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Family members don't quite get it until it's way too late.
R:  I know -- I know you hear all this buzzing, I'm in a nursing home [LAUGH] working.
L:  On yeah.  Is somebody sick? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, they're just -- the buzzers are all going off.
L:  Oh.  How funny.  But um, yeah, it's kind of um, habits are um, some that are -- y- y- you get a little bit -- now it's amazing you're a nurse and you're able to live with your husband as a smoker.  Did he have, like, certain rules that he had to adhere to?
R:  Oh, he wouldn't smoke in the house or near the kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, and he -- he only smokes a cigar now, w- when he plays golf, like, once a week, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't play golf with him, so [LAUGH] I don't have to smell the smoke.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because that takes a lot of perseverance.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my God. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Sounds like a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not even really listening.  So, um, ah, what other habits did they say?  Oh, not exercising.  Th- all that does is just make you not feel good.
R:  What, over exercising?
L:  No, not exercising.
R:  Oh, not.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, under exercising.  It just makes you feel blah.
R:  Right.
L:  And then I think -- ah, for me, my mental attitude, you know, and my self esteem goes does down if I'm not --
R:  I get -- I get -- I get tired real quick if I don't exercise.  I get lazy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, [LAUGH] lazy.  Yeah.  Um, I just get -- and you know what I've noticed recently too, is that sometimes when I'm on the edge of a -- when I'm at the end of like, fighting a cold and I haven't really had, like a full blown cold --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'll be um, I know that my body's getting over it because I get really tired or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I exercise, like, towards the end, it like, boosts my immune system, like, it rockets it.
R:  Yeah, I think that works.
L:  And I totally get over the cold, like, the next day.  But if I like, just were to sit around and kind of mope, or just rest, it's not good -- it -- it's not as if -- as if I work out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um, just a dance class, a yoga class, something, and all of a sudden, boom, I just feel a thousand percent better.  I- it happened to me last week.  I was just like, wow, that's cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well it keeps your heart healthy, your body healthy, exercise.  It keeps your weight down.
L:  Right, it can, ah, lo- lower your cholesterol and then -- I guess it takes just um, the circulation with proper circulation in your body, um, it can help -- it can help, um, with your circulation.
R:  Right.
L:  And in turn, you metabolize better.  Like the plaque in your bloodstream and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, yeah, yeah, plus I- I'm like, I'm kind of weird.  I hate exercise but I love to um, dance and I love to do things that aren't considered exercise.
