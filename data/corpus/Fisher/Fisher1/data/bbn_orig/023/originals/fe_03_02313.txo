L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  I said hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Dave.
L:  Okay, Dave.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  This is the -- my name is Edwin.
R:  Edwin?  Okay, um --
L:  What are -- what are discussing today, Dave?
R:  Um, illness. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  I have not so ...
R:  Yeah, this is my first call also.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um --
L:  Any -- what illness in particular or --
R:  [MN] Um, the que -- they had some questions before about, um, like getting colds and do you get -- are you more -- people get more sick in the, um, winter, you know.  That kind of stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  You didn't hear that part?
L:  I didn't unfortunately, no.
R:  Maybe -- maybe only one of us hears it and that's, um, part of this thing.  I don't know.  Anyway --
L:  Oh, oh yeah so what, um -- how -- how do you feel?  What do you think, um ...?
R:  Well, you know, I really hardly ever get sick.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I'm very fortunate.  When I get sick I really get sick, like I --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- have my appendix out or something like that --
L:  Really.
R:  -- but colds and flu and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just never seem to get them.
L:  Right, same here.  Me too, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, people, how -- how they usually, you know, come down with a cold with the change of weather.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, but, you know, I thank god that, you know, that doesn't occur with my metabolism, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I, um -- people at work, um, envy me a little bit I think, because --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- I have so much sick leave piled up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, but, uh, so yeah, um -- how did --
L:  That's good.
R:  So's, this is not really a topic that -- I don't really get sick.  I -- the last time I used a b- -- any amount of sick leave is when I had to have my appendix out, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, just the usual typical things I don't seem to get.
L:  Right, right, I mean, I -- I agree.  I'm -- I'm exactly the same way, so this is a very hard topic for both of us to discuss, um, but, um, you know, a lot of people do unfortunately with the change of weather get -- get the illness, you know, get sick. [NOISE] -- um, and it's a variety of age groups, you know, from little kids, you know, to adults.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  You know, but, um, why did you have your appendix removed?
R:  'Cause it burst. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was supposed to get operated to remove my spleen but, uh --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- I chose not to, yeah.
R:  That -- that's often because of a very serious accident or something.
L:  Um, not at all, um.  I was diagnosed from one day to the other with, um, low platelet counts.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, I dunno if you're familiar with the platelets in your blood?
R:  Um, more or less.
L:  Well, yeah, well, the normal count for a human being is around two hundred and twenty five thousand.  Um, I was diagnosed with just one.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, so to make a long story short, I was just, um, you know, I was  [NOISE] -- I was, you know, told by my doctor that I needed to get my spleen removed and [NOISE] once I did that, you know, that my platelets, you know, maybe will go up, you know, so it was like fifty fifty.
R:  Huh.
L:  And this was three years ago.  I mean, I dunno.
R:  And you decided not to do that?
L:  Decided not to do that, yeah, and my platelets, fortunately wen- went up on their own.
R:  Mm.  Did you, um, talk to another doctor for a second opinion?
L:  Actually yes, that's what I did.  I actually did get a second opinion, um --
R:  And was that doctor's opinion different or ...?
L:  Um, he, you know, put me on a few tests.  Um, he wanted to leave that as your last resort type of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and fortunately I just, you know -- honestly I just stopped going to the doctor, you know.
R:  Well, actually I was just wondering whether that's such a, um -- um, serious potential, um -- the potential is seri- -- you know, I don't know, you know what I mean I guess, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, that, um, if it turned out to not be necessary it would certainly make me wonder if I'd want to continue going there of course, you know, medicine is a art, as they say. 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  It's, you know, differences of opinion and experience of the doctor and each person is different and unique, you know, so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- sort of talking generically about health or something as -- see ea- each person has -- each person is different, each doctor is different.
L:  That's correct.
R:  It's sort of a miracle anyone's ever not sick, I suppose. [LAUGH] Anyway --
L:  Used to talk to people -- I used to talk to people from all over the world, you know, who had the same disease.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, there is no cure for it and, um, it -- fifty -- some people they go, "Oh my god, yeah.  I got so much better after I removed my spleen", and half the people were like, "Oh, it was, you know, it was a mistake", and this and this and that, so.
R:  Hm.
L:  Very confusing.
R:  Is there a, um, typical reason why someone would have low --
L:  They --
R:  -- platelets like that?
L:  They have no idea.  There is no proof.
R:  Really?
L:  Really.
R:  So, they don't know if it's some sort of genetic thing that's kicked in later or ...?
L:  We do not know.  We do not.
R:  Um, mm.
L:  It's crazy.  I mean it happened to me one day to the next, you know.
R:  Huh. 
L:  I don't know.  Should we be discussing [LAUGH] this or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess we're sort of off topic but --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I'm -- I'm sort of, um, my -- my daughter who's in college was the one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who told me about this thing and I -- and, uh, she says, "Every time you talk to somebody I get some money", you know, so -- so --
L:  True.
R:  [LAUGH] -- so I agreed to do it.  I wasn't quite sure exactly how it'd work and I'm -- from the email that I got --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it wasn't clear to me exactly -- exactly what was being studied and how I -- I know they're recording these conversations but I don't really know, um, what it is that they're doing, what the aim is.  But I guess if we knew -- they probably don't want us to know, because if we knew we could skew it one way or the other, either --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- accidentally or on purpose, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know.  Anyway, seasonal illnesses [LAUGH], so if we don't have those much, um -- I don't know if -- -- are -- are there any things that we're not suppo- -- I mean, um, like, am I supposed to say that I live in California?
L:  Well,  I'm -- oh, I'm in New York.
R:  In New York, oh, okay, well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh and --
L:  Right, so how long is this discussion supposed to take?
R:  Uh, we're supposed to talk for ten minutes and somehow --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're going to indicate to us when the ten minutes is over.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um, we're just sort of, uh, [LAUGH] faking our way through this at the -- at the moment, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um, how did you find out about this project?
L:  Um, my wife, um, who was in -- online, exactly the same way, through --through email.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, mm.  Yeah, I don't know how my daughter found out about it but she sent me something the other day, and so I said, "Okay, what's the worst that'll happen?"  I guess we can, if there's some topic -- they propose a topic that people feel uncomfortable with, we can just say we don't wanna talk about it, and decline, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anyway.  Um, mm, mm, mm --
L:  [MN] What can we talk about as far as illness.
R:  Yeah, um, illness, illness.
L:  Maybe insurance? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I said insurance coverage, you know --
R:  Oh, insurance.
L:  -- health coverage.
R:  Well , uh, I have really good insurance.
L:  Really.
R:  Actually, I haven't had any complaints, and my employer has, you know, said, like in four years they had like three different insurance companies, but they've kept this one for, I think, this is the third year, and it's quite good.  I, uh, um --
L:  Oh, your -- your --
R:  -- recently went down to a -- because I was having some numbness in my hand, and, you know, they pay good attention to you, and they're gonna be running some tests, I don't know what that's about yet but -- [SIGH]
L:  That's good, I mean --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- insurance -- insurance nowadays I think it is very, very important.  Um, after I was diagnosed with my sickness I've been unable to maintain a -- a steady, um, employment.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, unfortunately, I had to go to like a state --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, insurance, and well it hasn't been bad.  It's been pretty good.
R:  The, um -- hm.  How long ago, um, were you diagnosed with the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- low platelets, give or take?
L:  It's exactly three years, exactly.
R:  Three?
L:  April Fool's Day.
R:  Oh, three months, no three --
L:  Three -- no, three years.
R:  Three years, okay.
L:  Right.
R:  There was like -- are you on a cellphone?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Oh, there was just this momentary thing where I didn't hear something.  Three years?  And, um, [SIGH], you still aren't able to do ongoing regular --
L:  Um, it's in --
R:  -- work, huh?
L:  Yeah, it's just that, you know, I -- my -- my type of line, my line of work is very physical.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, and with the low platelet counts, you know, I'm unable to, you know, do physical work --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because, um, if I were to get in some sort of accident, I would like s- -- you know, hemorrhage and --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- can cause death, you know.
R:  Hm.
L:  So ...
R:  And how has that impacted you, the -- your inability to, uh, work on a regular basis?
L:  Oh, I mean you could imagine.  I've been through divorce, I've been through everything all ready.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah, I was recently married.
R:  Oh.
