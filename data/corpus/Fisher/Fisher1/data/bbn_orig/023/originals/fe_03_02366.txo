L:  Hello.
R:  H- hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Hi, my name's John.
L:  Hi, I'm Tracey.
R:  Hi, Tracey, um, [MN] well, let's see.  I -- in -- in the choices, the first thing that I -- jumped out at me was gossiping.  I think that gossiping is probably the most destructive of these, uh, traits that -- that they gave us and I don't know how you feel about that but, uh --
L:  I would have to agree.  That's the one that, um, stuck out to me because that's the one where someone else is being hurt.
R:  Exactly, yeah --
L:  Potentially.
R:  Drinking or smoking, uh, yeah I think we all know that -- that you're kind of destroying yourself if -- if you overindulge in that and, uh, but gossiping you're -- you're very correct.  I think gossiping is something that you're, uh, actually going out of your way to -- to destroy or hurt somebody else.
L:  Right, and -- and some people think, "Well, I'm not doing it to hurt anyone" and I don't think people realize that they're hurting someone, but they actually are, um, because rumors spread and people elaborate.  It can just be very destructive. 
R:  Yeah, a- and that's -- that's the truth of the -- that whole thing is that the elaboration that people -- the perception is what kills people.  Uh, if -- if somebody read you and I a -- a sentence, I think that that same sentence we would both interpret it entirely different, so if you're gossiping for what- whatever reason, um, it -- it has a strong possibility of coming back and snake biting you and ... I try not to.  I -- I don't try to even get involved in it.  Usually I'll walk away from it --
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, you know, I mean, gosh [LAUGH] I -- you know, I -- I have been a participant indirectly, uh, and it -- it's usually for me anyway, I try to stay away from, um, names or -- or individuals or -- or, you know, concrete, uh, individuality.  If it's just general then -- then I'll go along with it, uh, to a degree.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, yeah I -- I don't -- you know, smoking, drinking -- I'm a christian, so I -- I don't really participate in -- in smoking, uh, I'll have a glass of wine or a beer on occasion and, you know, I'm not pristine by no means, but, uh, you know, that -- that's kind of I guess how they say that, you know, that's your own personal doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I could see how like maybe smoking could be seen as like you're harming other people but kind of when you see a person who's smoking you know the second hand smoke is there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so you're kind of able to walk away and gossiping is like something that you have no control over as the third party.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, with second hand smoking or you can walk away, um, you don't have to hang around with people who do choose to drink --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, as long as they don't get in a car 'cause then that's something completely different, um --
R:  Yeah, no, yeah I think we've probably both been in situations like that where you're in an, uh, enclosed environment and somebody lights up.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I think nowadays, uh, I don't know how old you are and it's probably none of my business, but I'm -- I'm fifty two, so my growing up -- I mean, I can remember as a youth my parents smoking like chimneys in the car and, uh, all the way up to my young adulthood people were smoking all ar- -- all around me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, thank god I never even took the habit up, but, um, nowadays it's politically incorrect to smoke, so, uh, it -- it's much easier to avoid that.
L:  Right, yeah my mum is, um, a smoker and yeah -- oh, I remember we're from California so now you can't smoke in restaurants, but growing up you could.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I remember when we would go out to dinner and we'd have to sit around and everyone would be smoking and now when I travel some place else where there's smoking in restaurants I'm like, "Ooh". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Are you still in California?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I am too.  I'm in Huntington Beach.
L:  Uh, Northridge.
R:  Oh, okay well --
L:  Northridge.
R:  -- we're neighbors, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, that's -- that's the -- the odd thing about that and drinking kind of the same -- same way really.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- you know, if you're around somebody that's, uh, a little too intoxicated you can walk away from that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, yeah, unfortunately, um, I -- and I -- those are the only three that jumped at me.  I -- I forget what else they -- they had mentioned in there, but --
L:  One was not exercising --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- which I don't see how that would be an evil. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  That's -- that's kind of something you put on yourself.
R:  Mhm.  The same thing, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I -- I'm not overweight by no means yet, but, uh, I -- and I don't exercise.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  People say I look good for my age, but I know that, you know, because I don't exercise my cardiovascular's not up to snuff, um, a- again it hurts me.  It doesn't hurt anyone else --
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I think that was the, uh, the general consensus here was that what was the worst thing or, uh, you know, the -- the most harmful thing and, um, again I -- I am -- this is my first time doing this so I'm -- I'm probably rambling, but, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I'm just -- I'm kinda coming back to the gossiping thing is, uh -- it just jumped out at me as being hurtful and that -- that was the first thing that, uh, I felt.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Right, 'cause I think that -- I think one of my things is that you shouldn't do anyone else harm, um, and all those other things if you choose to harm yourself then, you know, you have to answer to yourself, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, back to the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gossiping.  Do y- --
R:  Yeah, and yeah [LAUGH] and it usually c- -- you know, it -- it ha- -- it is truthful because usually when you do gossip it comes back and gets you i- in the end.
L:  Mm.
R:  It somehow -- I guess that old thing, "What goes around comes around" and -- and I've known people that are, um, professional gossipers.  They just, you know, working in a clinical environment you're around a lot of, um, gosh I'd hate to say backstabbing people, but just people that are always critiquing you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, it -- it's just -- I think that's part and parcel of any work environment is you're gonna get caught up in -- in a certain amount of gossiping and you just have to know when to walk away and -- and when not to really get, uh, involved in -- in input.  But, uh --
L:  Yeah, I th- -- yeah, I think people, uh, probably gossip too much.  I think you shouldn't really say anything that you wouldn't say to that person's face.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and a lot of people that's their time when they do say things and I understand like venting.  There were times when, "You won't believe what this person did to me" and that kind of thing, but then that person that you tell it to can take it to someone else and it just becomes a big rumor mill.  Not good.
R:  Mhm, and I think wha- [MN] under, uh, the stress, or the duress of -- of that emotion, uh, yeah you certainly do.  You vent and -- and a lot of times you don't realize that you're -- you're gossiping.
L:  Right.
R:  But indirectly you are because a- and that's -- you're absolutely right.  Somebody else can take that and say, "She said they did this to them and then she said this about so and so" and, you know, it -- it can really escalate into an ugly affair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's -- you know, a- again, um, I don't know.  It's, you know, if I were perfect then I -- I would be able to sit on the thrown but, uh, you know, I've been probably privy to as much gossip as anyone else and just through the years have learned that, uh, you know, it hurts you regardless and the interpretation is -- is the key, you know, nobody really understands where you're coming from and for them to try and interpret what you're saying can, uh, often lead to a -- even a bigger mess.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But, uh, okay, so no exercising [LAUGH], no smoking, uh, do you drink?
L:  Um, occasionally.
R:  Yeah, okay, yeah I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think -- I think that's, uh, in today's society I think that's acceptable as long as like you say you don't, uh, or I was saying y- y- you don't over abuse it, uh --
L:  Right, yeah, I think the only place where it becomes evil is when you get behind a wheel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of an -- of a vehicle.  I was hit by a drunk driver so, um, knowing that, you know, that affected my life and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then that -- then that person did affect me where if they had just stayed at home and chose to drink that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wouldn't have been a problem.  
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't have had a problem with it. 
R:  Yeah, unfortunately, um, you know, accident happen and w- -- I was just talking to somebody about that and they said, "There's no such thing as an accident".  Th- that it's actually you're, uh, you're pushing the envelope in some way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're either trying to get away with something or you're trying to, uh, get somewhere faster than you need be, or, you know, it's always, uh, the individual's, uh, miscalculation or, um, irresponsibility that leads to an accident.  I -- I kinda disagree because in your case, there's an example.  You were the recipient of somebody else's, uh, negligence.  
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, so, that -- that's a tough call, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, uh, exactly --
L:  And for a lot of people that I know who believe like in the fate thing and that everything happens for a reason, it's just when you're on the -- the short end of the stick it's really hard to see that this is what was supposed to happen and there's good to come from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is there good that comes from that though?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  That's -- sometimes I -- I wonder.  I'm going through a divorce and that's why I'm back in -- home in California -- California again and, uh, you know, I -- I keep -- again my faith tells me to -- to look for the answer, you know, and -- and I'm like, "I can't find it".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I've been here since January.  I -- I'm still looking for employment, uh, you know, I've got backgrounds.  I've got a, you know -- I'm -- I'm very marketable but in this day and age it -- it's -- it's very hard right now, you know.
L:  The economy, yeah.
R:  Yeah, the economy's just terrible and, uh, so having said that, you know, y-
