L:  Hi.  I'm Suzie.
R:  Hi.  I'm John.
L:  What did they say?  I couldn't hear what they said, they're saying.
R:  The topic is about when seasons change, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, do you feel like you have -- did they change how you feel, like --
L:  Like?
R:  -- colds or things like that.
L:  Yeah, definitely does with me.  Um, -- [NOISE]
R:  And they want -- and they want to know whether there's and all that, if you could talk about it -- we could talk about it.
L:  Okay. 
R:  How about for you?
L:  Um, every fall and every spring I get migraines and, um, then when we have major storms I get a migraine, and a lot of it's from the allergies, and so I have to take, um, an antihistamine and, um, you know, pain medication for my head, but I have to take an antihistamine all the time, um, and especially when the pollen gets really, really bad, when you can see it on, you know, the cars, et cetera.  What about you?
R:  I have epilepsy, so actually -- and, um, I get some mild depression when -- when, you're right, like when the fall or spring changes, actually I've been doing a study on it.  It, uh, the barometric pressure changes quite a bit in the fall and the spring, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm a former brain surgery patient, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I have a, uh, a cavity actually up in my brain where -- where there's nothing in there.  It's fluid, it's not solid mass.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, like when you go on the airplane and you are going to land, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and your ears feel like they're going to blow up?
L:  Right.
R:  Your whole face feels bad and you choose either yawn, or you chew gum, or you pinch your nose and -- and blow out and all that, anything to make that pain go away.
L:  Right.
R:  Same concept except for in my head, it can't go anywhere, so it creates this horrible, uh, either migraine as well, or I have seizures, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, uh, there really isn't any medicine I can take for it and it's -- it's just a awful time period, but it happens every -- it happens every fall and spring.  And I used to live in South Carolina where, you know, you can get falls or spring a couple of times during the year, because the weather's so weird, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but now I live up North and so it's pretty consistent until when the fall and the spring come around, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just kind of brace myself for it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's not -- it's not a common cold type thing, but it's definitely, you know, if I hadn't had the surgery and all that happened, I don't think I would have a problem with it, I -- I didn't before, and, um, it's pretty much that.  I do -- I also have migraines though.  And when it rains, the same thing when it -- when it rains or suppose we go from one day where it's hot and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and dry and everything, then it goes cold and rainy, or back and forth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's really bad, but it's not --
L:  Well, that --
R:  -- excuse me from blithering or anything.
L:  No, but it affects me that way also, um, in fact I have to take [NOISE], you know, pain medicine and lay down [NOISE] and, you know, do all that and, uh, decongestant, but when the barometric pressure changes, like you say, --
R:  All right.
L:  -- I get -- I get a migraine also, [MN] but I started taking botox injections and that seemed to help some.
R:  Botox? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  What is that?
L:  It's -- it's, uh, it's used a lot in plastic surgery but, um, it's also used -- it kills the nerve cells, and --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- um, so it helps with some types of migraines and it seemed to help a little bit with mine but, um, you know, with the change of seasons it -- it just -- it just kills me.  I've been pretty bad lately, um --
R:  Well, where -- I mean  where are you?
L:  I live in Missouri.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, we get back and forth, back and forth.  
R:  I see.
L:  It's [NOISE] -- it's really different, oh, you know, like we've been having -- I can tell when we're going to have horrific storms.  Like yesterday, we had, you know, two bouts of major storms.
R:  Right, you can tell beforehand, right?
L:  Right, but also it affects my allergies, the spring and -- and -- and th- -- mainly the spring affects my allergies.  And so, um, in fact I may have to have sinus surgery because I have such a bad ear infection this year and sinus infection, and --
R:  Have you been -- have you been to see someone who does allergy tests to see what all you're allergic to yet?
L:  Yeah, I have.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, but I don't want to do the shots. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, I did that, you know, but that was for foods, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're not bad.  The shots don't hurt.  You -- you think they would.  They don't hurt at all.  You can't even tell.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, that's seriously.  It -- they are so -- those needles are so small you can't tell or you do them yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Piece of cake.
L:  Well, I may go -- I may go ahead and -- and do that then, 'cause it would make life a little bit easier, but, um, I'm supposed to be allergic to dogs and cats, but I really don't have any problem.  I have several -- I have like six cats and a dog and I really don't have -- seem to have any problems with them but, you know,   it -- it's just the weather change and the, um, the pollen.  You know when the pollen is -- since you -- since you -- you used to live in South Carolina --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- remember how the pollen used to -- the pine pollen used to just have yellow all over your car?
R:  Yeah, i- it killed a lot of p -- I mean, i- a- a lot of people have problems down there.  I don't.
L:  Right.
R:  I have a real quick question to ask you, I don't know if this is legit or not, but this is the first time I've done one of these calls, um --
L:  Me, too.
R:  You been doing these?
L:  No, this is the first time I've done one.
R:  Oh, oh, I'm wondering whether they tax implications is -- I mean is  this considered income or what?
L:  I don't know, but I think we're supposed to talk about the subject. [LAUGH] I don't think we're supposed to get off the subject.
R:  Yeah, well, I- I- I can talk to someone else about that --
L:  But --
R:  -- but, yeah, as far as the rest of the subject then.  You know, it --
L:  Well, now that you live up -- up -- up north, um, allergies are not as bad up north, you don't think?
R:  Well, I- I never had allergies up north.  It definitely give -- I live in New York City --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, so it's -- it's pretty stable.  I mean you have a -- you have a summer, you have a fall and you have a- a spring and a winter and, like I said, it's the transition.  Usually, the transition is harder going from spring to summer with the weather change there, because you have about a week, two week area, unless it's a weird what year like this year, where you have very dramatic changes in the weather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's when I get sick, or whether it's, uh --  and -- and then the same thing with the fall, fall to winter.
L:  Well, that's what killed me --
R:  But once the winter comes -- mm?
L:  That's what killed me this -- this spring, is because it would be like in the thirties and then all of a sudden, the next day, you know, you'd get a seventy, and then the barometric pressure would change, and it would start raining and then you'd go back to thirty, and [LAUGH] it just jumped around so much.
R:  We-, uh, uh, I'm so curious about that medicine that you're on, though.  I- I- do you take that and it just relaxes the nerve, or do you have to actually inject it or ...?
L:  It's in- -- it's injections that the doctor does.  A lot of my --
R:  But it's in your head?
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I'm going to --
L:  In the temple.
R:  -- have to find out about that because it -- I mean,  I -- I'm in -- I get in excruciating pain from mine.
L:  Y- Your temples and the tops -- top of your head?
R:  Yeah.
L:  All around your hairline and the back of your neck.
R:  Right, and I also used to drink a lot of water and that would help, but that doesn't do it.
L:  No, -- 
R:  You know.
L:  -- caffeine helps.
R:  I can't do that.  I'm -- like with the epilepsy I can't have caffeine.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean, but, uh, --
L:  We --
R:  -- I'm definitely glad you told me about that, 'cause I- I-, you know, I'm not -- it's a rough -- it's a rough couple of weeks, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- each seasons.
L:  Well, I'd talk to a migraine specialist.
R:  A -- A neurologist or just a migraine specialist?
L:  A migraine specialist.  They -- a lot -- some -- some doctors are migraine specialists --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and that's what I would do.  Um, that, you know, that's what I would do.  I go to one and that's where I get them.  They're really expensive but my insurance pays for it, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what -- what it is normally is, it's used in plastic surgery --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and to help women with their -- the wrinkles, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because it kills the nerve endings so it relaxes the face muscles, so and the wrinkles aren't there, but it really helps with -- they've done a lot of studies and it shows that it really does help with migraines.  So, if you --
R:  I hope you get better.
L:  Well, I will.  I'll be fine in a couple of weeks once the weather quits changing and, you know, all that, but -- and the pollen's gone --
R:  I'm, uh -- I'm sorry, what?
L:  -- and once all the pollen has gone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause right now, I'm taking Allegra, but I've had to be on antibiotics for four weeks 'cause I- it -- I get so congested it gets into my ears and then, you know, and I get a sinu- sinus infection and an ear infection, and so -- [MN]
R:  And so you got it pretty bad, though.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but then the rest of the time I'm, you know, usually pretty okay.
R:  How about just regular colds and stuff, like, I- I don't get -- well, I probably just get, you know, temperature colds and things like that.  I- I don't -- I never get just regular colds when the weather --
L:  No, I don't either, you know, I don't seem to either.  I seem to be, you know, fine other than that so, I don't know.
