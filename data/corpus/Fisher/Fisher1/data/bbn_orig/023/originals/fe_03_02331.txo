R:  Hello.  My name is Donna.
L:  Hi.  I'm Melissa.
R:  Hi, Melissa.  I'm in, um, Saint Paul.
L:  Oh, I'm in Redwood Falls, Minnesota.
R:  Oh, well, then we're not too far.
L:  Yeah, we're almost neighbors. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] We have a -- a subletter by the name of Melissa.  I'm thinking, "Oh, no, I wonder if that's her?" [inaudible]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, now that would be funny.
L:  I just called.  Did they call you at home?
R:  Oh, no.  I just called in.
L:  I did, too.  Do you have to call in every time you want to do this?
R:  No, uh-uh.  Um, just if they don't call you then I call in and -- and, um, you can do it up to a certain amount of times.  I don't know how many it is.
L:  How many have you did it?
R:  I think three.
L:  Okay.
R:  Three or four.
L:  I've only did it one time.
R:  Oh, I would call in before it ends.  I don't know when it ends, though.  Anyway, the topic is illness and it looks like it's, um, like allergy or cold related.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, what was that saying?  If a cold lasts seven days if you do nothing about it or a week if -- if -- if you don't?  I've never heard the saying.
L:  Yeah, if you go to the doctor.
R:  Yeah, oh, I've never heard the saying.  I think it's going to last no matter what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I don't know about you but for me it depends on what type of a cold it is.  I mean, if it's really, really bad I'll go to the doctor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I've -- I've gotten pneumonia before but, um, many times before, but otherwise I try to let it run its course.  What about you?
L:  Uh, [NOISE] yeah, that's pretty much what I do.  I have allergies --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so I was out three weeks --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- no, three days, sorry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- last week, [LAUGH] um, but a lot of times since I have the allergies I have been out last year for like seven days.
R:  Is that like rag weed and pollen type of allergies?
L:  [MN] They don't know, um --
R:  Oh, you've  never been --
L:  I went in --
R:  -- tested or anything?
L:  -- and I got the allergy tests, you know, they do it like three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hundred things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can't figure it out.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So right now, you know, my voice is a little raspy.  I just got over that last bout.
R:  I wonder if they could put you on something like, um, Zyrtec or something?
L:  I'm on it.
R:  Oh, does it help?
L:  Well, a little bit [LAUGH].
R:  Takes a while to get maybe into your system.
L:  [MN] I've been on it for two years, so ...
R:  Oh, wow [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] It's well into my system.
R:  Guess you've been on it long enough, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have -- I don't know what -- if it's allergies or what but when the seasons change, um, I get the migraine headaches very bad when the barometer changes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, do you ever get those?
L:  No, I get the red eyes.
R:  Oh, I get that and itchy throat and itchy ears.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think that -- I've never been diagnosed or tested but I think that's allergies, but I don't --
L:  [MN] But I think that would -- that would affect your cold a lot more.  It would make the duration --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- longer.
R:  I would think so, more miserable, too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know, getting all clogged up.  And personally I think I'd rather have a -- even though they're -- they're m- they're a pain I'd rather have a head cold than a chest cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't seem to get rid of chest colds.
L:  No.
R:  No matter what.  And head colds, at least you can try to take something for it but, um, I have a, um, thyroid problem, underactive thyroid.
L:  Okay.
R:  So you have to be very careful on what you take otherwise for some reason it can interact.  Any sort of medication, um, especially over the counter, could interact to make your heart rate go really, really fast, like deadly fast.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, so that's why --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they put a warning on the back about thyroid.  You know, if you have thyroid problems not to take most over the counter medications or even cough medicines.
L:  'Specially that, like, Acetaminophen.  I can't take that, that'll make my heart --
R:  Really?
L:  -- just go.
R:  Like Tylenol and all that?
L:  Anything with Acetaminophen I can't take.
R:  Oh, wow.  What happens?
L:  It stuffs me up and --
R:  No kidding?
L:  -- my heart just races.  Yeah.
R:  Well, I wouldn't, I'd stay away from it then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you take?  Like Ibuprofen?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or Aleve I currently have.
R:  Isn't that the same thing as Ibuprofen or no?
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  You know, I know com- Ibuprofen comes under a thousand different names, like Tylenol does too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is all Acetaminophen.  But I may be wrong, it may be a different class of medications.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, usually if I have to go to the doctor for a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cold I usually end up on, um, I end up on antibiotics and -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like prescription cough medicine, which I don't like to take because I don't like -- I don't like to feel drugged.
L:  No, no --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and that stays with you until the next day.
R:  Oh, I know.  It's like a drug [NOISE] hangover --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- there's, you know, you can't function, you can't think, [NOISE] you -- you know, [NOISE] it's hard to drive even and I -- so I just won't take it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The antibiotics I will, um, but they don't like to give those out too much anymore anyway unless they're sure that -- that it's, like, bacterial and not viral because --
L:  See and a lot of times more often now, they'll be like, "Oh, it's viral, it has to --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- run its course so I'll wait till the fourth day or third day --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to go in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know that's a waste of seventy dollars just to walk in the door.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, the last time I got super, super bad, um, [NOISE] well, actually second to the last time, I went into [NOISE] like a urgent care centre and they did x-rays and all that type of stuff and they said, "Oh, you have a, you know, a cold" which, duh, no kidding.  I mean, I was miserable.  [NOISE] I was truly, truly miserable and this was going on like a week and a half now, and they said, "But, you know, you'll be fine and all that, and just, no, we're not going to give you anti- any antibiotics".  And this is on a Sunday morning and on Tuesday the man who wrote -- the radiologist who reread the x-ray said, "You need to get into your doctor now.  You have triple pneumonia, both lungs and your bronchials".
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And he says, "And I'm sending over, um, [NOISE] a zee pac" which is, um, um, antibiotics, that Zitromax?
L:  Yeah, the new one.
R:  And he says, "I'm sending that over, um, and you need to start taking them now.  You need to get to your doctor now". [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  And then they had -- then -- then they had the nerve to charge me for the visit [LAUGH] after they -- they misdiagnosed me.  I mean, that could have killed me, so ...
L:  Yes, very easily.
R:  [LAUGH] But the last time I had pneumonia, um, it was very strange because we went to Mexico.  Um, I won a -- a free trip from WROL[?] and, uh, my husband and I went to Mexico for five days and came back and I had a -- like a bad chest cold and I thought it was just like bronchitis --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I went to the doctor and we went through two courses of Augmentin and it didn't do anything and, um, so the CDC, Center for Disease Control got involved and it turned out I had malaria.  Now, I didn't -- I thought, first of all I thought malaria was eradicated and I did -- never knew that a m- malaria can turn into like something like a chest cold --
L:  Oh, my G- --
R:  -- and, um, what it actually is some sort of worm and it lives -- it lives with you forever.  You don't ever get rid of it but the CDC got involved and I got better.  They gave me then three days of Flagel and I was fine.  But I went on for like [MN] God, about twenty days on -- on the Augmentin, um, and it still didn't do anything.
L:  What part of Mexico?
R:  Cancun.
L:  See, we were in Mazatlan and that happened to my boyfriend.
R:  Did he get malaria, too?
L:  Same god dang thing, yeah.
R:  Oh, now, see I hear it's so rare.
L:  Well --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- he had it, too.
R:  Wow.
L:  He was sicker than a dog.
R:  Yeah, and it seems -- it seems like it -- like it starts out just like a cold.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, and I thought maybe it was the airplane or the change, because we went -- it was last year, April first.  Remember that big, that huge big snowstorm last year?  Uh, there was a big blizzard and we left that day and got there it was eighty six degrees.  So I thought the change in the weather and then going back [MN] from the hot into the cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, did it.  But it -- it wasn't.  It wasn't that at all.  Very strange [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.
R:  So what did they do for him?
L:  Pretty much the same thing.  Put him onto antibiotics.
R:  [MN]
L:  They weren't -- you know, I'm kind of in a little hick town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't get so upset about things like that as they would up there.  They're better doctors.
R:  Well, see, they have to -- well, yeah, but this doctor that I went to wasn't so good.  I went back to my old doctor, the CDC guy, because this guy was just giving me the same thing over and over.  But, um, you know, he got it right away.  He knew.  He says -- he said, "It's either strangulitis or it's malaria" and they did tests and it was malaria.  And I understand if you got it while you were in the United States, for some reason it has to be reported as a big, you know, big news thing.  You know, the news cameras come out, but if you get it while you're out of the country like in Mexico or something like that, they -- they don't -- they don't count it.  I can't explain this.  They don't -- it's -- it's not as bad.  There's no news coverage but if there's an outbreak or even one person gets it when you're in country, like, if you were to get it from in your back yard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they have to quarantine you and everything else.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Now, with him and the way I was too, I bet if it came around again they would think we had that SARS stuff.
L:  Yeah, pr- --
R:  You know.
L:  -- probably nowadays, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it's the exact same symptoms, at least I had.  I mean, extremely high fever, I was like a hundred and four, hundred and four to a hundred and five, bad, bad chest, you know, congestion, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the nose all stuffed up, uh, I felt like I was on some sort of an acid trip.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I couldn't stand up.  I couldn't get out -- I was so cold and shivering.  I went in the tub to try to warm up.  I couldn't get out of the tub I was so weak.
L:  Wow.
R:  And didn't even realise it and my husband had to come and lift me out of the tub and then I would keep climbing back in because I was so cold [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, you know, I don't know.  I don't know what that has to do [NOISE] really with a cold [MN] but it was cold like symptoms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To the extreme.
L:  [MN] So what is the -- I guess, I don't know.  When would you go to the -- a -- the doctor?
R:  When did I go?
L:  When would you go on a normal cold?  How many days would you have to have it to go?
R:  I suppose with me personally, um, if the cold was just a -- like, uh, like if it kept getting worse I would go probably day five or six --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, if it wasn't getting any better or if it was getting worse.  What [NOISE] about you?
L:  [MN] I'd go day three I think, like I said.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] There's a lot of things around here and the first time they said that I thought they were just
