L:  Stephanie.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda from New York.  How are you?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi, I'm Linda from New York.
L:  It's Stephanie from Florida.
R:  Oh hi, Stephanie.  How are you?
L:  I -- I'm doing good.
R:  Good.  So, isn't this interesting this research?  How --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how did you find out about it?
L:  Um, a friend on the Internet was doing it and so I --
R:  Yeah, it's great.
L:  -- got involved.  Yes.
R:  All right, so the topic is they wanna know that as the seasons change if peo- when people get sick and what they do and all that, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah I think that's what they said.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was a long one today.
R:  I know [LAUGH] and then the second one was I remember they said, "A cold lasts seven days if you go to the doctor and a week if you don't", meaning to me that like you can't do anything if you go to the doctor it's not gonna help, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.
L:  I thought -- that's what I -- I -- because I think seven days is a week basically.  Right?
R:  Exactly, so --
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  -- it's like a play on words --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because there's really nothing to do for a cold.  I mean --
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- you know when you have a cold, I mean you really -- you know you could take medication at some of the drug stores --
L:  Like just to sub- subside the, uh, the problem but you can't really cure it because its not its not a curable thing.  You just wait it out really.
R:  I know.  What part of -- you said you're in Florida?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, what part do you live in?
L:  Um, South Florida.
R:  Oh, that's so nice.  I've been in Florida many times.  I love it there.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's nice.
R:  You've --
L:  'cept --
R:  -- always lived there?
L:  Yeah, but I've never seen snow.  Never ever seen snow.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You've never seen snow.  Here in New York we've had the worst winter and speaking about depression 'cause they said, you know, when you get ill I don't -- I guess they mean also -- as people do get depressed in the winter here in New York.
L:  Really?  Huh.
R:  Yeah, well you know what because --
L:  'Cause you can't go out.  Yeah
R:  -- it gets dark, it gets dark at four thirty, it's so cold, it's just so blah.
L:  Yeah, well I know when it rains round here I wanna sleep.  It makes me wanna -- it makes me tired or you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I dunno.  I associate it with sleeping, so ...
R:  I know.  So -- well, how do people like -- for instance, what would you tell someone if they said, "Well, how do you stay well when the seasons change"?
L:  Well, yeah, it's like  -- well, my seasons don't really change round here but I guess in, um, -- in, uh, certain -- like -- like in August in spring or fall it, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- the pollen comes so people have more allergies.  Like I know I get allergies for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I'm allergic to things so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, that makes me sick and I get colds from that but, um, I don't know.  If the seasons don't change I don't know if -- I don't know, does it really affect you?  If like its cold.
R:  It does.  It -- yes, it affects -- there are many people like me where like I really actually get kind of depressed and down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when, lets say, you know when it's like January and it's brutal and it's dark at four thirty, and it's freezing and it's icy, and you have to drive home.  I work.  Are you in school or are you working?
L:  Ah, oh, I'm -- I'm graduating college in -- next semester.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Congratulations.
L:  Yeah.  Thank you.
R:  So, um, yeah, I wanna ask you 'bout that.  So, I work and, you know, it's -- um -- it --people do get upset here when --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- it's very cold and it's --
L:  And very -- yeah --
R:  -- very depressing.
L:  It could make you feel sick too probably.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Half the sickness is in your head anyway, I think.  Like people -- I get sick sometimes I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's in my head, you know, my -- everybody round me's getting sick so you get sick too.
R:  Definitely, definitely, definitely.  And they also say that if you're, um, like you know if you're  very stressed, right, it could bring on, um, you know, you could bring on sickness.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your resistance is down.
L:  That's -- that's -- that's what I thought happened to me recently actually.  I,  um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd been sick for a while and was trying to figure out what it was and I knew my -- a friend of mine had felt the same way, we felt -- both felt nauseous, we both felt like we had colds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and everything, you know, was going wrong and she went to the doctors and I didn't, and he told her it was probably just stress, and we had both --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- going through the same stuff because our finals were finished, the end of our college career --
R:  Oh sure, sure.
L:  -- that we all started to get sick.
R:  Oh my god, so tell me a little bit about you?  Where do y- -- you go to college in Florida?
L:  Yeah, Florida Atlantic University, it's --
R:  Oh, it's wonderful.
L:  -- it's kind of -- it's -- I don't know if you know where Boca Raton is?
R:  Of course I do.  Of course.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I mean I've been in Boc- --
L:  I'm in Boca Raton --
R:  I've been in Boca many times.  My, um, my -- I used to go to Delray Beach all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- you know, I've been to Florida I'd say about fifteen to twenty times in my life.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so I've been there many times and I love Florida.  I just -- I have a very good friend who lives right near Disney in Orlando.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know it's great.  It really is.  And, um, so you're graduating, that's wonderful.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's great, and what -- what kind of course did you study?  What -- what --
L:  Um, graphic design.
R:  Wow.
L:  So all done.
R:  Very impressive.
L:  Yeah, I'm just training.  I could get si- get sick 'cause I -- I always seem to get sick, right --
R:  I know.
L:  -- when I -- I need to get things done.  It must be subconscious or what but --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- somethings happens and --
R:  I know that's right because we have to speak more about the sick topic because [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I know it's been -- you know, around here also people get the flu a lot and, um, I was lucky 'cause I got the flu shots, so once you get the flu shot most of the time you don't get the flu.
L:  Yeah, I l- -- like where I -- where I work, oh I work at, um -- they -- they give out a flu shot sometimes like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I dunno, they -- they give it -- they give it out and all like the, um -- the old elderly people come and there'll be lines and lines of people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just getting the flu shot --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and I'm so scared to do that because they say that sometimes you ca-  you can actually contract the flu and you can get worse.
R:  Yes, I do know --
L:  Your immune --.
R:  Yes, I do know people who do get the flu shot and did get the flu, but I've been very lucky 'cause I -- I had the flu many years ago really bad and I had it -- it was so bad I couldn't go out for like eight days, and then I said, "All right, I'm gonna get the flu shot", and then from then on I've never gotten the flu.
L:  Well, that's good, yeah, probably builds a tolerance for your system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, yeah, I don- I don't know.  I try not to go into the doctors that much because a lot of the time, you know, you'll -- you can visit -- you don't really need to.
R:  Of course, and plus the fact is where I work we have the Oxford Plan where you have to get your referral and all that to go to the doctor --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and it's such a pain just to -- you know, you just say to yourself, "Well, maybe I could treat it myself at home" [LAUGH] you know, 'cause, uh -- and you can't -- you can't forget this referral to go to this one and that one.
L:  Yeah, those insurances are a pain.
R:  Oh, it's terrible, in fact that --
L:  Yeah, that's how mine was.  Actually, it's getting better now.  I had, uh, HMO and PPO.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It was supposedly dependant of the Doctor Board[?] but then it -- 
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- switched over just to PPO, so I don't have to get a referral anymore, but --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- I don't know.  I -- I ha -- have a whole new plan, like ch- -- all these new doctors whose treatments I-- I haven't really cho- chosen any new doctors yet, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean it's -- I -- like the good old days when you could just go to the doctor and the insurance, you know, before the PPOs and the HMOs.
L:  Yeah, and they don't wanna give you this test because it's too expensive --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you have to wait it out, and try this and this and this first before -- it's just a pain.
R:  That's right.
L:  So, okay, if I'm gonna go to the doctors and you're not gonna give me medicine anyway, what's the point in going if you tell me I have a cold, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Waste most of my afternoon waiting, um, in a waiting room --
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  -- for you to tell me, "Oh yeah, you've a cold, by the way".  
R:  I know.
L:  Huh, drink some soup, you know.
R:  Yeah, 'cause when the lady, you know, who talks to you beforehand; it's a recording, I assume.  She says, and it says about the doctor, and you go for one week, and you have a cold, and if you don't go you have a cold --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it was just funny 'cause I laughed.  I said, "Well, obviously, the doctor doesn't do much".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, it's true.  People do get a b- -- um, ill and they get upset, and they get -- um, the change of seasons, I think, affect people a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and also, as you said, the allergies, 'cause I have allergies, too.
L:  Mhm.  Me too, yeah.
R:  I have a cat.  Imagine I'm allergic to my cat.
L:  Me too.  I hav- I have three cats and I'm allergic.
R:  Me too.
L:  Only ob -- I'm only allergic to -- to one of them.  I was allergic to -- I'm allergic to most cats --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's funny, I have a real tolerance to these cats.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I'm not.  I can put my face in his fur and I'm not allergic and I don't get a cold from him but --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- when -- my -- I had one cat, uh , my mother's cat --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- I'm allergic to that cat.  I don't know why.  I don't know what the difference is, but maybe it's his fur.
R:  Does it have long hair?  Different --
L:  It doesn't have long hair, but it's got finer hair --
R:  Finer hair.
L:  -- and I get the worst allergies and like cold in my life.  It's horrible.
R:  Yeah, I have a cat too and she's almost a year old, and she's a tabby, and she's grey and white, and she's beautiful, but I am allergic, so I take Claratyne and things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but some days I'm okay, but then other days, like it could kill me, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she's really not that fur -- I mean she's furry, she just doesn't have long hair, she's just a typical cat, you know, um, typical tabby cat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I love cats.
L:  Me too, yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm so glad.  Oh, that's -- isn't that ni- -- and it's funny, I just subscribed to -- it's called "Cat Fancy" magazine.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen that before.
R:  Yeah, and it's really interesting, and in the -- there's this one cute little article where, um, the cat writes in.  It's called "Dear Tabby", like a "Dear Abby" --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then you prete- -- it's, you know, they pretend the cat's writing in.
L:  That's funny.
R:  You know, and the -- yeah, and then they're answering the cat, so it's -- how many, um, how many of these things have you done so far, calls?
L:  Oh, this is my second one.
R:  Yeah, this is my second one, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did they call you, or you call them?  You --
L:  They called me.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I haven't -- I -- I haven't called them yet.  I didn't know if I was supposed to wait.  I didn't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'd get two in -- two -- two in two days.  And it's like  --
R:  You could call anytime you want.  Like I called before and now I just called again, because, um, I think the most that you get is three, right?
L:  Is it three, uh, in total or three in one, like amount of a to --
R:  It's three in total, but then, you know, if you refer people it says -- did you see that where you get a dollar each person you refer?  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah, I saw that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but someone's saying there was extended thing where you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after -- after that you can still continue with it, and my -- this lady on the internet said that she had done it, and ma -- made it like twelve hundred dollars or something like that.
R:  You're kidding? 
L:  I don't know whether she was true, but --
R:  Well, really?  Really?
L:  -- you know.  I think it was the interesting thing to try, you know.
R:  It's very interesting because what -- my cousin is involved in this.  That's how I found out about it.  He goes to, um, he's -- he's, uh, doing his PhD at Berkeley in California and he emailed me this morning, and he said, you know about this thing, so I signed up, and it sounds great, and I figured, "Let me try it", because --
L:  Yeah, talk about food, colds, whatever, you know.
R:  Yeah, and it's just so nice, like before, um --
