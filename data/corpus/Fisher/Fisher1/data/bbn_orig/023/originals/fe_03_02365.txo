L:  Hello I'm Michelle. 
R:  Hi Michelle I'm Dale. 
L:  Hi -- um, I'm not real sure [LAUGH] how this works this is the first time they've called me. 
R:  Yes Ma'am well this is the first time I've tried also. 
L:  Okay, so, um, -- let's see I guess our topic is which of those things are worse. 
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  Um, personally I think, um, -- probably drinking too much alcohol, and the second would probably be smoking. 
R:  Yes Ma'am.  Yeah that's what I would probably say too is the alcohol would be the worse one and then the smoking would be also the worst. 
L:  Yeah because I think with alcohol because it effects your mind you know -- so I think drinking too much alcohol and, um, -- I don't know really why I think it's worst.  Probably like I said it effects your mind so you really don't know what you're doing and then because -- I don't know gossiping that's not really that bad because I do it myself.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  And, um, -- let's see, um, -- what else was there?  I believe it was not exercising enough or something.  Like that's bad but that's not going to kill you. 
R:  No Ma'am. 
L:  But, um, -- let's see I don't really know what else to say.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well I -- I agree with everything that you say.  I think if you -- if you put -- you know physically offensive to the body it would be probably the alcohol or smoking. 
L:  Yeah.  The smoking I think I put because my step dad he smokes like two packs a day and he's just had so many health problems.  It's just awful -- he's had heart attacks and he's had a stroke and he's got trouble breathing, and I think that's probably why I think is -- you know -- cause smoking that's just really bad. 
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  Like that, but, um, -- let's see here what else I can think of to say on the subject.  [NOISE] I'm so sorry my child just started crying.   [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Come here sweetie.  [NOISE] [SIGH] He usually naps around this time of day that's why I put this time [NOISE] but --
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  He doesn't seem to want to know to sleep.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] They're recording this so they're -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay I'm sure he'll get used to it. 
L:  [LAUGH] My goodness, um, -- so let's see.  I really don't know what to say on the subject so I guess we're just suppose today talk to each other I'm not --
R:  All righty. 
L:  Sure how this works but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So have you ever done any opinion polls before? 
L:  Um, I've done an opinion poll on like products -- like that. 
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  Like, um, -- someone called me about some computer products one time [NOISE] because, um, -- I'm really into computers and things. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, -- I feel [inaudible] not filled it out well -- it was kind of half way fill out halfway [inaudible] I had to do the rest online. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I actually got paid for that too so --
R:  Oh, that's good. 
L:  Yeah so that was pretty nice. 
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  And then [NOISE] I noticed this thing and --
R:  Yeah I noticed it too -- I thought I'd give it a try. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  This is the -- this is the first time I've called them. 
L:  Yeah it's a -- like I said this is my first phone call so -- so it's as you can probably tell I'm not very shy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's good though. 
L:  So I figured what the hey I'd give it a try. 
R:  Yes Ma'am.  Well it sounds to me like what they're -- what they're gonna do is -- is present a topic, and then take two callers and -- and match them together. 
L:  Yeah.  I didn't know how it was gonna work. 
R:  I didn't either. 
L:  Then they called and they were like, "Please hold while we try and find another caller" and I'm like, "Oh no"  [LAUGH] but, um, -- yeah it's not that hard I don't think and I think we're supposed to keep to the subject but I don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- else to say about the subject.   [LAUGH]
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  But, um, -- think of what else I can think of -- cause I can't really remember the other options -- like I can't remember alcohol, smoking, and not exercising and gossiping. 
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  And I think that's all I can remember -- I think there was another one. 
R:  I can't remember any others either. 
L:  [LAUGH] But, um, -- let's see -- let's see if I can get back to the subject -- I'm not real sure what to say about any of it -- that's all I -- I don't know -- but uh, let's see.  But not exercising -- let's see I think. 
R:  Well if you have a small child I'm gonna assume that you're getting plenty of exercise. 
L:  Oh, yes I get plenty of exercise and especially now that he's um, walking almost -- he's trying to walk, so he falls down a lot -- that's just what now happened.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's a lot of work.
R:  I can imagine. 
L:  He's my first, and my husband's always at work now to try and help us pay bills and everything so, that's why I thought I'd give this a shot cause it's ten dollars -- but that's ten dollars so --
R:  Yes Ma'am.  So are you planning on doing the other two surveys also? 
L:  Um, I probably will.  [NOISE] But um, yeah -- I was looking into the -- I can't remember what it was exactly what they called this, um, -- some kind of research thing
R:  Yes Ma'am. 
L:  I thought it would kind of be kind of nice to see, you know what it was all about.  [COUGH] I think probably if they do call me back, I'll probably be a little more prepared of what to expect. 
R:  Yes Ma'am.  I've got the letter here from the off line computer -- they call it the University of Pennsylvania Fisher Prosh- Project. 
L:  Oh.  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Well I don't know what else I could say either. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I agree with what you said. 
L:  Yeah and just like I said -- yeah, um, -- I didn't mean to interrupt -- you go ahead.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's okay.  Uh, I guess that's about all I was going to say also. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah but -- I don't know gossiping I don't really see how that could -- I mean I know how it's bad, because I have been the victim of gossiping, but it's not gonna you know hurt you and -- I mean it could hurt other people's feelings, but that's pretty much it. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And well I don't know I guess if you look at it at a certain point it is pretty bad, but it's not going to effect your health --
R:  Yes Ma'am.
L:  -- unless you make somebody really mad.  [LAUGH] And they come after you.  But, uh, [PAUSE], um, -- this is really strange -- I don't know why it feels so strange.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah did you think that was funny?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  What else. 
R:  Well I've been exactly where your husband's at right now.  My wife and I, we got married eight yours ago and, um, -- my, uh, oldest daughter she's -- her brother day is today. 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  So she turns seven and I can remember what it was like seven years ago. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was out working as long and as hard as I could. 
L:  Yeah.  Mine will be a year old [NOISE] next month, well [NOISE] in June -- it's not next -- month after next.  In June so he's a handful, and my, um, -- job that I was working at I was a cashier and [NOISE] was able to make it but they were suppose today hire me back and they decided that they weren't going to that they didn't need me anymore, so that kind of fell apart and, um, -- then we realised even if I did get another job that day care would be so expensive, I would just be working to pay for them to take care of my child so I might as well stay home and do it myself.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  That's right. 
L:  So he's -- 
R:  Well we had that decision too with -- with my wife we decided that, um, we would let her stay home with the babies cause I have two daughters and, um, --, um, cause she -- she worked full time up until we had our children, and, uh, she said, "I'll keep working if you want me to" and I said, "Well" I said -- I said, "If we can do it financially" I said "I think that the babies will be healthier and will be happier at home with you than in day care centre". 
L:  Yeah.  That was my main thing -- I really honestly was hoping that [LAUGH] that we wouldn't be able to afford day care centre because I really wanted to stay home with him, because I know in day cares they don't get nearly enough attention they need. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, --
