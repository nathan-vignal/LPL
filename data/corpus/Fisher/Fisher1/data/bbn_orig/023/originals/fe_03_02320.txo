L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- name is Tania.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Tania.  My name is Bob.
L:  Hi, Bob.  Where are you at?
R:  Oklahoma.
L:  I'm in, uh, New York.
R:  Oh, New York.  Good.  Thirty Third Street, I guess.  Yeah, I'm from New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's cool.  I'm in Brooklyn right now.
R:  I was born in Brooklyn.
L:  Oh, cool.  Well, it's actually, uh, it's getting finally the springtime here, so that's good.
R:  Good.
L:  So, um, so what do you think about the, uh, the illness, um, situation? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You mean the SARS?
L:  Well, yeah, yeah, let's talk about SARS.  No, I was actually thinking more like what they asked in terms of, uh, like what do you do to prevent, you know, catching cold and that sort of stuff?
R:  I -- I take nutritional products.
L:  Right, yeah.  I actually -- I agree.  I, um, I like, uh, you know, echinacea and all that sort of stuff, like just the whole complex of, uh, various like golden seal and echinacea, and like little wellness, um, tablets that they sell on Fourteenth Street, [MN] and the healthy pleasure stuff, so that's, um, that seems to be working, but um, I don't really think you can prove that that much.  Just exercise, kind of eat healthy, more or less.  Um, so what do you think about SARS?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is there any SARS cases there, or...?
R:  One.
L:  Oh, really.  Ouch.  Yeah, there's some SARS, um, cases in, uh, Chinatown here, so it's not --
R:  Yeah, well -- well, the main thing with the, uh, your -- yourself is what has hurt the population from not being able to prevent, you know, colds, flus and all that kind of stuff --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- is the fact that people are too -- use too many antibiotics.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's pretty bad, I -- I agree.
R:  So, that's what happens when --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's some -- I'll give you an example.  My sister is a nurse and she brought her kids up using antibiotics --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I didn't bring up my kids using antibiotics.  They would take vitamins, vitamin C and so on.
L:  Right.
R:  And then there was -- they were never sick.  In fact I think I took, uh, my son, when he fell in a barbecue once and it was, um, when, um, barbecue's on the floor he tripped on the mat and that was the only time I had to take him to a doctor, but other than that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, for, uh, colds, flus and that stuff, uh, nobody has been -- my children haven't either or I, to be honest with you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gone to the doctors, 'cause as soon as you start using the antibiotics they just kill all the good bacteria --
L:  I know.
R:  -- that is in your system and --
L:  I know.  It's ridiculous but I mean it's kind of like it's basically that's the main stream approach and that's what people, you know, who are not really, you know, who don't bother like educating themselves and looking for alternatives and stuff, and that's basically what everybody is doing and that's pretty sad.  I think it's, uh, it's just, uh -- and what about like going to the doctor.  That -- that's usually basically what you're going to be prescribed, right?  You go to the doctors and that's what they --
R:  Yeah, if you go to the doctor you just tell them what you want and they give it to you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You go there and ask for the blue pill, the purple pill [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  That's -- you don't even tell the doctor.  They tell you on the TV what to tell the doctor anyway.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, everybody goes to the doctor.  They see something new, uh, whatever the prescription is they put it on TV, so everybody wants RLS or whatever the name of the stuff is, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I used to work, actually I used to work, um, for a pharmacy, um, in the south.  I -- I lived in the south at one time.  I travel a lot, but, um, anyways, um, so the pharmacist actually used to tell everybody, "Do not ever take any drugs because this is so horrible and like all the crap that goes in there just, you know, pretty much try to stay healthy as much as you can, and like, you know, just stay natural and just don't -- don't take any of that crap", so -- and that's the pharmacist like what's fifteen years of training telling you that [LAUGH] so, um --
R:  Well, the pharmacist is going to know what not to take also better than the doctor because, you know, he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he actually gets educated on the pharmaceutical -- pharmaceutical part where the doctor's not really educated.  The salesman comes into the doctor's office and tells him, "Here's a set of golf clubs if you sell so much of --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- Redlin" or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, as far as colds is if you go to a doctor -- what was the question she said?  If you go to a doc- doctor you --
L:  It's like seven days or a week, you know, versus a week, you know, on your own, so that was kinda pretty much --
R:  Yeah, if you were some --
L:  -- just say meaning that, you know, either way it's still going to be a week so, at least a week and you know what, it's -- it's actually, you know, and she also used to say like, you know, unless you actually -- unless a miracle happens you actually have to give your cold like a little time to develop and kind of get -- go away because when you nip it in the, you know, nip it in the bud then it's like -- like bullshit, right, so you're not going to be able to -- then you're going to get cold -- sick again because that's all, you know.  It's all going to come back because you -- you haven't really cured it.  You're going to kill it with antibiotics and then whatever, right, and then you -- and actually after antibiotics you feel so sick and like wasted.  This is bad, you know, and if you're still at work this is just killing you, because you're drained like your -- your energy has gone and it's just, uh, I don't know.  I hate them, but again there are cases when it's totally, you know, there's no way around it but if you can help it then it's better not to take antibiotics, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  If you have some sort of infection, like you could have a -- oh, uh, you could use a couple of things out there for like sinus infections rather than antibiotic.  You could use like colloidal silver.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's a product you could spray into your nose or whatever and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go down your -- I used it once wh--
L:  Yeah, a lot of those -- a lot of nasal things sprays are very addictive though, like it is better to rebuild, you know, that one I don't think but I mean a lot of that stuff is -- is just, uh, people really don't know, but it's like -- it's pretty bad I mean like two or three times unless you actually, you know, interrupt right there and then you get addicted to that stuff and then it's even worse.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, colloidal silver is -- is just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- silver.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  So, it's not addictive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just, uh, it kills -- it kills bacteria and it is known to kill even virus, er, infections.
L:  Yeah, so that's good.
R:  So, it's something that won't hurt you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's terrific.  I mean that [MN] -- and then again, you know, if you take this echinacea stuff now like they're saying like if it's over exag- exaggerated like all the effects of it.  But still, you know, jesus, it's like the Indians have used it for -- for many, many, you know, for a long time and -- and that's basically just a natural way of, um, just trying to strengthen your immune system, so I think that's it's not ever going to hurt your aims and -- and plus --
R:  No, no I think echinacea's all right.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's not like you -- you're going to see the effects but I mean just, you know, you take it when you feel like under the weather and hope for the better, eh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, the stuff works.  That does and another product that's real good is a ga- garlic product, which is high in alyssum[?].
L:  Right.
R:  And tha- that's known to kill the -- kill a cold or anything that's bacterial also.
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  There's a lot of stuff out there.
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  Although, mind you not too many people get educated on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean they don't even know about it.
L:  I know.  Yes, that's bad.  I mean usually like if you compare like the system to, you know, Sweden or just any European countries it's just, um, [MN] I don't even know.  It's not like the doctors are not educated enough the doctors are, but I mean a lot of them are so completely hard headed about stuff and they're not really following just all the latest and greatest results, and, um, like, for example, I found a -- a dentist in Georgia that's like completely out of this world.  The guy's like on top of things.  He's like totally amazing, and there's nobody like that in New York [LAUGH].  Absolutely nobody.  And I asked him, like, did you have any like good dentists in your academy who moved to New York and he was saying, "Well, they're all old school, you know", so it's -- it's just bad.  I mean I -- I'm really for progress and like for finding, you know, doctors who can understand and kind of just, uh, pretty much they're not going to put you on like steroids, hormones and all that sort of crap, right?  But, um, it -- it's difficult because the main stream dentistry or what would just be that just regular practitioners, they're all kind of --
R:  You know, people are getting poisoned also from their -- which kills the immune system too is the mercury in the fillings, and that kills your immune systems so therefore that's detrimental to your immune system --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that -- and then, you know, you -- you get more susce- susceptible to colds and flus and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, people are loaded with mercury and that stuff don't go away.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And then --
L:  So, forget about not eating fish.  This is like it's in your teeth, so --
R:  -- then it gets -- it just drips into your system --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until it gets where it wants to -- it gets lodged in all your organs.
L:  Yeah, I know.  That's -- that's ridiculous, right?
R:  And --
L:  What about like all the MPA crap that they're not even like -- what about like food colorings and like all of that stuff, and like artificial flavors and colors?  I mean I -- I cannot believe that this is not illegal.  This is -- I know it's like a multi billion dollar industry.  Everybody likes colors but like what the heck, right?  It's bad stuff.
R:  Well, the colors, they're not too bad.  It's the stuff they -- all your artificial, uh, sweeteners that --
L:  Well, even that, well, like what about like, you know, GSM and all that crap, you know?
R:  Well, GSM and -- and ...
