R:  For lan- we've had a pretty cold winter for Calif- for California.  I mean, it's been --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in the fifties and sixties, which is, you know, like a subzero storm by our standards.
L:  Ah.
R:  I know, you guys get -- you guys get extremes, though, where you are, huh?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You got from freezing cold to boiling hot?
L:  That's about it.

R:  What kind of weather do you guys have now?
L:  It's about sixty eight out of -- most every day now.
R:  Most every day?  Is that -- and is that nice weather for you?
L:  Yes, for spring.  
R:  I like it when it's -- I like -- like the eighties and nineties, when you can wear shorts and a tee shirt and not -- not -- and not have to pile on tons of clothes and -- and get the sniffles and all of that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And so you're participating in this program, I guess, the same as I am, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And is this your first call or second call or --
L:  I got a call last night, but I had a telezapper and I forgot about it and it hung me up.
R:  It hung you --
L:  Still there?
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  And it's a quite an interesting thing, the program that they're doing.  I'm not really exactly sure how it all works here, but we'll -- we'll find out, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  So I unplugged my telezapper and it's okay now.
R:  Oh, the tele- and did you have any, uh, questions about the weather in California?
L:  Um, no.  It's -- thought it'd be pretty nice there all year round?
R:  Yeah, well it -- it goes from -- yeah, it's six -- sixties to nineties is our kind of range here.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Every -- everybody comes here for the weather, but I've been living in the Caribbean, so I'm used to really warm --
L:  Oh, how long --
R:  -- warm weather.
L:  -- you been in California?
R:  Ah, I was born and raised here, but uh, been here for the last nine months.
L:  Oh.
R:  And uh, so where I came from, it was really, really warm.  I'm used to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- used to it being a lot hotter.  I like it hot.  And cold weather I don't like.  Uh, you have to wear too many clothes and get all bundled up and stay indoors too much.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And do you -- so do you get a chance to go outside a lot or wh- what do you do?
L:  I'm outside all day long, in the yard, and --
R:  In the garden?  You gar-
L:  Flowers and garden, yeah.
R:  You garden a lot?
L:  In summer time, I don't usually come in until dark.
R:  So, you like to --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You like to garden?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, then --
L:  I have a vegetable garden, flowers.
R:  I guess -- I guess that's lethargic or -- not lethargic, what I mean, uh, therapeutic, to be out there growing things?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of stuff do you like to grow?
L:  Pardon?
R:  What kind of stuff do you have growing in your garden?
L:  Not yet. 
R:  Not yet?  You're just --
L:  But peppers, tomatoes, carrots, beans --
R:  You're -- you're reap- reaping and harvest -- not harvesting yet, you're uh, reaping and sowing, as they say?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Brilliant. 
L:  Yeah, a couple more weeks, I'll be planting it.
R:  And --
L:  We wait till uh, last frost, about the middle of May.
R:  Yeah.  Do you find that therapeutic, to be gardening?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love it.
R:  Like growing stuff?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And you grow vegetables or plants or flowers or --
L:  Both.
R:  A little of everything?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, well I could use a good landscaper at my place.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  My son planted a lot of shrubs and stuff here, and flowers.  It's really nice.
R:  I find myself getting -- I actually am doing a lot of planting of plants, like ferns and -- and tropical like plants around my house and I find some of my older friends, too, are -- we're getting -- as we get older, we get -- kinda get more like wanting to [inaudible] of gardening, which uh, which we joked about, like, from the uh, Godfather.  You know, he was real bad all his life, and then as he gets older, he decides to become a gardener.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, growing -- his gardening and raising things and -- uh, growing things makes him feel better, creating.  Creating life.  I guess it's a --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's therapeutic to, uh, raise plants.  And a lot easier than -- a lot easier than children.
L:  What's that?
R:  I said raise -- growing plants is a lot easier than raising children.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  That's for sure.
R:  [LAUGH].  And so how did you hear about the study?  
L:  On the internet.
R:  On the internet?
L:  Mhm.
R:  On the internet.  Ah.  I got it from a local magazine that was out.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And uh let me think here, 'cause the two calls have been from Ohio and one was from Connecticut.  
L:  Oh [inaudible].
R:  So, that's kind of strange.  I just fit it in, I mean, it's -- it's interesting.  Ah, you just call total strangers and talk about some -- just illogical subject here.
L:  Mm.  We're only allowed three calls, right?
R:  Right.  I believe that's three calls, yeah.
L:  Unless we can sign up again?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, be a good way to make a living, just talk to strangers.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And so how is your health?
L:  Good.  I can not complain. 
R:  Can't complain?  Feel good?  And -- it's getting spring time ish.  Does that make you feel better about going outside and gardening and all that kind of stuff? 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Makes it easier for you?  Do you feel a bit more active?
L:  Mhm.  You're cooped up all winter time, you know?  It's -- you can't wait to get out.  
R:  Yeah, you get a little cooped up.  Little cooped up, it's like a little cabin fever going when it's -- uh, you guys have had a pretty hard winter there, yeah?  
L:  We did, we had a lot of snow this year.
R:  A lot of snow?
L:  Cold, too.
R:  I don't like snow.  Unless you're skiing, which is --
L:  My son went to Texas in October.  He said he's getting away from the snow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah?  That's what a lot of people do.
L:  He called me while we was having all this snow and cold and blowing and he told me he's out in shorts, washing the car.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah?  I used to li- --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I used to live in, uh, in a snow town, Lake Tahoe.  You ever heard of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Lake Tahoe?  So I know what it's like to have to heat up your car key with a cigarette lighter to get it to turn and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and spend twenty minutes scraping off your windshield and -- and all that, and I said, ah, all right, the snow's pretty --
L:  Who needs it, huh?
R:  Snow's pretty, but I'll take a warm, tropical beach --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an -- any day.  
L:  For sure.
R:  I think -- I think warm weather's a little bit healthier for you, too.  I'm not quite sure.  But I know when it's warmer, I feel like getting out and doing a lot more things.  And -- so what else do you like to do? 
L:  Um, I like to go boating and --
R:  You like to go boating?  Are you near the river or the lake?
L:  Ah, there's a couple lakes out here.
R:  You near a couple of lakes --
L:  [inaudible] in the boat.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  We go waterskiing.
R:  You're on the edge of one of the Great Lakes, right?
L:  Uh, no, that's nearer Cleveland.
R:  Near Cleveland?
L:  Great Lakes.  I'm in Youngstown.  
R:  Oh.  So you have -- 
L:  About six --
R:  You have smaller lakes where you are?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah?  Ohio sounds like it'd be a pretty place?  Is -- is Ohio pretty?
L:  Is Ohio pretty?  
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  It's nice and green and kind of flat and level.  
R:  Well.  I guess that's good as far as illness go.  You don't have to walk up hill a lot when the weather's bad.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh, so ask me some questions.
L:  Any earthquakes lately?  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  Yeah, that's what California's famous for, isn't it?  No, we've had a good uh, we've had a lot of rain this -- a lot of cold and a lot of rain this -- this winter, so everything's really, really green here, but then what's gonna happen, it's just gonna get real dry in the summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then that's when we get brush fires.
L:  Yeah.
R:  California tends to get a lot of natural disasters, out of all the states.  We get -- tend to get hit by a -- by some of the worst.
L:  Yeah, I notice on TV. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Are you in southern California or --
R:  Yeah, I'm in -- yeah, I'm in Hollywood.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I actually live right below the Hollywood sign.  You know the Hollywood sign?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Yeah.  Everybody knows that, right?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  World famous.  
L:  Yep.
R:  So, you're not real chatty?
L:  No.  
R:  With -- did -- did uh -- were you on the phone waiting for a call or did they call you?
L:  No, they called me.
R:  They called you and said you can pick up now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time?
L:  No.  This is about the time I got my call last night, was just a couple of minutes after eight --
