R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's --
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is April Huck.  I live in Los Angeles, California in the United States.
L:  My name is Carol Wilson.  I live in Chicago, Illinois.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, we're supposed to talk about personal habits and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what we think is the worst.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you wanna go first?
L:  Sure.  Well, I felt smoking is because there are so many bad side effects of it.  You can get lung cancer, just so many things.  Whereas the different stuff they were talking about such as gossiping, it's not really as bad as, um, smoking I think.
R:  You know what?  I totally agree with you.  I -- the -- I -- first I thought -- the first one I thought maybe was gossiping --
L:  Right.
R:  But then they went into smoking and I know personally I think because I myself participated in a lot of the different personal habits that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were talking about.
L:  Right.
R:  So, from personal experience, I think I've done all of them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I, myself, quit smoking cigarettes two years ago.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, I think that it is a terrible, terrible addiction because number one it's one of the most difficult things, substances to quit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, number two, it not only affects your entire physical health; I mean it affects your lungs --
L:  Right.
R:  It affects your heart, it affects, um, in your throat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It affects all the different parts of your body.  Um, I think it also affects the environment around you.
L:  Right, exactly. [NOISE]
R:  Um, it affects your family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it affects -- you know, just strangers that have nothing to do with it -- it affects them.  I think it affects the amount of smog that we have the air --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the air that we breathe.
L:  Right.
R:  So, just in that regard I think it's just a really dangerous thing to have out there and I think because society pretty much, um -- it's not illegal or it's -- you know, I know there's bans out there, but you're pretty much allowed to do it pretty freely still.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's still like incredibly dangerous because of that as well.
L:  Yeah, it is and I think for me, I have really bad allergies, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Smoking, it just -- it really irritates me really a lot.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I think I r- -- I agree with you.
R:  Don't you think because, you know, I can't -- I cannot believe myself.  I started smoking when I was age eleven and I'm twenty seven now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I -- it's crazy, but it --
L:  Was it hard to stop?
R:  It was -- I -- I tried stopping about a million times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I was able to stop.  I started stopping when I was like sixteen --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I was able to stop for a year at a time.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I had w- -- I have -- I have really good willpower.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm able to stop at a year at a time but then I w- -- there was something stressful would happen in my life, like a death of a family member --
L:  Right, and then you just go back.
R:  -- or exams at school or something and I would just go back, but, um, the thing I didn't understand is I never understood because of my youthful age, the actual like toxicity of what it was doing to my body.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Until I started getting really terrible headaches and migraines.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it got so bad that I started having headaches and migraines every single day of my life.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I finally went in and checked myself into this headache clinic and they told me right away like, "You have to stop smoking" and they've isolated me in an environment for two weeks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I thought I was going to go crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, basically what happened is my headaches went away.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so I saw like a very direct correlation between stopping smoking and my headaches, so I kinda did an experiment and I was able to, through supportive friends and everything, like stop smoking and I had a lapse where like at -- like six months later --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I finally got a cigarette -- hold of a cigarette and I smoked and I had like the worst migraine I've ever had in my life --
L:  Right.
R:  And so ever since then I have -- like that was two, two and a half years ago, I -- I stopped smoking after that because like the migraine was the worst I've ever had in my life.  I couldn't see, I couldn't walk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just thought, "Oh, my god.  This is really what I'm doing to myself", and it just -- it lost its allure entirely.
L:  Yeah, and I think also like main -- mainly people smoke usually in their -- you know, when they're young 'cause peer pressure --
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, that's a major, you know, fact.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Peer pressure.  They do it because their friends and other people do it so they wanna fit in.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that's major too.
R:  And don't you think like pe- -- a lot of times people who smoke I think a lot of the other behaviors that we -- they were talking about like the not exercising --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- and the not eating right, and the gossiping.  I think a lot of the other negative behaviors that they were talking about comparing it with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go along with the smoking.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Don't you think?
L:  -- they all kinda fit together.
R:  Don't you think?
L:  Right.  Yeah, you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes, 'cause I mean, I'm -- I'm also like a pre licensed therapist --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's this whole like thing about oral fixation --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that we talk about and like, um, about satisfying your urges through your mouth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It goes back to like being a baby and when you're a baby like your learn through your mouth and somehow when you're younger like you didn't satisfy those urges enough when you were younger, so that now when you're older you just have this urge to like --
L:  Right, just letting it out.
R:  Yeah, you need an outlet to your mouth, so you smoke, you drink excessively --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You gossip with your -- you know, you -- you use your mouth to vent and to be like very, um, angry with and there's kind of like a connection and I think with all of those like negative behavior type of thing.
L:  I think they all kinda fit together and they all play a role.
R:  Right, and you just kinda go downhill from there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Like when I first heard it I'm like, "Gossiping and smoking". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, 'cause then I know right now I mean it's part of my life where I'm really into fitness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I thought, "Well, not exercising, you know, that's terrible too".  'Cause, you know, not exercising, I think, really contributes to a lot of like depression and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, low body image and low self esteem, I think, but --
L:  Right, because it's like right now in the media the, you know, the certain look that you have.  You know, that everyone wants, you know, it's just --
R:  Right.
L:  It's a lot of pressure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so a lot of people turn to different things.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's just, yeah.
R:  Well, smoking, that's -- that's totally part of it too though.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Because that's exactly -- everyone -- that's the big thing.  That's one of the big things especially as a woman why I didn't want to quit smoking was because everyone told me, "As soon as you quit smoking you're gonna gain ten pounds".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it's that -- you have that same oral fixation and that's what you do.  You just -- instead of smoking you're still nervous.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You wanna feed your face with something and you start eating and so my doctors told me, "Well, okay, yeah, that's gonna happen.  But what you're supposed to do is either chew gum or something or you exercise instead with that nervousness and, you know, that's how you kinda offset putting on the weight, or whatever".  But there's so many women who smoke instead of eating lunch or eating breakfast.  They go out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and have their cup of coffee and they smoke.  So --
L:  So, did you get -- like I've seen on TV like they have, you know, nicotine patches, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you try that stuff?
R:  Um, actually I am ju- -- I am one of those people -- no, I didn't use anything.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm one of those people where I just -- I wake up one day and I'm sick of doing something and I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just stop doing it.
L:  Right, you wanna change, okay.
R:  I mean, I then -- yeah, I'm a recovering alcoholic.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm a recovering drug addict.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm a recovering caffeine -- major -- major caffeine addict.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, that was probably one of the hardest things to give up.  I used to drink pots and pots of coffee a day.  Um, I've -- I've been able to kick all of it.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  All of that.  Just by like one day waking up and saying, "Oh, my god.  What am I doing to myself?"  And, um, you know, there's been times where I -- I've said on like, you know, New Year's Eve --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I'm gonna give it up".  I -- I always say, like "I'm gonna quit smoking on New Year's Eve".
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  This last time I quit smoking I said, "On New Year's Eve I'm gonna quit smoking".  And I woke up like on November thirteenth and I said, "Wait a second.  Why the heck am I waiting for New Year's Eve?  Like, what the heck is that all about?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just quit that day, 'cause I was like, "Why am I waiting for this contrived, made up, crap day when I'm supposed to give up everything? Like I'm giving it up today, like I feel like crap".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  And I just gave it up.  But, you know, at the time I was dating someone and a- -- the same boyfriend I have now and he wasn't giving it up so it was really, really difficult.
L:  Yeah, but it's hard if you don't have support, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] It was really hard --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because we'd be in the car and he would like light up a cigarette and I would just look at him like, "Are you trying to kill me, or what?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, "What are you doing?"
L:  Right.
R:  So, finally on January first, he quit as well and so it made it so much easier after that because there was no, you know, it wasn't be held right in front of my face like I'd --
L:  Right.
R:  -- been taunted with it. [LAUGH]
L:  And you have support from someone --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- else which is good.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Right.  But ev- -- and it's funny.  I mean, even now like I walk past -- I go for a walk every morning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I walk past like Starbucks and there's people sitting out in front drinking their coffee and smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I cover my face.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they look at me like, "Oh, you're so rude" and I'm like, "Gosh, this is gonna give me a headache".
L:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it gives me -- it seriously gives me a headache and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, it's just, ugh, it's horrible.
R:  I don't -- I think it should be banned like --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- from -- in front of anywhere.  Like I think you should just have to do it in your house or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I just -- I don't know how -- what kind of happy medium we can come to about that, but it's really -- I have so many chemical sensitivities that I just wish it would be banned completely.
L:  Right, like a [inaudible] alone is just horrible.  You know.
R:  Right, I can't believe they used to be -- people used to be able to like smoke at work --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- and in movie theaters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That just terrifies me. [LAUGH] That just makes me freak out when I think about that. [LAUGH] So, how long are we supposed to talk? [LAUGH] 
L:  I think ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I found out about this, um, on the Internet.
R:  Oh, okay, so --
L:  So --
R:  -- how long have we been talking? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Longer than ten minutes.
R:  Really?
L:  But I think they're supposed to say something though.
R:  Oh, okay then so we'll keep talking.
L:  Is this y- -- is this your first time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  So, we'll keep talking.  Um, what else?  Smoking -- oh, well drinking caffeine you know, caffeine also really ...
