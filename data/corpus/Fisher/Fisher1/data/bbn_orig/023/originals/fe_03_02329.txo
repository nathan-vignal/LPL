R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Linda.
R:  I'm Juliet.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine thank you.  How are you, Juliet?
R:  Great.
L:  Good.  Anyway, it's like that we're supposed to talk about illness.
R:  Uh, yeah, when the seasons change.
L:  That's an interesting topic.  Um ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes allergies, not necessarily colds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, I get hit with allergies.  I've been -- I've -- I've --
R:  You sound a little stuffy [LAUGH].
L:  I am congested right now but I -- it's not a cold.  It's just congestion --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, I have to knock when I say this and, um, basically my health is pretty good [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Where are you -- where do you live?
R:  Uh, in, uh, close to Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay, so you're back east and I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Wow, I just got a call from California.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I get two.
L:  And, um, the weather here is pretty good so it's -- it's not like really, well, sometimes it changes within a day, a fifteen degree change.
R:  Right, but do you have like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot of seasonal changes, I mean is it pretty --
L:  No, not really.
R:  It's pretty -- yeah, I was going to say it's pretty like sort of level.  You might get like a few -- like over here we have major seasonal changes.
L:  Exactly, and I would say that that might --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- get -- where you would get sick.
R:  Yeah, like I --
L:  Um, do you?
R:  -- I do.  Oh, somet- like, um, when the -- I'm a college student.  I know I run myself down and then when I get like in the spring this time I got a cold like a couple of weeks ago, because it was like really cold and then really warm and then really cold --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I think it -- it -- in the summer time I usually get a summer cold.  I think that's more to do with like walking into really heavily air-conditioned buildings and then outside, and then air conditioning and then outside, like I hate that.
L:  You know it's funny you mentioned that because whenever I go to, which isn't that often necessarily, like Lawton[?] or Las Vegas, --
R:  Right.
L:  It's so hot outside and it's close, you know, with the air conditioning inside.
R:  Right.
L:  Whenever I'm in air conditioning for a half hour I just -- this is how I get, congested.
R:  Right.
L:  I sneeze and I get that really bad cold --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I hate air conditioning.
R:  Right, so I mean I -- I think that like the temperature changes may, um, contribute to just like your body trying to, like, compensate with the hot and the cold.  Like I -- I hate that, yeah .
L:  Right.  Right.  Um, [MN] what is -- I mean I prefer that when it's warm out.
R:  Right, I do, too.
L:  I mean I h- I'm not a cold person it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If the sun's out I'm a happy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- person.  Um --
R:  I'm the same way.
L:  -- when it's not, um, it really affects my mood a lot.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, 'cause I mean like I don't know, up further north, you know, you have the big like sort of seasonal depression illness, you know, when it's winter time, it's all gray and cold and not a lot of sunlight.  Like up in Boston, I think, they have a lot of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- seasonal depression problems.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, but do you go to the doctor when you get sick?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either unless it gets to the point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where I'm really bad.
R:  Uh, I'm not big on the medication. [LAUGH] I'm --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- more like the orange juice, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hot cup of coffee, hot chocolate kind a [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- remedies.
L:  The orange juic- -- you know, the vitamins and --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you just have a tendency to, well, I do, you know, just take it a little easier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  Like the whole feed a fever starve a cold thing.
L:  Right.  Right, exactly.  Um, when I have a fever I mean [LAUGH] I'm good for nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean like let me sleep.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I'm really a very bad patient.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm better off being alone and just -- just sleeping.  Um, when I have a cold I can deal with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you, too?
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm the same way.
L:  Well, you're young, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean when I have a fever I still like to -- like I like to be in bed and just feel like, "Duh, [LAUGH] Leave me alone.
L:  You get hot --
R:  Don't [MN] --
L:  -- and cold.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really uncomfortable.
R:  Right.  Definitely is.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] the minute you, you know, cover up then you start perspiring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, that's when I know I'm sick.
R:  Yeah, that is.  Definitely.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, but -- but usually you know that's when it breaks and you know, you know, you're up on the upswing.  It's just like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just going to get better.
L:  Exactly, so why go to the doctor?
R:  Right.
L:  Why I- I mean to be honest I don't even feel good enough to call the doctor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that -- at that point.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, at that point it's like the point -- un- unless it's like sort of like you get like, I don't know, uh, if it's a really bad chest cold and you have like bronchitis --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- or something that's the only time I would.
L:  Well,  yeah, because one time I had an accident and they gave me a pain pill and it's like, "Why are you doing that?"  I had like it was something with my ribs --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I wasn't breathing right and they said, "Well, if you don't breathe right you can catch pneumonia" and I said, "You're kidding" so I've never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- forgotten that because you're not breathing properly and so that's the only way that if it really carries on then I will --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I know I've got to get something to -- to break that up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I certainly don't want to end up with pneumonia.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, oh no [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But it -- prior to that I didn't even know that if you don't breathe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ri- you know, and that was just from a car accident.  It wasn't from --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, being sick.
R:  Yeah.  Um, do you -- do you know much about the -- the saying they said, like, you know, if you have a cold --
L:  Stop.
R:  -- and you stay home and it lasts for seven days.  If you go to the doctor it lasts a week.  I mean I know it's the same amount of time, so --
L:  Right.  Right, exactly.
R:  -- I don't know much about the --
L:  Um, [MN] I'm not sure.  I mean I heard, you know, s-  a- starve a s- a- h- see I was even get confused on starve --
R:  Yeah, feed a fever and starve a cold.
L:  -- a cold and feed a f- yeah [LAUGH] right.  So, wait, starve a fever and --
R:  No, starve a cold and feed a fever.
L:  Okay.  I even get confused on that saying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, yeah, I think things just have to run their --
R:  Their course?
L:  -- run their course.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  Um, like you said, unless it's, you know, something in particular.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but if it's a basic something that you can deal with why go to the doctor when you're going to run into people who are sicker.
R:  What about, um, like the flu shot?
L:  You know what? [MN] I haven't -- I have prior gotten flu shots occasionally and I'm not quite sure if -- if they've worked.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the last couple of years I know there was a shortage on flu shots.
R:  Right, yeah, there's a shortage.
L:  And so I know I didn't get a flu shot then and I don't think I've had any worse of a year.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know [LAUGH] going back, I mean I don't write down on my calendar when I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not feeling so good but I don't think I've, um -- as a matter of fact I think I felt better, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, --
R:  You see I know with me, like, you know, when -- with -- with being a student like I know, like, when I run myself down like with studying and like all that great stuff, that I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going to like get sick --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because my immunity is going to be down and --
L:  And you're also in a lot of places with a lot of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's a probable tendency that other people have germs and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're passing them back and forth --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, you know, but that's what you get when you go out at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is true [LAUGH].
L:  So, um, you know, I just have to, you know, I have to knock on wood all the time when I'm -- when I'm feeling okay [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because it's not necessarily going to, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah, but the -- the seasonal al- allergies are rough.  I mean I do get, um, occasional alle- allergies, 'specially like in the springtime when everything starts to pollinate.
L:  Right.  They said this year's going to be really bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd say -- I don't know why but --
R:  And when everyone in the neighbourhood, like wants to cut their grass on the same day --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- that one nice day it's out and everyone's cutting their grass --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I go nuts [LAUGH].
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  I'm like. "No".
L:  And yet I don't know what I'm allergic to.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's just all the -- all the stuff in the air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I can deal with it so I sneeze.  
R:  Right.
L:  I don't take medication.  I don't take any allergy stuff or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or anything.  Um, I've nev- I don't -- I'm not allergic --
R:  I-- I -- I don't, I mean it, yeah, I'm the same way.  It doesn't bother me to the point where I need to take action because like --
L:  Right, you --
R:  I --
L:  -- just have the tendency to -- to sneeze a lot more.
R:  Right, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I mean it worries me because you've like taken one medication and then they have all these side effects, and when --
L:  Oh, yeah, the side effects are --
R:  -- you start taking another medication for, um, the side effects.  Next thing you know you're like on fifteen different medications.
L:  Right, exactly, you know, yeah.  I'd rather not take the medication because I don't need to be drowsy.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Most of them I think make --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you drowsy.
R:  Definitely.  Drowsy --
L:  And, uh, --
R:  -- headaches --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- bloody noses, god, and stuff I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't want [LAUGH].
L:  I can deal with the runny noses and I can deal with the, uh, sneezing so I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- support Kleenex [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Eventually maybe I'll buy stock, you know, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  I was thinking the same thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- especially in the middle of a cold [LAUGH].  I could have bought stock --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- in Kleenex [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah, we don't have the seasons, I don't think, here that -- that you do. 
R:  Yeah, like right now the temperature over here is like fluctuating by like thirty or forty degrees each week.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's a lot.
R:  Yeah, like today it was like in the eighties.
L:  Whoa.
R:  Like l- like high seventies, eighties. Yester- yeah.
L:  Beautiful.
R:  We were like yesterday, we were like, "Yeah, we have better temperature than Honolulu right now" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then like --
L:  Isn't that nice to see.
R:  -- and then like ...
