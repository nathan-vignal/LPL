R:  Hi there caller, this is Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle.  This is Karen.
R:  Hi, Karen.  How you doing?
L:  Fine thanks.  Is this your first time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh great. [LAUGH]
L:  What have we gotten ourselves into? [LAUGH]
R:  I dunno. [LAUGH] It sounds pretty strange but I guess it works.  Um, I think I just heard they said we're supposed to talk about the weather --
L:  Right --
R:  -- and getting a cold or something?
L:  -- getting -- right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think for a number of years I did -- that did happen for me.  I always used to say I'm getting my annual spring cold, I'm getting my annual spring cold, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this year -- oh now that I've said it I probably will get one, but I -- I have not gotten one --
R:  You haven't gotten it yet, huh?
L:  -- and I don't know why, no, and I don't go to a doctor.  Who does for a cold?
R:  I -- I --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  -- don't either, no.  
L:  No.
R:  I don't do the doctor anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where do you live?
R:  I'm beyond the doctor.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm in Wisconsin.
L:  Wisconsin.
R:  Oh no, what am I saying.  I'm in Wis- -- I'm in California.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm from Wisconsin and --
L:  From Wisconsin, okay.
R:  -- I was -- I was gonna tell you something that I used to get colds a lot, and then I thought, "Well, I'm in California, I won't get colds so much" and now I don't get them as often, but when I get them they're really bad.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, like really bad, like they last forever and you're like almost gonna die. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you where -- are you where the air is -- has any pollution or no?
R:  [MN] Oh yeah.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Wonder if that makes a difference.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:   I -- I think it just carries so much more junk and stuff like that.
L:  Ah. 
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in New York City. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're in New York.  Okay, well there you go.
L:  We have a little bit of junk. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely, plus it's cold as well so ...
L:  Yeah, that's true, it's true. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and the -- the heat -- the overheated apartments and all that, although also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I've been a free lance, uh, writer and I've been a publicist and whatnot and I've gone back and forth between that and occasionally taking corporate work and they say when you go to a -- a place, you know, um, where you're surrounded by other people you're it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it increases and I have not been in a corporation this past year so maybe that is also a reason why I'm not --
R:  Oh, that's right --
L:  -- getting a cold --
R:  -- I wouldn't --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- doubt it because I know -- well definitely offices, the recycled air --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and also I was just on a airplane flight.  I went to Brazil and right before I left, 'cause the flight's supposed to be like twelve hours long, and I'm like, "Oh my god, that's horrifying enough" but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I end up getting a cold I'm gonna freak out, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I got these little things, like they're called airborne.  They're tablets and they're basically just like a little fizzy, like super vitamin.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But I'll tell you I did not get a cold.  And I think that's about the first time that I was on a airplane there and back and I did not get a cold.
L:  That's excellent, have to remember that.
R:  Usu- yeah, usually I tot- I totally get cold, so I just like try to dose myself with a ton of vitamins when I feel anything coming on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I take a nap, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I don't usually see the doctor. [LAUGH]
L:  What age bracket are you in or are we supposed to ask stuff like that?
R:  Are we -- I have no idea.  I'm like thirty.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sixty years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh all right, so -- well, now I wonder, and you're -- and you're not getting as many colds.  That's great.
L:  Yeah, well maybe -- maybe it's my --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- body's rallying for the really big stuff to come down -- down the pike as they say. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, maybe you've had all the viruses. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right, and you run out of them after a while.
R:  That'd be great, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea but now they say there's all these, you know, new things coming out, and -- and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   -- I -- I have a girlfriend that's actually a nurse and, uh, she says that what they think is happening, 'cause there's always like super viruses coming out, and that's why they last so long and that because there's so much international air travel --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that all these things are mixing and it's, you know --
L:  Ah
R:  -- smarter, smarter, but anyway I went to Brazil and I didn't get anything, so I'm happy.
L:  Good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was -- was that for business or pleasure, or ...?
R:  It was for pleasure.  I went to see a -- somebody named John of God and, um, he's like a healer, um --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  There's different places -- there's a lot -- he's been studied a lot, like, um, when we were down there there was -- there were some people from, um, [LIPSMACK] from Harvard I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like that, Harvard or Yale, and they were doing a study on him, on spiritual healers, and, uh, so I figured if I got a cold on the way there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Don't trust the city to have one [LAUGH].
R:  It was like yahoo! [LAUGH] I'll be getting rid of that thing fast.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, but I -- you know, it was a lot of fun.  It was really great --
L:  Very good. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it -- he was the real thing, so it was really interesting.
L:  And what did you think of Brazil?
R:  Oh, it was wonderful.  It's a great place.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I've never gone.  I've been to Central America but never gotten to South America --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I'd love to.
R:  Where in Central America?
L:  Oh, I was in, um -- I used to work for UNICEF so places like, um -- I was there during the cease fire of, um, oh, what is that, uh --
R:  Nicaragua?
L:  No, um, [MN] -- wow, the memories already starting, it's [LAUGH] --
R:  El Salvador then?
L:  -- let's see.
R:  Where?
L:  Uh, El Salvador, El Salvador.
R:  El Salvador --
L:  El Salvador, right, right.
R:  -- oh my goodness.
L:  Right, and that was --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that was it.  Well, UNICEF, um, which, uh, you know, is bureaucratic like every other organisation but they -- they -- they managed something that was really cool, which was during the -- the war went on for a long time and, um, children were not getting vaccinated, and all the work that UNICEF had done was beginning to, you know, be in jeopardy, so they -- they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- went to the church there and they went to the, um, uh, both sides, you know the -- the rebels as well as the government, and the -- and through the intermedi-  intermediary church they called for a twenty four hour cease fire and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- everybody stopped and children got vaccinated and even the soldiers -- we have pictures of the soldiers, um, helping to, you know vaccinate, and then as soon as that was over, they picked [LAUGH] up their guns and started shooting each other.
R:  Oh no.
L:  I mean it shows you how crazy people are.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean they're -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I say if women were running things, you know, there'll be none of this war nonsense.  We just wouldn't do it.
R:  Well, that's ex- that's exactly the point. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's why they keep us out of like -- oh I shouldn't say this over the phone --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on a study, I might get hunted down.
L:  Yeah, we're being recorded; we're being -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We could really get into this but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's exactly why they keep women out of stuff like that --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- they wanna be little war heroes or something.  I dunno.
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  Probably whoever's studying us right now is having a good laugh.
L:  [LAUGH] But I -- I loved --
R:  But, yeah that's pretty funny.
L:  -- the El Salvador people.  They were really -- really they're such -- such -- they had, I mean, compared to what, you know, we strive to have in terms of material things, you could say that they had practically nothing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they -- the families they loved each other.  They seemed so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- genuinely happy with each other and, um, my children at the time were, you know, fairly young, and they'd get their thing, you know, what was school like today?  Uh, it's boring and like everything was boring, and went through that stage, and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- these children were sitting waiting for their teacher and she had to walk like three miles across, you know, rocky terrain and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're sitting there and all they have are pencils and -- and, you know, little -- barely scraps of paper and they jump to their feet when she arrived, and -- and they were like thrilled of -- to have a teacher, and they were just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hung on to every word, and I'm thinking, "My -- my ratty children.  If they could just appreciate what they have".
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  And now they're grown up they do, but I mean, you know --
R:  I think it's -- it is like a -- -- it -- it's like if you have it too easy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you really just don't appreciate anything, and -- and, uh, there's also a lot of -- lot of anger, I think, in this country, 'cause I've been down to Costa Rica, and I notice the same thing.  People are extremely, what we would call poor, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they were so happy --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and they were so nice.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  Like they would never let anything bad happen to you.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're always watching out for you even though they don't let you think they are, but they'll watch out for you, and they were so nice, and I was like, "Wow, people like --"
L:  Yeah. 
R:  "-- talk to each other.  How 'bout that?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  But it's almost funny that it's -- it's kinda weird and it's like -- it's just bizarre.  
L:  It is.
R:  It's the way it should be I really think, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you do?
R:  Um, uh, I came out to LA to do acting and singing.  Um, so, gee what am I --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- doing?  Yeah, it's kinda interesting.  It's been -- it's been pretty cool out here, like I've had some really amazing things happen but I haven't fulfilled my dream completely at all so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, but, um, it's --
L:   But you're staying with it?
R:  Yeah.  What's that?
L:  You're staying with it?
R:  Ah, for a little while, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm getting to the point where I'm kinda like, well okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Something -- something needs to really happen to really keep me here because, um, I'm just getting tired of the city and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I really like -- like going to South America and stuff like that.  People, I think, are much cooler.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and it seriously is like we have to stick on the cold topic, but --
L:  [LAUGH] All right.
R:  I'm like afraid of these colds that come a by, I mean they're scary, and now with the SARS thing, they're getting even scarier. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah exactly, um, well --
R:  My  god, they're like getting deadly.
L:  Well, used to be a cold was something for me that would last ab- -- you know, maybe twenty four hours at the most, but there's a -- there's another kinda cold that's really kinda vicious, think like a super cold, and --
R:  The flu or --
L:  No, it's actually --
R:  Oh, just now?
L:  -- a cold, and -- and it just seemed to hang on.  That was a few years ago and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I -- occasionally I'd talk and a couple a people would say, "God, I've had this cold for so long I --" and after talking to people over a period of time and I guess the next time I was vi- visiting my doctor regular check up kind of thing, I -- topic I think might have come up, he'd say, "Oh, there is a -- a different kind of cold that's, like a, you know, that's like a week long cold and it -- and it's -- it's -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  But I don't -- I don't know colds are, you know, viruses or not but, uh -- I should know this, but I know they can't be cured by antibiotics, right, therefore --
R:  No, they can't.
L:  -- they're --
R:  They kinda just boost up your system.
L:  Right, that's all they can do, yeah.
R:  But, you know, one time -- okay, like the last really bad cold that came through here was about two and a half to three years ago and I'm wondering if that's the same one you're talking about, but it lasted for me about two and a half weeks, and then after about --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:   after about two and a half weeks it went down to my lungs and, you know, it goes into your head and your throat and in your chest --
L:  And a horrible cough, right?
R:  -- and I thought, "Oh, it must be gone", 'cause nothing happened for like two or three days, then all of a sudden I started noticing that I couldn't take a full breath --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I started to br- -- I couldn't breathe.
L:  Oh gee.
R:  I'd get it --my -- my lung capacity got smaller and smaller, and I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to die soon". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm talking like this, I'll be going -- and I couldn't cough anything up.  Nothing was coming up.  It was just growing in my lungs --
L:  Oh . 
R:  -- and, um, at the same time this woman from my church says to me, "We're gonna go over to so and so's house and learn how to make colloidal silver" and I was like ...
