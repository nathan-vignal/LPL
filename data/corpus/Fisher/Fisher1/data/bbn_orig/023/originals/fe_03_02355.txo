L:  Hello, my name is Jennifer.
R:  Hi, my name is Patty.
L:  How are you today, Patty?
R:  Oh, just fine.
L:  Good, good.  Uh, I guess we're supposed to jump right into the topic here.  I've not done this before, so I --
R:  Um --
L:  I guess we will.
R:  Me either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you -- do you wanna go first, or ...?
R:  Um, it -- it doesn't really matter, um, what we supposed to see which was worse; drinking, overeating, not exercising, I guess which was worse for your he- --
L:  Gossiping, uh, things like that, yes.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- I guess if you're talking about healthwise, um, um, I guess drinking in excess would be the worst thing.  Or would it --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- be overeating? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, g- I don't know, um, o- of the choices that were given, I would have to pick gossiping.  Of course it doesn't affect your health particularly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I -- I do consider it the worst of everything that they, you know, mention because I think so much damage is done by irresponsible gossip.
R:  Well, I think gossip in itself maybe is not the worst thing.  As you said, irresponsible gossip, yes.  I think gossiping to some extent keeps our social, um, kind of people in line because if there's no gossiping then nobody has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any kind of social --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- cues to answer to, so to speak.  But irresponsible gossiping, yes I agree.  Just slander and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- being malicious.
L:  Yeah, your -- your point is well taken.  I guess it depends on, you know, to some degree on how you define gossiping and -- and just an exchange of information, certainly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's nothing wrong with that.  It's when you get into --
R:  M- --
L:  -- uh, passing along rumors and particularly with, you know, things that can be harmful or hurtful to other people.
R:  Right, m- maliciousness, yes.
L:  Right, right.
R:  A- and just trying to, um, look good to somebody else by passing along some information.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Or -- or to --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- make people think that, you know, you're smart or whatever because you have certain information that they don't, or something.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- I think -- I think gossip in itself has to be treated, um, as something that -- that if you pass it -- pass something along it's -- as information and not as something that could be really hurtful to somebody, so, yeah, I agree.
L:  Exactly.  But --
R:  But --
L:  -- i- infor- informational, I mean, we all do it.  We couldn't live without doing it, you know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- for that matter, but, uh --
R:  I -- right.
L:  -- just as far as, "Oh, so and so's pregnant and not married or whatever" I [LAUGH] I --
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Right, right, well just --
L:  -- think that --
R:  -- slander -- slander, you know, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and just being mean about it, but a- as far as the other ones go, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know myself personally, alcohol in -- in with people that I've known or whatever has played a huge role in, um, disrupting lives and causing a lot of chaos. 
L:  Oh, abso- -- well, my -- my mother and my brother both drank and drugged themselves to death, so --
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  Uh, mother was fifty six when she died and my brother was thirty and --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- uh, I mean, that -- that scared me no end.  Now --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- my husband and I do drink socially, but --
R:  W- --
L:  -- we are very careful with it because like I say I -- I've had some really bad experiences with my family.
R:  Well, so-, you know, social drinking is one thing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being responsible is another.  I -- I'm of course talking about the, um, just destruction of the family --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because somebody c- --
L:  Like happened in our case, yes.
R:  Right, yeah, my, uh, my children's father he's, uh, been in a lot of trouble.  He's been in d- you know, prison and that kind of thing just from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the drinking aspect and of course we're split up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  So, yes, this is good.  But, um, yeah, so I -- I think that -- I never really dealt with it too much when I was growing up 'cause my immediate family didn't drink but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as I -- as I've gotten older I can see that it's pretty detrimental to a lot of families.
L:  Exactly.  Well, uh, let me just ask you, out of curiosity if you don't mind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But based on your experiences and your observations, what do you think of the prevailing, uh, definition of alcoholism?  Uh, basically that it's an inherited trait and that, you know, i- if you start down the road of alcoholism that, uh, you know, it can only get worse, you can never get better.
R:  Um, I think that genetics does play a role in being predisposed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, to the likelihood of having a problem with addiction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just as a lot of -- uh, you can be predisposed to a lot of different genetic things.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think that you have to recognize that fact --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, have to be more vigilant in dealing with it or finding other means to, um, you know, learn how to deal with it.
L:  Exactly, course that -- that's been my case is, you know, knowing that there's a predisposition there I have to really --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- watch things, um --
R:  Right.
L:  What -- what about the theory that, you know, once somebody begins drinking too much that they have to stop altogether.  The Alcoholics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Anonymous thing that they can never have another drink.  Do you think that's valid, or not?
R:  Um, I think -- I would probably say, personally I believe probably ninety five percent, yes.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think there might be a small number of people, um, that -- that may not be the case for but I think overall, yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That that probably is true.
L:  Very interesting.
R:  Um, 'cause I've seen it -- I've seen it happen so many times, um, you know, within my --
L:  Mm.
R:  My own circle that I know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That, uh, they stop and then, you know.  So, I -- I can't say blanket statement, yes, but I would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have to say, "Pretty much, yeah".
L:  Yeah, but by the same token I -- I also have observed, you know, one in my family and also in my friends, uh, those that -- who can't seem to stop, you know, the downward cycle, but by the same token I have also seen others that, you know, were able to do --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and then, you know, get to a point where they could drink socially too, so --
R:  Well, I -- I think -- I think that's awesome.  I -- I think when -- when starting out on the road they probably have to decide that they're not going to drink at all any more, period --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and maybe, maybe, you know, somewhere if they get in a different place in their -- in their head [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Only they know where that's at. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause I sure don't, but, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  That -- that, you know, then that would be something that they would have to deal with.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  A- and, and --
L:  -- if -- if we get off the gossip end of it and just go back to what's detrimental to your health, I think I would tend to agree with you that, you know, probably, uh, excessive drinking is --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just about the worst.
R:  Yes, I -- I agree and -- and as far as the overeating goes I -- I think I can relate to that pretty strongly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] As my -- as my family is, um, very much genetically inclined to be, uh, heavy. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, mine -- mine is as well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, uh, I -- I fought my weight for years and years and years and years --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but the older I got, the more I took on the, uh, contours of my grandmother and there's been --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very little I could do to stop it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, there -- y- you know, actually that's because, um, right about seven months ago I just had a gastric bypass done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I've lost a hundred and ten pounds and --
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  Absolutely, but, you know, people are -- people are like, "Well, that was drastic".  It's like, yes, but sometimes when you have a problem, you have to have drastic measures, whether it be alcoholism, or overeating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or whatever the case may be.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, um, and they're like, "Well, I couldn't do that", and it's like, "Well, you didn't". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  It's like, "I can't -- I couldn't have done that", because there are a lot of limitations or it is very strict.  It is very hard sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, um, as far as the over eating's concerned I think that's a very much a genetic problem with your metabolism and also psychological with depression and et cetera like that.
L:  Well, I -- I tend to think, you know, from my observation that it's more of a, you know, genetic predisposition than anything else because --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- I do know that there have been times in my life -- if I am literally willing to almost starve myself to death --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I mean eat absolutely nothing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, I can lose, you know, weight and maintain a weight loss --
R:  And then gain it back plus some.
L:  -- but if I approach anything like normal eating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just, you know, start gaining weight and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- conversely I have some, uh, very thin friends who put away three times as much food as I do and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- aren't any more active, you know.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH] So.
R:  And I'm -- I'm saying the metabolism itself I think is pretty much g- genetic, but as far as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as overeating like feeling that you have to eat even when you're not hungry --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is more of a mind thing 'cause, I mean, I know I've done it before.  I'm not hungry, I'm either bored or I'm stressed or --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- whatever the case may be and I'm putting something in my mouth. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, "Oh, I don't need to be eating this.  Ooh, this is good". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, how about smoking?  Where do you rank that?
R:  Um, smoking?  I consider that pretty detrimental.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think -- I -- I have a mother right now who is, uh, has emphysema --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, she has been, you know, in the hospital several times this year and she still has her cigarettes in her freezer to keep 'em fresh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.
R:  But, I also know that they're highly, highly addictive.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And -- and, um, 'cause I have friends and stuff.  They're like, "I wish I never would've started". 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I have to say that, um, it's, you know, if we can stop, you know, especially children and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- young adults from starting in the first place, then that would be the best that --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  So, you never smoked at all?
R:  Uh, I'm -- I've smoked occasionally, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like when I've been drinking or something, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not, yeah, yeah, not
