L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] My name is Carla.
R:  Hi, this is John.  This is very interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] A first for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, same here.  How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, uh, my daughter actually.
R:  Oh, I f- -- yeah, I found out through my wife, actually.  She, uh, referred me.
L:  Uh, uh, okay.
R:  Uh, so did you hear the topic of conversation?
L:  Well, I was trying to remember what the personal habits that we're supposed to decide which is worst --
R:  Correct, yes --
L:  -- or talk about which is worse.
R:  Which is worse out of a list of five, I think it was.
L:  Oh, you counted.  That's --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- better than me.  I was answering a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- FedEx at the same time.  Um, [LAUGH] uh, the only one that caught my eye, blatantly, was smoking, but that's because --
R:  Smoking, okay --
L:  'Cause I --
R:  Well, I wholeheartedly agree on that one. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't smoke and I -- I get rather irritated at, uh, people who think that's a -- a, uh, a right.  
R:  I agree because, you know, it impinges on people, you know, that are in the vicinity of you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think so, and, um ...  Well, I live here in New York and they actually just proposed a non smoking ban on all bars and I couldn't, you know, be happier about that agreement. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they did that here in Colorado too.
R:  Oh, they did?  Okay.
L:  But, uh, it was supposed to take effect January first --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and instead, what happened was I -- I think a whole coalition of Marlborough men showed up.
R:  Oh, I see. [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, [LAUGH] overturned it.  Uh, basically put it on hold so it has --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- it has -- they have to go back and collect it -- 'cause ess- -- it was basically different city councils; like Denver, Colorado Springs.  Pueblo passed it.  Those are three major cities --
R:  That's right, yes.
L:  -- in Colorado and, uh, uh, my understanding is Pueblo's is still in a- -- they did take theirs into affect.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  Because they didn't have a -- a large enough signatory to -- to turn -- overturn the -- to get city council turn it back, but I'm not sure.  But Denver and Colorado Springs, forget it.  I mean the people just swamped City Hall and they decided to put it on hold to get the signatures put but it, uh --
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah, so it's --
R:  Wow, 'cause I always thought of Denver as being a very, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- health conscious city.  Actually, I think a lot of people, you know, love the outdoors there.  You know, you would think they would be all for it.
L:  O- --
R:  Like --
L:  Have you ever been to Denver?
R:  I -- I -- well, actually I ski all the time in Denver.  I'm -- I'm a avid skier and snowboarder.
L:  Oh, 'cause certain times of the year the pollution -- the air pollution is so horrible.
R:  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, up until about ten years ago the air pollution was just a huge, huge smog over the city.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, really they had to, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- enact a whole bunch of, uh, laws to try to cut down on some of the pollution --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and start cleaning up business and that's changed, so now we don't see the smog nearly so much --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  But it was ugly.  It was -- you couldn't see the -- I mean, you'd see yellow mountains.  I mean, it was terrible.  Uh, but they've done a good job turning it around, so -- but I would've thought they would've, uh, enacted the no smoking in the bars too, but they didn't.  But there are some restaurants that, because their national chains, have opted to adopt that policy --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and so those do exist independently here, but, uh, trying to get into one of them [LAUGH] for a meal --
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  I- is at least an hour away.  They're very popular because of that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have big signs as you enter saying, uh, "This is a no smoking property", so -- like the outback restaurants are w- -- are a chain.
R:  Oh, the steakhouse, right?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's a whole chain and the whole chain nationwide is no smoking throughout the whole restaurant and bar.
R:  Yeah, the law went into effect here on April first, so all bars and restaurants are off limits for smoking nowadays.
L:  Well, that'll make visiting New York in September more pleasant for me.
R:  Oh, are you coming in September?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you'll love it here. [LAUGH] It's the best weather wise too, in September.
L:  Oh, well that's not my friend -- that's not what my friends are telling me, given all the snow.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's quite humid in September but it doesn't rain that much, so that's a good thing.
L:  Oh, it's a good time.
R:  Yeah, that's -- so, it's a good time to come.
L:  Okay, that sounds great.
R:  And you'll breathe easier in the bars [LAUGH] and the restaurants. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's funny because you see a lot of people congregating nowadays in the -- in the front entrance.
L:  Well, you know, and I -- yeah, that's -- that's kinda way it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the no smoking restaurants around here, but I came from California last year. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so I was very accustomed to no smoking.  I mean -- and nobody even gives it a second thought.  There's a small disgruntled crowd that doesn't like it --
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  But it's small.
R:  Yes, very much so.
L:  I mean, smoke- smoking isn't -- isn't, uh, uh, looked at very highly there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's -- it's -- it's really the opposite.  It's the kids are frowned on from starting smoking.  I mean, it's huge and my understanding is I read a -- I think I read a research report that showed that, uh, uh, some of the disease issues associated with cancer th- -- I mean, um, with smoking has significantly dropped, but I don't -- I don't know if that's for sure.
R:  Hm, yeah --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- I -- I didn't read about that, but --
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  -- I'd be surprised though, you know, because I think that smoking is on the -- on the rise actually.
L:  Yeah, well you won't find it in any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- public -- any public place actually --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in California.  It's so pleasant.
R:  Are you originally from California?
L:  No, no I j- -- I was just a transplant there from Oregon to Colorado, to -- to California and that was one of the pleasant surprises in moving to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- California.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, I'm originally from California, the San Francisco Bay area.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yes, and miss it.  You know, I wish I -- I think I'll probably go back one day, you know, to start a family 'cause, you know, it's hard to live in the city in New York and -- and raise kids here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  It's really tough.
L:  San Francisco's nice.  I was there just a few months ago.
R:  Yeah.  I love it there.
L:  Yeah, that's nice.  Well, I don't even remember what the other vices were.  What were they?
R:  Well, the other ones were, uh, lack of exercise, uh, eating poorly, uh, drinking excessively and I forgot what the first one was but, you know, those are -- you know, those can only harm the p- --
L:  Yourself.
R:  -- the person that does -- yourself, right.  They won't --
L:  Well, actually that's not true.  
R:  Well, your loved ones too.  That's true.
L:  Well, your loved ones and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- also as you enter the health care system [LAUGH] because of the outpouring --
R:  That's right.
L:  Uh, uh, then it does cost us all.
R:  Correct.
L:  It can only harm the person who has it specifically, but it can cost society tremendously.
R: Yes, a bundle.  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, a bundle, a bundle.  Especially, uh, eating wrong and -- and or -- or eating poorly and no exercise because they'll just increase the old, uh, heart attack factor.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  And that just -- that's very expensive.
R:  And that's a tough issue to solve too because, you know, it -- it is free will.  People are -- are free to do whatever they want.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So ...
L:  Absolutely -- so, then what do you think of the healthy people campaign that the NIH keeps trying to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think for a -- the last decade they've been trying to ground swell this healthy people campaign and I've yet to see any advertising in any --
R:  Yeah, I -- I've yet to see it.
L:  -- city, anywhere.
R:  I think they're just -- they're being inundated with all the [LAUGH] -- I -- I don't think it'll --
L:  They spend a lot of money but everything just seems to me it goes down in paper or printed somewhere and I don't see the programs.
R:  Yeah, neither do I.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I kinda wondered --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about that and yet they -- then they get plaud- applauded for creating programs but I keep thinking, "Is it -- is it really a worthwhile program if nobody joins in?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.  It's a paper trave.  
R:  Yep.
L:  That's all it is.  But, you're right.  Doesn't hurt anybody, although I do appreciate healthy people, period.
R:  Yeah, I think they're more pleasant to be around. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I do too 'cause I think it a- affects your mental disposition --
R:  Sure.
L:  Well, certainly if you're not exercising you're not sending off any of those happy hormones to the brain on a daily basis.
R:  Of course, right.  I mean, they said that one of the -- the best way to combat depression and, you know, mental illness is to exercise and to eat right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, y- -- that's right.  The endorphins that you release I think that -- that those help tremendous- --
L:  Yeah, so if more people exercise we'd have a happier world. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's right. [LAUGH] Do you engage in a lot of physical activity?
L:  Um, I usually do work out at least four or five times a week.  I --
R:  Oh, good.  Good for you.
L:  Yeah, how about you?
R:  Yeah, I try to do that.  I belong to a gym and I play tennis outdoors here in Central Park.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  Yeah, it's very -- it's a beautiful day today.  It's about seventy two and sunny today here in New York.
L:  Wow, we've got --
R:  Very nice.
L:  -- very overcast and about sixty, or fifty five --
R:  Well, f- --
L:  -- outside.
R:  Well, for once we're warmer than you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well the w- -- our weather's been playing tricks on us 'cause yesterday it was like seventy five.  It was gorgeous and --
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  And then two days ago it snowed, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It can't decide what it wants to do.  I keep thinking today, "Should I plant flowers, ah --"
R:  Mm, [LAUGH] leave it.
L:  "-- think I'll wait another week". [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's the way this State is.  I mean, we've had snow as late as the last week of May.
R:  That's -- but the resorts are -- are they still open, or are they closed?  The ski resorts.
L:  N- no, I think they're open 'cause they've just -- they got a whole bunch more snow within the last --
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  -- week or two.  I -- I saw, uh, I saw a lot of skiing.  I mean, they always, you know, put that on the news whenever they get some fresh powder.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I think within just the last week or so 'cause we got snow at the lower elevation.  It just disappears, but at the higher elevation --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was, uh, good enough that they were actually trying to get people up on the slopes.  But, uh, you know, ironically of all the exercise I could possibly do in this State, that's the one I don't do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like, uh, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] Going down a hill at a very [LAUGH] fast speed --
R:  Sounds kinda [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, this -- this is not the exercise that I think it would be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  and then -- and then a few people I've known who've broken collar bones or --
R:  Or wrists.
L:  -- or multiple fractures in the legs --
R:  Yep.
L:  It just scares me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my wife just, uh, tore her ligaments in her knee this season snow boarding with me.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, it was a freak accident.  She slipped on a patch of ice and went down pretty hard and, you know, that -- that was it.
L:  Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
R:  Yeah, so she's on -- she was on crutches for the first month and now she's, uh, you know, in rehab physical therapy.  
L:  Wow.
R:  Maybe, you know, maybe skiing should be one of the [LAUGH] dangerous activities. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and it bothers me, you know, if you take it up when you're younger it -- y- then even if you have accidents you heal well and fast --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But the older y- -- older you are and when you're
