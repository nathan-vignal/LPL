R:  Hello? 
L:  Oh.
R:  Hi I'm Deanna. 
L:  Hi Deanna. 
R:  [LAUGH] Is this your first phone call? 
L:  Yes it is. 
R:  Okay.  Um, I'm quite surprised to get the call.  Cause I just signed up yesterday.  So let's see, um, our topics were personal habits? 
L:  Personal habits. 
R:  But then it said, uh, what do we think is worse? 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And the choices were over eating -- Hm --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  What did you say? 
L:  I said that could be one. 
R:  That could be one -- but you know, I've gotta think of alcohol.
L:  Alcohol.
R:  How it could potentially impact so many more around you. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  And, uh, I am a big coffee drinker so I guess I'm guilty of the caffeinated stuff. 
L:  Yeah.  Coffee drinking that -- that'd  -- that could be is caffeine d- --. 
R:  Yeah, I would have to say that personally I would eliminate the coffee.  I see that as the least detrimental and so that leaves me with what, um, --
L:  Reading and, uh, -- was it reading, uh, the other one. 
R:  Oh, was one of them -- I couldn't hear one of them.
L:  One of them was reading. 
R:  Reading? 
L:  Reading yeah. 
R:  Oh.
L:  [inaudible] reading.
R:  I would have to say, uh, no. 
L:  Um.
R:  So we're looking at what for me personally -- what about you have you eliminated any? 
L:  Yeah I eliminated the, um, alcohol -- the alcohol and the, uh, -- over eating that's what I -- I come up with. 
R:  As what  as, uh, the -- the worst? 
L:  Worst. 
R:  Alcohol and over eating? 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah do you have any history of alcoholism in you family or anything like that? 
L:  I'm a recovering alcoholic. 
R:  Are you? Oh, well then you definitely know the impacts --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and -- yeah. 
L:  [inaudible] right now. 
R:  Pardon me?
L:  I got seventeen years sobriety right now. 
R:  Oh, for -- God bless you -- that is amazing.  That's amazing because you know what all of the external stuff doesn't go away so it's a constant --
L:  Oh, it doesn't. 
R:  Do you find that it's gotten easier for you? 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It has?
L:  Yeah but you feel better [inaudible] one day at a time. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Cause I'll tell you it just takes one time and you can pick it off. 
R:  Well you know it's funny cause I guess the way we're programs -- plus for alcoholism they say so much of it is genetic and if you, uh, have already had it I guess in your system I imagine you'd be even more so for that but -- I wish you all of the best on you continued success -- I know that's, uh, -- has got to be challenging. 
L:  It's a disease. 
R:  Yeah that's what I understand from what little I know about it.  But, um, --
L:  I think, um, [inaudible] pictures and everything else [inaudible] somebody's inside [inaudible]
R:  Oh, for, um, -- yeah well. 
L:  Your liver. 
R:  You mean right -- you mean physically as well. 
L:  Yeah eats you right up. 
R:  Mhm -- which brings up another good point why that's, uh, -- I guess in our opinion the most detrimental. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Because aside from what it can do to you emotionally and spiritually and physically.
L:  That's it. 
R:  Socially it seems to have the most cons against it yeah. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Excuse me? 
L:  And it can put you in a denial state. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah. 
L:  You think of it as -- you know what the heck it's not gonna bother me you know. 
R:  Well you know and not just alcoholism -- I think that's probably true of addiction in -- in general. 
L:  Yeah that's an addiction. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Drugs are the same way.  They [inaudible] how about drugs. 
R:  Yeah.  And it's funny because, um, with the drugs -- I mean it doesn't have to be the ser- -- well I guess what some people would consider the serious drugs you know.  [LAUGH] It could happen from just, um, --
L:  The way they should of [inaudible] drugs and alcohol. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can drink alcohol and take a -- take an aspirin you can get -- you're gonna get a kick out of it sometimes. 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Oh, yeah sometimes [inaudible] if you've got medicine.
R:  Huh.
L:  Alcohol what -- you can get a kick off it.  Oh, yeah you get [inaudible] that's why they tell you not to drink alcohol when you take your medicine. 
R:  Oh, well I guess that's -- especially with something like an aspirin or something as well -- yeah I mean aside from it chemicals and everything, but I would think like something as simple as an aspirin -- but they say what -- that it thins out your blood so I imagine the effects are much higher. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Yeah.  See all of the things that you learn on these phone calls.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So this is your first phone call? 
L:  Yes it is. 
R:  And when did you sign up. 
L:  My wife signed up -- actually my wife [inaudible]
R:  Oh, and the phone rang and she handed it to you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, and I -- no she's not here, she's working right now. 
R:  Mm.
L:  But the phone rang and I started answering the [LAUGH]
R:  Well at least you knew what it was about.  I just signed up last -- 
L:  I don't know much about it -- she told me about it earlier and, um, somebody calls -- you know just do the survey for me. 
R:  How funny because it -- I mean it's true they didn't give you much information -- I -- they didn't give me -- you know -- it's -- and I even checked up on it a little bit -- I realised it's supposed to have a link or it's a study with the University of Pennsylvania. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  And, uh, I think a lot of it has to do with, um, speech and such -- but aside from that and it's a good reminder because I haven't mentioned it to my husband yet, so [LAUGH] I'm going to be stepping out this evening so I better prepare him. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most of its just plain common sense. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of it -- you know you just --
R:  Talk.
L:  -- whatever your topic is you've just gotta -- what they're topic is.  What the topic gonna be, and go from there and -- you know whatever they're gonna have. 
R:  You know but for me it was a departure from when they said personal habits. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  To -- to what you know you consider to be -- I can't even remember what the question was -- the most detrimental or the most harmful or what do you -- 
L:  The most, uh, worst.  
R:  What the worst thing is in your opinion -- yeah. 
L:  Yeah most worst things in your life -- opinion in your life.  That was [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd have to agree -- you know and I mean I think you really punctuated it by telling me -- you know your own personal experience with it because it really helps to bring it in. 
L:  You got your over eating -- over eating you've a lot of over eaters right now.  You know the weight classes and everything else. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Weight watchers and all of that stuff. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. 
R:  And so much of that over eating I'm sure is, um, a result of certain pains and certain, uh, certain emotional baggage that you have or problems that you've had -- you know I find myself even recently I've never had a weight problem but recently I've noticed that --
L:  Right now.  I got one right now and I'm a diabetic. 
R:  Oh, to boot. 
L:  The boot, yeah [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  Geez -- see --
L:  I had two.

L:  I'm two thirty five right now. 
R:  Right.
L:  I'm way over obesity.
R:  Right.
L:  I have obesity right now that's why -- that's why they -- you know over eating that's -- that's the thing unless you're, uh, you know -- you got to control your diabetic -- your calories and stuff. 
R:  Yeah. I've just found and I guess it is sort of a -- a weakness in me that, uh, with certain challenges lately and with stress --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I find myself going for a lot of junk and sugars and eliminating other things and then just continually -- compulsively really just -- you know putting things in my mouth [LAUGH] eating and eating and eating and it's got nothing to do with hunger and eating it's just nervousness. 
L:  I have a lot of stress and depression [inaudible]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah and that's what I'm recognizing in myself. 
L:  [inaudible] a lot of faith. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You ain't got to face the emotional -- you know -- you're gonna lose it.
R:  If you don't have what? 
L:  If you don't have faith. 
R:  Well you know and that's -- that's a good that's a very interesting point that you bring up because I am a Christian and even that I've been thinking lately -- I've been disappointed in the last couple of days and my attitude. 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Because I have that -- you know so I've really been convicted. 
L:  Bitterness.  [LAUGH]
R:  Pardon me? 
L:  It's called bitterness.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and -- and you know and I -- it's so true you have that and it's a slap in his face if you don't [LAUGH] if you don't really learn to rely on him and know that he's in charge and control and everything else -- so I'm sure I do have control issues with which, uh, also fall into this personal habits category.
