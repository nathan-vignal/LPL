L:  Well, hello, my name's Todd.
R:  Hi, I'm Danny [NOISE].
L:  How's it going?
R:  Danny.
L:  [NOISE] How are you?
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good. [COUGH] So, what do you think about the topic? [NOISE]
L:  Um, it's interesting.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  W- w- what do you think about it?
R:  [MN] Uh, well, I -- I really hadn't given it too much thought, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't typically get sick when the seasons change, so I --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, neither do I.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I haven't -- I've -- I've been very --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- fortunate this year.  Haven't had any colds at all.
L:  [MN].
R:  I do have some problems with, uh, allergies occasionally, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's about it.  I haven't been having any, uh, any problems with, uh, colds or flu or anything.  I got a flu shot this year [NOISE] and I guess it must have worked pretty well, 'scuse me, so, um, --
L:  Yeah, I've gotten the flu shot before my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I -- I don't know if I like those anymore.
R:  You don't know if you like what?
L:  I don't -- I don't think I like those flu shots anymore.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Why?
L:  Just 'cause I -- I -- well, I -- I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I live in warm weather now so I don't get the flu very much often, so ... [MN]
R:  So, you don't think you'll get a flu shot again, huh?
L:  Yeah, probably not.
R:  [COUGH] Well, my doctor always recommends it. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] I -- I think its, um, I think they're good for people who, uh, work around large numbers of people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If you're, you know, if you're in a situation where you're coming in contact, like in a hospital or in a situation where you're meeting -- where you're dealing with the -- dealing with the public a lot.  I think it's a good idea.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I didn't -- it didn't make me sick or anything like that when I got it.  You know, I didn't get the last part of the, um, question.  What was it -- well, it -- the second question was, I think, what do you do to keep yourself well or something?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I do exercise and running.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, what else --
R:  You're a -- you're a jogger?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A runner?
L:  Yeah, and I live in a mountainous area so, uh, I do a lot of exercise, cardio stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, maybe biking this summer, so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What --what about you?
R:  Seems to keep you pretty well, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I take my vitamin C every morning.
R:  Now, that's something I don't do.  I -- [MN] I have taken vitamin C maybe a couple of times here and there but not very -- not -- not on a regular basis or anything and, you know, what I do is I try to drink, uh, lots of orange juice, eat lots of fruit --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, proper variety of fruits and also I exercise as well.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, walking, running, um, maybe some tennis, uh, here and there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Bowling, try to stay active and y- y- -- I think that there have been studies that have been done that show that exercise definitely helps to improve the, uh, or boost the immune -- immune system, so I feel like that's --
L:  Very definitely.
R:  -- pretty good, and then eating healthy.
L:  Yeah, eating healthy is good.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and, um, I guess --
L:  Have ever, like, exercis- -- have you ever tried that Tae Bo?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  You ever tried the Tae Bo?  Do you know what Tae Bo is?
R:  Y- well, it's some type of thing, it's kind of like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- karate or something like that or Ju Jitsu --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I'm familiar with it.  I -- I -- I've never done it, never taken the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lessons or anything.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So, how does it work?  W- how is it different from say karate, judo, uh ...?
L:  Uh, it's to music and it's, uh, it's more fast paced.
R:  [NOISE] So, it's, oh, it's a- now Tae Bo is really kind of like --
L:  Little billy boy[?].
R:  -- a lot of times it's offered in conjunction with, uh, aerobics?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly, it's a mix --
R:  It's similar to aerobics.
L:  Yeah, it's a mix.
R:  Okay, so it's really not for self defence.  It's really for the exercise, right?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, that's what I was thinking.  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  At first I was thinking when you said Tae Bo, I was thinking it would be like judo or like a defence, a- a- certain type of -- of sport, similar to karate or something like that --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- for self defence purposes or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But no, I've never tried that, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you do Tae Bo on a regular basis or just every now and then, or ...?
L:  Every now and then, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you think it burns a lot --
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah, ju- -- I s- -- I'm on a speakerphone now.  I was asking do you think it burns a lot of calories when you do the Tae Bo?
L:  Oh, yeah, I think it does.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good work out.
R:  Well, I like the ca- it's good to kind of change up a little because sometimes you get burned out on walking, on running --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, you know.  I kind of switch up.  I'm -- I might -- I try to jog maybe a couple of times a week and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll walk for an hour.
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  And then go biking, you know, maybe once or tw- -- maybe on the weekend go biking and do different things so I don't get too bored with the same thing, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  That seems to work pretty well for me.  O- other than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I mean --
L:  Have you gotten sick at all this year?
R:  No, I haven't.  I've -- I've been very, very, uh, fortunate in that I haven't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- had any -- any colds or flu or --
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- no allergies or anything.  I mean, well, I've had, uh, um, allergy problems but, you know, the sneezing, the all of that but runny nose, but normally I just take, um, some allergy medicine, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't even take that on a regular basis, but I just take it whenever I need it, and that seems to knock it out.  
L:  Well --
R:  I've been pretty fortunate.  What about you?
L:  Yeah, yeah, same.
R:  Have you been sick this year or...?
L:  Little bit, not really.
R:  Okay.
L:  So...
R:  That's a good thing.  So, what do you do?  Do you do any of the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- natural remedies or herbs when you get sick, when you start to get sick?
L:  Um, oh, I just [several inaudible words].
R:  I'm sorry.  Can't hear you.
L:  -- try -- oh, yeah, I tried them.  I tried them.  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Which ones have you tried?
L:  [NOISE] Um, what have I tried?  I've tried, oh, I've tried ginseng, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's a pretty good product.
R:  Okay.
L:  Natural herb.
R:  What is ginseng supposed to do?
L:  Oh, it helps the memory.
R:  Okay .
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] do you think it helps you?
L:  Yeah, I think it -- yeah.  I think it has helped me a little bit.  Yeah.
R:  Something like that is -- there's very -- to me I guess very difficult, seems like it could be v- difficult to engage in that kind of thing.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But, um, I've tried echinacea.  Have you ever, er, tried that?
L:  Oh, yeah, I heard about that, yeah. 
R:  Yeah, w- now what have you hea- been told that it was used for?
L:  Um, memory also.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Well, with th- -- why -- why -- why are you taking it?
R:  Echinacea, no I've taken it.  I -- I don't -- well currently I'm not taking it but like at the onset of a cold --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of times, well, a couple of times I've taken it, you know, like just when I've initially get a symptom or two like when I start to feel a cold coming on I'll start taking it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think you take like two or three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- echinacea capsules a day or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it actually it -- it doesn't get rid of the cold but it reduces the length of the cold.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  So, um, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and then I read somewhere that -- that it actually is not that good for you so I don't take it on a regular basis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it seemed to work for me when I took it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have some now but I -- but I don't really take it, you know.  It's just sitting in the, uh, medicine cabinet for right now.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  I'm not really much for all those natural remedies.  I -- I try some of them though.
L:  Yeah, and what else have you tried?
R:  I've tried, um, what's this other thing?  Um, s- -- well, not really natural stuff but I -- I take oat bran tablets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do -- I -- I take oat bran supplements and, um, I've tried spirulina as a -- spirulina is a, um, appetite suppressant because I was trying to lose ...
