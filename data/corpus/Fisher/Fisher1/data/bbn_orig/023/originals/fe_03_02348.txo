R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  Good, how you doing?
R:  All right.
L:  Are you on a speaker phone?
R:  Yes, are you?
L:  No, I'm not.  I
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's okay.  You -- you can stay on it.
R:  No, it's all right.
L:  It's fine.
R:  So --
L:  So, uh, where are you from?  Are you from Boston?
R:  No, I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Get out of here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How'd you hear about the project?
R:  Oh, I, um, heard from a friend on line.
L:  Oh, very cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Interesting.  Uh, all right, so I guess -- what's the topic?  What do you --
R:  Going to --
L:  -- dislike most?
R:  Yeah, I think gossiping is the worst.
L:  You think -- more so than smoking?
R:  Well, yeah, because the gossiping, people cannot defend themselves if they're -- if they're not around.
L:  But what if they are around?
R:  Well, if they are around it wouldn't be gossiping, right?
L:  It wouldn't be?
R:  No.
L:  It just be like telling someone to their face?
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Interesting.
R:  What do you think?
L:  I think it's smoking, personally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Only because it's -- it's really one of the only consumer habits, you know -- you know, I don't know, anything a c- -- a consumer does --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that is legal but still harms other people.
R:  True.
L:  For instance like second hand smoke has been proven to cause these effects in children whose parents' smoke and I'm -- I'm assuming if you work in a bar or whatever you have higher health risk than the average person.
R:  That's v- [COUGH] very fair.
L:  And it just seems like it's a little unfair to the other person to me.
R:  Very true.  Yeah, very true.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you're right, gossiping is pretty bad.
R:  Yeah, because they can't defend themselves, you know, but, um, but, um -- is this the first time you're doing one of these calls?
L:  Uh, actually I did one yesterday.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I kinda work for the company who's doing these tests and they wanted -- they needed more people to do it, so I figured I'd sign up.
R:  Oh, it's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you -- do you -- are you in the technology field, or you just heard about it from a friend, or ...
R:  I'm in the [COUGH] -- excuse me, I have a little cold.
L:  That's okay.
R:  But, um, I have, um -- I'm in the, um, customer, um, service.  I do customer service and, um, you could say it's technology also.
L:  Right.  Which company you work for?
R:  Well, I work for a local company.  I don't wanna say. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, that's fine.
R:  Um, but it's, um, very known.  It's a cable company.
L:  Oh, right on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very nice.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Very cool.  Inter- -- yeah, I find it interesting with -- I -- I talked to someone yesterday from like Illinois or something and she just was, you know, a regular person who just called in.  I find it pretty amazing --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- 'cause [COUGH] wi- -- the company I work for is -- and I guess I'm up to working on it in the future -- we're -- we're actually gonna be looking at all the data and figuring out what it means and helping to train the models and whatnot.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, sounds interesting.
L:  It's very interesting.  It's interesting stuff.
R:  Well, I've been do- doing surveys for several years, but, um, I never did anything like this.
L:  Yeah, it's very -- do you know sort of what's going on with the project, or ...?
R:  Well -- well I have an idea, but, um, not really, if you -- you wanna explain it, or ...?
L:  Yeah, I mean what's -- what's happening is -- is that, um -- I work for -- I work in a speech recognition division.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in order to make a lot of the -- the -- in order to make a lot of the systems work, you have to generate these models that sort of have a certain vocabulary in 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you figure out the traits of the vocabulary and then they sort of match it up to the, uh, the user's speech patterns in their voice and they try to get similarities between what a user's word is, that he says, he or she says, and then matches it to a word that's kind of already in your vocabulary, say.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, by getting all these people to talk about things and just getting different dialects and, um, you know, different -- sort of like idioms that people talk about, you're just -- we're building this big model so that we can get conversational speech, you know.
R:  That -- that sounds good.
L:  Yeah, 'cause see right now with speech recognition is kind of hard for conversations like this because, uh, you know, there's just so many -- there's just so many rules and so many times we break the rules, but we can't -- but we can still understand each other.  That's hard for like an automated process, like a computer or whatever, to figure out what's really going on.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.  Science -- it's hard to understand science, right?
L:  What?
R:  Well, it's science.
L:  You're right.
R:  Yeah, and so i- you never can really follow the rules with science because you have to, you know, [NOISE] go on your own judgement like.  So, you're calling from -- like, um, right now you're located in a college?
L:  No, no, I'm at a company in Boston.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so, and, yeah, I guess the system -- I think that we're working with another school with this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who -- who is actually administering the Fisher project, but I think they're using some of our recognition models and stuff for this [LIPSMACK].  So, it's -- it's pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah, uh, what were the other options to that going -- I guess going back to the --
R:  Subject.
L:  Subject.  What were --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- the other options?  It was like gossiping, smoking, uh, I forgot the other ones.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it was --
R:  I just remember those two because --
L:  No drinking was one.
R:  Well, some drinking yes, you know.
L:  Uh.
R:  [COUGH] But I don't -- I -- I hardly ever drink.  I don't know about yourself, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I mean, the last time I drank maybe was, um, several months back.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, you know, occasional drink I guess is, um -- wouldn't harm anything if you, um, if you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a certain place with, um --
L:  As long as you're responsible about it and don't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, don't drive or anything.  That's ridiculous.
R:  No, that's true.  Because if you [COUGH], excuse me, if you drink and drive, you're taking other people's lives.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's very selfish.
L:  Very selfish.  Kinda like smoking.  No, I'm kidding.
R:  Yeah[?], well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, true.
L:  But I guess it's not as -- as extreme right now, but a lot of --
R:  Well --
L:  I think Boston is, uh -- they're out -- they're banning smoking in every public place.
R:  Well, they're trying to do that in New York.
L:  Yeah, I think it's already in effect though, isn't it?
R:  Mm, I'm not really sure --
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- the last time I think I heard w- it pretty much was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, if I'm not mistaken.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um --
L:  Uh, so do you live near the city or are you more in --
R:  I'm more in towards Philadelphia.
L:  Towards Philadelphia?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, very nice.
R:  I live in -- like in the shore area, so --
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  I've never really been to New Jersey, I don't think. 
R:  Mm.
L:   I've driven -- and I -- and I live so close, I mean, I just -- I've driven through the top of it and that was it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think Boston's like, how many hours away, five hours?
L:  From where, Boston?
R:  From New Jersey, you know, Jersey and Boston.
L:  Yeah, it's probably something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I used to live in Connecticut.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I was only maybe about two and a half hours away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  From cer- -- from certain areas, but, um ... Gossiping, huh?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gossiping number one.
L:  I can see that.  I think --
R:  I --
L:  -- that's -- that's respectable.
R:  Yeah, because I worked in a office for several years and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You see it.  You see it all the time.  And, well even -- and people cannot defend themselves.  So, I believe in if you -- if you wanna say something, if you are going to say it, you make sure you are able to say it in front of that person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean.  You don't ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that -- that only makes the most sense.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, I just -- yeah, you're right.  But I guess certain people are just sort of like -- and sometimes I do it myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's just like you kinda --
R:  We all do it.
L:  -- wanna get it off your chest and you maybe -- it -- I guess there's some sort of thrill of knowing something that other people don't know and then you kinda feel like the person in charge by telling other people.  I don't know.
R:  Well, I think it's part of our nature to gossip.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But what it is -- is that I feel like anything I have to say -- say about you, or anybody, I'm willing to say it to you also. [LAUGH]
L:  True, true, true.
R:  Yeah, so, um, I'm not known as a gossiper at my work. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think you should get employee of the month.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very good, um, what was I gonna say?  Something about, uh, [MN] ...  No, yeah, I think the reason why people gossip too, mostly, is that they kind of know that they don't have anyone to respond to them.  I mean, sure, people can stand up for their friends and whatnot, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when you say it face to face to someone and they're like, "No, I think you're wrong 'cause of this", and they're like, "Well, blah, blah, blah", then --
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  Then they freak out.  Anyways --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, so what else?  What else is new?  What's new in your life?
R:  [LAUGH] Nothing.  
L:  Nothing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's good, um --
R:  You know, but, um, let me see here.  So, I'm looking at the email that you guys sent.  Well, y- you know, your company sent me.
L:  Right.
R:  And um, like I say, when I did surveys throughout the past it's always, um, on line, or it's all this product testing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's never, um, you know, to this ex- -- to this extent.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Kind of different.
L:  Yeah, oh, now did they call you?  Do we participate in up to three calls, okay.
R:  Yeah, you're allowed to three -- uh, up to three c- calls.
L:  Right.
R:  They, um, they called me, um, before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- originally, but when I -- I started to talk nobody was there, so I'm just -- had dead air.  So, I figured, "I'm gonna go check my email, maybe they emailed me", 'cause they did say they would email me within seventy two hours, so, um, and that was right they had the email
