R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Loretta.
R:  I'm Teresa. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  Um, so, okay.  I'm -- I'm walking down the street so I apologize if, ah, there's loud noises, so 
L:  Oh, that's fine.  I can hear you all right.  Can you hear me okay?
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  Great.
R:  Um, okay, so it's personal hygiene, was this the topic?
L:  I think that they said the topic was personal habits and they were talking about --
R:  Oh, personal habits.  Right, and what -- what -- what you detest, or something?
L:  Um, it listed a few things to talk about, like gossiping, smoking --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- drinking, all that good stuff. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Um, let's see, what do you want to talk about first? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, how about exercising?  That was one of them.
R:  Okay, but what was it?  What do you not like in a person?  Or ?
L:  Well, it says like, what -- what's the worst of all these.
R:  Oh, what's the worst of all these.
L:  I don't really think -- I don't really think one is worse than the other, in a way, it's just kind of --
R:  Right, right.
L:  It depends on how it affects your situation.
R:  Right, such as exercising.  Um, I mean if you're -- I guess they're all kind of relating to one another, if you're not taking care of yourself you're going to be, you know, over drinking, over smoking, over weight.  You're not taking care of yourself, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I saw exercising -- I don't think it's a big problem unless you're not healthy [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Right, unless it -- it -- it's supposed to be more so whether you feel healthy and whether you're unhealthy, not so much how you weigh --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  That's what they say, at least. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it goes under over eating too.  You don't want to eat so much that --
R:  You're not healthy and get --
L:  You're not healthy.
R:  -- maintain -- right --
L:  Y- you have to eat good stuff, too.  You have to have all the nutrients and --
R:  Right.  Well I think -- I think all of these things are kind of, those things that, you know, you gotta do in moderation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Such as if you exercise too much then, you know, that's not good for you either.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, so I kind of like, missed -- I couldn't hear her when she said it, so I kind of like, missed the general, like, idea of it.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't think it really matters, because --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  As long as we talk about it in general. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  But yeah, it's kind of -- it's kind of like, there's a middle ground and it's not exactly the same for everyone because how much exercise or caffeine or whatever one person takes in just isn't going to be the same for the next person.  It's kind of like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- different for each individual.
R:  Right.  Um, but there's smoking, like, per se, I smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, but that -- that doesn't really necessarily bother me unless, you know, you're a chain smoker pushing your boundaries --
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  There's nothing -- there's nothing wrong with smoking unless you're being rude about it, like, there's some people who they don't care if their friends don't want smoke near them and they -- they smoke --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in their friend's houses without asking, I mean, if -- if you're rude about it [inaudible] but as long as you're not, if, you know, a personal choice, then it's okay.
R:  Right, right.  So, but you know, with this smoking ban it's obviously a lot better now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know [inaudible] and all, so um, let's see, what else was there?  Exercise --
L:  Gossip was one of them.
R:  Gossip.
L:  Gossip. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, gossip is interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  A lot of people say, "Oh, I don't gossip", or "Oh, gossip is bad" but most people do it.  A lot of people just --
R:  Yeah, I don't think you can help not gossiping really.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  As long as it doesn't, um, you know, as long as it's not excessive and you're not doing it to harm someone on purpose, obviously.
L:  Right.
R:  Gossip is okay.  So, um, I'm trying to think of [LAUGH] this is so funny.  Have you done these a lot?
L:  Have I done what?
R:  Done these calls a lot?
L:  Mm, this is my second one.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  I did one before, so the last topic was a little easier but this one's kind of a little funny --
R:  This is kind of, like, general, yeah.  Um -- the drinking.  What about drinking?  Do we talk about drinking?
L:  Sure. 
R:  Um --
L:  Um, I don't drink a whole lot --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, my -- my boyfriend is an ex alcoholic, so that's probably the reason why -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] right.
L:  [LAUGH] because, you know, he doesn't drink at all now --
R:  Right.
L:  But again, it just comes down to some people can and some people can't -- and it comes -- a lot of it comes down to control, I guess.
R:  Oh, complete- everything is about control --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in life.  So 
L:  Or the lack of it.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I mean, they're all really kind of related in that -- you know, in that way in that -- you know, the more you don't do it then the less you do it, you know, it -- it depends on your body in a way, you know, you are so --
L:  Right.  It -- it's [NOISE] It's all right. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'll walk away from it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you know, it's like, excluding the gossiping and ex- the things like smoking and drinking, I mean, it makes sense for there to be some laws about it, you know, because those things can affect other people, like drinking and driving --
R:  Of course, yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But at the same time you got to allow for personal freedom and stuff like that too.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I'm not really one to tell someone you can't do that, that's wrong, you know, it's their decision, so 
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm sorry, I'm like, trying to, like, think, ah.
L:  It's quite all right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's so funny, so, um.
L:  Is there -- is there anything, like [inaudible] things or other things, other, like, personal habits or, I guess personal [inaudible] things that -- that annoy you if someone else does it too much or doesn't do it at all?
R:  -- that annoy -- [PAUSE] personal habits, um, nail biting drives me crazy but that's not on it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Well anything, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I think my hardest thing about personal habits is, like, when you know, someone tells your friend or someone tells you, "Oh, I'm going to stop doing this, oh, tell me to stop doing this, and we're going to diet, so, you know, tell me to stop ah, eating", or some people exercise --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they want to you to do it and then, you know, they don't -- they don't maintain what th- you know, what they're, you know, what they want to do, actually.
L:  Right.
R:  And that drives me crazy because you become this, you know, psycho trying to help them when in fact do they really want to be changed, do they really want to curb their habits?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like that's, like, I've got -- a lot of my friends are like that, so that's why -- that's the only thing that drives me crazy.
L:  Yeah, people kind of need to do it for themselves, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's one thing to ask for a little help, and that's okay, like, because some times people have habits that they just become aware of, that they want to change.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- and that's the way to be like, you know, if someone told me that I -- that I do this sometimes and I didn't realize it until now, if you see me doing that will you let me know so that I can, you know, keep working on changing that.  That's okay, but I think someone else to like, keep you from doing something that's kind of -- it's not taking responsibility for it.
R:  No.  And it's frustrating.  It's frustrating because then you look like, you know, you're trying to help them and they don't want to be helped. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um, yeah, I sometimes feel like that, that's why that drives me crazy.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  So, um, what about you?  Any personal habits that drive you crazy that aren't on this?
L:  Um, not a -- not me personally, I mean, I know some people wh- who have a lot of like, little pet peeves, like they can't stand it if they're near someone who has like, crooked toenails, or you know, some people have really weird things that -- that they can't tolerate in other people and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- also the people who they'll only date people within a certain weight range or a certain height or something like that, where it's kind of like, a little excessive, I think.
R:  Right.  I think with like, the drinking, like, you know, with drinking and with smoking, you can you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can hi- not you can hide it, but like, you know, it's your choice but the people who are like, over weight, that's something quite simple and I have a lot of friends who are, you know, have their discrimination --
L:  Right.
R:  -- against over weight people --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Um, so that's kind of a pet peeve because, you know, because I have over weight friends and I know they try really hard because [several inaudible words] and it's frustrating --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, with people who meet them or k- or you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who meet some people are really, you know, how they have these preconceived ideas of how they are, how they're going to be or you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So that -- that's -- that's a pet peeve so, of mine.
L:  Yeah, I guess to me, like, a pet peeve is more, um, I have more pet peeves with people's character more than their behavior.  If that makes sense, like --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- the -- the type of judgments they make or if, you know, I try to, you know, m- a lot of people try to be open minded, it's not easy and everybody has their things they get caught up in where they're judgmental on this or that.  Everybody has that but --
R:  Right.  No it's only in the sense[?] --
L:  -- some people --
R:  Yeah, there's that whole boundary you can get mixed and, so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, let's see, um, [MN]
L:  I know --
R:  Hm?
L:  Um, [LAUGH] cleanliness is some -- a personal habit that -- that affects --
