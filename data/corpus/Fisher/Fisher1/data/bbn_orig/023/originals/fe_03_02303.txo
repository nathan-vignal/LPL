L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Amanda.
R:  Hi, Amanda, my name is Cindy.
L:  Hi, Ci- --
R:  I'm from, um, central Missouri.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay, uh-huh. [SIGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And this is my first time.
L:  Yeah, mine too. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] My daughter --
L:  I just --
R:  -- got me into this.  I think we're supposed to talk about illness?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What was --
L:  Like --
R:  What was the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- question that she asked?  I didn't quite understand her.
L:  There were several things, but basically, like, when the seasons change a lot of times people get sick with the weather issues, and then, [LIPSMACK] um, did she say something about, like, people say that a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor and a week if you do? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I was, like, okay. [LAUGH] Um, [NOISE] but yeah, basically, like, what do you do to keep well as -- you know, if you don't get sick or what do you do to get better if you do?
R:  Oh, well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I seldom go to the doctor especially over something like that, so --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  I -- I wash my hands a lot and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I try to avoid, um, people that are sick, you know, if they're sick and coughing and stuff, I try and avoid their airspace, not share their airspace.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I am a nurse so I do know for a fact that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're gonna have a cold for five to seven days regardless --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of whether you go to the doctor.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I was --
R:  And, uh, yeah, I -- if I do have symptoms I'll take something for the symptoms but that's about all I do.
L:  Basically the same as me.  Like, I tend [NOISE] to get sick for a lot longer than that 'cause I have asthma and that always tends to make it worse with the hacking and the coughing and you get sick because you're coughing so hard and it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible].  So, I try not to get, you know, catch anything, too.  I -- my mom's a nurse as well so, you know, she's like, "Wash your hands" and --
R:  Uh-huh, wash your hands a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So that's basically [NOISE] the thing.  I generally actually just in the wintertime when most people are sick, my spring starts allergies.
R:  Yo[?].
L:  Allergies so bad, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Mine too, mine too.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I have noticed that I don't generally get the spring colds that people get, so I feel blessed in that manner.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... I mean, I -- I guess I get paranoid about certain things, [inaudible].  Like, my mom, [LAUGH] she's got me on this thing now, like, you wash your hands, you turn on the faucet, but, like, you use a paper towel to turn it off.
R:  Right.
L:  You take a paper towel to the door and you open the door with your paper towel.
R:  Right.
L:  You throw it away as you're leaving the bathroom and, you know, I found that actually when I started doing that I caught a lot less colds. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, you --
L:  So, something works 'cause, you know, people don't wash their hands and --
R:  Yeah, really, and they're nasty, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you're like, okay, that's really gross. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, we cover our mouth with our hands and then we turn around and use that same --
L:  The same --
R:  -- hand to open the door or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You'd be surprised at the contact that you get just from, you know, touching everyday objects.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I really started noticing that.  My friends were all like, "Well, why are you so concerned about it?"  And I'm like, "'Cause, you know, [NOISE] I'm trying to stay healthy.  Y'all know I can't afford to get sick". [LAUGH] I used to stay sick for, like, two months at a time.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I was just really not at all healthy and, you know, now I'm eating better, eating regularly, you know, except during finals, which is now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But -- but, you know, like that kinda stuff and now I don't -- like, the last cold I had I think I was sick for, like, three to five days, something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I took [NOISE] Cold Ease too.  I don't know if you know about that stuff, but, like, it's like the zinc [NOISE], um --
R:  It's like what?
L:  Zinc lozenges. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so at the first sign I'm like, "Oh, time to go get some more". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that actually really helps a lot.
R:  Uh --
L:  So ...
R:  -- Theraflu[?] col- -- or is it ...?
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  Alka-seltzer plus cold tablets.  Those aren't -- those really knock the symptoms out.
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  [MN]
L:  See, my thing is I think I've tried the alka-seltzer thing and it was just so horribly tasting.
R:  Oh, yeah, gotta sorta hold your nose and drink it fast.
L:  Yeah, is that what -- okay, see --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I never did that one.  'Cause with that [NOISE] fluid you can't really drink it fast 'cause it's gotta be hot. [NOISE] Generally I would make, like, four cups of tea --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then add a cup of [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] if it was best to wait 'til the tea was super strong and, I mean, you taste [inaudible] and all but it's not as bad. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  But it made me feel good 'cause it was warm.
R:  Mm.
L:  I never tried -- 'cause, you know, when you don't have time to sit and drink tea or whatever, you -- Theraflu is kind of out of the question.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I never tried the little alka-seltzer thing since the first time I had 'em.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So ... [NOISE] Ten minutes on colds, huh? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm not -- I don't know how I got it -- let my daughter talk me into this.  I'm not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm not a real talkative person.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But she said a lot of times there would be, like, four people talking and then, you know --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- your four minutes go by real fast.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or your ten minutes, rather, go by fast but ...
L:  Yeah.  See, I didn't know that -- you know, a friend of mine got me onto it.  Um, she sent out -- we have a list or -- on campus for, you know, various groups of people and, um, you know, she sent out, like, "Yeah, you make ten bucks a call".  And, you know, we're all broke college students so we're like, "Ten bucks to talk on the phone?  Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.
L:  [LAUGH] Sounds good to me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Well.
L:  That's why I'm like, okay, 'cause I definitely could use the money especially when you're not working as much during finals and, you know, three weeks later comes a check and you're like, "Oh, yeah, forgot about that".
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So ... which helps, too, 'cause then you -- by the time you've worn your immune system down and you get back to being sick again [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Right, you've [inaudible] dollars --
L:  -- you need the money for cough syrup[?].
R:  -- to go buy you some medicine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, it's -- that's one thing, I do try not to get sick because usually when I do it's -- it's a real hassle [NOISE] and I miss classes and plus I have asthma[?] so [NOISE] once I get sick or have some sort of virus, usually that triggers a relapse and I end up, you know, [NOISE] tired on top of everything and I get dizzy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm like, no, I can't deal with all of this so ...
R:  We had a nasty th- thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- come through the area a couple of weeks ago.  People started out with a cold, you know, it was like a cold, common cold.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it -- their voices went, they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- thr- -- their throats hurt something terrible.
L:  Huh.
R:  And it just -- it went from -- it's like it went from a head cold to their throat killing them to pneumonia.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And they -- they missed, like, ten days of work, almost two weeks of work.  They were --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that sick.
L:  Well, that's really [inaudible].
R:  And the antibiotic, it was -- had to have been viral because pe- people were going to the doctors and they were putting them on antibiotics and they weren't doing any good so it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tells you right there it's viral.
L:  [NOISE] I don't understand why -- 'cause the last time I got sick the doctor wanted to give me an antibiotic.  I was like, "This is a virus, it's not, you know".  But I mean, I guess sometimes you never can tell when it's gonna -- the virus is gonna cause a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a bacterial infection to grow but [NOISE] that sounds awful.  'Cause I usually get really hoarse anyway 'cause I cough a lot.  You know, when I cough [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's really heavy with the asthma and everything so it just ruins my vocal cords.  But [NOISE] I never had it anything like that.  That sounds pretty awful.
R:  It was just -- just to listen to 'em talk was just painful to listen.
L:  Oh, goodness.  Oh, that sucks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you think about this SARS thing?
R:  The stars ...?
L:  SARS, the -- I forget what --
R:  Oh, oh, the SARS, okay.
L:  -- you call it, what it stands for, yeah.  But --
R:  Well, I just hope that they get a control on it and it doesn't, you know, get over here and spread everywhere.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I think --
R:  I think they're doing a pretty good job, though, at containing it.
L:  Yeah, they are.  I think there's been a couple of people in Philly who've caught it and they've [NOISE] -- maybe one person died or they're still both, you know, in -- in quarantine or whatever it is they're doing with people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But somebody [inaudible] recently [NOISE] came over from, uh, China.  He was on a business trip or something and he brought it, which [LAUGH] really, like, oh goodness, here you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, just ban --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all travel to and from, [LAUGH] you know, that area of the co- -- of the world right now until we get a hold on things.
R:  Yeah, this, uh --
L:  The thing that gets me is, like, why are they -- I mean, I understand why they shut down the hospital, but at the same time I don't because people need to be treated.  If you're gonna shut down the hospital, like, I would say move everybody else into other hospitals and make one of the hospitals, like, a SARS place or something.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Need to get treated, don't just put 'em out on the street or make 'em stay home and spread it. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  You know. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Quarantine [NOISE] some area in the hospital or something but that didn't make much sense to me.
R:  Do like they did years ago and have, um, T.B. wards.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.  And that way, you know, you have everybody together, it's all under control and, you know, [NOISE] in terms of area.  That way you don't have to, like, do mass exodus of the hospital itself, but every location can have their own ward, floor, wing, whatever it takes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but I'm just like great day in the morning, it seems like everything is -- is coming down on us now.  I'm like, okay, just let me wash my hands [LAUGH] and ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Get really annoyed at people [NOISE] who just cough out in the open or sneeze out in the open.  I'm like, "Hello, what's your deal, man?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, "Didn't your mom teach you when you were younger?"  I remember my second grade teacher used to have this little saying, like, to get us to cover our mouths when we sneeze.  She's like, "Every time you sneeze and you don't cover --
