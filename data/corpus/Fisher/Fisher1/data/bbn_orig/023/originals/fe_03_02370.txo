R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name's April.
L:  And my name is Geena.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Um, I guess the -- the topic was annoying habits or personal habits?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So, which do you think is worse?
L:  Smoking. [LAUGH] Yeah, I smoke and I can't quit, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I definitely --
R:  [MN] I smoke too, so don't feel bad, but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I've been trying to quit.  I'm almost there but the problem is that I find that when you -- when you wanna stop you light one up and you go, "Ooh", but you keep on doing it.
L:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I managed to quit for like twenty days in November, but situation came up and [COUGH] I was around somebody who smokes constantly and there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it went right out the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- window.
R:  Oh, yeah, when you're with someone that smokes all the time like that there's no way.
L:  Right, and all that hard work.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Man and it was hard.  Oh, god.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Man and I was so sick the whole twenty days.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I guess I'll just have to try again.  Smoking is terrible.
R:  Yeah, I think smoking is one of the bad ones and, uh, I'd have to say another one there is probably, um, not exercising.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Well, just for me though.  I mean, I'm not sure how other people do it but, um, if I don't exercise, I mean, it gets really difficult and you start getting stiff and [NOISE] you know, you start gaining weight and --
L:  Tired, you get tired.
R:  Yeah, you get really tired if you don't actually do something, so -- but I have to say smoking is worse.
L:  Yes.
R:  Smoking is much worse.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  And like also the smell that you have on you like --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  Even though I smoke I hate the smell.
L:  Yes, me too.
R:  I -- I can't -- I can't do the smell.
L:  Right.
R:  And I have to go in afterwards and brush my teeth and, uh, put perfume on and do the whole lotion thing and wash my hands.
L:  Right, right, right.  And it doesn't help. [LAUGH] I don't think it --
R:  I mean, it does for like ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  But that's pretty much it.  After that you're -- you're on your own.
L:  Right.
R:  And unless you have like a toothbrush, or like a bottle of Listerine with you, forget it.
L:  Right, right, right, right.
R:  Or unless you eat something that's just as strong as a cigarette and you can't get rid of it.
L:  Right.  I agree with that and it's -- it's so terrible.  Boy and they --
R:  I mean, uh, it's just -- it's just bad and it's expensive too.
L:  Oh, my gosh, yes.  It's very expensive and if --
R:  It's like -- is it thirty bu- -- or forty bucks a carton now?
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And depending on where you live in New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess it's much more than that and not to mention, you know, in the end it's gonna cost us for health care.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's right.
L:  Right.  And insurance costs more if you're --
R:  Yeah, insurance, uh, depending on, you know, who you go through, I think Keysers [NOISE] like two[?] hundred a month. [NOISE]
L:  Right, if you're a smoker it costs more.
R:  Yeah? [NOISE] 
L:  So, that's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's -- that sucks. [LAUGH]
R:  And if you have any pre existing conditions a lot of times you can make it worse with smoking and there's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot medications if you're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- taking the medication, uh, and you smoke at the same time, uh, you're at a greater risk for certain types of cancer. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right, that's true.  Especially like birth control.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  That's not good.
R:  I'm on a form of birth control where if you smoke, um, it -- you're not supposed to smoke but if you do it raises your, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- percentage of getting, uh, lung cancer and I think another one was, um, [NOISE] blood clots. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stroke, yeah.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  So, it's no good at all.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's not something that, uh -- I mean, I've been trying to quit but it's -- it's just -- it's difficult.  Like I'm down to maybe one cigarette like a week.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Maybe every few days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is good but even then, like I need that and, you know, when you light up you're sitting there thinking, "Oh, this is kind of gross", but --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But you continue doing it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- until it's out because you don't wanna waste it.
L:  I know it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You're right.  That's right.
R:  It's the -- it's the bad smoker's mentality.  Once you light up you don't wanna put it out because you're wasting a cigarette.
L:  Right, right.  That's right.  That's right.  You got all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kinds of excuses why --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you don't wanna do it, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, you come up with anything.  "Oh, well, you know, I'll do it next week", and "One more won't hurt" and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  "It's not that big of a deal.  I mean, it's only three bucks or four bucks a -- a pack".  So, when you've gone through five or six packs you're looking at like almost twenty bucks.
L:  Right, that's right.  Oh, my god.  It's so bad.
R:  I -- I, yeah, I have to put smoking like top -- top of that list.  Even though I smoke, I'll be the first one to say it's like not -- [NOISE] it's not something that I would ever want someone else to take up.
L:  Right, right, right.  Shoot.  I wish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I just wish I had never started.  That's the thing.  I tell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the little kids I see now, "Don't start smoking".
R:  But it -- it's hard too like if you have parents who smoke.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Because you're around it all the time as a kid and once you hit a certain age if someone like, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- leaves a pack somewhere, you may pick it up.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, before you know it you're hooked.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, I mean -- [NOISE] I tell people all the time too, don't even start because it's -- it's just not worth it.
L:  Right, it's terrible.  It's really terrible.
R:  Like even though I smoke, I won't smoke indoors at my house because everything's just the smell of smoke.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [NOISE] You pick up a pillow and a reeks, or like --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Or, like yeah you walk into like your closet and your -- your clothes smell like it and you have to get everything dry cleaned. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right, right.  It's terrible.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but --
L:  It's really awful.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The smell is bad. [COUGH] Y- --
R:  It's just -- it's -- it's not just expensive but it's very time consuming and it takes a lot of trouble to avoid certain things with it.
L:  Right.  You know, what e- -- you're right about the time thing because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you gotta take cigarette breaks it really takes a lot of time away.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You may not --
R:  [NOISE] It does.
L:  -- even real- -- you don't even realize it.
R:  Yeah, you could be out like fifteen, twenty minutes and you'll have maybe two cigarettes and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you don't realize.  You think, "Oh, I just had two cigarettes", but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you're not counting how long it takes you [NOISE] to go through one cigarette.  'Cause I know some people go through 'em fast and other people [NOISE] take a little bit of time. [NOISE]
L:  And not to mention how many --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- times you do that.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Right.
R:  You're like two, three times a day and you're looking at your lunch break. [NOISE] 
L:  Right, that's right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Gee wiz. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's terrible.
R:  It's a very costly habit any way you look at it.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It really is.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Gee wiz.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And I -- you know, I never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thought of that too.  That's, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the time thing is something.
R:  Yeah, and like not just that.  Like if you want to, uh, you know, go somewhere and you smoke a cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't wanna smell like that, you have to take the time to go back and brush your teeth.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  And do all this other stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then you smell your clothes and by the time you're done you have to change --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because your clothes still smell.
L:  Right, that's right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's right.
R:  [NOISE] There used to be a neat freak if you want to smoke and not smell like it.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And that alone is like difficult. [NOISE]
L:  It's terrible.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's definitely a terrible habit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I just wish I'd never started.
R:  [NOISE] I'm glad I'm down to one or two a week, but --
L:  Yeah, that's a --
R:  It --
L:  -- that's an accomplishment.
R:  But it's just that whole "Am I gonna kick those last two?"
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE] I kicked everything else.  The last two should be simple.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They should --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know.
L:  Right, they should be.
R:  Should be. [NOISE] 
L:  And you think --
R:  Should be is the key phrase.
L:  Right, and you think that to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yourself and you wonder why you're not succeeding.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Also, it interferes with your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ability to exercise a lot of times too.
R:  Yeah, yeah it does.  It, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lowers your lung capacity and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the time you're on the treadmill and you're good for maybe five minutes and that's it.
L:  Right, right.  See that's no good either.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's no good.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, what --
R:  And if you have asthma, forget it. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] That's true, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause that'll just send you in all kinds of fits.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I'm actually allergic to the cigarette smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, that's great.
L:  But that doesn't stop me. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, my god.  That's sick, isn't it?  That --
R:  No, I know other people that do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just unfortunate.
R:  [NOISE] And also, um, in California -- I'm not sure if you're from California, you can't smoke anywhere within like twenty feet of a -- any building, like any commercial building.
L:  Oh, no, you --
R:  You can't smoke inside bars or restaurants.  Like smoking is completely banned everywhere. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, if you --
L:  You can't smoke in restaurants --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- here but they don't have the thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about being twenty feet from a window or anything like that.
R:  No, here they do because --
L:  A building.
R:  -- because for here people who are standing outside complain.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So, you have to be so far from the building so the smoke doesn't --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- hit the entrance. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Twenty feet.
R:  That's how bad it is here.  It's at least twenty feet, depending.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE] Usually they'll have signs posted saying where you can smoke and where you can't.
L:  Wow.
R:  And even have non smoking work environments here where when --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- you get a job they'll tell you right up front, "There's no smoking here". [NOISE]
L:  So, you can't even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoke at home and work there?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, pretty much. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  Because they say the smell is offensive to others that don't smoke.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
