R:  Hi, this is Sylvia.
L:  Hi, this is Clovis[?].
R:  Hi.  Um, okay, I guess we're supposed to talk about colds?
L:  I -- [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I usually do not get them.  I mean, uh, do -- I mean, do you get them when -- when the season changes?  I really don't.
R:  Um, I -- it's funny.  I used to get them a lot as a child and -- and all through school and college.  I used to always get them when the seasons changed.  Um, but after I guess maybe about five, six, seven years ago, I went vegetarian, and to be honest, I haven't gotten sick since.
L:  Oh, well, I was -- I guess I was a vegetarian during my high school -- school years up until now and I still am, so maybe that's probably why.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That's so funny.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, but I -- I notice that, with my coworkers and such, and other people, that that does happen, that they do get sick when the seasons change.
L:  Well, usually the ones that I work with, they have allergies, so it gives them the appearance of a cold, but um, I can't really say that, you know?  I have -- I mean, you know, I haven't really worked with people that get sick during the season.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I mean, every once in a while I'll end up with the flu when I'm going into the uh, the winter uh season. 
R:  Right.  Right.  And I -- sometimes I don't -- I think it's not just the season, but usually when you go to work, they have um controlled temperature there.
L:  I know, that's --
R:  And --
L:  -- the problem.
R:  Right.  It -- I mean, it's hot outside and you go into work and it's a meat locker.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's the same thing.  [LAUGH].
R:  Or um -- or it's freezing outside, you go into work and it's a sauna or --
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh, my God.
R:  -- it's -- it's one or the other.  You can never win and maybe it's that, like, contributing to it?
L:  I thought it was only my workplace.  [LAUGH].
R:  I think it's everybody's workplace.  Um --
L:  Now, I have -- I -- I have to say that maybe, you know, like you said, I don't think it's really the season.  I think it's the workplace itself.  
R:  Right.  Right.  And when the seasons change also, you don't always know how to dress because it could -- one day could be really warm and the next day could still be kind of cool, while the -- the weather's trying to adjust to what season it really wants to be.
L:  I know.
R:  And tha- that's a -- be a factor.
L:  Well, Florida, I live in Florida --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so -- so I mean, we have really had some really strange weather.  I mean, you know, we're -- we're usually -- one day -- I -- well, you know, I have to really say during this summer because of the strange weather that Florida has --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I really have to say maybe it is, you know, during the -- that season, they do get -- get colds because now -- I mean, from one day it's thirty eight degrees and the next day is sixty or eighty.
R:  Right.
L:  So I guess Florida can say that, you know, the -- the way the weather is, people end up with colds.
R:  Oh.  I'm -- I'm actually calling from New York myself and --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  New York City, to be exact, and we -- we have all four seasons very distinctly, so I guess Florida is more warm, so that even your winter isn't that harsh?
L:  Right.
R:  But um, this year, we had a bad winter and our -- you know, our spring is really dragging it.  Like, we're -- everyone's really excited to get into summer and people are walking -- people are walking around wearing tank tops and things, but it's really not hot enough for it yet.  But people are over excited, so they're -- they're really, um, dressed inappropriately.
L:  Well, um -- I mean, that's what I'm saying, even with Florida this year, is that -- I mean, we having weather -- because one day it even -- we had little um -- it wasn't a lot, but we had, like, sprinkles of snow.  I mean, the weather -- the temperature had gotten to that place where we were able to have snow.
R:  Right.  Wow.  Wow.  I think one of the other questions they asked was about going to the doctor?  
L:  Well, I really don't go, because my cold is not that severe where I have to go.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I haven't gone to the doctor for a cold since I was a child, and my parents took me.  I -- yeah, I -- I wouldn't go to the -- because by the time you get an appointment and you get there, it's kind of over.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  
R:  And usually you could just get over the counter stuff now, these days.
L:  I know.  
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah, it's funny that neither of us really get sick.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  It's the wrong topic.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  But thank God for that.  [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  Thank God.  [LAUGH].
R:  Let me see.  Colds.  Mm.  Well, at work, we -- um, we have free flu shots in the fall, that we give to employees, and a lot of um our employees actually do participate and they get their flu shots, so I guess we don't have as many people getting sick.  
L:  Mm.  Well, I mean, we have that also, but I have never gone for the flu shot.  Um, I -- I think it's more -- I don't think it's beneficial for me.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I haven't gone either, just because I don't get sick and I just figure if everyone else is getting the flu shot, then they won't get and then I won't get sick.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Mm.  Well --
L:  What else did we have to talk about?  
R:  Um, mm, about colds.  Let's see.  I -- well, um, mm.  About change of season and colds.  
L:  Well, like I said, there is -- in Florida, it's more of allergies than anything else.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  Um --
R:  I think people in certain occupations are more prone to colds because I -- um, my friends that I have that are teachers, they're always getting sick because they get it from the kids and the kids give it to each other.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they bring it home and then they bring it back and it's -- you can't win --
L:  I know.  
R:  -- when you work with um kids so directly and just things like that.
L:  Well, even in the office, it's -- you know, because one person -- I guess even in the office, that circulates around also because of, you know, by the time you have the -- you know, by the time they have the symptoms, the cold's already there.
R:  Right.
L:  So when one person has a cold, it spreads around.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah, and there's not always great circulation of air in the office either.  I mean, I -- I know I sit in an office that doesn't have a window so we don't really have any air movement.
L:  Well, we have windows, but not the ones that you can open.
R:  Right.  Right.  Those too.  
L:  Um -- well --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I think people are also preventing colds these days.  Like, people seem to be more health conscious and taking vitamins.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And really, like, doing the whole herbal thing and just being more knowledgeable about that.  It used to be that not too many people were involved in that, but now in your supermarket, you could buy all kinds of herbal remedies and just alternative medicine type things.  It's very mainstream now.  Like --
L:  And a lot of people, like you said, a lot of people now are taking vitamin C tablets.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  I know that, like, when I sometimes feel that I might be getting cold, I -- I -- I take a vitamin C tablet or a zinc tablet, um, just to ward it off because I don't really like taking actual medicine.  
L:  I know.  It's -- I -- I don't think that the -- the medicine -- I -- to me, I don't think it really works because you never have the same cold once and -- and you know, you never get the same cold again, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can't cure it anyway because it's never the same one.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I don't think it's a cure.  It's just to make it more bearable.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So that you can just get through the day.  
L:  I know, but sometimes even the ones that says "non drowsy" your system seems to collide with that.
R:  Right.  Right.  So even if you're not falling asleep, you're just feeling kind of loopy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that -- that's just as bad.  
L:  I know.  Um -- 
R:  Man, these seems like ten long minutes.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Um, well, I don't -- I thought we went to -- I thought we have gone over ten minutes.
R:  Well, it's supposed to beep.  I -- I'm not looking at a clock right now so I don't know.  
L:  So --
