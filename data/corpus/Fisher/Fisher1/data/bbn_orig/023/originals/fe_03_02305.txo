R:  Hi, my name is Beth.
L:  Hi, my name is Bill.  How are you tonight?
R:  Okay.  Oh, we just start now, huh?  [LAUGH].
L:  I guess, yeah.
R:  This is the first time I've done this.
L:  Yeah, same with me.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Uh, the topic, about uh, health.  Um, I guess what -- I'm not a believer in going to the doctor immediately when I feel, uh, poorly.  Usually it has to get pretty serious for me to uh -- to go to a physician.
R:  Um, I agree.  I don't know unless absolutely necessary.  I'm not a doctor or medicine person.
L:  Right.  Uh, well, the -- one of the major problems is the fact that it's extremely difficult now to uh -- you know, to get an appointment when you can uh -- you can be there, and I live in -- near a very populated area of the country, that uh, has huge practices, family practices, and when you try to get an appointment, uh, unless it's a dire emergency, it sometimes takes as long as a week.
R:  Right, and by then you're not sick any more.
L:  No.  
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Well, I don't know what your exp- I don't know whether you have -- you've -- uh, have kids?  I mean, I have children and um, you know, they're continually, especially in the winter months, continually coming down with -- with um some sort of cold or uh, twenty four hour bug and you know, if you'd spent that -- if you took one to the doctor every time they got --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a little ill, you'd be there forever.  
R:  Yeah, my kids are teenagers and they don't go to the doctor that -- I mean, they've had their check ups, of course and everything, but we've -- I don't usually take them to the doctor unless it's pretty extreme.  Or they're sick for more than a while or extremely high fever.
L:  Well, one of the things I find is that if the kids are active and they, uh, participate in sports and uh they're active, you know, they -- they don't seem to get as sick as -- as kids who, uh, who don't participate it, believe it or not?  You'd think they'd be exposed to more situations where they catch uh colds, being in activities, but I guess there's some benefits in sports, to uh -- to building up their immune systems.
R:  Right, they stay healthier.  My -- yeah, my -- my kids are boys and they're both in sport all the time and they are pretty healthy for the most part, mm.  They haven't really had that many colds or flu in a long time, and they're older now, so I guess they're not in a, like a daycare environment which probably helps them.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Um, you know, especially the younger ones in daycare, uh, it does have an impact.  Just the number of -- number of kids and the length of time some of these kids spend --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in daycare.
R:  And they're all touching the same things and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sharing them.  
L:  I guess there's -- there is something to be said for uh, uh -- for uh, raising your kids at home.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  If you have that option.   [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  And not too many people do now.
R:  Right.  
L:  Uh, but I've -- I've always -- in terms of uh -- in terms of trying to -- to uh stay healthy or, you know, I -- I guess for the last two years I've taken a flu shot, which is the first time I have even -- I've been offered them for twenty years, and I've never --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really taken it.  And I didn't really -- one thing I noticed was I didn't get sick this -- this past --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh cold and flu season, so I don't know whether that contributed --
R:  Yeah, I've never had a flu shot, but I don't really get sick either.  I don't -- I rarely get sick.
L:  Are you in an office environment, where you're around a lot of people?
R:  Yeah, I am, and everybody can be sick around me and I don't usually get sick and I think I -- I don't know why [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  It's just a question of immune systems, you know, that our immune --
R:  I guess.
L:  -- system that are -- are less susceptible you are to uh catching colds and --
R:  Right, and I'm actually working in a medical environment, which you would think I would be exposed to more.
L:  Right.
R:  But for some reason, it's just not happening to me, which I'm glad [LAUGH].  Just hope it doesn't all catch up with me later.
L:  Right.  Yeah, well you expect that's true I guess.  On the other -- the other side of that is hospitals are probably as clean or more clean than uh, than the average home because of just that reason.  They don't want to -- they don't want people going in there and staying there and getting ill from -- from other uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other diseases.  So, um the problem uh -- the problem that I find is that uh, it seems, as you said, it seems like the younger kids are more susceptible to it.
R:  Right.  I think just because they touch so many things and touch their face, their mouth.
L:  Oh that, you know, and hygiene.  It's difficult to uh -- [LAUGH] basic hygiene is difficult to control with smaller kids.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, you know, they're consistently washing their hands or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- consistently -- uh clean things before they -- they touch them.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  It's hard to make them wash their hands before they eat every time, especially because they do a lot of it away from you.  [LAUGH]. 
L:  Right.  And --
R:  They're with other friends.
L:  Plus it seems that, uh, their energy requirements are -- their food requirements are such that they need to be um, eating a lot more frequently than adults do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I guess it's much more, uh, uh -- it's much more of uh -- important thing to them to eat when they're hungry than it is for us.  We'll just ignore it and continue doing --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- whatever we're doing.
R:  Well, we don't always have that convenience of eating when we're hungry.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Depending on if we're working or --
L:  Well, you know, the other -- we've -- uh, I guess as -- as we progress with technology, we -- we've -- we've also become, uh, more used to going to the doctor and for example, you know, my parents rarely went to the doctor.  I mean, they had to be -- I mean, normally a doctor's visit would only come after some catastrophic uh occurrence or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a trip to the emergency room or something, there'd be a follow up by the doctor, but -- or a once a year visit for a check up.  But as things progressed and uh I guess we were -- we just got more and more used to going to uh --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- get treatment.
R:  There's so much more preventative medicine --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- or diagnostic ability that everybody's going for the diagnostic tests now, I think. 
L:  Well, which makes sense.  Um, you know, at least you can deal with it if you know it's coming.
R:  Right.
L:  When it happens, it's a little too late.
R:  Exactly.  Which I think -- yeah, that happened with my grandparents and other people older than that.  
L:  Uh, do you think that uh, um, the diagnostics tests that they run really have a different type of, uh -- it's like an MRI now they're advertising, that they say can predict, uh, predict uh the possibility of heart disease and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and do you think those things are accurate?
R:  Um, fair- I actually work for a radiology group so yeah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- pretty much.  [LAUGH].  Um, they -- I mean, they can tell what -- your susceptibility because of the -- they can see the narrowing of the arteries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if you're getting close to closing off an artery, then you're probably gonna have a problem.
L:  Yeah.  How good are they -- I mean, at actually -- you know, like an xray you don't -- you don't get much of a picture of --
R:  Right.  You can't really see that narrowing.  Um --
L:  Uh, where the --
R:  -- the -- and now on the newer machines -- you can get -- you know, they used to do the, um, angios --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where you had to have the dye injected and everything.  It was a major surgical proce- well, not a major surgical procedure, but it was a big ordeal.
L:  Yeah, anybody --
R:  I wouldn't want to do it.
L:  -- doing anything around my arteries is a major [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Yeah, I would rather just lay in a tube and let it take --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a picture [LAUGH] if I had a choice.
L:  No --
R:  They offer to have the PAT imaging now with the um -- for cancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is really amazing if you've ever seen it, or -- it is very interesting technology.  It's a three dimensional picture, they inject you with a sug- a -- a radioactive isotope that has a sugar solution.
L:  Mm.
R:  And tumors metabolize sugar at a different rate.
L:  Really?
R:  So when they run you through this machine and do this three D scan, anywhere that has a tumor shows up on the scan.  
L:  Mm.
R:  They use it for people that have had -- for a -- a cancer already or they're in an advanced stage, to see where else it's spread to.  There could be all --
L:  So but I imagine that would be very uh -- very helpful for early detection, too?
R:  Right.  They're not really using it too much right now for, you know, like as a pre diagnostic test because it's fairly new and it's fairly expensive, but I know like, through the groups we work through, they have -- they even advertise it in the paper.  You can get a full body scan and you know -- I've -- you can pay cash for it out of your pocket, if you want that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- peace of mind, you know?  Because your insurance isn't going to pay for it just because you want to have it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no, I've seen that.  I've seen those ads, uh, where I live too, same thing in the papers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that uh basically a disclaimer saying, you know, this is the cost and most insurance companies won't pay for it.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, how -- I mean, are those -- so they're more accurate than what they used to call "stress tests" where they just basically, you know, exercise you to the point where --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I guess --
R:  Because that's testing your heart's reaction to the stress.
L:  Right.
R:  Where the uh -- you may have no symptoms with narrowing arteries and -- until actually you have a heart attack.  
L:  Mm.  So it sounds like they are slowly moving towards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- diagnostics, so --
R:  If -- if you have a history of heart disease, you can usually get it covered.  You know, they won't just do it for anybody, just because they want one.  We're just getting to the point where the average consumer is wanting some of these tests as a diagnostic um preventative test, but we're not there yet.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's difficult --
R:  They're expensive.
L:  -- to say, okay, we'll pay for yours --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we won't pay for yours.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, obviously -- especially if you're paying the same premium for insurance --
