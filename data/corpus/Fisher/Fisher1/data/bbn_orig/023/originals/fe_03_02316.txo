R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Larry.
R:  Oh, I'm -- this is Ena here.
L:  Ena?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nice to meet you, Ena.
R:  Uh, yeah, nice to meet you.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, do you actually remember the question that they asked earlier on?
L:  Yeah, they -- they want us to talk about getting a cold, and the change of seasons.
R:  Okay.  Actually, um, who wants to start?  Do you want to start first, or maybe I start first?
L:  Oh, you go ahead.
R:  Oh, okay.  They were talking about seasonal changes, and how -- illnesses, right?  Okay, for myself, for this particular winter, which is very brutal, I'm pretty lucky in the sense that I haven't gotten sick at all.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  But -- but the thing is it affects me in a way in terms of my sleeping habits, is like I got tired more easily, you know, and things like that.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, yeah, I don't get a cold surprisingly, because I'm actually, yeah, mm, not A- American citizen.  I was like from somewhere hot and, uh, I suppose, how do I keep myself from not getting the illnesses, I suppose, I -- I, you know, I make sure I have a balanced diet.  I try to sleep well, you know -- you know, like, if it's raining I try to avoid the rain and things like that, I mean, just some basic common sense, I think.  Yeah, how 'bout yourself?
L:  Oh, I think that sounds pretty much like me, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  I take a handful of vitamins every day.  I very seldom get sick, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the change of weather doesn't affect me too much, either.  I, uh, --
R:  Okay.  That's great.
L:  I adjust to it pretty well --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, uh, I got to get my sleep.  I do know I got to have sleep and I found that I have to do what the bible says, and have one day of rest a week, because if I don't get one good day of rest then, by the end of that week I probably will get sick.  I'll either get sick or have s- some emotional crisis in my life, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I've found that I have to have one day where I don't do any kind of work at all.  If it's not Sunday, another day of the week, just I got to have a day of rest one time a week.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, so that's really helped me to stay well I found over the years.
R:  Do you really feel that an apple a day keep a doctor away?
L:  Um, I think, uh, that's probably just another way of saying, you know, you need to eat proper and have good food, and, yeah, I do.  I'm -- I'm a kind of a health food nut.  I -- I  --
R:  Oh, are you really?
L:  -- eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables and, uh, I don't eat any processed food, and right now I'm on a low carbohydrate diet, so --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- I'm not eating anything with any sugar in it, or any grains.  I'm completely off grain right now.
R:  Oh, okay.  I mean, well, you seem like more health conscious than I do actually, because, um, I -- I don't really like, not into diet, things like that, because --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, I'm still here.
R:  I am here.  No, so --
L:  Heard a click.
R:  Oh, n- no, I -- here -- Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, okay, sure.  Um, well, it's -- well, I don't know.  For -- for a guy, you know, I suppose for the g- all the guys I've met so far, uh, you know, I think you -- you must be the most -- one of the most health conscious one I've ever met actually.
L:  Well, I'd -- I'd like to live to be an old man and I don't want to have cancer when I die.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, and you hear all these crazy things about, uh, er, you know, if you live long enough in America you're either gonna get breast cancer or prostate cancer --
R:  Uh, yeah, that's awful.
L:  -- and I think that's terrible and I think it's something in our diet and in our food that's doing that to us, so, I've just --
R:  Yeah, I won -- Yeah, one thing actually because, like I say, I'm not American citizen, but I've been here for a while and it seems that, like, for example, you go into a supermarket, I've just realized that convenience store is like what people is eating, and I was thinking to myself, "This is very unhealthy".
L:  It's terrible.
R:  And -- but I think like, maybe the people here, the local, you know, just like something fast and quick, so I think this is where all this frozen food in the food mart, you know, business is booming, yeah, but --
L:  Yeah, well look at how fat Americans are.  Have you noticed how many fat people there are in America?
R:  Yeah.  It's terrible.
L:  Isn't it disgusting?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's awful.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's terrible, I think, yeah.
L:  Wh- what country are you from?
R:  I'm originally from Singapore.
L:  Singapore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So you know this is --
L:  [Chinese phrase]
R:  [Chinese phrase]
L:  Good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good for you.
R:  Uh -- uh -- Are you a- American born Chinese or are you, like, you emigrated here?
L:  No, I'm Swedish.
R:  You are Swedish?
L:  Yeah, my family -- my name is Olsen and my family, my grandma emigrated from Sweden.
R:  My goodness, but just now when you speak your Chinese, you speak it very well actually.
L:  Oh, well, thanks.  I don't know -- I don't know but a few words [LAUGH].
R:  But -- but you speak very well.
L:  Oh, thank you.
R:  Oh, okay, okay, oh, oh, oh, okay.  I think we ha- we go back to the topics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What else did they ask actually?  I didn't --
L:  So -- yeah, we -- the cold thing, you know, I -- I -- I guess with this, uh, SARS that's going around, Singapore has been hit with the SARS too, you know, that we need to keep our immune system up, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, anything that runs our immune system down, not sleeping, too much sugar, and, you know, chemicals in our body, is something that's going to make us more susceptible to getting sick.
R:  Yeah.  Do you actually do detoxification stuff, like ...?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, oh my goodness.
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  You're really -- you're really into it.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and bowel cleansing, too.  Bowel cleansing is very good to help keep you healthy, 'cause all those toxins build up in your intestines.
R:  Do you also do exercise also, like, yoga or just judo, regular gym?
L:  No.  I'll tell you what.  I work construction for a living, so I get a lot of exercise during the day --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, I'm always --
R:  Very good.
L:  -- lifting and moving.  I'm not a sedentary person.  I don't sit at a desk.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm always, uh, burning lots of calories, so I don't really have to watch my weight.  I can eat as much as I want and not gain weight.
R:  Oh, same here.  I can eat as much as I want without gaining the weight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but for me it's, um, I don't exercise a lot actually, but -- but, you see, actually when I came here it was like in autu- autumn, so the weather is not so -- the weather then was quite nice, so actually I normally jog in the morning, early morning, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but when winter comes and, you know, like after Sep- -- after November, when the we- -- when the weather starts to turn cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for me, so I stop exercising, and I don't like to go to gym, so I need to go outdoors to do my exercise actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, and so I think I will be starting it pretty soon, maybe end of next week or what, yeah.  I will do my -- my dose of exercise, yeah.
L:  Well, I think when you go out in the cold weather, I think it actually helps you be strong from not getting sick.
R:  Yeah, true, yes, in a way, yeah.
L:  Breathing fresh air, and it makes your body more hardened towards that, and as long as you take care of yourself and you dress properly, I think it's good to go out in the cold weather in the wintertime.
R:  But, you know, the problem with me is that was from Singapore -- I'm from Singapore, so the, you know, it's always --
L:  It's hard on you.
R:  -- yeah, it's always hard, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the problem is that I -- I don't mind the cold.  I like winter actually.  The problems is when the wind blows on my face it is terrible.  I don't like -- look I think I keep my body warm.  That's not the issue.  The issue is my face, because my -- you know, it gets dry, so, uh, it's terrible.  It's the wind, I think, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You put moisturizer on your face?
R:  Yes, but the thing is my skin is very, very dry.  It dries very fast.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I have very, very dry skin, so that's the thing that kills me actually, I think.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, but like I s- -- but what you say, I agree that actually in the cold, right, when the cold wind, you know, blows across your face, actually you feel more refreshed, and in a way, you build up your immunity, because back home, right, when I was in Singapore, I always have cold two times a year.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  That is why when I first came -- came -- come -- came here, I was a bit worried.  I was thinking, oh my goodness, like in December I'm going to get a cold or flu, but it doesn't happen.
L:  Well,  that's good.
R:  Yeah, I think, like, it must be the weather that's being, you know.
L:  You -- you know, they say -- I grew up in the northern part of America, and when everything's frozen, there's no virus or -- or germs can survive, not until it starts to warm up then they become active again.
R:  Where did you -- where did you stay?  Alaska?  No, right.
L:  No, I was in, uh, --
R:  Northern --
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Cleveland, Ohio, where I grew up.
R:  Yeah, it's very cold, because what my roommate, one of them, used to study there, so she was telling me the winter there is very brutal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I was complaining to her about the winter here.  She's like, "Here is nothing compared to what I have gone through".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, you know one of the other tricks I found to -- to battle the cold if you do get a cold?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is drink lots of water.
R:  Oh, oh, yes, that reminds me, that is, if I'm going to come down with the flu or cold, right, I normally take those, you know, effervescent tablets, like those one of the milligram of vitamin C.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It really helps.
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've got these, er, zinc C lozenges that are supposed to be very good, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you know what I don't do?  I never go to the doctor and I never take antibiotics.  Most of the colds are viral in nature and the antibiotics won't do any good anyhow, unless you have secondary infections, so ...
R:  Yeah, true.  I don't do antibiotics for my flu and cold also, not even for fever.
L:  No, why bother.
R:  Yeah.  No, no such thing.  Yeah.  You don't need that actually.
L:  No.
R:  In fact, a good doctor would not recommend that to you.
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But most doctors do.  They just say, "Here" --
R:  Here it is.
L:  -- "Here's a prescription.  Go home.  Call me in a week", and, of course, your body's going to fight it off and in a week you're going to be better anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If you -- even if you didn't take the things you'd be getting better.
R:  Yeah, because, like, fluids, you know, you know, if it's not -- if there's no underlying disease or serious illness, basically, they can go by themselves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't actually need to -- to take all those chemicals into your body and that.  Your body will have to start, you know, getting rid of that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You're better off keeping your immune system strong and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, there's echinacea.  Have you ever taken echinacea?
R:  No.  What is that?
L:  Echinacea is -- it's a native wild flower to America, and it has the effect of stimulating your immune system.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, they sell it in tea form and you can buy it in dried capsules and any of the --
