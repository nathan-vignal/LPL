R:  Hi, I'm Katie.
L:  Hi, this is Linda.  Are you there?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] Okay, so what do we do? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, we talk about the topic now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so it was smoking --
R:  Um, I think --
L:  -- drinking --
R:  -- smoking, drinking --
L:  -- gossiping --
R:  -- overeating, um, gossiping, uh, I forget what the other one was. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Which one -- which one [LAUGH] -- which one gets your goat? [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... I think probably gossiping because, um, I'm so used to the other ones 'cause [NOISE] --
L:  You're used -- so used to the rest of 'em they don't bother you any more?
R:  Yeah.  Well -- well, not so much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- overeating but just, like, um, most of the people I know drink and smoke cigarettes so it doesn't me so much any more.  It's just kind of the environment.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, I don't know.  Well, I guess --
L:  I guess -- I guess --
R:  -- gossiping is present in the environment, too, but it's, uh -- I think it's more immediately damaging.
L:  I guess if it's not, uh, real facetious, although is gossiping by definition facetious, I don't know.
R:  Hm, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  But I can't stand smoking --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- for nothing.  Not in my house, not in my car, not while I'm eating, [SIGH] I hate that.  And drinking, I could live without too but --
R:  Yeah.  Did you have, um, were you around smoke when you were young?
L:  Uh --
R:  Is that why it bothers you?
L:  No, my parents didn't smoke but all my si- -- older sisters and brother dr- -- do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for some reason.  So, I'm not sure where they picked it up from 'cause not from my parents.
R:  [MN]
L:  Then, I don't know, my husband drinks too much so I think that's why I don't like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And because I haven't been allowed to have it for so many years because I've either been pregnant or nursing, so maybe I'm just jealous. [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  But -- so, do you have any kids?
R:  No, no, I'm, mm, young, I'm only twenty.
L:  Oh, twenty, well.
R:  Too young for kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's way too young.  I didn't have my first 'til I was thirty but [COUGH] yeah, ha- have fun. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so th- --
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think when I --
L:  So this is why you're not dissing the drinking and the smoking, yeah, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out there having fun drinking and smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  All right, now I'm jealous.  See, I'm thirty eight with four kids, my drinking and smoking days are over. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  I think my, um, whenever I have to explain it to somebody my attitude is always I'm kind of getting this out of the way why -- while I can get away with it.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  'Cause I know once I get older --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- once -- once I wanna have kids or whatever, I'm going --
L:  Yeah, 'cause it --
R:  -- not gonna be able to get away with this any more.
L:  -- it's not [inaudible] and still acting like that. [LAUGH] Yeah, you --
R:  So --
L:  -- get away with ev- [inaudible], yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's -- it's -- it's also probably the social environment that makes, um, that makes gossiping bother me more.  Um --
L:  Oh, yeah, I think I get --
R:  -- because -- because it's in a --
L:  I think I get ninety percent of my information about what's going on in the community by gossiping [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have to [inaudible] my good list not my bad list. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That's part of my mommy network. [LAUGH] You know, that's how I know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what's going on. [SIGH] Um ... [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, people -- people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- still get their, like, reputations ruined and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and lies get spread about people that -- that are undeserving of having --
L:  That's some pretty serious gossiping --
R:  -- lies spread about them and --
L:  -- you know.  Are you talking about gossiping or are you talking about spreading rumors?  Hm.
R:  Um, I kind of --
L:  See --
R:  -- tie the two together.
L:  I -- gossiping to me is just kinda retelling stories that have already been told.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, just kind of pass- -- just [inaudible] as it were.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, whether you should actually be, you know, authorized to do so or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think rumors is just making stuff up to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hurt people or whatever.
R:  Well, I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, um, like the -- [SIGH] when -- when you tell somebody you always exaggerate points and -- and it's like the game telephone or -- or -- or something like that, where you, um, [MN] whatever you say gets distorted, um, by how many people you tell it to, how many sources it has to go through 'cause they always change it a little bit.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, I mean, it's not like everybody is lying on purpose, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, there's --
L:  It does get diluted and stuff.
R:  Things -- things have come back to me that, like, somebody has told me something about something that I did without knowing that it was me who did it and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's completely backwards.  And they don't -- they don't realize even that they're talking to the person that they're talking about and it's kind of a funny situation. [SIGH] And --
L:  [MN] Yeah, it's like that -- that game that you play as kids and you get all in a circle and you whisper something [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one person's ear and round, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And when it comes back to that first person it's nothing like it was started.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  What area do you live in?
R:  Uh, I live in New Jersey.
L:  Jersey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, see, I'm in South Florida.  Must be pretty happening up there.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Have you been down -- have you been down here in spring break? [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH] No, I haven't.
L:  [LAUGH] Not that lucky? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we had all the spring breakers here a couple of weeks ago and the place was pretty much jamming.  I think MTV came down this year even to South Beach.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, I'm just about forty five minutes away from there, if that.
R:  Is there a lot of drinking and smoking? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you twenty year olds always drink and smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's South Beach [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's spring break, what do you think? [LAUGH] They just made another movie about nothing but spring breakers drinking and smoking, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the Cancun thing, have you se- -- heard --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- about that?
R:  Yeah, I've seen commercials for it.
L:  Yeah, that should be real fun for you to watch. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Me, I'm kinda over it. [LAUGH] Not that I didn't have my share.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm kinda disgusted with the reality TV shows and the reality movies.  Well --
L:  Well, I -- I got enough reality. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I got too much reality. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't need to watch someone else's reality.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I'm gonna watch something on TV I want it to be completely fake and, [LAUGH] you know, all good and, you know.  I don't wanna know there's more crap out there in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Do you remember what the last topic was?  I can remember four but I couldn't remember the fifth one.
L:  Ah [SIGH], what was it?  Smoking, drinking, gossiping, overeating -- overeating, was that the other one you were talking about?
R:  Mm, I thought there was another one.  Um --
L:  I don't know.
R:  But --
L:  I don't know.  Is it required we stick to topic or they just give us a topic so we'll have something to talk about for ten minutes?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I think -- I think they probably just give us a topic so people like you and I, who probably have [LAUGH] absolutely nothing in common, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can try to talk for ten minutes without going, "Uh, okay, uh". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I just normally run out of anything to say. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... I actually don't think I have anything to say about overeating, though.
L:  [MN]
R:  So --
L:  Well, I [LAUGH] -- I've had four kids and I haven't lost the -- the pregnancy weight, so don't even get me started there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was a size six. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you were pregnant, though, right?
L:  Yeah.  It's hard to lose pregnancy weight.  That's another reason I -- although that's a bad reason for waiting 'til your later years that way 'cause, of course, the older you get then the harder it is to get rid of it, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've had my fourth and last child so now I'm -- soon as I finish nursing then I'm going full -- full steam ahead and doing the Jenny Craig or something so ... I may not get size six back [inaudible] when I was twenty five but, you know, something reasonably close to that should be fine. [MN] [PAUSE] [NOISE] So, what else is there?  Ria, what are you doing?  Thank you, baby.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you stay at home with your kids?
L:  Yeah, I got two at home.  A -- a -- a two year old who just got into the Lanocane and smeared it all over her head [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which she's never done that before. [LAUGH] And a five month old who's soundly sleeping, thank God, at the moment. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] It's so funny, she's got it smeared all over her head.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There won't be any mosquito bites bothering on her head today. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Mosit- mosquitoes haven't --
L:  Mosquitoes are really bad down --
R:  -- gotten here yet.  It hasn't been warm enough.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's only been warm for, like, two days.
L:  Oh, yeah, I have a sister that lives up near Long Island, I think, and oh, I don't know how you people can live in that weather.  It's gonna be, uh, eighty nine degrees today I -- well, today it's raining but once the rain goes away it's supposed to be almost ninety. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  I can't imagine having to live in the cold.
R:  I used to live in New England.  It was freezing.
L:  Oh.  People that live in, like, Chicago, how can they do that?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's cold and windy all the time.
L:  I was in the military and I was in Indianapolis during the -- one winter doing my training and get out, that was ridiculous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] You couldn't pay me enough to live in that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- year round.
R:  Which branch of the military were you in?
L:  I was in the army.
R:  Oh.
L:  Twenty years ago.  It was fun.  Went overseas, got to travel, probably went to about thirty different countries while I was over there.
R:  That's exciting.
L:  It was a blast.  There when I was twenty so, you know, perfect time to be there. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  I have a friend who just --
L:  Those were safer times though.
R:  -- recently joined the Marines and we were all terrified that he was gonna get sent to Iraq, but then he didn't.
L:  Your boyfriend or your brother?
R:  Um, just a friend from high school.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, that's getting pretty crazy over there.  But now it's kinda calming down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so maybe he'll -- he'll get lucky and just stay home.  You know, in -- in my old days I used to be that way, too, you know, gung ho, you know, join the army, but now that I have sons of my own [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm telling my husband, "They're going to Canada to see relatives if anything happens when they get older".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't care.  Forget that patriotism.  Their mom served for 'em, that's all they need, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not gonna risk my kids' lives for some stupid oil well [NOISE] or something, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Get out, that's -- that's a different perspective when you have kids.  You look at things totally different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] I don't know. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Now she's saying, "Gross".  Yeah, it was gross.  Now you got that slicked back hairdo.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
