R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Linda.
R:  I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi, Kelly.  Boy, that's a lot of bad stuff all in one there.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  [LAUGH] So, which is worse?
R:  I, hm, well, let's see --
L:  It's a- alcohol.  I do not like alcohol.
R:  Yeah, I think alcohol is probably one of the worst.
L:  Hm, a- and of course overeating [NOISE] it's so -- it's bad on your health.
R:  Yeah, it is but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have a tendency to do that, so I won't make that the worst one. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I'm with you on that one. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I think drinking probably because, um --
L:  It impairs your judgement.
R:  Right, it impairs your judgement[?] and, you know, all of them can be an addiction --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but, if you talk about like accidents and like drunk driving, those kind of things then, um, you know, smoking usually doesn't cause that; overeating doesn't; lack of exercise doesn't, but the drinking --
L:  No, none of those impair your judgement at all so that you get in a car, you drive, you kill innocent people --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so --
R:  Right, so, but probably someone who drinks would not agree.
L:  Oh --
R:  Like if you have someone who -- who casually drinks and -- and, uh, you know, is a real fitness buff and, you know, doesn't put anything bad in their mouth or anything then, you know, they would probably say, "Lack of exercise", or eating, so ...
L:  Which none of 'em is good.
R:  No.
L:  But as you said, none of those impair your judgement.  You're not gonna hurt other people.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  By, you know, overeating, or -- I mean, you're hurting yourself.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But -- a- and I have seen out of so many people that drinking -- I -- I mean, [SIGH] they drink so much they end up losing their home, everything --
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, it's -- a- you know, as far as addictions go, you know, that one has the most damage that can be done.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, smoking, you know, I grew up in a family with a smoker and I can remember riding in the car and just gagging.  You know, my mother is a chain smoker and she'd smoke one after another after another, um, but, uh, I don't know.  You know, dad -- she wasn't really -- you know, she wasn't really hurting us.  I mean, we didn't have to worry about crashing the car or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  'Cause see I smoke and I still feel it's not good for, you know, ones around you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not good for yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, I wish I could quit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, easier said than done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you should never start.  But still, I -- yeah, I'm not gonna, uh, crash the car.  I m-, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or anything because I'm smoking.
R:  I -- yeah, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other one on the list that's interesting was gossiping.
L:  And that is so harmful.
R:  I know.  But it's so easy to do and it's hard -- how do you know when it's gossip and when it's not?
L:  That's why I think you should, um, as the bible says, "Say yay and nay and forget it" [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't say anything else because, uh, you know, [SIGH] you could hurt so many people.  The -- the old saying, you know, "Sticks and stones may hurt my bones, but words, uh, alone will never hurt me", whatever it is now. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  It's not true.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because you -- you know, you can't take words back.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  Once you've said 'em, they're said.
R:  Right.
L:  A- and, you know, when someone says something bad about me or something, I -- I recall it [LAUGH], you know, I -- I -- I think about it.  It -- it really does hurt.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well --
L:  B- --
R:  -- and sometimes where -- where I get hung up is like, okay I have -- I have like a circle of friends and I might talk to 'em like every other night or so. Um, my one good friend I talk to every night and like if I talk to my one friend Patty and, you know, she's telling me about her day and she's upset about something or whatever and then I talk to Laurie; if I tell Laurie is that gossiping, or is that just sharing with her where Patty's at? [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's sharing, sharing concern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  About a friend.
R:  Yeah, well I hope it's that.  You know, I -- I don't do it out of, you know, negativity, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  That's -- that's also -- gossiping is another habit that's -- and it's hard to break.
L:  Well, a- y- the problem, I think, I know with me a lot of times I say things before I think.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I mean, because I'm a very open person and what's on my mind I say.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  And so I'll say it before I even think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not intending to hurt anyone 'cause I would never intentionally hurt anyone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you do.  It just pops out. [LAUGH] 
R:  It comes out.  Yeah, it just pop -- I know.  And then you say, "Oh, no", you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I f- --
R:  I hope this person doesn't -- doesn't hear or doesn't find out or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But still, I don't think that's as bad as alcohol.
R:  Yeah, no, I don't either.  I don't either.  I mean, maybe -- I don't know, maybe people who don't drink like -- it could hurt it personally, like a friendship, but -- but, you know, it doesn't cause the damage that, you know, like you hear some kids who grew up in -- in alcohol, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  In a house with a- -- you know, alcoholism and drinking.  I mean, they just have horror stories to tell, so --
L:  Yeah, a- and so many times because they -- of the alcohol, you can even be apu- abusive to your mate, your children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, that's a horrible thing for kids to grow up in.
R:  Right.  I don't know though that it was -- it was right for them to lump that under personal habits though, because, you know, like, I don't know.  I mean, it just seems like, you know, if we're talking about gossiping and alcohol it's like apples and oranges.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, it's like two different things, but, um --
L:  But it wasn't our choice, it was theirs --
R:  Right, that's right.
L:  -- so, we go along with it. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right, that's right. [LAUGH] 
L:  Was there any --
R:  This is the first --
L:  -- other choice?
R:  This is the first time I've done it, so I don't --
L:  Me too.  This is my first.
R:  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I -- let's see, it was gossiping, drinking, smoking, overeating or a lack of exercise.  Those were the five.
L:  It's the lack of ex- exercise just hurts me.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, I guess in the long run it could hurt my family, you know, if I end up dying too soon.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Uh --
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  But, um, a- a- -- then again, they may be happy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, "Hey, she's gone", no. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, and some people -- I mean, you could also --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think you could also put in there, um, over exercising.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, I have -- it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so funny because I have a friend whose husband runs every day.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He -- he, you know, and if he's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gotta miss dinner, if he has to work late, if he has to miss dinner -- I mean, and actually the running comes before --
L:  Before anything else.
R:  -- his family, you know.  Like he'll go running instead of coming home and having dinner with his family, so, I mean, a lot of these things you could probably look at -- at both ways too.
L:  Yeah, become obsessive with it, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I could see how that could hurt a family too.
R:  Yeah, that would never be my problem, but [LAUGH] --
L:  No, it wouldn't be mine either.
R:  [LAUGH] I would never --
L:  I have a church next door which has a track that I can go walk. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One time I started, you know, and then I, you know, "Well it's too this, it's too that, I need to do this". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, I know it's so easy to fall out of it.
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  You know and once you start.  I joined a local Curves place the other -- the other month and over -- my daughter was home over Easter Break and I didn't go not once and now it's -- she's been back all week and now it's so hard to get back into going.
L:  It is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Once you quit, I mean, you can come up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with so many excuses.
R:  Right.  But --
L:  I can anyway.
R:  You know, it also depends on what -- what they mean by lack of exercise.  Because nowa- nowadays like even the American Heart Association is counting like housework as exercise; gardening as exercise.  You know, like -- you know, it doesn't --
L:  Yeah, at least you're getting out and you're moving.
R:  Right, it doesn't have to be a, um, set, you know, like going to a gym or biking, or, you know, aerobics or something.  You know, so, you know, lack of exercise I mean, I think, you know, they -- they say like thirty minutes, four times a week and I think on average I get that just from doing laundry and housework and --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- grocery shop --, you know, lugging in groceries and --
L:  Mowing the grass, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I do all those things.  I have a husband who's a stroke victim.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you know, all that is on me.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah I -- I -- it doesn't show in my weight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I still think it's plenty of exercise.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, and sometimes it doesn't, you know -- even doing those things, even if you're not changing your eating habits, you know, you're still exercising your heart and your lungs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, doing the activity.  But, I don't know.
L:  Oh, 'cause see that's where I worry about him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause he really -- because o- of his stroke, you know, and he -- he can't walk.  He can't walk over things.  He can't use his right arm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But he still does not get up and do things --
R:  Right.
L:  And you have to move.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, if you don't -- the only thing about not exercising, especially if -- if y- you have health problems or you're older, is that you'll deteriorate faster.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and, you know, I know my -- my grandmother we all [LAUGH] -- we all [LAUGH] -- my aunt must've bought her every kind of exercise machine there was, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to make it easy on her because she was just losing so much muscle tone and, you know, eventually it was even hard for her to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Like my husband y- you know, it just takes everything he's got to take a shower.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it just exhausts him.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
