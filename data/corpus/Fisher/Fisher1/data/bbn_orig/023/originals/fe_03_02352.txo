R:  Michelle.
L:  Kathy.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't get all --
L:  This is my --
R:  -- those.
L:  What?
R:  I didn't get all of those; gossip, smoke, alcohol, overeating.  Did you got 'em down?
L:  I didn't either.  This is my first time.
R:  Oh, it's just my second, so --
L:  Oh, okay, well you're one step ahead of me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, gossip, uh, smoking --
R:  -king, alcohol --
L:  Overeating.
R:  Oh, not exercising.
L:  That probably goes along with overeating.
R:  Yeah, alcohol, um, what do I think is worse?  Um, what do you think is worse?
L:  Um, smoking.
R:  Smoking?
L:  I used to be a smoker. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I quit, oh, December of eighty six and, um -- what -- what got me to quit is the -- I had, uh, that was the first year I didn't get the flu shot and then I got the flu, then I got bronchitis, then I got pneumonia and I kept thinking, "Oh, my god, I can't breathe.  What would emphysema be like, you know?"
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, that -- that -- I was sick for about two months but that was the best sickness. [LAUGH] When -- when I look back at it, you know, and I tried doing hypnosis [NOISE] while I was sick and I said, "Hold your breath", you know -- you know to quit smoking and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And no way could I hold my breath, but I had no desire, you know, 'cause I keep associating it with emphysema.  What about you?
R:  Right, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I agree, smoking, um, also it seems to be a big -- big killer, um, among, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people causing disease and, um, [MN] let's see.  I also -- but not healthwise, but I think gossip is also bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It hurts a lot of people who, um, you know, don't really even know that they're being talked about.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I try to -- try to avoid gossip too, but um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I never have smoked and, um, overeating is something that's over -- I know more of a problem for me that I have -- have to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- overcome and try to not eat and I love to exercise, so, I don't know.  But I -- I think smoking is -- is the worst because it causes cancer and causes other people -- I read, um, I have young children and I read a, um, article a couple of months ago and it said that, um, parents who smoke around their kids, um, their kids are gonna have like high amount more cavities, like five times the amount of cavities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than, um, children who live in non smoking homes and, um --
L:  Plus --
R:  You know.
L:  -- they're at a greater risk for like asthma and that kind of stuff too.
R:  Yes, yes, and um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, like second hand smoke and it just seems to just be a problem like when you go to a restaurant and you want a no smoking table and you have to wait longer, but they could put you in smoking right away but you don't wanna sit around it and --
L:  Right.
R:  And the cost of it too, that's -- I even have family who do smoke and they're always complaining that they don't have money for this or that, but then they end up with I don't even how much cigarettes cost, but they come up with --
L:  Oh, I know they're ri- -- they're ridiculous, um -- you know, I told my husband, I said, "Even if smoking, you know, wasn't bad healthwise, I don't think I'd ever wanna start it up again just how much it costs for each cigarette", you know.
R:  Right, yeah, and they make it so difficult on smokers anyway.  Like most employees you can't smoke in the office, you have to go outside and we live in Texas so, you know, it's hot most of the time.
L:  Fine. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I mean, you gotta stand in the heat to smoke something that's really bad for you, um --
L:  What I like in my city in Texas here is most of the restaurants; I'd say at least eighty five percent, are totally non smoking.
R:  Yeah, I saw that Dallas had gone to that, um, non smoking --
L:  Well, I'm in Arlington.
R:  Arlington, okay.  Um, yeah --
L:  Then we've been that way for a long time.
R:  -- we go to Grapevine.  Oh, you have?  Well, that's nice.  We go to Grapevine some and it seems that they, um, they still have smoking or not smoking or, um -- I don't know, maybe it's just the bar.  Yeah, that is nice if they have gone to just non, you know, non smoking establishment.  But that's even, you know, why make it even harder on the person to -- to smoke, so --
L:  So, I think eventually then they'll -- they'll rule it out in bars and stuff too.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- that would be big on the sm- -- on the cigarette industry if they did that 'cause I think a lot of people smoke just casually as they party or drink or whatever, but, um --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I -- it's, um, hard and it must be just so hard to quit because of all the commercials and all the patches and gum and hypnosis you hear and I mean there's just as much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- information on how to quit smoking as there is on trying to get you to smoke, so it must just be a horrible, horrible habit to -- to stop.
L:  Well, like I say, in my case on my brain, see I associate that with emphysema and --
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  So --
R:  How many years did you smoke?
L:  Oh, gosh.  Well, off and on about, uh, fifteen years or so --
R:  Wow.
L:  I found out I was pregnant with my daughter and this was back -- well, she's thirty three now, but this was back whe- before they even said you shouldn't drink alcohol or you shouldn't --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But there was just something, some maternal thing or something in me.  I -- I couldn't stand to smoke and I couldn't stand to drink wine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so I quit for about a year there, the smoking, and then I -- and then I took it back up like a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like an idiot, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I have friends who quit smoking while they are pregnant but then they can stop for a whole year, you know, and then they can't wait to have a cigarette, but yeah, I don't -- I don't know, it just must be horri- horrible, horrible hard habit to stop.
L:  I don't even like -- well, you know, I get something in the mail sometimes and I can tell that person was a smoker.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  It reeks of it.  I -- sometimes us ex smokers are the worst. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  A- about criticizing other people, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that is, um --
L:  Which city do you live in?
R:  Um, we live in Keller.
L:  K-, okay, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, yeah, I have small children so we're always, you know, try to enforce, you know, "Don't smoke" 'cause they say, I guess, y- they start young, seventh, eighth grade --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- is the -- is the big push to -- the cigarette companies want 'em to start young and get addicted like in high school, um, and if you can make it like to eighteen or something they said, then you have a lot less chance of -- of becoming a smoker or stuff, um.
L:  Right, and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's mainly the girls they say too which --
R:  Yeah, I know, I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't understand that and I guess --
L:  I don't either.
R:  Yeah, it's really bad.  My dental h- -- dental hygienist said it's really bad on your gums too.  It can make your gums and your teeth your -- look healthy, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but they're not really it just restricts the blood flow or something so it just can affect your whole body and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your, you know, your whole family so um ... yeah.
L:  I admit I should do more exercise and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I should do more walking and stuff like --
R:  Yeah, walking's good.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] or water aerobics.
R:  Good for you.  Mhm.  Yeah, that would be -- that would be good.  So, and the gossip --
L:  They --
R:  -- thing has --
L:  What -- what did you say?
R:  The gossip is just a big, um, personal thing that I have to just overcome just to not be part of it and just, you know, turn -- turn away from it [LAUGH] and don't -- don't listen to it or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- continue to do it --
L:  Right, 'cause [NOISE] some peop- --
R:  Just with women -- yeah, it's hard.
L:  People have thinner skins than other too, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes, yeah, so, um, yeah, um, I don't know.  We're supposed to keep talking for -- let's see eight, nine --
L:  I think it was right about -- whe- when they say two o'clock, I guess they mean two o- -- how many days a week --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did you tell 'em you would take calls?
R:  Um, five but, um, my two calls were fixing, I think, to get cut off but, um, mine I just called in.  You can call in a number and enter your pin number.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Um, that's what I do.
L:  Oh, and then -- then you can do it more at your convenience?
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  'Cause I have a young child and she naps, so I did enter times but I never have actually got a call, so I just, um -- do you want the phone number you can call?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, let me see if I can find it [NOISE].
L:  I just said, "Tuesday and Wednesday from -- at two o'clock" or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, to call --
L:  But, you know, it could[?] be some time where I'm gonna have to be gone or something.
R:  Yeah, you just wanna get it over with and not be waiting around.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's, um, one, eight, six, six --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Six, eight, seven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Four, seven, five, eight.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then when you call in, you enter your, um, pin number and they'll ask you some questions about your phone and then -- I had to wait like a minute and a half for them to find someone -- find you for me to talk to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  So --
R:  So, but --
L:  And then I forget how much we get per call, but --
R:  At ten dollars a call.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, if you talk -- you have to talk eight minutes which I think we [NOISE] -- think we did.
L:  Oh, that's like a dollar a minute then.
R:  Yeah, pretty good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, you could only do three though.
L:  Oh --
R:  Three --
L:  -- you can only do three?
R:  Yes, that's what -- on- -- after the first one I did I was like, "Oh, yeah, I'll do one of these a day" and then I looked on the website and right now they've limit it to three calls, um --
L:  Per month, or per what?
R:  Per -- period, per person.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, okay --
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  I see --
R:  So --
L:  Mm and kinda spread it out a little bit.  Do you do like any mystery shopping?
R:  Yeah, that's how -- I haven't done any yet, but I've signed up to do
