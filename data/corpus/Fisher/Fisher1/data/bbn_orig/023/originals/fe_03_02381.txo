R:  Hello, this is -- my name's Christine.
L:  Hi Christine, I'm Sheryl.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing really good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Good.
R:  Um, well, personal habits, and they're talking about all those different ones, you know. Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just thinking to myself, um, just because of my own belief system, I would say a lot of them are equal in -- in not okay.  I wouldn't say that, um, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't class, you know, not working out, as one of those -- gossiping and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and smoking and --
L:  I agree, I agree.  Um, I guess -- I guess they're all harmful in -- in some way but it depends upon how you look at it, I guess.
R:  Right, I mean, and it -- and it would probably depend on the attitude, you know, in not working out, too, I mean, if you're not working out just because you don't have the time, and you know, schedule or whatever, you're not -- you -- you're actually directly like, I'm not trying to work out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then really -- it's not -- I guess it'd be a heart issue.  Heart issues or goss- gossiping is usually because you want to um, you want to blurt other information about other people --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Heart issue with smoking is typically because you need something to [LAUGH] that you think will -- can, you know, help you de-stress and whatever.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, they're all different in that way, but um, yeah, I -- I agree, it's um, though they say you can make time for more working out, but I don't know. [LAUGH] I haven't. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No.  Oh well, we have a day care and a bunch of little kids and um --
L:  I can hear them in the background --
R:  Yeah, there's quite few of them.
L:  They're kind of your workout, aren't they, huh?
R:  Oh, I definitely run around with them all quite a bit. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's great.  Oh, now where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Oregon.
L:  Oregon, okay.  I'm in, ah, southern California.
R:  Okay, yep, I used to live over there.
L:  Oh!  Well, I guess I think, ah, one of the more harmful ones that I can remember from the list is gossiping, um --
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I don't think that benefits anybody really, and it just, you know, it just hurts -- it can end biting you in the b- back, I guess, and ah, ends up hurting a lot more people than -- than I guess it helps any, if that makes sense.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I think that's a really bad one too.  It's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's wise to keep your tongue and watch what you say, about other people.  So ...
L:  Yeah, if -- if you can't say something nice --
R:  I'd say I think that was one of the worst [inaudible] that I can remember, too, is just because that one, you really do have total control on.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  You're absolutely right.  You're the one that, ah, that creates it for yourself.  That -- that makes sense.
R:  Because I can see people that smoke, you know, some -- you know, they have an addiction, so addictions are hard to break.
L:  Yeah, they are.
R:  So I wouldn't necessarily think it's a great thing and I wouldn't, you know, want somebody blowing smoke in my face, but I'm not going to, you know, I wouldn't judge a person because they did it, either.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, whereas I may stay away from somebody a lot more because they continue to gossip or talk about me or someone else that really concerns you.
L:  Right, because they couldn't -- yeah, well, I mean, you figure if they're talking about other people to you, then chances are they're probably talking about you to other people as well, so --
R:  Right.  The same way with the -- the not working out, I mean, I don't think I would stay away from a person just because they don't work out, yeah?
L:  No. [LAUGH] That makes sense, I know, I know.  
R:  I don't remember any of the other topics -- the ones that they said --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- because it comes out pretty quick.
L:  I know, it does and ah, my boss was talking to me as -- as they were going by, so -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um, well, what else?  The working out?  Yeah, that is, you know, it's -- it's a question, they say, of choice, but um, you know, I think it's just a question of time as well, you know, there just --
R:  Right, and the majority of [inaudible] are extremely busy nowadays, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true, and um, I mean, I know, I have a three year old son and by the time, you know, I'm up at the break of dawn and then by the time I go to work and come home and pick him up, really, there literally is no time in the day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- poss- you know, I want to spend as much time as I can with him and then that sort of, you know, takes away from it.
R:  I understand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a three, a five, a seven and a nine year old.
L:  Argh, oh my --
R:  My three year old's a girl --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and then, like I said, we do the daycare, so we typically have about five other kids here --
L:  Oh my --
R:  -- majority of the day [LAUGH] 
L:  Well you --
R:  -- so when they go home, then I see my kids and that's just not[?] going to allow me have my own personal time [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no.
R:  And um, so once they go to bed, then I'm too pooped to do any, you know, total exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's probably one of those things that has to be a planned agenda and, you know, it's kind of like going on a date. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well it is.  It's -- it's -- when you have, ah, four kids, I mean, you -- it's spontaneous, it just doesn't happen, you have to plan, absolutely and then even your best laid plans probably, you know, get changed around and whatnot just very easily, just by the nature of four kids.  Oh my goodness.
R:  Well yeah, I was looking at the cost of some places to um, you know, go workout, and -- and getting membership in some of those alone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can kind of be +spendy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, so you add the child care on top of that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and it's just like, huh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  And I think, you know, in -- I think you can get just as many benefits at home, you know, whether you're going on a walk with your kids or -- or you know, just buying a treadmill or something, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're so inexpensive these days, or an exercise bike when you're watching TV or whenever you have a little free time, you know, so, I know, I think you can get the same amount of benefits --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- without having to pay the monthly fee.  That's true.
R:  Well we have stairs, so if I've done something, like, if -- if I have ten minutes then I'll just run up and down the stairs as many times as I can. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, I know, we do too, but ah, boy, you're probably running up those stairs much more than I am. [LAUGH] Wow.  Oh my goodness.  Well you're -- you're certainly busy.  I'm trying to think, ah, some more personal habits.
R:  Personal bad habits, I -- I don't know, I mean [several inaudible words] lying and cheating, obviously those categories can kind of be up there with gossiping.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I guess, I don't know if you're a religious person, or not?
L:  I am, yes.
R:  But I would say probably anything that is listed in the bible would definitely be something that I would not be for. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh, yes, yes.
R:  Yeah, and then those issue that they kind of named that weren't listed in the bible then I probably wouldn't care about too much. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's true, yes, I kind of -- I feel that way as well. Um --
R:  So --
L:  That you kind of, you know, and -- and everybody has a different value system, that's true, but ah, I like um, you know, I agree with you in terms of certain things you can -- you do have complete control over and then some, less so.
R:  Right.
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  But um, yeah, I um, you know, I've been --
R:  Well when we're building, you know, just with the nine year old, we're working on a lot of character issues with him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, and um, they sh- they show[?] him the negative ones and I show him those positive ones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all over the place, and um, I can just say that it's more pleasant to be around someone I know that he is -- he is-- I mean, just [inaudible] you know, the watching his mouth and watching how he speaks to others, and --
L:  Right.  Well you certainly want good influences, you know, as opposed to bad [NOISE] there's so many -- so many -- so much negativity and so many negative influences out there and that it's ah, you know, sometimes --
R:  I'm going to have to pick up this crying baby just 'cause somebody is watching my door --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and she's going to think that I'm -- she's going to see that a person's come to get her [LAUGH] --
L:  No problem, do what you have to do.  [LAUGH] Oh.  But um ... [NOISE]
R:  She doesn't like other people, um, she doesn't like -- she doesn't like to think that someone else is going to pick her up besides me.
L:  Oh.  Well, that shows that you're a loving person. [LAUGH] She must have complete confidence in you.  Oh.  But I know, now do they teach -- I know some schools do these character building courses, or they try to um, you know, included in the curriculum, is that the case with your son?
R:  Um, well, actually I've just taken him out of school.  I home schooled him recently.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because I just [several inaudible words] because he's been making a lot of bad choices with the [inaudible] and refusing to hang around with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, well it's just amazing how sometimes you get on the phone and then everybody goes down hill.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Now how is -- is that working out?  Do you -- are you um -- are you finding an improvement or -- I guess it's -- it's only been a short time.
R:  Yeah.  In attitudes very much so, and really, in behavior, very much so, and um, I've home schooled them all th- all but this last year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so we tried [NOISE] Um, we tried to put him back in because we thought it would give him more social liaison or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  And um, not that he didn't get a lot of it already because he was going to all kinds of, like TE, he was going to computer classes and church and -- and all kinds of different things --
L:  Right.
R:  And so we thought, okay, well, you know, maybe we'll just give him a little bit of time, he's starting to get older and he just kind of chose to hang round the kids with the -- the wrong habits.
L:  Oh, well --
R:  And that's something you can't really monitor too much while they're there --
L:  No, you can't --
R:  My goal and my thought were taking him out of school to home school him again for a little while longer is just to really try to continue to pray for him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and try to get him to properly understand to make  life easier, he just really needs to start making some wise choices --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on his own.  He obviously wasn't kind of protecting his heart, um, and so my thought is right now we'll protect his heart and continue to train him to do it himself.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
