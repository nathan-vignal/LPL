L:  Hi, my name is Betsy.
R:  Hi, my name is Martha.
L:  Hi, Martha.  Well, do you wanna start, or I'll start?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Okay.
R:  If you've got a start on it.  I don't know which one would be worse.
L:  Well, let's see.  I, um, I just came back from, uh, a meeting.  I sell cancer products, so I'm definitely a non smoker and we were actually just talking about somebody who, uh, is very sick actually and they're near dying from smoking, so it's a cause near and dear to my heart, so -- I think smoking is definitely on the list.  It's -- it's -- it's a hard thing to quit, but it's just so sad 'cause so many people get so sick and just --
R:  Well, I smoked for many years but I'm -- I'm definitely a non smoker now.
L:  Well, what do you think compared to --
R:  But alcohol kills so many people too.
L:  That is true.  That is true.  I have known many people over the years who -- oh, gosh have just like drank themselves into the ground.
R:  Yes.
L:  And just [NOISE] -- it's so sad 'cause you can just see it and I actually was just at the movies the other day and I ran out to go to the ladies room and I ran back in and all of a sudden, we were sitting in the movies on a Sunday afternoon at four o'clock, I came back in the theater and sat down next to my husband and I said, "I smell beer".  But it was so strong it was like literally someone must've downed like seven or eight beers 'cause it was exuding from their pores.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  My god, that's so sad.  And I'm like, "Somebody's going to a movie in the afternoon and they have to drink so much that it's literally -- it -- it was -- the smell throughout the whole movie was offensive".  And I'll have one or two drinks.  I mean, I don't find anything wrong with having a glass or two of wine, but it's just -- again I think the same thing with smoking, it's just so sad if somebody just can't control, you know, the urge that they're just, you know, it -- that it -- it takes over their lives and -- and causes -- and causes problems and interferes with, I guess, day to day activities so that they can't do all the things that they might be able to.
R:  Well, now it really interfere.  It used to not.  You used to be able to smoke anywhere.
L:  I know.  Well, no, but I'm -- I'm saying even interfere like somebody smokes and then they're smoking for let's just say twenty years and it doesn't bother them and it's, you know, it interferes with other people maybe, but then all of a sudden they have some problem and they're coughing and then they're coughing up blood and they go to their doctor with it, you know, they're just -- their daughter just had their first grandchild and then they have lung cancer and it's like, uh, mm, you know, ooh, "Why couldn't you quit?"  So, you know, that's -- that's hard, but then you're right also too, that's also now an issue.  I -- I live in the next State over from New York City and they just totally banned smoking from bars and restaurants, so you can't even smoke in a bar.
R:  Now, that would be interesting.
L:  It -- it is.  It has been a --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a, um, a big change.  They're actually, um -- it's caused such a huge controversy.  There was a -- a, um -- oh lord, what do you call?  The -- the -- a bouncer.  This poor gentleman was just trying to maintain the law that, you know, there was no smoking in the bars and somebody was smoking and he was trying to get them to leave and they shot him and killed him.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  So, there's a big case going on in New York City and that's -- that's because of smoking.  [LAUGH] Somebody wouldn't -- somebody just wouldn't say like, "Okay, I can wait to smoke my cigarette".  He got so upset over the fact that this poor person who was just employed at, you know, who knows the poor thing probably made ten dollars [LAUGH] an hour and they killed him over it.  So, that's, uh, definitely [LAUGH] -- it's definitely changed --
R:  Awful[?].
L:  -- the situation, so, let's see --
R:  I -- I can remember back when I did smoke, you know, [SIGH] going to a bar and sitting and drinking was one of the one times that you really, really, really wanted a cigarette.
L:  Right, I remember --
R:  Or, after --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you got finished eating, the very first thing I always wanted was a cigarette.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, you're mixing alcohol and no cigarettes. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, it's -- it's very strange.
R:  But, yet at the same time the poor people that didn't smoke that were in bars might as well smoke.
L:  Right.
R:  Because my best friend did not smoke but she loved to go to bars to go have a couple of drinks and dance, you know, just normal --
L:  Everyday stuff.
R:  Yeah, you know, just go be a -- a -- a young adult.
L:  Right.
R:  And she wasn't able to unless she took lots of allergy medicine.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I -- I -- like I say I -- that would happen to me sometimes when I'd be out and if it was a very smoky bar I would get really congested --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the next morning I'd wake up and my voice would be gone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, you know, just from breathing in all the smoke and not being used to it.  But it's -- it's funny, I -- I remember my parents both smoked and they quit, um, years ago like so many people and, um, my dad used to say for -- for years he would still, you know, occasionally with certain things like if he saw somebody else pick up a cigarette he would get that craving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, in certain situations.  Now he doesn't but it's, um, you know it's -- it's changed.  It's definitely changed.  Well, so let's see.  There was -- what were the other things?  There was smoking, there was excessive smoking, excessive drinking, not exercising, what was the other thing?
R:  Um.
L:  Overeating?  No.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't remember.  Well, listen, I think not exercising [inaudible] it's good for you, but I think if you have to compare --
R:  I don't think it -- it -- it affects other people like --
L:  No.
R:  -- smoking and drinking does.
L:  No.  I don't -- I think -- I think smoking and drinking definitely impact more on other people's lives --
R:  Yeah, choosing --
L:  -- whether it's the family or friends.
R:  Choosing not to exercise is just, you know, harming your own body.
L:  Right.  And [LAUGH] -- and, uh, not affecting -- not affecting other people.  I agree. [NOISE] I definitely agree.
R:  I think there was also gossip.
L:  Oh, I forgot about gossip.  That was the other one.
R:  Gossip.
L:  Gossip, well.
R:  Compared to smoking and drinking.
L:  Hm.
R:  That's kind of a weird comparison.
L:  It is a weird comparison, but gossip, you know, thinking about it -- I mean, I know we all do it even though we're not supposed to, but it's -- it's --
R:  And if you compare it biblically, you know, it's just as bad as any of the rest.
L:  Right, I'd probably agree.
R:  But, if you compare it socially --
L:  Or e- --
R:  -- everybody does it. [LAUGH]
L:  Or im- impactfully[?].  I mean, I think -- I think some of the ways that it might --
R:  I think you can kill somebody with your tongue.
L:  Hm?
R:  You can kill somebody with your tongue.
L:  I was just gonna say, like, you know, have you ever accidentally been saying something about somebody and then that person overheard or found out and then you felt so terrible in your heart?  You were thinking that, "Oh, my goodness".  You know, you weren't thinking when you were saying something and you weren't -- you weren't realizing the impact that it possibly could have on their feelings and that's, you know, I think that's something that -- but I don't think -- I don't think that -- that could [NOISE] affect so much the, um, the impact that smoking or drinking could.
R:  No.
L:  I -- I think smoking or drinking, you know, the -- the pain and suffering that it could be causing family members.  Like, if -- let's say you have a spouse that was [inaudible] and you smoke and the smoke causes them to get lung cancer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or it causes them to have breathing problems [NOISE], or they're so worried about you because you're, you know, constantly coughing and you can't walk up the stairs and, um, all these other health -- these things that impact your health and they're so worried over that, that's affecting them.  So, yeah, I definite- -- and then drinking the same thing.  I mean, good gosh those people that just, um, ruin their lives with -- with, you know, drinking and, um, you know cause so much pain to their family.  I mean, one of my, um, one of my friends, her brother -- her parents have spent so much money trying to put him in, um, um, detox programs, you know, for -- for drinking and he just can't stop and, um, you know, it's been going on and on for years and that's so painful to them.  I mean, they're older and, um, you know, you think, "Oh, they shouldn't be going through that".  So, definitely think that, uh, that's an issue.  And compared to gossip, I -- I -- I don't think there's any comparison [NOISE] and the overeating, or the, um -- sorry not exercising.
R:  Right.
L:  You any additional thoughts?
R:  Not that I can think of.
L:  All right.
R:  I just -- I -- I can't imagine putting the two of 'em side by side and trying to compare 'em.
L:  No, I think -- I think it's ...
