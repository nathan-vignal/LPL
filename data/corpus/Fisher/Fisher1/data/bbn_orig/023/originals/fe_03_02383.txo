R:  Hello.
L:  How are you?
R:  Hi, I'm David.
L:  Hi, David, how are you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Not so bad.  Not so bad.  Sitting -- sitting here waiting for my wife to come out of a train [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] And me, ten dollars. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, a bonus, right?
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, so the question is, ah, which do you think is worse, gossiping, over eating, smoking, ah, what were the other things?
L:  Alcohol, tobbac- alcohol and caffeine, I think was in there.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, over eating and going -- not going to the gym.
R:  Okay [LAUGH] 
L:  So, do you hate --
R:  I would put in a vote for gossiping. [LAUGH] 
L:  You're going to vote for gossiping?  Because you like over eating and smoking, caffeine and not going to the gym.
R:  [LAUGH]  Or [COUGH] I think we're supposed to rate, ah, ah, what is worse in terms of ah, I guess wh- wh- well I guess we start by putting in our own votes, and that's my vote.  What is your vote? [LAUGH] 
L:  Your vote's for gossiping, what about smoking?  I think smoking is the filthiest of the habits, I think.  Was that in there?
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  Yeah that one's [inaudible] David, I think.  Ah, but that's just me I guess, I don't know.
R:  Okay.
L:  Wh- why do you think gossiping is worse than um, than smoking or [inaudible] ?
R:  Um, well, I just thought, I mean, I -- I understood the question is, to me it, like, sounds like a values question, so, ah, to me it seems that I think that all other four or five things ah, that they listed, I think that those are things that I think you can turn around, um, and I think that they are less likely to have an effect on other people, but I think that gossiping is -- is you know, it's ah, it's ah, it's ah, a problem of mortals and um, I mean, you can -- you can obviously stop gossiping but once you've done it, you've done it -- you -- if you hurt someone in the process you can't really turn that around, um, you really only hurt yourself if you're smoking, unless, you know, breathing your second hand smoke in someone else's face.  But [LAUGH] you're only hurting yourself if you don't go the gym, if you don't eat and stuff like that, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I think I say that.  I think those are things that you can self improve on, and you can obviously self improve on your, ah, gossiping habit, but if you hurt people all the way, um, I think that that is something that's very hard to uproot.
L:  Yeah, but how does gossiping really hurt somebody?  I mean, except unless you're drawing attention [several inaudible words] 
R:  Well, I think -- I think you can hurt someone because you're -- if you're spreading something that you're not sure is -- is true about someone, or if you're spreading something that someone wanted them -- wanted something to keep them -- they wanted to keep it private, you know, they have a right to privacy and if you're going around behind their back without asking them, um, then that's wrong.  [LAUGH] That's my own -- that's my own moral judgment, ah, but um, I think, I -- I mean, I can't say that I'm a hundred percent, ah, innocent --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of ah, of -- of that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- of that thing, I think that I -- I think I do it all the time, but [LAUGH] or I think that ah, I -- I think that this world is based on gossip.  The entire media is top gossip.  The entire media ah, industry would be out of business, um --
L:  At least The Star and The Enquirer would be [LAUGH] if nothing else.
R:  Definitely.
L:  I don't -- I mean, I guess some of the substance of these habits are more offensive to me because they are forced on our society as well, right?
R:  Yes, definitely, I mean, yeah, I think that -- I think th- the other thing that were mentioned were definitely, are also a- are bad things. [LAUGH] 
L:  You can say that over eating and not going to the gym only affects yourself but if you're dependent on society to take care of you if you've had a heart attack and been in a coma for twenty years, then you can say, yeah that's affecting other people.
R:  Right.  And if you're dependent on -- on drugs, um, I don't know if that was one -- I don't know -- well, I -- I guess --
L:  Yeah, I mean, it should be in there.
R:  -- smoking in a sense is a drug, yeah, but if you're depended on -- on that ah, right, you aren't doing anything good for society, um --
L:  [inaudible] in general is bad because [inaudible] support yourself and you become a welfare case or something along those lines and ah, then [several inaudible words]
R:  Right.
L:  Got it?  [inaudible] at some point I don't know what happened there.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I don't know, I mean, I guess it's despicable habits or bad habits, I mean, I guess, I don't go to the gym, per se and I'm over weight and so I should be taking care of those, that's pretty despicable, I guess, as well.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think it's -- I don't think it's despicable, not to go the gym, I think that's like, a personal decision that people make, um, but I think it's just -- it's a matter of, you know, what you value in terms of wh- wh- what you spend your time on doing.  Um.
L:  My wife is completely clueless.  She's now walking away from me, ah, she's seen me.  Look at that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Beautiful.  Just picking her up at the train, here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, how about all that for another bad habit, picking your wife up off the train, that's a fine habit actually. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But ah --
R:  That's good.
L:  I -- I wonder what they're trying to ask us though.  But ah, I don't know. [inaudible] wife in the car. [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is David, I'm doing a -- I'm -- we're participating in like, ah, in a study. [LAUGH] [NOISE] We're talking about, the question was, what is -- what do you va- what do -- do you think is the worst?  The -- and -- the answers were smoking, gossiping, over eating, not going to the gym, ah, or, I think, drinking alcohol, ah, obsessively.
L:  Smoking.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because it is -- it can -- other people's health, not health -- not just your own.
R:  Right.  I said -- I said gossiping because I felt that gossiping was ah, was something that can get -- it can get def- I felt that all the other things that -- I-- I saw it as kind of like a values question and all the other things that were listed were things that, ah, I think that you can improve on yourself, but that gossiping was something that once you did it, you kind of, already you -- you -- you can't really fix it.  I mean, like, once you've gossiped about someone, if they find out, it can hurt them and you can't really turn around -- it's almost like -- it almost sounded like a question of whether gossiping didn't really fit in [LAUGH] with all the -- with all the rest of the answers.
L:  Well, if somebody smokes around you and you have asthma and you have an asthma attack and die, I don't think they can turn around and change that either.
R:  What did you say, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch it all.
L:  I said if somebody smokes around you and you're allergic to it and have asthma and you have an asthma attack and die, I don't think that they can turn around and change that either.
R:  No, they ah --
L:  I think that's a little bit worse than if somebody gossips about -- I -- I think I'd rather somebody gossip about me than kill me through smoking near me.
R:  Yeah, I would agree with that, or -- or -- or I mean, in that -- or on the other case, you know, if someone's drinking obsessively and they get into your drunk driving accident, that's also definitely horrible.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  It takes its toll on people, ah.
L:  Right, but we live in New York City, so I'm more likely to be near an inconsiderate person that's smoking near me than, you know, driving drunk.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah. [NOISE] I think we've exhausted this question. [LAUGH] 
L:  Probably.
R:  We have to wait -- we have to wait till the study cuts us off now.
L:  And also, there's a lot of ah, a lot more cases of children with asthma because of kids that smoke or parents that smoke --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Right.  I also -- I also live in the New York City area and it's nice now that they at least, that they're trying to keep, like, restaurants and bars and stuff with this non smoking ban.  I don't know how well they're upholding it but --
L:  Right.  I wish they would just do it outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Outside of buildings.
R:  Yeah.  That also creates a problem for people that live around that area.  I mean, if you live up -- up -- like, you live above a bar or something like that or above a restaurant people are walking outside and now you have people that are polluting the outdoors, so, um, it doesn't really solve the -- it solves the problem inside the place, it doesn't solve it outside where people that are -- want to keep their environment clean.
L:  Mhm.  So, how long does it take for this study to cut off? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, it should be an- it should be like, in thirty seconds or so, I think.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] So, did they call you on the --
R:  Yeah it's like, ah, it's like, it's like -- both me and your husband ah, signed up for it and it like, automatically calls, ah, the ah, like, a computerized operator --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  And then you get paid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't understand -- I don't know what the purpose is -- I don't know -- they're doing something in terms of like, people talking on the telephone --
L:  How much is the payment?  Oh, ten.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, it doesn't -- they change the topic, like ev- [inaudible] is not clear like, what exactly they're trying to study --
