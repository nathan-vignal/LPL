L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name's Juliet.
L:  Hi, my name is Dee.
R:  Dee?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess the topic is illness?
L:  Mhm.  Um, I'm guessing it's, uh, minor illnesses, 'cause they said it's only about the seasons.
R:  Yeah, well, there's one that I heard about that, um, people get in the wintertime, and it's because they don't have enough exposure to sunlight, so it's kind of like it causes depression, which makes you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which makes you susceptible to colds and things like that, but that's the only one I've heard about, when the seasons change.
L:  Um, I was thinking like when the weather gets cold people get colds and flus, and, um, I guess in the springtime, allergies and such  -- stuff like that. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, yeah.  I know my dad always got allergies in the springtime, and it -- and the symptoms were the same as a cold, like runny nose, and red itchy eyes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't know -- I don't know if that's an illness, but either way ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It still feels like one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they also said something about it's -- um,  a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor?  Did you hear them say that?
L:  Yeah, I heard something about, like seven -- seven days.  I think they were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- talking about the allergies then, 'cause I know for a col- -- e- like they confuse the allergies with a cold, and then if you have it for more than seven days it's not a cold then.
R:  Okay, then it's an allergy.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  I don't know.  I've also -- I had a friend who, um, got severe allergies from the season, you know, pollen and things like that outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and also from cat hair and stuff indoors and, um, I don't know.  I wonder w- if it's like, just like having a cold, where you just get groggy and you can't go to work, and things like that, 'cause his were pretty severe.  But I've never, knock on wood, had to deal with anything like that.
L:  Oh.  Well, my, um, I actually have allergies.  My doctor said that, like those people for se- severe cases, they can get, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- allergy shots in the summer, or, like, whenever, and, you know, um, desensitize them to those -- to the pollen or whatever they're allergic to.
R:  Oh, wow.  Have you ever taken Claratyne?
L:  Um, that's the one thing I haven't taken before. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  That's the one I see on commercials all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I don't know.  Some of them might make you, oh, I don't know.  Do you get the allergy shots?
L:  No, I don't.  Um, I -- I was on Allegra for a little bit, and I'm now on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Claranex for a little bit, um, well just --
R:  Oh, okay.  I've heard of both of those.
L:  Yeah, we're just rotating --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- drugs right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh -- [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  -- fun .  Do those make you tired?
L:  Um, yeah, actually, a li-  uh, a little, so I don't -- I'm beginning to think it's a cold or something 'cause none of the medications work.
R:  Huh, 'cause I know my friend had, he was tak- -- like I said, Claratyne, and we were all in a wedding and he was sneezing and runny nose, red eyes, 'cause it was the cat in the house and also it was springtime, but he wouldn't take any medication, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause it made him too sleepy and he was in the wedding, so, basically, he just had the most miserable day ever.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  So, I --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- I -- [MN]
L:  I heard that Claratyne works very well.  It just, I -- for some reason my doctor doesn't believe it or something.  Every time I go --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, she's always, like, "No try this.  This is new on the market".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I get --
R:  Well, I wonder if ca- -- if let's say, for example, if you wanted to try it, would you be able to or do you need her permission?
L:  I think I could -- yeah, I think I could try it without her permission.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just -- it's weird because I'm sitting there and I don't want to contradict her, 'cause she's the doctor.
R:  Oh, of cour- -- right, 'cause she, you know, she's gone to medical school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I used to work in a doctor's office and they would have -- they would promote certain brands --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of medication based on, you know, who was selling to them and what type of, um, benefits they got, like commission --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they got from that.  So, it might just be something as simple as, you know, the people that are supplying her with medication only promote certain brands.
L:  Right.  I --
R:  But still -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I --
R:  I wouldn't want to offend her.
L:  -- I know I just don't know how to even pre -- every time I go I'm like, "Yeah, I heard that Claratyne was good", and she's like, "Oh, how 'bout this one"?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, really, I've heard Claratyne, it's really good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, thankfully, I -- I don't have to deal with that but, um, I know that the one -- I -- like I said, it's not an illness, but it's kind of like depression, where you get really, um, kind of, you know, you're in a bar and susceptible to colds, is when you're not exposed to sunlight, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, that's fixable by just either going to -- I know it sounds cheating, but going to the tanning salon, 'cause you're exposed to the UV rays --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for short periods of time, it can actually enhance your mood.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I just thought sunlight but I never thought about that tanning booth.
R:  Yeah, because it has the same type of rays, and they actually sell a product you can keep in your office, at work, or at home.  It's a -- it's a little panel that lights -- it emits UV rays and you can use it for, you know, ten minutes a day, and it actually -- it  helps, um, avoid winter depression.
L:  Oh, how?
R:  I don't -- I don't --  isn't that strange?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know if it gives you a tan, though, but either way ...
L:  It probably will 'cause I think its, um, that's what causes the skin to change colors --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, wow.
R:  Yeah, but I think if your mood is good, that you're not as susceptible to illnesses, at least that's what I believe.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.   Like we are happier, like, you know, how they're like, laughter is the best medicine.
R:  That's what I've heard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder why.  I wonder if it's a muscular thing, 'cause you're contracting your muscles?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I took a class in, um, kinesiology, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was about muscles and one of the first things they talked about was laughter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how it -- it can benefit, you know, your muscles [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and your mood --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, I don't -- I don't know if that has anything to do with, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --if it's just  I don't know, smiling, or if it's your muscles working makes you feel better.
L:  Yeah.  Have you ever heard, like, frowning takes more muscles than smiling? [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  I've never heard that.
L:  -- forty muscles if you frown, or something, and like eight to smile.  I don't know.
R:  That's funny because what -- I kind of believe it 'cause when you frown you have to furrow your brow and, you know, scrunch up your nose, and then keep your mouth kind of tight.  When you smile, I -- I'm picturing just, you know, your cheeks and your eyebrows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a good one though.
L:  Do you remember any, um, any of the -- the, uh, other stuff we were supposed to talk about?
R:  Um, --
L:  I completely forgot.
R:  Well, I c- -- I wrote -- I kind of just quickly wrote down a note.  It just said, "Seasonal change; cold lasts seven days if you don't go to -- something about the doctor" and -- and that was it.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- I don't know, if I had a cold I rarely ever go to the doctor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just kind of wait it out.  Um, you know, luckily I haven't actually been sick in a long time.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I don't know.  Maybe that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Not seeing the doctor can keep you healthy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think the last time I went to the doctor was in November but that was to-  unrelated to -- that was just like I -- I ate something that made me sick.
L:  Oh, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sort of like food poisoning?
R:  Yeah, something like that, and it -- I -- I had thought of like three places I had been that day that I got sick and I, like, refused to go back [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they -- they're good places.  It's like, you know like  a supermarket deli that I really like.  I won't go there anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was -- I was -- I couldn't go to work for two days, so, and when I went -- by the time I was able to get an appointment with the doctor, you know, he interviewed me and, you know, checked me out, and he said, basically, now, you know, you're -- you're going to be fine.  Just have Seven Up, 'cause I couldn't really eat --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- till that second day.  I'm like, well, I came all the way out here. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We've spent half an hour of filling out forms in your office, and you tell me to have Seven Up.
L:  Yeah.  I know that feeling.
R:  So -- [LAUGH] that's why I don't like going to the doctor, even if I am sick, I always think that your body can heal itself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to some extent.
L:  Yeah, I just like the, um, like I had the flu this winter.  I -- I thought it was a cold and so I kept on taking cold medication.  Finally, I went to the doctors and, so I don't like sickness is that, you know, sort of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is like a cold, but really isn't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did -- how did you decide to go to the doctor?
L:  Um, I don't -- it was just not going away, and, um, one night I couldn't take it anymore.  I was coughing and I couldn't sleep, so the next stage was the hospital and, um, sat there for a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the doctor goes, um, "You have the flu, just --" 
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- there's nothing I can do, so why don't you go home" [LAUGH]
R:  Go home and go to sleep, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Was it -- is it contagious, do you think?
L:  Um, I don't think it -- well, I guess other people get it, too, so, um, my friends, they -- they sort of got sick after me [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I don't think I gave it to them though.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It could have been -- yeah, 'cause I went to work and I -- after I'd gotten better and I was talking -- I work with students, and I -- one of the girls said, "Oh, you know my stomach was hurting really bad" and I thought, "Gosh, I wonder if I got it from her, and not the place where I'd eaten"
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I was just not sure.
