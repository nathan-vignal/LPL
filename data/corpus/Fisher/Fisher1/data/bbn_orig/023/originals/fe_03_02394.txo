L:  Hello.
R:  Hey.  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Jenny.
L:  I'm Carey.
R:  Hi, how's it going?
L:  Okay.  How are you today?
R:  This is so weird!  I just got the call and I'm like, parking in a parking lot.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm at home but I have a um, small baby, so, um 
R:  Oh, where are you from?
L:  I'm from New York.
R:  Okay.  I'm in LA.
L:  Oh, okay, so we're on opposite ends of the um, country.
R:  Totally.  I don't get it.  So are we supposed to talk, is this like, recorded?
L:  Right.  Um, I guess, like, we have to talk about which um, habit we think is the worst one.
R:  Oh, which one -- okay, there was gossiping --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was not exercising --
L:  Right.  I -- I think smoking is the worse one.  I -- I mean, I don't personally smoke, but um 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've had a lot of family members that smoked a lot and they ended up dying young and so for me, I think that habit is the worst because it not only affects the person but it affects the rest of the family, too.
R:  Hm.  What other options were there, besides smoking, gossiping and not exercising?
L:  I think that was it.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I think smoking's the worst.  I guess gossiping is bad because -- but then, like, you know, everybody gossips --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, you gossip about your friends, [LAUGH] like, if they're really mean one day, like, I -- I don't smoke and I know a lot of guys who smoke and it just stinks up the car.
L:  Right.
L:  And like, they get in such a bad mood when they don't smoke.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I too think that gossiping isn't good.  I mean, I do it. I -- and a lot of times I feel bad about having done it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um, I'm sure the people that I gossip about gossip about me [LAUGH] so 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I don't know, I do- I don't think it really has like, that as big of an impact on other people as smoking does, but, that's just my opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  I don't know what else to really say about it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, me too.  When did you sign up for this study?
L:  Just yesterday or the day before.
R:  Me too.  How weird.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh well.  I think gossiping is like, um, it's kind of like, just communicating, like, venting or complaining, but I don't think it's that harmful unless you're doing it to make someone feel bad, to make, like, someone else look bad, I think.
L:  Right.  I -- it's just sometimes like, I- I'll see -- I'll hear someone gossiping about someone else and then to that person that they were gossiping about they're gossiping about another person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's when it -- I don't know, it just seems kind of strange.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, it's like we said, everyone does it, so 
R:  Mm.  And with exercising, I don't know, everybody that I know, they either exercise a lot and they're completely committed to it, like, even if they're going on a trip overseas they have to find where the gym is that they can go to every day, so I think it's like, it's kind of like dying your hair [LAUGH] right?  Once you start you're just like, oh my god, you just feel so gross if you don't dye your hair when the roots come on. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  When the fat comes, you're like, oh God!  I have to exercise, and um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- such a big commitment.
L:  So they either are obsessed with it or don't care at all about it.
R:  Yeah.  I used to run for a sports team back in high school and it felt really good, like, I felt so hungry and my appetite was up and I think I looked really healthy, because I had like, a tan and everything, but it's like, once college started, I mean, it's just about, you know, shopping, or, you know, socializing.  I don't really exercise.
L:  Right.  I know.  After I got ma- well probably like, six months before I got married I -- I started like, really exercising a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, I had lost, like, twenty pounds --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and then I was able to keep up with that and everything and then I had my daughter in June and um, I gained forty pounds with that pregnancy, but she was almost ten pounds when she was born --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and now I'm like, just about two pounds above, but I'm not able to exercise like I was before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't have the time.  I mean, she keeps me pretty busy, 'cause she's starting to walk and stuff, but I'm -- I'm not obsessed with it any more. [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you have like, a nanny?
L:  I don't.  But I --
R:  Oh.
L:  I quit my job an- to stay home with my daughter.
R:  How's that?  Like, do you find that you have less time for friends?
L:  Y- I don't have much time for any thing these days, you know, she keeps me busy --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- round the clock and so.  It's such a different -- it's a different life, definitely.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But um, 'cause I worked in a hospital and everything was fast pace and now it's like, you know, everyday is the same [LAUGH] thing, it's kind of like, have you seen that movie, that old movie ah, Groundhog Day?
R:  Yes.  I knew you were going to say that! [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] See, it's kind of like that, but I mean, it's great.  It's great staying home with her, it's just very different.  So, but I wanted to stay home until my first went to school and then go back to work after that.
R:  So you're definitely not thinking about another child any time soon, huh?
L:  Um, probably when she's around three.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  It's a lot of work.  I don't know if I could -- I don't think I could be, like, go through pregnancy and all of that with her at the age that she is now.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And I definitely don't want her smoking! [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah!
L:  You know.
R:  Totally.  I mean, my parents don't smoke.  D- does anyone in your family smoke?
L:  My father smoked.  He died, but not from that, but um --
R:  Oh really.
L:  He -- he smoked um, a lot and my brother smokes a little bit, but um, like, all of my grandparents, or I shouldn't say all of them, but three of my grandparents died from things that were related to cigarette smoking.  So 
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And they were all young, I would consider them young, I mean one was only fifty five when he died, um, and the other one --
R:  Wow, my dad was like, sixty when he had me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, my dad was forty nine when he died.
R:  Oh my god.  He's like, younger than my mom is now.
L:  So 
R:  Hm.
L: I- I'm thirty --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- and my mom is fifty.  My mom was nineteen when she had me though.
R:  Oh, that's really young.
L:  Yeah.  So she doesn't smoke.  I'm glad about that. [LAUGH] but um, yeah, so all my grandparents, I mean, they were fifty five and early sixties when they -- when they died and it was all like, related to cigarette smoking, so I'm very against that.  That's why I think that's the worst habit.
R:  Have you ever -- yeah.  Have you ever um, you know, smoked a cigarette outside of school when all your friends were, some people, like, a lot of people were smoking, did you feel pressured to smoke at one point?
L:  I never did. 
R:  Really.
L:  But I have asthma.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, that would just be terrible for me anyway, I don't even like to be around second hand smoke because of that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I never really felt tempted to do that.  But it is kind of -- oh, my brother was always the kid in the car when my dad would be smoking and my brother would be complaining and rolling down the window and everything --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and he's the one that picked up the habit.
R:  Oh my god.
L:  And I never would have imagined that would happen, but he -- he was definitely doing that because of peer pressure.
R:  Right.  Is this your younger brother?
L:  He's younger, yeah.  He's um, four years younger than me.
R:  Like, nobody in my family ever started smoking, but um, my family has a shop, like, that sells miscellaneous stuff, including cigarettes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [LAUGH] 
R:  My god, and so, like, in high school I just thought, you know, so many people smoke, I'll just, like, give 'em packs of cigarettes and my brother, like, lectured -- lectured me about how bad smoking is, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, everybody around me smokes and they waste so much money on it.
L:  Still people around you who are smoking a lot?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, not my boyfriend and nobody related to me, but like, um, like, my best friend, she smokes and her boyfriend smokes, and god, they smoked so much over spring break that I felt like my whole throat, like, just in smelling the second hand, I thought it was like burn.  I could just feel something really weird, like, it was a sore throat or something.  But once I got one day of fresh air that feeling disappeared.
L:  Well they say that second hand smoke can be just as bad as smoking a cigarette yourself.
R:  Yeah, I totally agree with that.  I think it's even worse because it doesn't have the sulfur.
L:  Right.  I mean, you don't -- I mean, I know people that smoke aren't intentionally trying to [LAUGH] make other people sick --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I, you know, I'm sure it's sure it's a very bad addiction, but um, it really -- it's like, the habit that really just affects other people the most.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's why like, now, in a lot of restaurants, you know, they ca- people can't smoke and now in bars in New York and
