R:  Hi, this is Anna, in Florida.
L:  Hi, my name's Teresa, in Texas.
R:  Okay [LAUGH] I've never done this before, so ...
L:  Me neither [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think smoking's bad, but I smoke myself, so ...
L:  Yeah.  I do to.  I think gossiping can be really bad.
R:  Yes, gossiping is bad too.  Real bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it just leads to one thing to another.
L:  That's right.  And you know, the smoking and the drinking I don't approve of, even though I do smoke myself, but those are habits and I guess gossiping, even though it can be a habit, it -- it's something that you have a little more -- I think, control over.
R: Yes, I think you have control over that.  I don't drink but I do smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I know they're all habits that --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I try not to gossip. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, yep, I think that's the bad one.
R:  [LAUGH] So, oh [LAUGH]
L:  Do you know what they -- I mean, do we have to just talk about the subject or ...?
R:  Yeah, I think we're supposed to talk about it for ah, ten minutes or something like that.
L:  Oh, okay, all right, well --
R:  So, ah, I don't even remember what all the habits were -- was drinking and smoking and gossiping --
L:  Not exercising, which, you know --
R:  Oh yes.
L:  -- I mean, all of those are, I guess bad for your health if you don't, but then on the other hand, you know, it's ah, like I said, it's something that you can control, um, the -- the gossiping is just something that's not bad for your health, it's just bad for everybody around you. 
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I've been involved lately in a personal situation to where I just thought, you know, it's, the person that started the gossiping ended up costing me about thirty nine thousand dollars! [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Well, I know how that goes.  I mean, I -- it hasn't ever cost me any money, but, if you s- ah, I -- I try not to -- when someone talks about somebody I just try to think, mhm, yeah, I know --
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  -- and don't make any comments myself because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know certain ones, if you gossip to 'em then they go right to someone else and tell them a story and always add something on to it. [LAUGH] So --
L:  Right, right.  And then y- y- you know if they're talking to you, I think so, Alice, at the pub ju- could you hold on one minute, I got somebody here [NOISE] I'm sorry, I just moved into a house and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I had ah, th- the people here -- bye bye, thank you, I'll talk to you later.  Um, yeah, I -- I -- I remember as a kid, my mother always said, you know, if somebody picks up the phone and talks to you about somebody else you can be guaranteed that when they hang up their phone they're going to be on the phone talking to -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Talking to somebody else. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- about you. [LAUGH] That's right, you know.
R:  That's right.
L:  And it's like, something that I -- I think is very true, you know.  I used to notice that even with my kids.  If they get on the phone to somebody and you know, start gossiping and before you know it, you know, it's like, well, you know that that story's going around and who knows how it's changed, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I remember, ah, a I'm a cosmetologist and I went to -- when I was in cosmetology school and people, you know how they gossip and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well the teacher started from -- on one end of the room and said something to someone --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then by the time it had went through all the way around to the other side of the room, oh, ah, it was totally different from what she had said.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's li- like that game, telephone.  You know?  Do you ever play that?
R:  No.
L:  You know, somebody makes a statement and then they have to whisper it to the next person and then the next and so on and so forth and, like I said, before you know it, it gets down to the end and the story is like, you're wondering, you know, where did they get that from?  It's not even close.
R:  Yeah, well that's like the teacher done that time, th- that's just the way it was, by the time it got to the other end of the class, in this, ah, it was totally different from what she had said to begin with, so ...
L:  Right that's -- yeah, that's true.
R:  That's how gossiping is. [LAUGH]
L:  And you know, I -- I mean, I know there's things bad for you and ah, drinking -- I don't -- I don't drink myself only because I can't handle it [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.  I can't either.
L:  -- um, not working out, you know, all those things are health issues, but I think something like gossip can really hurt, other than, you know, just the person themselves --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I think it can hurt a lot of people, you know, um, without even knowing it, like I said, I -- I just got involved with something in -- in the family and it turns out that somebody said something and it wasn't even true, but before you know it, you know, my sister took it as the gospel truth and [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Oh, okay.  She was in charge of, like, my dad's inheritance and she just cut me out to thirty nine thousand dollars and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- you know, it's like, I don't know if she intended it all along, or, you know, she used this as the excuse, but it's like, you know, and -- and it -- it -- it's just because somebody just decided to start gossiping.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  So, I don't know.  I -- I --I can't remember the other, the drinking, no exercise, oh, over eating.
R:  Well, I don't do any -- I don't do much exercise [LAUGH] and so, ah.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I guess that's a bad habit [LAUGH] not to do.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  One thing I -- go ahead.
L:  Yeah, over eating, I think they said, it's another one.
R:  Oh, I don't over eat, but I, ah, I eat at the wrong times [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well I eat -- I eat the wrong things, but you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well I eat -- I eat the wrong things but I also eat at the wrong time which has a lot to do with if you eat at night you um --
L:  That's true.
R:  If you eat during the day you can, you know, go around and do things, get it off, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if you eat at night before you go to bed, that's what's bad.
L:  Right, it just lays there.  That's true and I -- I know that my husband has just started a job where he works till nine, so that's right, 'cause I put on weight since, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you eat dinner, 'cause by the time he gets home it's ten --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --you know, and it just doesn't seem to work its, you know, self out and stuff, you know.  So ...
R:  No, no.  You're supposed to eat about two hours before you go to bed.  At least.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm lucky if I have the kitchen cleaned, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- by the time I'm ready to plop into bed, you know, at the end of the day and stuff, so --
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Where are you in Florida?
R:  Ah, I'm in Navarre.
L:  I don't know where that is.
R:  Close to Pensacola.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, my folks lived in Newport Riche down on the gulf coast --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but um, you know, th- this, ah, like I said, I think the other things that they listed, you know, are stuff that hurts you, personally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, yeah, the smoking around people could give them second hand smoke or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't do that either, but ah, you know, the other stuff, the gossip, is something that, boy, I tell you, you can watch that stuff just go like wildfire.
R:  Oh yeah, I know.  That's right.
L:  You know, an- an- and hurt so many people, you know, I mean, even though this money that I lost out on, you know, hurt me, I've got four children that -- that you know, could have gone to them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they ended up losing out on it, and like I said, unfortunately there's no way to, you know, go back and undo it because she just insists on listening, you know, to what this other person said, so, ah --
R:  Wow, that's ah --
L:  -- my smoking doesn't hurt her, it doesn't hurt anybody else or, um, you know, and um --
R:  No, that's -- we hurt ourselves -- well, our smoking, if we smoke outside doesn't hurt anyone else, but you smoke inside it does, but --
L:  Yeah, well in Texas now -- 
R:  Which I did, smoke out- inside, but I -- I have started smoking outside now.
L:  Yeah.  Well, Texas has just passed all kinds of laws where you can't smoke in restaurants or --
R:  Oh, is that where you're at, in Texas?
L:  Ah, in the Dallas area, yeah.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, so you can't do that anyway any more and I don't smoke around my kids or my grandchildren --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I didn't smoke when I was pregnant, you know, I mean, I knew enough not to do that kind of stuff, you know --
R:  Yeah, I'd like to quit smoking's, what I'd like to do.
L:  I know, I know, and I -- the more I think about it -- I just moved into a house and it's been so stressful, I mean, it's four months --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know, um, there still do- the builder's still doing work on the house.  It seems like very time I get something unpacked they come in to do something -- you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, but ah, I mean, exercise, you know, I used to be a -- a personal trainer years ago.
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  Yeah, I started with, um, you know, m- m- menopause with a bad bladder so I couldn't do much aerobics and um, you know, I just couldn't keep up with it any more and I know -- and -- and then I broke an ankle so I can't do any of the --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- yoga that I used to teach, you know, and it's like [LAUGH] God.
R:  Well I used to ah, do yoga for a short time --
L:  Yeah, I did it for years.
R:  -- a long time ago and I liked yoga and I've been wanting to do that Tai Chi --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but I bought that Billy, ah, Blanks, or whatever it is, the Tai Bow tapes, I bought all them and everything and never even used 'em yet.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  You know, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, like I said, when I broke my ankle and tore my ligaments, ah, I can't do any twisting and turning because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because any of the turns and my knee goes out from under me unless I get surgery, which then I'd be more scared afterwards to do it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too, you know and ah, so I know that.  I know the overeating's bad and um, you know, like I said, I don't -- I don't think I overeat, I just eat the wrong things and now were eating late at night that -- that's something else too.
R:  Yeah, that's one of the worst times to eat.  That's what I do, I eat at night.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it's kind of hard, you know, like I said, he works till nine and um, you know, by the time he comes home and I have dinner ready, it's you know, it's pretty late.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's getting on there, so, I know that's probably the reason, and plus the age, you know, um, that I've gained the weight w- w- you know.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH] 
L:  So I --I -- I think a lot of it has to do with the metabolism and stuff --
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know, it's just kind of slowed down.  They got me on medication for it and um, they still haven't been able to adjust it, but the doctor's like, scared, because the more they give you of the Thyroid medicine the more it can damage your liver so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kind of another one of these women things that you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Like hormone replacement, you know, do you do it or do you don't do it?  You know.
R:  [LAUGH]
