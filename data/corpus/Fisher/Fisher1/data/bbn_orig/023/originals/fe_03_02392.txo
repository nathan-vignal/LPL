L:  Hi.  I'm Zack.
R:  Hi.  I'm Erica.
L:  Um, yeah.  For the question I would have to say gossiping is the worst, ah, because it affects people other than you, which, ah -- my opinion would not [inaudible] fully responsible.  I don't know.  What do you think?
R:  Mm, yeah.  I was gonna say gossiping too.  I really couldn't understand what else she was saying besides smoking and drinking and all that.  But, I would say gossiping is more harmful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to everybody else.
L:  I don't know.  I drink and I smoke, so I'm a little --
R:  So do I.
L:  -- biased.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know --
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm -- I don't know.  I have no idea how to fill ten minutes on -- I don't know -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- ten bucks though.
R:  I don't know.  I wasn't even expecting the call, so [LAUGH] -- um, yeah, I like to smoke.  I like to drink.  And I don't know what else she said.  What else did she say?
L:  Ah, using caffeine to much, which is another --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  I guess --
L:  Um --
R:  -- that would be bad if you were driving.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- yeah.  I mean, caffeine -- I'm -- like, I live in caffeine, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah, I've gotta say gossip.  I'm terribly biased.
R:  Yeah, same here.  Hm.
L:  Yeah. [MN]  Yeah, I don't know.  I sat up all night and, ah, did homework and stuff, so, you know --
R:  Yeah, there you go.  I don't know.  I don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really drink much stuff with caffeine in it though.
L:  Yeah?  Well --
R:  Like, I'm not a fan of caffeine.
L:  Yeah, it -- I don't know.  I don't really drink soda that much.  I drink Red Bull though, which I think has a -- a hell of a lot of caffeine in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though -- even though I like it's, ah, ginseng and stuff like that, I -- I don't know.  It's --
R:  It's mostly caf- --
L:  -- it can't be good for you. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Well, then you mix it with vodka and then [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Red Bull and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. I was -- I was actually at a bar the other day and a Red Bull and vodka in -- well, in Manhattan though costs thirty dollars at a bar.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  But th- -- but that was pretty, ah -- pretty steep after, like, a thirty dollar cover charge.  But --
R:  Whoa.  What club was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this?
L:  Ah, it was a place called Webster Hall.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be [NOISE]  -- I don't know -- it's supposed to be [MN] the best club in New York or something.  I -- I don't know.  I was there with some friends for a few days.  And, you know, they were clubbers.  But, ah, yeah, vodka and Red Bull for thirty dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, that was about my entire budget --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- for the day.  I couldn't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- eat for a week.
R:  Oh my God.  You just go to a liquor store and get a seven dollar bottle of vodka, and go buy a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dollar[?] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of Red --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- Bull and --
L:  I -- I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I did bring my flask with me 'cause I was assuming that, you know, I -- ah, that it would be expensive as hell.  So, I got away --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little bit. But --
R:  I hope it was good vodka. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. I --I -- I don't even think it was.  I think was, like -- like, Smirnoff maybe.  That's something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's okay.  But, it wasn't --
R:  Smirnoff's kind of in --
L:  -- like, Stoli or anything.
R:  Yeah.  Smirnoff's kind of in the middle.  I was actually gonna buy vodka yesterday.  And I went there and I saw the cheap vodka, and I was, like, "Cheap vodka's bad".  Then they had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Stoli for twenty two dollars.  And they had Smirnoff for fourteen.  I was, like, "Okay, I'll take Smirnoff".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Smirnoff -- Smirnoff blue label's -- is great.  It's, like, a hundred proof, and it's the same cost as eighty proof.  So, you're just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It -- yeah.  Much more effective.  But, I think, ah, Vox vodka is like incredible.  I mean, I've had it a few times.  It's like drinking water.  It's great.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's it called?
L:  Vox -- V.O.X.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know.  It's -- it's not even Russian I don't think.  But, it's only -- I mean, it costs as much as, like, Absolut.  But, it's a lot -- it's like water.  It's great -- it's great.
R:  Mm.  I'll have to find it.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's pretty much all I drink is vodka.  I drink Yaegermeister sometimes.  But, I like vodka.  It's -- you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mix anything with it, so --
L:  Yeah, vodka, ah -- yeah, I tend to stick with to, like, vodka and Captain Morgan's.  And it's not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- not bad when you mix it with Coke or something.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most of my friends like Jack Daniels, and that's probably the --
R:  That's --
L:  -- foulest stuff I can --
R:  -- disgusting.
L:  -- think of.
R:  That's so gross. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's even worse warm.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  That --
R:  I -- I have some friends who used to chase it with -- like, chase warm Jack Daniels with warm root beer, and that was the most --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- horrible --
L:  That's awful.
R:  -- combination ever.
L:  Yeah.  I have a friend that mixes it with Mountain Dew somehow.
R:  Ew.
L:  I don't know.  It's like a -- becomes a murky brown liquid.  It's really disgusting. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah --
R:  That's horrible.
L:   -- it's a -- [LAUGH] yeah, vodka's definitely the way to go. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I like the vanilla vodka.
L:  Yeah, actually the vanilla and the, ah -- the raspberry I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, the Smirnoff Twist flavor or whatever --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- is also -- ah, it's, ah, pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  My -- ah, we like to mix with, um, Vanilla Coke, and it tastes like candy.
L:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Vanilla Coke and -- yeah, very good.  And, ah, what is it?  If you take a shot of Baileys I think and put it into a pint of Guinness.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Guinness is really thick anyway, but -- I don't know -- my -- my friend was a bartender for a while.  And I don't -- I can't remember what it's called, but [NOISE] put a shot of Baileys into a pint of Guinness and it's great.  It's li- -- I don't know -- it tastes sweet somehow.  It's a --
R:  See, I don't like beer.   I can't drink beer.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I -- I got -- there -- there's a guy that lives in my, ah, apartment that is from Britain and he, ah -- he doesn't drink American beer because it's, like, not thick enough for him. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, Gui- Guinness is kind of, like, the low end of what he drinks.  But, he --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  -- brought some stout over with him.  And it's like -- it's like sand, or -- it's just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the thickest crap ever.  It's -- I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't understand how you can drink more than a glass of it.  But yeah, he's not a big beer fan either.  I don't know.  [several inaudible words] being like water though.  It's great on, like, a summer day or whatever just to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- open a beer.  But, you know, not --
R:  I used to [several inaudible words]
L:  -- to get drunk with.
R:  Yeah.  Really you have to drink a lot of beer to get drunk.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  And that's, like, just defeats the point of drinking really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You think?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, yeah last summer it was just -- it was like I had no job for about two weeks and me and my friend just went on a binge.  And it was, like, at the end of that you -- we could probably drink, like, cases and cases of beer a day and be, you know, pretty, like, tipsy or whatever, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you still don't get drunk.  It's li- -- it's ridiculous.
R:  Right. 
L:  It just fills --
R:  And it's not --
L: -- your stomach up.
R:  -- a good drunk either.  It's kind of, like, sluggish.
L:  Yeah, it's -- yeah, if you wanna get, like, actually drunk you've got to go with liquor.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what -- yeah, you like -- see, I quit smok- -- or, I tried to quit smoking about four or five months ago.  And it's like, yeah, you know, no problem when you're sober, but when you're drunk you've got to have a smoke.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like -- it's so necessary.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's what happened to me.  Like, I -- like, I turned twenty one last year, and I quit smoking for three months beforehand.  Then I turned twenty one and it was all downhill.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I started smoking again.  It was really bad.
L:  Yeah, that's what I -- yeah, I'm only twenty, but -- so, like, with, ah, British friend, he's twenty one.  So, you know, we'll go to the bars together or whatever and it's just [MN] -- yeah, it's no good.  I mean, like, bars are fun, but [LAUGH] it's such a waste of money.  Like, just go buy a fifth of liquor and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have a -- have a good night for a third of the price, you know.
R:  Right.  Well, that's what I've been doing lately.  I just go to a liquor store and buy a big bottle of vodka and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we get drunk before we go to the clubs.  It's so --
L:  Yeah -- yeah, exactly.
R:  -- much cheaper.
L:  That's -- yeah, just drink -- drink in your -- drink at your place -- whatever and then go out.  And don't buy drinks when you're out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  once you're there[?]. [LAUGH]  My friend -- my friend -- ah, when -- when I was in New York -- when we went to that club that was expensive as hell, my friend drank almost a fifth of, ah, Bacardi, like, by himself and --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  -- and blacked out before we got the club.  So, then he --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he -- like, he didn't go into the club I don't think, but the club was thirty five blocks from our hotel and he somehow -- when we got back he was there.  And he had no idea how he'd gotten back. [MN]
R:  My God.
L:  [LAUGH] That's -- yeah, that's, like, three miles.  Ah, [LAUGH] he -- he's like, "Maybe I called a cab.  I have no idea though".
R:  [LAUGH] Wow.
L:  But yeah, so -- I don't know.  Can't -- you can't pregame that hard I guess. [NOISE] 
R:  No.  Wow.
L:  [MN] It's no good.  The, ah -- so are you in college?  Or are you, ah --
R:  No.  I'm just working --
L:  Okay, sweet.
R:  -- full time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I me- -- 
R:  It's kind of boring.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- yeah.  I'm about to have to pull the full time grind.  College is too damned expensive. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  What are you doing?
L:  Ah, I'm sorry?
R:  What do you do?
L:  Ah, I go the University of Illinois. [LAUGH] 
R:  How's --.
L:  And yeah, I do, ah --
R:  -- that working --
L: -- computer --
R:  -- out?
L:  -- science.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  I did -- I did, like, a stint in college doing that, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I dropped out.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm hoping that I -- [LAUGH] I'm on academic probation right now, so I'm hoping that I don't --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- drop out.  But, ah --
R:  What'd you do?
L:  I just got a low GPA last semester, and that --
R:  Oh.
L: -- brought me down to, ah, below a two point five.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But, ah, yeah, hopefully that'll pay the bills and allow, ah, much more drinking of Vox vodka instead of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- ah -- instead of -- I'm trying to -- I can't remember the brand that -- that we always drink here.  It's -- oh, it -- it's Gordons.
