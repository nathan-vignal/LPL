R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Marty.
L:  Hi.  I'm Laura.
R:  Hi.  How are you today?
L:  I'm really good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  This is -- this is my first time on this thing.  How about you?
L:  Me -- me too, so that's good [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, I guess so, so we won't be expecting too much out of each other.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Where -- where -- where are you from?
R:  I'm originally from Quincy, Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I'm originally from outside of Philadelphia.  I'm in, um, southern New Jersey right now, though, so...
R:  Oh, okay, well, that sounds pretty exciting.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  You probably don't know -- um, you've probably heard of Mark Twain?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe Hannibal, Missouri?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Quincy is just up the river from Hannibal.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that's kind of an easy for people to locate us, but, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, I -- I was, uh, I don't know if the, uh, topic was kind of difficult, but, uh, I was often ill in Quincy [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, actually I was sick quite a bit growing up.  Um, kind of had like, uh, you know, that's -- they mention like change of seasons in the topic?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not sure I got all of the topics that they mentioned, but I mentioned the change -- they mentioned the change in the seasons.  Well, I was one of those kids who got like, uh, bronchitis, pneumonia, stuff like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at the change of seasons so, but it seems like I've outgrown a lot of that, so --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- yeah, but --
L:  That's not so bad, because I think I noticed it most -- I -- I think it's interesting that they did mention change of seasons 'cause I -- I think that's very true.  For me, it's more like allergies and sort of like flu, not really, I don't know, not -- not like a real, you know, big sickness, but I did notice it most --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I -- when I, um, when I moved, but when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not just, uh, like change of seasons, but actually like where I was moving to.  When I was in college, I got more sick there from like living in a different location --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, which is interesting, but act- actually, um, the topic I thought was interesting, 'cause I'm, uh, I'm a wellness consultant and what I see is --
R:  You're a wellness co- you're a wellness consul --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that's interesting.
L:  Well, and I work for a company that researches and develops health and wellness products that are actually designed to help prevent sickness --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as opposed to a company that treats it, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean, we're -- we're more focussed on prevention.  I think maybe one of the things they said, one of the topics was something like, you know, what do you do to -- like when you get sick and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I thought that was interesting, 'cause like now actually, you know, I'm focussed more on what I can do to prevent myself from getting sick rather than like, you know, curing it once I get sick, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and well, I think that there is a future move to that right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of people might call it alternative medicine or whatever --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but, uh, yeah, I think -- I think that the emphasis now is on prevention and preventative medicine and, you know, I don't care some -- for some people it might be vitamins, for some people it's, uh, a, you know, you know all this a lot better than I do, so --
L:  Yeah, well, yeah.  What my -- what my company does is we basically specialize in like four different areas.  One is sleep, 'cause a lot of people, um, have a lot of stress because they don't sleep properly --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they say stress is like the number one, you know, killer cause of heart attacks and things like that in the United States.  Um, another one we do specialize in is nutritionals, like vitamins and things like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and then we also do things like environment, which focuses mainly on water, um, the kind of water that people, um, drink, and how that can help their body fight off disease --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the other one is, uh, is fitness, and basically like just staying in shape and things like that also helps prevent disease, so --
R:  Wow, that's so interesting, so what is your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- involvement in all of this?
L:  What -- [MN]
R:  You're working for them -- you're working for them, right?
L:  Yeah, well, what it -- what it is, I'm b- -- I'm considered self employed with, um, like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- an independent contractor, like a wellness contractor --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and, um -- but, basically, what I do is the company it started in Japan and it grew.  They're in like thirty two different countries now and, um, and as a -- basically it's just a lot of people that work through the company, so the company provides like, you know, the products that they research and develop for us to go out and, um, basically a kind of like people have like a doctor.  It's sort of --
R:  Okay.
L:  --  like, they also have like a wellness consultant, and what I do is like we'd go and build, um, like a wellness home for someone and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- describe the different products and things and how they would, uh, you know, improve their life style and, uh, things like that, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so you, uh, you'll go into people's home to talk about their, uh, living style, and their eating and all of this stuff?
L:  Yeah, sort of, like, you know, it's basically a lot through -- through word of mouth, just talking to people and, um, you know, and finding out like, "Oh, I don't sleep right", or, uh, like I don't have this, I don't do this, and, um, yeah, basically just showing them different ways that they can -- that they can improve that, as well as, like, building a business with it.  So, like, you know, I tell people about that and then I train other people how to do the same thing.
R:  Wow, so you're m- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- able to make a living doing that?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's, um, it's -- it's really cool.  I just started actually a couple of months ago, and, um, --
R:  No kidding?
L:  -- it's a lot of fun.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Um, 'cause you just build like a lot of good, like, relationships with the people and, um, you know, it's something that like it's a type of product that really changes people's lives, and so it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that, you know, obviously people are appreciative of that, you know, and, uh, -- I -- I mean I've heard a lot of stories and met a lot of people that, you know, were going to have go and get like surgery for this, or this, or this, and because they use one of our products now, you know, the problems they've had for twenty years have gone away in like a month, so --
R:  Wow.  You know, I -- I -- I've read about stuff like that and then they don't need their surgery or anything anymore, do they?
L:  Yeah, no.  It's -- it's -- it's really, really, um, you know, um, fascinating and a lot of people, you know, in my -- in my family, a lot of them have had like cancer and, you know, and -- and different problems like that, so that kind of interested me, 'cause I was like, well, you know if I can show them a product that can help them get better, prevent this, you know, I think that would be, uh -- so, basically, the goal of the company, their vision, is to, um, is to basically, um, you know, influence and change like worldwide wellness.  They're in thirty two countries right now.  Their goal is to be in over two hundred, so --
R:  Wow, well, I hope it gets to the point where, uh, more health care coverages and things like that will c- -- will cover it, because, uh, most health care, most of -- of that coverage and insurance is all geared towards, um, you know, once you're sick, as opposed to preventative --
L:  Mm, exactly.
R:  -- and, uh, so if -- if you're on the ball and aware of the stuff, it's all out of pocket, and it can be, uh, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I -- I -- I -- I've, uh, can't say I -- I know a lot about it.  I've done some reading, and, uh, I guess it's, uh, I do what I can, but a lot of it comes down to if I -- if I had more money and had more time, I might be able to do more with it, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- most of those things are out of pocket expenses, 'cause a lot of, uh, you know, a lot of, uh, claims just won't cover that kind of stuff, which is too bad, 'cause in the long run we -- we'd all save so much more money.  We will.
L:  Yeah, we really would.  It's -- it's funny because, um, Japan is the number one healthiest country in the world and they spend eighty five percent of their, um, dollars, you know, in the, you know, for health on prevention, and fifteen percent on, um, you know, symptoms and sickness, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- United -- in the United States, the forty third healthiest country in the world, and they spend only fifteen percent on prevention and eighty five percent on, you know, trying to cure things and symptoms they can --
R:  Yeah, there -- yeah, there's an obvious correlation there.
L:  Very big difference, yeah.
R:  Oh, it's huge.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's interesting.  Um, if you ever get a chance read the book.  It's called, uh, "The Next Trillion".  It's by, um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Paul Zane, um, Pilsners.
R:  The Ne- The Next Trillion?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, it's really -- it's really all about like the health care industry, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- basically, um, and wellness, and what --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you -- what he's saying in the book is that the next trillion dollar industry is going to be the wellness industry.
R:  Wow?
L:  It's focussed upon prevention.  Yeah, and he actually --
R:  So, you're right in -- you're right in on that wave then.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.  There's all this -- it's all focussed around like the baby boomer generation, like, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, 'cause that's, you know, majority of -- of people.  It's like every eight seconds like someone turns fifty or something like that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and, you know, a big thing that they're focussed on now is, you know, trying to stay young, eating healthy, preventative, you know, although most of them are  more focussed on things like that now, 'cause they don't like, you know, getting older and aging and things like that, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, yeah, it's -- it's a very interesting, it's very fascinating, and, um, to read -- al- also it kind of explains in there a little bit about how the health care industry works as far as a lot of times what they do with the coverage that employees get --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- is that they -- they only treat the symptoms and not --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- so that they can go back to work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't cover it enough so that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they actually get completely better [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Mhm, exactly.
L:  So, by the time that they retire from their company, you know, they might end up getting cancer, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm. Oh, it's --
L:  -- and it affects their lives 
R:  -- it's just --
L:  -- but their employer doesn't care anymore, because they're not paying for it, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  --so -- but, yeah --
R:  Hey, you said you -- you have allergies and stuff, you said?
L:  Oh yes, definitely [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, 'cause I have allergies.  So, did you find stuff that -- that's good for that, or how -- how do you treat yourself?
L:  Oh, um, yeah, basically -- you see mine kind go like in and out, I guess it depends upon, you know, what they were saying, changing of the seasons and the type -- and the like time of the year and everything, but actually one of -- I have noticed a little bit of difference this -- this year, because one of our, um, nutritional products, it's called "Immunity" and it basically does like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just what it says.  It kind of builds up your immune system and somehow it affects something like that to do with my sinuses too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I haven't noticed it being as bad as it usually is.
R:  Mhm.
