R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Bob.
R:  Hi, I'm Andrew.
L:  Andrew, okay.  Did you catch all the, ah, criteria?
R:  Um, I -- I caught some of it, not all of it.  Something about which -- which do you think is worse, and ah --
L:  Yeah, ah, alcohol, smoking, um, um, not exercising, ah, what else was there, there?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Okay, all right, well, I, okay then I guess we've got three.  Smoking, alcohol or not exercising. W-
R:  Ah --
L:  -- we have to decide which is worse.
R:  Which is worse.  Um, well personally, I think ah, a combination of ah, smoking and consuming alcohol i- is worse.  I mean, a- alcohol I don't think is -- is that bad every once in a while, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  In other words, yeah, modern medicine says that an occasional drink of ah, so many ounces of ah, ah, liquor --
R:  Wine.
L:  -- or wine --
R:  -- is good for your heart, yeah.
L:  -- is good for you, and of course, ah, the extension of that is al- alcoholism, which is -- is ah, extremely detrimental, um, probably -- would you agree more detrimental than ah, smoking?
R:  Um, yes.  Yes I would.
L:  Although lung cancer [LAUGH] ah, is -- is --
R:  Well --
L:  -- probably worse than alcoholism which eventually effects the ah, the ah --
R:  Liver.
L:  -- liver, yeah.  So, ah, and then you're going to have, ah, die of liver, um, um, whatever it is.
R:  Failure, yeah.  I -- I think, ah, I think you're, um, more likely to get liver damage than -- than to get lung cancer.  I mean, I've known people who've smoked for years and years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Well, okay, in -- in talking about habits, um, did you ever smoke?
R:  Ah, I smoked once, ah, as a younger kid, I --
L:  Yeah, well I smoked for years and I spent many years trying to quit.  In fact, I say somewhat facetiously, Andrew, I'm a expert on quitting, because I quit so many times --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- before I finally made it --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- and ah, it was the hardest thing I ever had to do, of course, I've never been an alcoholic, you see?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I guess ah, I couldn't make a comparison there, um, when I drink, it isn't, ah, habit forming at all for me, ah, while I know that nicotine was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ah, well we may as well touch on the -- do you exercise?  I do, every day.
R:  Ah, no, I -- I don't make it a point to exercise but I mean, I -- I walk --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I -- I walk almost like, everywhere I go, um --
L:  Ah huh.
R:  So --
L:  Well, it depends on how fast you're walking because y- y- the object there is to get aerobic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And unless you're huffing and puffing, um, that's not really exercise.  It's sort of like, a lot of people think that tennis is exercise, when it really isn't, because there's too many stops and starts in the game so your heart rate goes back to a more normal ah, pace, when you're say, at the net, playing doubles or waiting for the other person to serve, or whatever, there's -- there's quite a few respites.  And, ah, to get really the benefit of exercise you have to stay at a higher level for a -- a sustained period of time, and ah, like, if you're walking in a city, you have to wait for a stop light or something, that -- that would ah, somewhat ruin the benefit of the exercise.
R:  Yeah.  Well, in that case, I -- no, I really do not make it a point to exercise.
L:  Yeah.  Um, 'course it -- ah, I put weights on my ankles and I carry weights in my hands when I ah, power walk.
R:  Right.
L:  Power walk is just throwing your arms up and really, let's say, going as fast as you can walk, and it's interesting because I had a -- a good friend explain to me -- a -- a minister friend of mine, who said ah, he had to quit running and ah, I kind of teased him about that, and he said, "No, wait a minute", he said, "Why don't you try speed walking?" and I said, "What do you mean, power walking?" and he said, "Try to walk as fast as you can", and the idea is that the human body as a machine is more efficient at running than it is at walking fast and so you stress the body more by ah, walking as fast as you possibly can is -- is harder on the body than it is running.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think that's true.  Ah --
L:  So, ah, it's the way the machine was built, so [LAUGH] I -- I went into walking because there is less pounding, ah, on the total body skeleton when ah, your not running --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and being seventy two years old, why, ah, you reach a point where you want to protect some of those things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But it -- it is a certain amount of discomfort or pain, ah, while you're doing it and the next day, ah, recovery time, when you get up in the morning you hurt a little bit and that's just pretty standard, ah, there's -- there's never a real panacea of -- of time to exercise.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I started at forty.  How old are you, Andrew?
R:  I'm actually seventeen.
L:  Seventeen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you see, you haven't even reached the point -- the thought yet, of ah, what's really important in life.
R:  But um, well, as far as what?
L:  Oh, how long you want to live.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, and -- and th- that's an important thing to decide --
R:  What y-
L:  There's lots of things about, you know, there's the -- the physical and the -- and the mental and the spiritual side of life and -- and ah, those are the basic three and if you want to get into the physical side and you decide you really want to live a long time, ah, you gotta pay the price along the way.
R:  Naturally.
L:  You have to put an input in in order to have the later years, you know.  An-
R:  Yeah, well I'm -- I'm anticipating my death in my forties, only because, ah, because every one in my family has heart problems and they've all been dying in their forties, so --
L:  Yeah.  Well, if you start right now on C O two ten, ah, which you can buy at any health food store and you start realizing that ah, ah, certain types of oils that you use and can take and ah, if you get on a good Omega three oil and if you take C O two ten and don't smoke too much and -- and get exercise every day, you can probably take that -- that expectancy of life maybe to sixty, sixty five or better.
R:  Mm.
L:  There's another thing you can do too, you can get a book on cayenne pepper and if you were to take cayenne pepper every day it would keep the whole circulatory system in much better shape, easier on the heart, no high blood pressure -- there's -- there's a ton of things you can do if you really want to live.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I know my mom and d- dad both had heart ah, problems too, um, and so ah, but it wasn't until I was in my mm- mid forties that that came to light to me, so I started at forty five on what you could now start off at seventeen, eighteen, to doing.  Um, you really could have a life expectancy of ninety to a hundred, but you'd have to work at it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's well worth it, depending on -- on how you value life, you know.  A lot of people really don't care, ah, and life doesn't mean that much to them, and ah, so they say, "Oh well, I'm going to enjoy this and that and the other thing", and not look at the long range picture.  But, ah, looking at the long range picture, ah, doing something with a discipline to it every day, only is going to embellish all the other things you have to do, like, study, or um, if you have to go in the military there's a certain discipline there that you have to have and ah, ah, that's what's really missing ah, in most young people today, is a sense of discipline.  They never -- they were never forced into it.  I mean, like, how many times -- how many spankings did you get as a kid?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I honestly couldn't tell you.  I -- I don't remember.
L:  Oh, well, I'm -- okay.  You don't remember ever being spanked?
R:  Oh no, of course I remember being spanked, I just don't remember how many times.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right, well then -- then -- then you -- you had some parents that gave you tough love.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  That's good.
R:  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  No.  No.  So, um, al- l- a lot of people never experience that and they don't know what don't or do not means, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ah, then you get on your own and you have to apply it to yourself, you know, you nearly have to spank yourself in order to do the right thing.  So, anyway, we better get back to alcohol and smoking.  Um, if you don't -- smoking is a very insidious habit.  I- it sneaks up on you.  I guess alcohol is -- is too, but you know, it's hard to pour yourself a drink in the middle of work or school or whatever you're doing.  You have to wait till
