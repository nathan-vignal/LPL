L:  Hi, my name is Julie.
R:  Hi, my name is [inaudible] Faulkner.
L:  Okay, what do we do?  Just start talking now? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I think smoking is the worst thing. [LAUGH] Smoking, and then after that I would probably say alcohol, 'cause doing the alcohol stuff is pretty bad.  Which one --
L:  I, ah, I agree that smoking is a really bad habit, I- Ive known people that, you know, have died from lung cancer due to smoking and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things like that, so I -- I reckon, I just can't stand the smell of smoking and I also agree, alcohol is -- is pretty bad up there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean it's cool if you're doing that in moderation but when, you know, some people are -- they just go overboard, it's like, you know, too much of a good thing is never good, so [LAUGH] that's the way I feel about alcohol.  I mean, it's cool to do it sometimes, but ...
L:  Yeah if you're just doing it once in a while, socially --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, no big deal, but it's when people who binge drink night after night after night --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's horrible.
R:  Exactly.  It's like, do you ever stop?  Do you drink something else? [LAUGH]
L:  Like, drink -- drink some milk, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah, something. [LAUGH] Koolade, anything but alcohol for a change of pace, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Yeah, so -- I -- I yeah -- I -- I have to agree that, you know, underlying, probably not exercising, is probably for health reasons, not a good idea, not to do, but, you know, who has time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- always to -- to get out there and -- and do a whole bunch of stuff? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [SIGH] I was -- I was supposed to start an exercise -- exercise routine, like, two months ago and it's just, like, trying to get into the habit of, n- not doing too well for myself, I'm not going too good on that, you know.  I think --
L:  I started doing some exercising in January, that was my New Year's resolution and that, but it's slowly drifted off. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what, that's for the past, like, four years, that has been my resolution.  Okay, I'm going to start exercising, I'm going to lose, like, fifteen, twenty pounds and does it happen?  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Food, you know, some things just look too good.  You have to eat it, you know. [LAUGH]  And, then, you know, you got that kind of job where you're sitting down all the time, it's like, ah, I'm tired of --
L:  Yeah, when you have a desk job you just get lazy.
R:  Yeah, exactly, exactly, you don't want to do anything, just go home and veg out for a while, you know.
L:  Yeah, and when I get home from work it's -- it's driving in traffic and all I want to do is sit home and put on the the TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, there -- there you go.  That's what I'm talking about, you know. [MN] Anyway, if -- if I could do something as far as exercise when I'm stuck in traffic that would be cool.  But ...
L:  Yeah, that would. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But who --
L:  I have two hours of commute -- just, you know, an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon.
R:  Really?  Oh, man.
L:  It's like, I'm driving home from work right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  And it's just sitting in here for an hour, it's just like, I need to do something.  I wish I could, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- utilize my time better than just driving, but [LAUGH] you feel like you wasted two hours of your day just driving to and from work.
R:  Oh, man, you don't have to -- you don't have road rage, do you?
L:  No, I don't get road rage unless somebody's, like, really got it on me [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Sometimes you get that one crazy person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which you get so mad at that you just got to yell out. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  I hate -- I hate when they cut you off.  It's like -- and then they cut you off and then they slow down.  I'm like, what was that all about?
L:  Yeah.  Or they slip[?] you off and curse you.
R:  Yeah.  It's like, what is that all about, like, does that -- [MN] how does that help the situation?  Okay, so I passed you and now you want to pass me and it'll fuck me off.  What is that sign?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What happened that time[?] nothing.  But I guess people feel better if they do that.
L:  I don't know, it's just a pain and sometimes what I hate is the ac- the stupid accidents that are caused over, you know, such stupidity that people do, like cutting people off and then it causes a big accident and then they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody else, you know, late getting home because you had to cut that person off.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  It's just such a pain. [LAUGH] I sometimes pass five or six accidents on the way home --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and it's just little stupid fender benders 'cause people weren't paying attention --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or they just -- th- they're in a hurry so fast to get somewhere that they're not looking, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're just cutting people off right and left.
R:  Yeah.  Did -- so, do you have to use um, the hand -- the f- what is that, like, a speaker phone on there now?  On the -- on the -- on the cell phone, [inaudible] -- 
L:  They have -- I don't have the one that's attached to the radio, you got the headsets --
R:  Oh that's a good thing.
L:  Where you got your hands free.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You just wear it -- l- you kind of look goofy, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, but it's a lot safer, so they say, than having, you know, to -- to fumble with the numbers and all that, you know, at the same time.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure how accurate the one with the radio is because I've had people say that it kind of gets fuzzy and sometimes the, ah, I guess when you're in certain areas of the city or state that you live in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the ah, the -- the fuzziness comes through more.
R:  Hm.  
L:  So, I don't know how good the ones with the radio would be.  I think the hand -- I mean, the head set one's probably the best option 'cause you can still hear pretty clear.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I always think of, you know, it's like, both ways, you know, you can hear and then you can p- speak pretty clearly without having to -- to scream into the little receiver part. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But you know what, getting back to the topic, because we went --
L:  Yeah, I know, we got of it. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, another thing that causes a lot of accidents is like, when somebody's like, lighting their little funky cigarette, you know, down -- on the -- driving, and --
L:  Yeah, I -- that's what I hate to see an accident has been caused because someone couldn't get their lighter out fast enough to put that cigarette in their mouth. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, or either they're trying to get rid of the ashes and some of it falls in their lap and they're like, wiping off the ashes and trying to see what they're getting burned, or whatever.
L:  Yeah, what I hate the most is when they flick their cigarette out the car window and it flicks back at you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or when they've finished with it and they throw the butt out -- it's like, you want to scream and -- at that person so bad, it's like, do you have to throw that out?  You know?  Can't you just put it in your ashtray in your car for now, until you get home and have a trash can? [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  W- what are you trying to do?  Start a fire on the side of the road?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that's what it seems like.
L:  I'm not a smoker and I don't ever plan to be. [LAUGH]
R:  I hear you.  I feel the same way.
L:  That's just the nastiest habit.  I have so many people, relatives and friends, that I know who just have nothing but problems from smoking and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's just no pleasure I see in that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't get it, but, you know, people do it, for whatever.  As long as they don't do it around me too much is -- that's all I really care about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we're taking this survey, so you -- are you taking it because you had to find -- you wanted to do something while you're on your commute?
L:  Yeah, pretty much. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  And -- and just you know, to help out with whatever research they got going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is actually my first call. [LAUGH]
R:  Really? This is mine too.
L:  I just signed up about a week ago.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that sounds about right.  I guess that's about how long it takes for them to process everything.
L:  You've been doing it long?
R:  No, this is my first time too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  The phone goes, oh, okay.
L:  Oh, that's good, so we're newbies. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, this is definitely interesting.  And we're supposed to talk for how long about this subject, now?
L:  Um, they said ten minutes.  I don't know how long it's been. [LAUGH] I think th- they interrupt you with a -- the computer when it -- when it's finished.
R:  Probably.  So, what part of the country are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm in Louisiana.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, where are you at?
R:  I'm in California.  What part of Lo-
L:  How?
R:  Yeah, I'm in California.
L:  Really.  What part of California?
R:  I'm in Los Angeles, of all places.
L:  Oh, you're in Los Angeles. I'm in New Orleans. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, you know what, I was raised there, ah, from -- from when I was a baby to about, mm, eleven.
L:  Really.
R:  -- and then my parents moved up, ah, back to California.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  That's like, I've -- I've never got to experience New Orleans.  Never.
L:  Oh.  You should come back one day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'll have to do that some time.  I was in, um, Nachez --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's where we were.  And then we --
L:  Oh, really.  Cool
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you never got to see Mardi gras or anything?
R:  No, and that kind of is a bummer, like, where you def- I -- you know, that would be the on- that would be a good -- a case in -- to drink -- drink a whole lot.
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's when the crazy drunks come out. [LAUGH]
R:  So you have a lot of people then, huh, the traffic is even worse during that time of year, isn't it?
L:  Oh yeah, because you got the parades everywhere and everybody's trying to get everywhere and it's all -- everybody's trying to get into one hole where the parade is going to be and it just causes so much traffic.  That's why I'm glad I don't live on any of the parade routes. [LAUGH] 'Cause you'd never get home.  If you live on a parade route I'd feel sorry for you. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Because you would never get home. [LAUGH]
R:  Th- that might cause you to start drinking. [LAUGH] if you did, huh?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] Nah.  So, I can just imagine what that would be like.  So you guys, ah, what do you do there -- for -- for the trades out there all the tourism during that time of year, though.[?]
L:  Oh yeah, we also got a jazz fest going on right now.
R:  Oh really?
