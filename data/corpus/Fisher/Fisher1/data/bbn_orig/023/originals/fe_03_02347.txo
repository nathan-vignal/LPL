R:  Angela
L:  Hi, Jim.
R:  Jim, hi, Jim.
L:  Hi, how are ya?
R:  I'm pretty swell.  How are you today?
L:  Pretty well.  Pretty well.  Um, interesting topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, gossiping, smoking, alcohol, uh, what was it, overeating?
L:  Overeating.
R:  Or not exercising enough?
L:  Right.
R:  Am I missing one?
L:  I don't think so.  Think that's it.
R:  Well, I -- I don't know, these are all pretty bad habits. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, I guess -- I g- -- the first thing that struck me, um, would be that, um, from -- you b- m- my -- my sort of personal takeout[?] would be gossiping would be the worst because it sort of involves more than just yourself somehow.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I m- -- I mean it's, you know, f- for me if someone is going to chose to overeat or to drink too much or drink caffeine too much, I think was one of them or over- -- whatever they were -- not exercise --
R:  Yes, inflicting[?] upon yourself.
L:  It's sort of -- it's sort of like a more personal decision, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, um, whether or not, um, I would chose any one of those, er, um, excessive, uh, behaviors, but gossiping it's sort of -- it's sort of, um -- [LIPSMACK] it seems to be mean spirited generally, um, and it sort of seems to involve yourself in someone else's business, I think.
R:  I would definitely say gossiping is pretty bad but, I don't know, I kind of lean towards the alcohol. [COUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  Only because, I guess, alcohol is legal --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, I mean smoking is legal but you see a lot of anti smoking ads, but alcohol is legal and it's kind of, uh -- you know, I have a lot of friends who are alcoholics, to say the least.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, uh, to think that -- you know, I guess driving drunk would come into play --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you think about other people --
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  -- but, uh --
L:  That's true.  That's true.  I was --
R:  -- the fact that it's legal but everybody seems to do it, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, caffeine is the same way though.  You see, that would almost make me think caffeine's worse now that I think about it [LAUGH] just because caffeine is really, really bad for you and that's -- there's no a- -- you know, no campaigns --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- against drinking coffee.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, we all know Starbucks is going to dominate some time soon. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [COUGH] --
L:  Mm, that's true.  That's --
R:  I -- although, I don't know, I kinda see your point on gossiping.
L:  But I guess -- I guess, you know, I was sort of seeing how it related -- how -- how it sort of, uh, would affect just an individual as opposed to how each of those, um, things does impact on society as a, you know, a- as a whole and actually I suppose each one of them, if you sort of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, really look at it, like even, um, overeating I suppose could lead to, you know, health problems and so it's -- you're -- you'd be a greater burden on society if you have health problems and the same with alcohol, you know, as you were saying drunk driving and of course alcohol in many forms affects all of society, um, wow! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's more of a dilemma than our thought.
R:  I guess excessive in general is bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, if you excessively drink too many O'Dooles[?], non alcoholic beer, then you've, you know -- could be excessively a non alcoholic, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know, yeah.
R:  Um, [COUGH] I don't know.  I guess if we have to lean towards one more so than the other there I'd have to think about it.  Uh, not exercising, how could that be worse than alcohol?  I -- I don't -- I can't see that being my -- my number --
L:  N- --
R:  -- one choice at all.
L:  N- no, no.  
R:  Um.
L:  Um, yeah, yeah, I guess, uh, if we look at it in terms of which of those behaviors, um, sort of, um -- well, th- there's either -- which one of these could be most addictive, or which of them could sort of, uh, change you as a person than most.  I -- I guess alcohol'd probably be pretty much up there.  Not that that's the issue.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] Um.
R:  And alcohol is definitely -- I think it's so available.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and -- I mean, you start -- you know, it's a social thing -- it's a social thing and everybody wants to socialize, everybody wants to have friends and a lot of times that involves going to bars or going some- -- you know, even dinner where you have wine.  It might start off as that and then you drink a little bit more and it's like -- in -- in especially in a lot of careers, like a lot of jobs, the -- the big thing is to drink afterwards.  To have happy hour after work.  You know, even -- I've worked at places where they've promoted alcohol drinking. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And it -- you know, evidently though there's no serious campaigns against it and yet everybody sits at work tapping their finger waiting for the hour of happy hour to come up. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, and then they -- of course the next day is always really bad for them.  I -- I think it's a personal habit -- and -- and it's harder to say no to I think too, because it's so available.
L:  Right, and like -- like you said, y- c- y-, um, as a personal habit that only sort of affects yourself -- I don't know.  It's sort of -- I guess it's sort of hard to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- look at it, um, in sort of a -- a -- a, um, isolated manner, I suppose.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think if it was more personal and you asked yourself which one was probably, you know, one of the worst for yourself, I would guess -- and not inflicting on other people would definitely be not exercising because how could you not exercising really affect a large cod[?] of people?
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  You know, um, versus if you're drunk and belligerent [LAUGH] and you're on the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- street and you're yelling at somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know, if you're [COUGH] -- I g- guess I don't lean towards smoking 'cause I reason although it has health problems it's -- it's your health, you know, and although we have[?] their second hand smoke, you know, that person chose to be in that environment.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, indeed, and that's sort of a big thing right now. I'm -- I'm in New York and right now, um, a law has just been passed in all the bars and restaurants, uh --
R:  No smoking inside, right?
L:  No smoking -- right.  No smoke at all.
R:  Yeah, I just moved to New York.  I -- I -- I thought that was strange. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean it's good, but y- you still make a choice, I guess, to be outside talking with your friends who smoke.  You know, I have friends who smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, on occasion I'll smoke a cigarette, but it -- I don't -- not in excess, but I can't see that being -- I can't see that being the worst, although [COUGH] overeating -- there seems like there is one we missed too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  Well, I know there is caffeine, uh, excessive caffeine use.  How can that be a really bad?  I mean, obviously on your budget if you're a Starbucks addict like I am, then -- then you definitely would be. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think we can probably -- if -- if  -- if we can sort of like rule some of these out.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I would say caffeine probably.
R:  Yeah, so we c- -- we could take out caffeine.  Possibly not exercising, at least I would. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, in terms of sh- -- well, I guess a- again like as -- as you say, if it's in terms of just, uh, how it relates to yourself, um, it can't hurt any other people probably.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's unlikely, um --
R:  And generally who decides the worst is what, the general population, right?  And if you're -- if you're trying to determine something that is overall most popular, whether it's most popular for, or most popular against, it's a mass majority.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, if something's affecting only that person, the likelihood of the mass majority agreeing on that being the worst is slim to nothing if you're --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, we're more concerned about ourselves. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  So, I -- I -- see I'm crossing 'em out here, um, smoking --
L:  Oh, you're taking notes?  That's good. [LAUGH]  You actually wrote them down.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, it helps me 'cause they said it so fast.  I was like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "Huh, I'd better write these down real quick".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, overeating, I -- I wouldn't lean towards.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm kinda between gossiping and alcohol because you made such a good point in the beginning about gossiping and gossiping is also kind of a -- maybe a disorder that's not a choice you make.  You know --
L:  That's --
R:  -- some people gossip exc- really excessively and it's not by choice.  It's not like when you say, "Oh, I'm gonna go out and have a drink", you just find yourself gossiping.
L:  But, that's sort of -- I -- I think y- you don't make a conscious choice but -- but it's sort of probably s- a -- a habit that's been developed and it's just part of your -- your life --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, I think, you know, there's certain people that -- that's sort of how they function on a -- on a normal basis, I suppose.
R:  Yeah, and -- and there's rehab for alcohol, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Is there rehab for gossiping? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know of any.
R:  So, you -- you have like, uh, almost a personal disorder that you've allowed yourself to become a habit, and that's gossiping, and if you realise that you gossip too much and you find yourself gossiping before you even think about the fact that your mouth is moving and words are coming out, you're talking smack[?] about somebody else, then, uh, you know, what do you do?  Who do you go turn to?  You say, "Mum, I -- I have a --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- gossiping problem". [LAUGH]
L:  In a way it's more, um, pervasive in a way because it's not actually[?] recognized, I suppose, as an ill, in a way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Al- almost like I was kinda trying to say about caffeine, like there's no -- like people don't really look at it but gossiping's even more kind of under the covers.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, so, yeah, it's a close toss up for me.  What do you think between --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- gossiping or alcohol, excessive alcohol drinking?
L:  I think I'd have to -- I'd have to probably rehear ex- the exact phrasing of the, um, the question, sort of put to us.  Uh, but it's sort of, um --
R:  I think which do we think is the worst?  I think, out of -- out of personal habit --
L:  Out of personal -- okay --
R:  -- which do we think is the worst?
L:  What do we think are the worst as a personal habits?  Um, well I think -- I mean, it -- it would have to sort of probably be excessive alcohol I would think.  I mean, i- in terms of i- i- having the -- the -- the -- the most impact, I suppose.
R:  Impact, yeah, because alcohol affects your budget, it affects your health. [COUGH] You know, I've seen a lot of ads about how it affects your health and your heart size, um, you know, it affects the people around you.  Um, it could affect people that you don't even know if you're driving drunk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which a lot of people do and I even know somebody who, you know, been involved in that situation.  It's bad, you know --
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  -- if you don't wanna hurt somebody you don't know, much less hurt the people you do know, or even yourself, which at the point you probably have no control over whether or not you're hurting yourself.
L:  And especially when -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- when we look at it in terms of excessive for --
R:  Ex- --
L:  -- any one of these habits.  If it's really excessive then --
R:  If it's really excessive then alcohol would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- definitely turn into some of those things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because excessive doesn't come along with [COUGH], "She got really drunk but she was completely okay, she didn't bother anybody, she didn't --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- drive drunk".  I wouldn't consider that excessive.
L:  Right.
R:  I would consider excessive like, "She got sick, you know, she got in the cab and yelled at the cab driver, or she caused a scene on the street, or ran over somebody". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know.  So --
L:  And I suppose, uh, again -- again it's sort of a -- a question of i- if we're including, um, the effects on society as a whole because I suppose real excessive smoking, or if you're smoking three packs a day you're gonna kill yourself with lung cancer pretty quickly, I suppose.
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, but then -- then again it's not going to affect society as a whole as --
R:  Yeah.
