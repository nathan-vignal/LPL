L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
L:  Oh, hi, Stephanie.  This is Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.
L:  Um, this is your first time participating in this?
R:  No, it's my second time.
L:  Y- second time, me too [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where did you find this?  From Tradewiz[?]?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, friend of yours?
R:  Um, no.  I was on a like a message board.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Colorado.
L:  Colorado, oh, really. I'm in --
R:  Yeah, where are --
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The person I talked to yesterday was in New York, too.
L:  Oh, really [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you -- where -- where in Colorado, are you in Denver?
R:  Um, I'm actually in Greeley, which is about, oh, half an hour or so away from Denver.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I have friends who live in Aurora, and, uh --
R:  Yeah, I know where that is.
L:  -- and Little Pitt in that area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, I guess we have to talk for ten minutes --
R:  Yes, about illness.
L:  -- about illness [LAUGH].
R:  Yes [MN].
L:  What -- what was your other topic yesterday?
R:  Food.
L:  Food?  Yeah, mine was the same thing about food, yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] It's just a --
R:  That's a little bit more interesting in some ways but, um-- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's pretty strange this, uh, this, uh, call [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder if we actually get paid? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I hope so [LAUGH].
L:  I hope so [LAUGH].  It'd be nice.  Um, what's more -- what do -- I almost forgot.  There was such a long ad- -- a long question [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Yeah, the first one was, um, that some people get -- tend to get sick when the seasons change and do we?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's something like that.  I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- yeah, I guess I -- I do get sick when the seasons change and, uh, I guess I have, uh, I guess I -- um, in the spring I get -- you know, start of spring I get a allergy to pollen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but uh, that's all I really have to talk about this topic [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  What about you [LAUGH]? 
R:  I --
L:  Do you -- when do you get sick? [LAUGH]
R:  No, not really, um, although I do have, um, really chronic insomnia, and it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- gets worse around season changes, so maybe that's sort of like getting sick [LAUGH].
L:  I guess so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder what they're doing with these answers? [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea [LAUGH].
L:  I suppose it's part of a secret government experiment [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think they just want to, um, see how we talk [LAUGH].
L:  I just can't imagine -- I just can't imagine --
R:  It's a linguistics thing.
L:  Yeah.  I just can't imagine them sitting through and listening to all these conversations [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, it's got to be boring.  I'm sure of it.
L:  It's got to be boring so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, we should talk about something more exciting [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that makes them [LAUGH] maybe they'll have more, more of a good time listening to these, uh, conversations.
R:  Right.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Um, I'm a graduate student.
L:  Graduate student, okay, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I graduated in -- from college in ninety eight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, uh, went to, uh -- where did -- where did you -- where did you go to college?
R:  Uh, I did my undergrad at Webster University in St Louis.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Where did you go?
L:  And in -- I went to Syracuse.
R:  Yeah.  What did you do there?
L:  University.  I was a marketing major.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I lived -- and I have -- you know since then I came back to New York and, um, I moved out to, uh, I moved out to LA in the beginning of two thousand --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then at the end of two thousand and two I, uh, -- end of two thousand and one my apartment was destroyed out there [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- in a fire.
R:  Right.
L:  So I lost -- so I lost all my stuff.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  That -- that technically made me sick, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right, I'm sure [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I lost all my stuff and the next thing -- the next thing I know, uh, I was able to get a transfer with my job out there to New York.  I work in -- um, and where I was working, um -- I moved out there to work in the film industry.  I worked at Warn- -- I worked at Warner Brothers out in LA.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And then now I'm just working -- I was working for them just -- just till recently.  They, um, they want to re- they want to relocate my, uh, position back to New York, hey, back to LA.
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  So, I said I didn't want to move back there [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I didn't like it out there, so [LAUGH] --
R:  What did you do for Warner Brothers?
L:  Um, I was the company reader.  I went through all the newspapers --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- looking for, uh, information if they said something negative about any of our, uh, any of our films, TV shows, or any -- the parent company at all, you know.  If they said something --
R:  Wow.  I bet that that was interesting actually, in its own way.
L:  Hey, you know it's interesting for a -- like if they -- for maybe a couple of days [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then, you know, it's like it's a lot of pressure and it's like my boss wasn't the nicest person to deal with, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it's like I don't want to move back to where she is, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She was in California and that's how ba- -- and I -- I hated her from over here in New York.
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  So, [LAUGH] but --
R:  It's easier to hate somebody from an entire country away I think --
L:  Yeah and [LAUGH] --
R:  -- than to hate them right there [LAUGH].
L:  So what do you -- what do you -- what is your major?  What is --what are you doing?  What are --?
R:  Um, I'm in English and Cultural Studies.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I read a lot --
L:  So, what do you --?
R:  -- about film actually, which is why I asked about -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, hey, maybe -- well, I ba- basically went through people's, you know, reviews, you know, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- we -- they -- they had a review file about films.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although I'm the one who got it to all the direct- -- you know, I -- um, basically I took the information and, you know, dispersed it around to all the executives.  That's what my job was.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Right, so they could decide what to, uh, make based on public popularity [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is one of my --
L:   Uh.
R:  -- big griefs with the movie industry actually [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], um, so back to, I guess, to the topic of illness.  I --
R:  Yeah, and there is --
L:   [LAUGH] Don't know much --
R:  -- there were some other things we were supposed to -- oh, um, something about, uh, they -- she said there's a saying that if you -- if you don't go to the doctor a cold will be over in seven days, and if you do go to a doctor it will be over in one week, and whether we think that's true.
L:  Uh, I don't think that's true.  You've -- basically go, you know, I don't know a doctor's always looking to, uh, to -- they're -- they're all -- their only answer seems to be in the form of a pill, so --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] They go okay, come and take this, and it's like I feel like I waste my time, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I'm -- sometimes I'm more interested in like, maybe like a holistic type issue [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- see what they have to offer.  I don't really trust the -- what these doctors are into.  You know, basically they're all -- they're all funded by, you know, pharmaceutical companies, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they all seem, you know --
R:  In a lot of cases what they give you is just to treat the symptoms.  It doesn't actually make you less sick.  It just --
L:  Yeah, I think I'd be better off with like a sugar pill [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  It's possible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, actually --
L:  Um.
R:  -- my dad is a nurse and he says that, um, sometimes the medication to make you feel better can actually prolong the illness a bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  Um, is there any other questions that they had tha- that they wanted to --
R:  You know, I'm pretty sure there was another one and I'm not remembering what it was.
L:  Yeah, they should repeat it --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- somewhere in the c- -- [LAUGH].
R:  They should break in half way through and say, "Remember what you're supposed to be talking about is ..."
L:  Remember what you're talking about, yeah, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Uh, wha- we -- wha- we -- d- d- did you call in or did you, uh, they c- -- you -- si- --
R:  No, they called me.
L:  They called you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, I was like, because like, when they was ringing I forgot that I signed up for the stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I've forgotten whe- I didn't think they'd be calling me like every day.  I just thought they'd give me like three calls or something like that.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they'd be spacing them out.  Apparently I'm getting more and I got one last night --
R:  Yeah, so did I.
L:  -- and I was right -- I was right in the middle of watching my T- [LAUGH] my TV show [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I was kinda like, "Oh, forget about it".
R:  Yeah, I was just making cupcakes, so um -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Fortunately, I'd just pulled a batch out of the oven --
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  -- so it's okay to talk.
L:  Yeah, I have to -- ho -- I would come or have a random conversation all of a sudden, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  It's pretty bizarre [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They should give you a little bit more about the topic before hand, you know?
R:  Yeah, maybe, then you can think of some opinions on it.
L:  At least then you can think of stuff to say, but I don't know if they even actually touching[?] that, you know.
R:  Yeah, I don't think it matters.  I think the real issue is that if they put two strangers on the phone together a lot of times what would happen is there would just be this big long silence so, you know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
R:  I think that's their big concern probably.
L:  So, you like it out there?  Like it in, um, that area?
R:  Um, you know, I don't as much as I thought I would.  Um, --
L:  Oh, okay, but you're not from there originally, or --
R:  No, well, actually ironically I was born in Denver, but I only lived there for the first few years of my life, so I don't remember --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- living there.  My family's in Kansas City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know whenever I go out there it was considering that was like a second place to, uh -- that's where I'd want to live, you know, if I wasn't living in the Midwest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like Denver.  It's really, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I have -- I have a few -- I have like a few friends out there, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's why, you know.
R:  Yeah, I like, um, I like Denver all right.  I like the mountainous areas all right.  I live probably about half an hour from the mountains so --
L:  I had --
R:  -- it's still a little bit of a drive for me.
L:  Yeah, I sort -- the thing that I like over there is those casinos that they have in the --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- Black Hawk and, uh, what is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I forgot.  I remember Black Hawk, those t-  -- those ones in the mountains up there.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, um --
L:  The [inaudible] gambling [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's a couple of hours from me, so --
L:  Oh, really, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I went down there, um, last September to see what it was all about.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I actually like it better than [LAUGH] I kind of like, you know, as far as gambling, because I don't like that too much, you know.  It's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- little bit of fun, you know, because you don't , you know, I read it's like closed bakes[?], you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  Well, have you ever been to Las Vegas?
L:  Um, Las Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  I've been there a couple of times.  I like Las Vegas a lot.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  See I like that better --
L:  So.
R:  -- because there are other -- I'm not a big gambler so there are other things to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I know, I know, be -- but if you just go for gambling, I mean, it's, like, "Oh, it's right there [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  And then I want to go but we never got a chance and like probably next time I go visit my friends out there I want to go to that little springs, the hot springs.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's that?  I forgot what they're called.  I just forgot what --
R:  Yeah, um, oh, I don't remember it either.
L:  Yeah.  Have you been to New York?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  When did you go?
R:  I have a few times.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I have a few friends up there, so.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  What part of New York do you live in?
L:  I live in, uh, I live on Long Island, but I work, you know, work in Manhattan.
