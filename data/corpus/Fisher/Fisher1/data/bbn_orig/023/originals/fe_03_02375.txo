R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Zoe.
R:  Uh, hi, my name is Renee.  How are you?
L:  I'm all right. [MN]
R:  Um, are -- are we supposed to answer the question of what we think is the worst?
L:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
R:  I think smoking.  What do you think?
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I think smoking is probably the worst as far as health effects and things like that go 'cause --
R:  Well, are we -- are we allowed to agree?  This is my first call so --
L:  Yeah, it's my first also. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, are we supposed to say why we think smoking?
L:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
R:  Okay, well, first of all I think it's very self destructive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and, um, it's -- it's a -- it's a bad and sick habit and I've known people that died of lung cancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I had a girlfriend of thirty eight that died of lung cancer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it not only affects yourself but it affects people around you, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, residual smoke. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, um, I'd say I definitely have to agree that -- for the smoking, that's probably the worst.  'Cause people my age -- I'm a teenager -- and, um, I know a lot of my friends that smoke and it's definitely really, really addictive and they did it because it's relaxing from stress and everything, but in the end, I mean, it really doesn't do anything that's a positive effect at all.  And people's parents who smoke and [SIGH] I've heard percentages and everything of, you know, kids and things that die from just the secondhand smoke is really, really bad.  Yeah.
R:  I don't see any redeeming, uh, habits to smoking.  I mean, some people feel it keeps their weight down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm an ex smoker.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And when I stopped smoking I didn't put on any weight because I made sure to eat properly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I felt a lot better, I could taste food, um, I didn't have to clear my throat, and this was, like, twenty years ago when my doctor said my throat was in a precancerous stage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I'm feeling a lot better, but I'm a little nervous about it.  I always have my -- do you -- uh, well you -- you're -- [MN] I'm in my forties so I go for lung xrays every year.  What about you, do you go for any lung or chest xrays?
L:  No, I'm just a teenager so [LAUGH] --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm seventeen.
R:  Oh, that's a wonderful, wonderful age.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you ever smoke?
L:  Um, I have tried one drag off of a cigarette once and I hated it, and so I'll never try it again and I'll never bother with it.  No.  Definitely not. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, they say it's the hardest thing to give it up, but I -- you -- I got, you know, scared so much about smoking that I just automatic- -- I just stopped cold turkey.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I had no problem giving it up.
L:  Yeah, I -- I hear it's pretty hard.  I mean, I have friends that smoke and things and they've tried to quit and they've tried to go on the patch and everything and it just -- it hasn't worked for them at all.  So, maybe -- maybe that, uh, they'll see the light some day [LAUGH] but --
R:  Well, tell them to go to a doctor and they'll scare the hell out of them.  I had a girlfriend, thirty five, who died.  She was a bartender, too.
L:  Wow.
R:  So she smoked and had residual, you know, the residual smoke from -- from tending bar.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it was a double whammy.  But it's, um, [SIGH] you know, if you have -- if you get cancer or emphysema from other things, it's one thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we are control of our lives with this.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. [COUGH] I don't know, what do you think about, uh, in restaurants and things?  Should people be allowed to smoke in there?
R:  No.  No.  Only because, uh, other people are affected by it and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can't handle smoke, that's why I don't go to bars.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I agree with the laws about, um, not allowing smoking, you know, in restaurants because it does affect other people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you wanna smoke, go smoke at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Go take a walk. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and smoke.
L:  Yeah.  Hm. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what else do we have to say about this? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well, I think we're just supposed to keep talking for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it that many minutes?  Just talking about smoking or anything else?
L:  Um, well, what else was on that list?  They had overeating or something.
R:  Well, overeating I think is also detrimental, but, you see, overeating is, um, is not deadly.  It's, um --
L:  Yeah, it's not as deadly and it's not as much of an addictive thing as something like nicotine or ... but ...
R:  Well, it could be addictive, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people with addictive personalities will gamble, smoke, overeat or be maybe anorexic or bulimic, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they do things abnormally or --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- off balance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, but this is -- this is kind of interesting.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Washington.
R:  Washington State or Washington D.C.?
L:  Um, State.
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, weird. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And what's your name again, I'm sorry?
L:  Zoe.
R:  Z- Zoe?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, hi, Zoe, I'm Renee.
L:  All right. [LAUGH]
R:  So this is a -- a very nice first call.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  How many calls are we supposed to do through -- throughout this whole thing, do you know?
R:  I have no idea, but I don't mind as many as, uh, as possible.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause this is kind of interesting.  They probably have, um, very current, uh, subjects.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And I guess we're recording -- recorded, would -- would you assume that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're being recorded?
L:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what it said.  I'm -- one of my friends who lives in, um, I'm pretty sure she's in Mississippi right now for school, she's -- she actually sent me, um, information about it and that's how I got signed up for it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, we'll see what happens with the whole thing.
R:  Good.  Well, I just signed up yesterday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So this was -- this was quick.
L:  Yeah, I wasn't expecting it at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, do you go to school, um, college or high school or what?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're in college?
L:  Um, no, I'm in high school right now.
R:  Uh-huh.  You planning to go to college?
L:  Um, I'll go to community college for the first couple of years and then I'll go on do a four year university after I figure out what I wanna do.  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Well, you've got your whole life ahead of you.  It's terrific.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have any animals, any pets?
L:  Um, I have a golden retriever dog and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- two cats. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I have four cats.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are they just mixes or anything --
R:  Oh, purebre- -- ah, pure -- pure, uh, mutts.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Th- they're wonderful.
L:  Yeah, I really like cats. [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I wonder if we -- if we covered everything on sm- -- on smoking.  You know, when I smoked I used to drink.
L:  Yeah?
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] it was -- there were times, you know, I was a heavy smoker, I smoked, like, two and a half packs.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I remember enjoying maybe f- -- ten if any -- if that many.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was just very addictive.  You just keep --
L:  Hm.  How many years did you smoke?
R:  I smoked about, um, five years maybe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Six years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And qu- -- and quit cold turkey when my doctor said my throat was in precancerous stage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I says, "I'm -- I'm not gonna die over a cigarette".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's just not worth it.
L:  Did you ever have any problems, like, after it was precancerous or anything or ...?
R:  No, it was -- it's what you call lucaplecomy[?] which is a, um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it's a temporary situa- -- it's a -- it's a changing of the cells.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it could change and turn cancerous or it can revert back to normal healthy cells --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you eliminate the cause.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the cause of -- of the irritation of the -- of the change was -- was the smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, and then I said, "Well, I'm not gonna gain weight because I'm very, you know, I'm very active and I'm very involved with -- with weight" and I just had to, you know, watch it so I [MN] -- so I just didn't feed my face.  You know, instead of putting of a cigarette in my mouth I wouldn't put a piece of chocolate in my mouth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, I'm very lucky.  Most people have withdrawals.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.  It --
R:  Nicotine withdrawals.
L:  -- it's surprising you were able to get away with -- from it fairly easily after five years of smoking.  I mean --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, I -- I started young.  I started, you know, seventeen, your age.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and that's when you smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, now, I mean, I think people your age are much more aware of -- are much heal- -- more health conscious --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than I was.
L:  Yeah.  Defin- -- yeah, probably more health conscious but [LAUGH] kinda risky at the same time.  I don't know, there's so much stuff going through high school so, yeah.
R:  Well, you can -- you know, you can't live in a bubble.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  So you --
L:  Can't protect people from everything. [LAUGH]
R:  You do take some risks. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, do you work at all?
L:  Um, no. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
L:  No, I'm --
R:  So, do you -- are you active in sports?
L:  Um, no, not too much.  Um, I've done lots of horseback riding and things my whole life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Competitive.  But other than that, I did other sports when I was little but not really when I'm older.
R:  Uh-huh.  I play tennis.
L:  Do you do anything [inaudible] -- oh, yeah.
R:  This is such an interesting format, do you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And especially for a first experience. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [MN] Hm, well --
R:  I think we're -- we're nine minutes.  What time did the phone ring, at six?
L:  Um, I'm not sure.  I didn't look at the clock.
R:  I think it's six o'clock and I think it's six oh nine now.
L:  All right.
R:  But, um, don't ever [MN] -- oh, you know, I remember the first time I took a puff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I inhaled and my head was so light.
L:  Yeah?
R:  It was [MN] -- I got very dizzy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know why, I mean, after that experience I just should have stopped.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But for some reason everybody smoked, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was, uh, a peer thing.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  So, [MN] [NOISE] yeah, very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll never go back to it, never, never, never.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I took the one drag off of it and my throat just burned so much.  And, ugh, the taste was terrible.  I -- I really like the smell of cigarette smoke, like, honestly I -- I just -- I like it but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as far as the taste goes, it's terrible and [MN] --
R:  Well, I thought it -- yeah.
L:  -- like, my -- my friends that smoke, like, it's just in their clothes constantly and --
R:  It's in your clothes, it's in your breath.
L:  Yeah, it's their smell. [LAUGH]
R:  There's nothing rewarding about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nothing at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, it's -- you know, you can get emphysema, you could -- oh, it's -- it's really t- -- I've had friends that have really had a very, very tough time of -- of, um --
