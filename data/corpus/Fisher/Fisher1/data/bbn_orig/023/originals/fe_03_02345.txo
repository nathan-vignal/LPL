R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.  My name is Robin. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Robin.
R:  [NOISE] How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  She was saying it real fast and I was like, man, I gotta press buttons and all this, I wanna talk to somebody.
L:  I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and this is the first time I've done this, too --
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  -- so I'm not real -- yeah.
R:  Well, this is the first time I've done this too, so cool, we can do it together.
L:  [LAUGH] All right, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  Uh, what did I catch?  I catched what are the -- the worst personal habits?
R:  Yeah, you sure did.
L:  All right.
R:  Smoking, that's one of my bad habits.
L:  Real- -- oh, that's my worst habit but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I think that's the -- well, I don't --
R:  It's the only one I have left.
L:  Oh.
R:  They took everything else away from me.
L:  Oh, okay.  See, now, I -- I took the question --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- more as if, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, what they -- what we thought were the worst habits, but not our worst habits. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  So, what is it, our worst habits?
R:  Um, I don't know.  She was saying something about gossiping, cigarettes, drinking alcohol.
L:  Oh.
R:  And something else.  So ...
L:  No, you know, I live in New York City and it's getting to the point where it's almost embarrassing to smoke any more.
R:  I know.  I live here in the D.C. area.  It's okay but people look at you real funny --
L:  Yeah, they don't --
R:  -- when you're standing on the street smoking.  There is a place in Maryland you're not allowed to smoke anywhere at all.
L:  Really?
R:  Except for -- yeah.  It's crazy.
L:  They just passed a law here where smoking is prohibited inside restaurants, even bars.
R:  Well, see, I can understand that but, like, after six or seven at night, come on, happy hour's four to seven.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Can't we be in the back drinking and smoking or something?
L:  Yeah, no, I wouldn't even wanna drink --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- without smoking.
R:  Mm.
L:  I really wouldn't.
R:  I hear ya.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so, um, did you find this on Craig's List?
R:  Um, actually a friend of mine sent this to me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Through email, and he gave me his PIN number to punch in.  So I punched his PIN number in, seven nine oh oh seven.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I -- I -- [MN] you're gonna have to help me out with this one. [LAUGH]
R:  No problem.
L:  All right.  Um, what do you think the purpose is of these -- this ...?
R:  Uh, I guess to see how many people have bad habits like gossiping, telling lies, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer.
L:  Oh, everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, if they're honest, a lot of people [inaudible] -- I know some people that -- that -- I don't -- I'm not into lying myself but I have before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, I know people that do not lie, d- don't do anything wrong, nothing, don't smoke, don't curse, don't do anything wrong.
L:  It's impossible.
R:  And they're not real, "Oh, you know, uh, I'm so good, why don't you try to be" -- they're not like that.  They're not condescending, they're very nice people.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  They're just not into the filthy habits that I'm into.
L:  Ha- -- you think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so smoking's you consider a filthy habit?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And drinking?
R:  Yeah.  Everyone else consider it -- considers it nasty.  I don't, or I wouldn't do it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think gossiping is -- could be dangerous, though, 'cause it --
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely.  I have a few friends that gossip heavily and it's not good.
L:  It's hard not to but --
R:  Well, it always gets back to them.
L:  -- when you know somebody -- but yeah.
R:  But they're the only person that you've said something to.  "Please don't tell anyone I'm telling you this", you know what I'm saying?  And the next thing you know, the whole neighborhood knows.  I'm on a online survey, son, I'll have to talk to you in a minute. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, no, you know what I'm saying?  And you're the only person that you told that person -- you're -- that's the only person you told that thing to so it could only be them that said that.  And they +vehemently deny it.  "No, I didn't say anything, swear to God I didn't say anything".  Well, it had to have been you 'cause no one else knows.
L:  Well, it's just easier to tell the truth or not tell somebody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something then.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I -- I have learned my lesson now not to tell her anything.  But ... [SIGH] I don't know. [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  So, do -- did you -- I understood something about not being able to use that phone number more than five times.  I wonder why that is?
R:  I don't know.  I've no idea.  I haven't given my phone number out or anything. [NOISE] I mean, do you want my phone number?
L:  I don't know, I picked -- I picked this -- what it is, it's on -- on Craig's List is -- I think they have it Washington D.C. also so if you're on the internet it would be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something worth looking up.  It's called Craig's List and it's just a, um --
R:  Craig's list dot com?
L:  Yeah, or just put Craig's List in your search engine.
R:  Oh, okay.  Craig's List, okay --
L:  And then you'll find --
R:  -- let me write that down.
L:  -- you know, it just was under, I think, I don't know if it was under community or part time jobs or what it was but, um --
R:  Huh.  Craig's List, I'll have to check that out.
L:  Yeah, so this is where this was advertised so, you know, that they were advertising to make ten dollars per phone call.
R:  Right, right, exactly.
L:  So that was pretty cool.
R:  Huh. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] The job market's tough up here now especially since nine eleven.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Oh, it's pretty bad here, too.  Well, I don't know, I went to get a, uh, just a, uh, walker's I.D., not a driver's license, and I had moved recently.  So I had to show my birth certificate, social security card, something that came in the mail, anything that was mailed here to this address --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like three or four different things just to get a walker's I.D.
L:  A walker -- they call it a walker's I.D.?
R:  Yeah, well, that's what I call it.  It's just I.D.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Personal identification.
L:  Never heard that, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I just came up from Florida two and a half months ago.
R:  Wow.  Oh, you moved permanently?
L:  Yeah, I came up permanent -- came back home permanently.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't do Florida any more because I have even more bad habits in Florida.
R:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No comment.
L:  Yeah, no, leave that one alone.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not gonna make -- I'm not gonna say anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we all know what Miami's about. [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, no, it wasn't Miami but it's the same trip, so --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, they have boats that come there, you know.
L:  Huh?
R:  [NOISE] They have boats that come there --
L:  Well, I was in Saint Pete.
R:  -- to deliver things.
L:  Oh, yeah, that -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Well, I was born there so maybe it -- maybe that's how --
R:  You're silly.
L:  -- I was delivered, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it comes in on the boat [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] catch us or no they don't.
L:  Yeah, so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  All right.  So, this is interesting.  So, we -- or -- wh- -- so what is it?  We have -- we have conversations with -- with, uh, strange people.  I mean, [NOISE] strange but I mean, like, people we don't --
R:  Well, I'm strange but --
L:  -- know str- -- stranger --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're a strange -- a stranger but not necessarily strange.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You sound normal to me.
R:  [NOISE] Not.
L:  [LAUGH] Not.
R:  Then you're abnormal too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I gotta tell somebody that -- that'll hire me here.  It is -- I can't -- I just can't get over -- I have no problem getting a job, I just can't get over how it's so hard to get a job up here.
R:  Oh, I don't know, I guess --
L:  It's given me a complex.
R:  Um, I don't know, I've been outta work myself for about a year and a half.  I've halfheartedly attempted -- what it was, was I had to go through drug rehab and all this, and after I did I signed on to this business school.  And I already knew how to use a computer, answer the phone, but this was -- they tested you on it and you did regular grade school, high school math, English, uh, answering phones, filing, [MN] basically how to run an office. [SIGH] And it was a real nice course but a lot of people that I applied for, they're like, "Oh, we just want you to answer phones.  It's only eight dollars an hour".  "I -- I'll take it, I'll take it".  "Well, you're kinda over qualified because you ran an office before".  "I don't care, I don't care, I got three kids, I need it".  You know, and I still can't get a job.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  Well, my husband's incarcerated right now and he's supposed to get out in three weeks so I'm gonna be going down to south of Alexandra, which is only about thirty minutes from here in Fairfax County.
L:  Uh.
R:  So if I get a job up here I won't be able to stay down there with him and his mom.
L:  I just got out --
R:  So --
L:  -- in January.  I mean, not January --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- November.
R:  Mm.
L:  That was part of why I left, though, before I got into the same habits again.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I had to.  I had to run for my life.
R:  Well, they say people, places and things.
L:  But it's true, though.
R:  Is it?
L:  It -- it helps just to get out of the neighborhood and then -- you know, 'cause if you want that stuff, you're gonna find it wherever you go.
R:  This is true.
L:  But -- but if you wanna get off it, it helps not to be around it 'til you get strong.
R:  Hm.
L:  Until life starts to get better, then it's like, well, hey, this really isn't so bad.
R:  Right.
L:  And you find connections, other ways, you know, of -- of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- dealing with the stress.
R:  But the thing about it -- well, see, I'm here [NOISE] in Del Ray[?] with my mom and it's like I go a week, two weeks, I won't drink, I won't do any type of drugs or anything, and then one just -- one night I'll just be sitting here and someone'll call and, "Yeah, I'll come out and have a few drinks with you".  Next thing you know we're getting high or something like that, so ...
L:  I couldn't do that if I stayed in the environment.  I wouldn't, I was too weak --
R:  Hm.
L:  So ...
R:  I'm not really in the environment but you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] A lot of times my parents won't let me talk on the phone.  They're like, "She's not here, she's unavailable".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But when the mood strikes me, I'm gone.
L:  Yeah, well, they care about you.
R:  So, and I caught a little charge a couple of months ago so now I gotta pee.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I don't know when I have to pee so [LAUGH] you think that's funny, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not funny.
L:  Well --
R:  It's not fun. [LAUGH]
L:  So ... you gotta do the best you can.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm trying.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But the thing that bothers me, now, like, smoking, you do it every day --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and you smoke -- I smoke a pack a day.  Well, if I only drink or get high once a week or once every other week or once a month, why am I still doing it?  I'm not addicted, have to have it every day.  Why am I still doing it?  You know what I'm saying?
L:  'Cause you want to.
R:  Yeah, but I don't need to.
L:  But you want to.
R:  I guess.
L:  It's not a matter of needing, it's just what you want.
R:  I guess.
L:  You know, and then you -- then you're willing to take the chance on the consequences to do what you wanna do.
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  And it's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know, what it boils down to, 'cause I don't think most -- I don't think most [NOISE] people do it because it -- to cover this or cover that or hide the way they feel, that's baloney.  They do it 'cause they wanna do it.
R:  Hm.
L:  Period. [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe.  Or you just become --
L:  That's what I did anyways.
R:  -- you become used to the addict that you are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  When I went into rehab I was hooked on, like, four or five different drugs.  I was taking fifteen [inaudible] a day and they're like, "You are hiding a lot of pain".  I was like, "I was?"
L:  Yeah, no, I don't know.
R:  You know, to me I never did drugs.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, oh, I just party a little bit once in a while.  Just -- I just party --
L:  I think we could disassociate[?] without the help of drugs if we wanted to, you know.
R:  Maybe that's what it is.  Hm.
L:  So, how much are cigarettes in Washington?
R:  Um, actually they're, like, three thirteen.  It's --
L:  Is it?
R:  -- I -- like, I live in Alexandra, Virginia.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, all right so --
R:  Which is about two minutes outside of Washington, but it's considered the Washington Baltimore area.
L:  Generic cigarettes are six and seven dollars a pack for generics.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  Here.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  They're insane.
R:  Well, Virginia, our main -- one of our main, um, products is tobacco.
L:  That's right, I forgot about that.
R:  They grow it, yeah, here.
L:  So, you're, like, close to J.R. Reynolds?
R:  Yeah, kinda.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kinda.
L:  My hero.
R:  Well, see, Virginia is, like, about eight or nine hours long, the entire state, and I just live at the very tip of it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Which is right next to D.C., right next to Maryland.
