R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Laura.
L:  I'm Jill.
R:  Hi, Jill.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, what was she saying?  What were the topics?  Which one is the worst, or which one is the best?
L:  I think she said, "Which is the worst".
R:  [NOISE] The worst, and one was ...
L:  Gossiping.
R:  Gossiping.
L:  Overeating.
R:  Overeating.
L:  Uh, excessive alcohol, or caffeine.
R:  Caffeine, and --
L:  Smoking.
R:  -- not exercising.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Which one do you think is the worst?
L:  Oh, for crying out loud --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] Probably gossiping. [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's either gossiping [NOISE] or excessive alcohol.
L:  Yeah.  Well, definitely excessive alcohol would be up there.
R:  Yeah, because that --
L:  I wasn't sure if she said excessive or just drinking alcohol, period.
R:  Well, I mean, I don't think that would be the worst [NOISE] if it was just drinking.  But if -- if it was done [COUGH] in excess -- excessively, then -- then I definitely think that [NOISE] it would be, um, you know.
L:  Yes.  It would be the --
R:  Pretty bad. [LAUGH]
L:  It would be the worst. [LAUGH]
R:  Because it affects so many people, so many other family members and --
L:  You're right.  Yep.
R:  Even if you -- you don't -- if you don't live with a family, it could affect your work and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- driving and all that.
L:  My, uh, husband is actually a recovered alcoholic.
R:  Mine too.
L:  Is he? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  My husband -- I don't -- let's see -- he hasn't had a drink in about eight years.
R:  Mine about, um, let me see -- about five, I think.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah, so that one is pretty like close t- -- you know, I could relate with that one.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and -- and -- and it did -- it affected everyone. [NOISE] You know, so ... [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH] Well, Mark put himself in rehab all by himself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which was good.  That's the way, I think, it should be done if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if at all possible.  It --
R:  Yeah, all on their own.
L:  -- has to be their decision.  Right.
R:  Mine just, uh, went to a men's retreat at a church --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] and came back sober and stayed sober.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  That's like a miracle.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Because it was -- it was pretty bad [NOISE] for seven years of going through that [LAUGH] and then, uh --
L:  I think --
R:  -- so that changed.
L:  I think my husband was lucky.  He didn't, uh -- didn't affect his work.
R:  It didn't affect his work.  Mine -- h- his -- my husband his work, uh, at work, either but our family life was going down the drain.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I can imagine, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  Yeah, it -- it was pretty bad.  What State are you in?
L:  Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, you are?  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, great. [LAUGH] How's the weather --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- over there?
R:  It's beautiful.  It's a beautiful, nice, blue, white cloud day.
L:  Yeah, are you in northern California?
R:  I'm in Southern California. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, we have a nice day too.  I like this time of the year.  It's still in the sixties or low seventies.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we're -- we're like high seventies, low eighties.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's nice though.  How did you find out about this? [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  About doing the research thing.  I think --
L:  [COUGH] I'm a member of money and shopping dot com.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, they're mystery --
R:  I never heard of that.
L:  I do mystery shopping, uh, where you go and evaluate different businesses.
R:  Gosh, I would love to do that.  
L:  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  I always [LAUGH] -- I always --
L:  -- you know, money and shopping dot com.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's one of the easiest ways to do it really is to, uh [NOISE] --
R:  And wh- --
L:  Y- -- there is a membership fee, but I have made that fee back, probably fifteen times over.
R:  Really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.
R:  Wow, and how often do you get to do it? [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] It's really up to you.  Y- you get on lists --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and you sign up with different companies --
R:  I --
L:  -- and whenever they have a mystery shop in California, they email you.
R:  Um, I found out through this thing called Craig's List.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- [NOISE] and then I just -- I got a lot of different like focus group type things and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and stuff like this from Craig's List. [NOISE]
L:  I've never heard of that.
R:  Yeah, and that's free. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  That's free, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  You should check it out on the internet, but you ha- -- [NOISE] these types of jobs are mak- -- money making things are under et cetera.  You put in the city, or the closest city you live in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then you have to go to where it says, "Et cetera" on the bottom. [NOISE] Because that's where they put like the [NOISE] odd job things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or focus groups or stuff like that. [NOISE]
L:  Let me write down what[?] it is.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Craig's List?
R:  Yeah, Cr- with no apostrophe. [NOISE] C.R.A.I.G.S. [NOISE] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- List dot org.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's dot org.  I'm pretty sure it's dot org. [NOISE] Yeah, Craig's List.  It's pretty good. [NOISE] And then this --
L:  Great. [COUGH]
R:  -- this guy last night told me that he found his on [NOISE] -- it was called Live Journal [NOISE], I'm pretty sure.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's -- it's -- I think it's good to [NOISE] know about these things 'cause [NOISE] it's like a couple of hundred extra dollars a month [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, gosh.  And then, you know, it's not that hard.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So, and the -- you know what, the other thing [NOISE] that I think is pretty bad is gossiping.
L:  That's what I was gonna say.  The, you know, malicious gossiping --
R:  Yeah, and it's so --
L:  -- can really affect --
R:  -- and it's contagious.  It's so easy to get out of control.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, so that's --
L:  I am battling with that right now.
R:  With yourself, or someone else?
L:  Well, with someone else.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I had to take a job at night.  I have two kids and I don't want to put them in daycare.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And really my only options were waitressing or bartending and so I -- I bartended in Elks Lodge --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which is a locked building.  You have to have a m- -- be a member and have a --
R:  A member, yeah.
L:  -- key to get in.  So, I feel pretty safe, but, um [COUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My big thing is that [NOISE] -- excuse me I have to switch phones here.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [NOISE] My cellphone, I mean my cordless, is dying. [LAUGH]
R:  Was dying. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I am not used to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very small -- I live in a small town --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So the mentality is very [LAUGH] small town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you're not the same --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nationality as the person talking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Oh, wow. [NOISE]
L:  They -- the N word just flies all over the place.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And, uh, it's [NOISE] -- I am really --
R:  Here, in California, that would not slide. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's very difficult for me [LAUGH] because I am not from here --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I tend to have a more open mind [LAUGH] and I --
R:  Where -- where are you from, a bigger [NOISE], a bigger city, or ...?
L:  Well, I'm an airforce brat, so I'm from --
R:  Oh, so you're from all over. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  But rec- -- I say I'm from South Carolina.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's where I lived most of my life.
R:  Yeah, but you've --
L:  Most of my adult life.
R:  -- been exposed to different --
L:  A lot, right.
R:  -- environments.
L:  And I just -- I do a lot of energy work and love work and --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  Prayer, and --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I stand there and go, "Please", you know, I'm surprised my tongue isn't half bitten off because I -- I really bite my t- --
R:  Of all the times you had to hold back. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, reall- -- yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that -- oh, my gosh [NOISE], here in California you [NOISE] -- you just can't even do that [NOISE] at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except them[?], you know, but [NOISE] the -- it's -- it's just not acceptable. [NOISE] Even in a small group it -- it's still, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- irritating, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's good.  I mean, that's how it is most of the places that I've been to, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except for this one. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  So, is it -- have you lived in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Pennsylvania a long time now?
L:  Three years.
R:  Three years?  Oh, okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, not that long. [NOISE] I mean, you know, when you consider your whole life time. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, that's not a whole long time.
R:  But I've always lived in California.
L:  Have ya?
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind living in Colorado though. [NOISE] That might be --
L:  I've been out there.  I have family out there --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you do? [NOISE]
L:  -- and it is very nice. 
R:  My best fr- --
L:  I've been to California too. [NOISE]
R:  My best friend just moved to [NOISE] Colorado in March and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's killing me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] where'd she live -- move to?
R:  [NOISE] To some place called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- North Glenn and it's real close to Denver. [NOISE]
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  What part of California did you live in? [NOISE]
L:  I didn't live there.  [NOISE] I just visited.
R:  Oh, I thought you did.  Oh, visited. [NOISE]
L:  No, I've -- [NOISE] San Francisco and Berkley --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then we travelled south [NOISE] on one, um, [NOISE] I had friends that used to live in San Diego. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay [NOISE], way South? [NOISE]
L:  I don't know -- my baby's screaming.  Could you hang on just a second?
R:  Oh, sure, sure.
L:  Thanks. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] I'm so sure, Cody, you think I would've done that to Danielle?
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, that's okay. [NOISE]
L:  It's 'cause I'm on this --
R:  Baby okay?
L:  -- land based phone -- yeah, I don't know if she -- she was in her swing and she must've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- done something she didn't like. [SIGH] 
R:  Fine[?]
L:  She's okay.
R:  Oh. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] How -- how old is your baby?
L:  She's five months and then I have another daughter that is six years old.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my youngest just turned seven last week.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  And it was like [NOISE], "Oh, my gosh, no more babies". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I kind -- kinda miss that, but I -- at least I get to be around kids all day 'cause I run a home school group.  That's why there's so much noise in the background. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, other people that want to have [NOISE] their kids home schooled, but they can't do it themselves, [NOISE] then they bring 'em to me.
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I thought about home schooling my daughter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I thought, "There's no way".  She doesn't listen to a word I say.  
R:  Oh, well then if she --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, then you can't. [NOISE]
L:  So, bringing her to somebody else --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would've been perfect.
R:  Yeah, too bad you don't live in California. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Then I could do it for you. [NOISE]
L:  That's -- that's right.
R:  Yeah, but, um, if you're [NOISE] -- if you're able to homeschool any one else's [NOISE] kids, that's a really good business.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't [NOISE] -- you know what?  Let me tell you how that is.  [NOISE] My husband took a leave of absence from his job for a year without pay [NOISE] and we're just making it --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- just on homeschool and [NOISE] living in California is like really, really expensive [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  So, if you -- I encourage people if they have that ability to work with children and -- and they kno- -- at least anything about home schooling, that you could start your own business doing this.  I mean [NOISE], thousands and thousands and thousands o- of dollars every month.
L:  Wow.
R:  And just stay at home. [NOISE]
L:  I don't think I'd have the patience. [LAUGH]
R:  Really? [LAUGH] [NOISE] A lot of people think that too.  Well, you know [NOISE] yourself best. [NOISE] You know, you --
L:  Yep, I like my kids and that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
