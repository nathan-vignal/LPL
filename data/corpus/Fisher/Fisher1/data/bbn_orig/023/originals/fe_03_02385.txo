R:  Hi, my name is Mary.
L:  Hi, my name is Shelly.
R:  Hi, Shelly.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm all right, how are you?
L:  I'm okay, I don't know if I caught all those traces[?] there, did you --
R:  Yeah, kind of a tough topic.  Um, over eating or drinking, gossiping, smoking, um, I don't remember the rest.
L:  No, I don't either.  I think -- I think 'cause, um, a couple just stood out when I heard 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the first time.
R:  I guess some are more controversial than others.
L:  Right.
R:  Like smoking.
L:  You think smoking?
R:  Yeah, and over drinking.
L:  Yeah, those are the two that I -- that kind of stood out for me.  I think, um, a lot depends on the circumstances of the drinking but I think, the smoking, because it -- it, um, effects other people too.  Oh, not necessarily, I guess -- I guess it depends where you smoke and where you drink. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Um, I live in Minnesota and you barely can smoke anywhere any more.
L:  Yeah, it's the same here, I'm in -- I'm in Rochester in New York.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, actually, just last week they we -- for a while here we had restaurants that were um, had smoking and non smoking sections --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then just, ah, actually maybe two weeks ago now they -- we don't even have non smoking sections in restaurants.  It's a complete --
R:  I thought that was just in the city.  Is that state wide?
L:  Um, I don't know if it's state wide, it's in the city of Rochester, though.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, there's --
R:  I know they did in New York City and I don't know how that's going to go over.
L:  They did do it in New York City?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it's going to make it more difficult for people but I'm sure they'll find ways around it because, actually the restaurants that I've been in since then, um, people are smoking in the bathrooms, which makes me feel like [LAUGH] I'm in high school again.
R:  Well that's how I feel when I drive through a business district --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or by a hospital.  You see these men in twelve hundred suits standing on the sidewalk like juvenile delinquents.
L:  Right.
R:  Or surgeons in their scrubs out on the sidewalk.
L:  Yeah, I'm a teacher and at our school, um, the teachers have to go out on the sidewalk too to smoke, which is, I think it's kind of a bad influence for the kids because they can't even do it, you know, I mean, I'm not a smoker myself and I -- I don't encourage it, but I'd rather have the teachers smoking in some confined area than out there --
R:  right.
L:  -- in view of the students.
R:  Exactly.  And it takes the teachers down to, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but down to the students level.
L:  Right.
R:   -- to um, you know, I'm no better than you, I have this terrible addiction just like you.  I don't know, it's just, ah, I think that people have taken it too far, I think.  A lot of people, like, even if you're outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- smoking, some people will wave their arms and exhale and make a big scene out of it and those are the same people that will sit for four hours in four lanes of bumper to bumper traffic inhaling exhaust.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that doesn't bother 'em.
L:  I think people don't think of that as um, I -- I -- I don't think they're as aware of that maybe as smoking, it's -- it's -- I guess as a non smoker, I think th- I'm just more um, sensitive to the -- the cigarette smoke because I think the, you know, carbon monoxide fumes are -- are not something you can smell anyways, but if I sat there thinking about it I'd probably want to hold my breath. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- in the traffic.
R:  Yeah.  I am a smoker.
L:  You are?
R:  Yeah, and um --
L:  Have you smoked for a long time?
R:  Yeah.  Since I got out of high school, um, phew.
L:  And do you have -- have you had any kind of health related problems with -- that you --
R:  No.
L:  -- would connect with the smoking?
R:  No.
L:  I'm not sure what it is, there's, um, this is just -- I would -- for some reason I -- I had a feeling when you -- when I heard your voice that you were a smoker, though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess -- I guess it's something that I notice, I pick up in -- in people's voices, um, because I'm -- I'm the only one of my siblings who doesn't smoke, but I hear something in their -- their voices that, I don't know, maybe it's something I'm just a little sensitive to.
R:  Now, that's very interesting that you picked up on it because I think that's really true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're um, there are, again, those stereotypes about women who talk like this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I need another smoke, but I think it probably does kind of, lower your voice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there is a certain, I can't deny there's a certain amount of congestion --
L:  Yeah, because I can hear um, like, when my sister especially, she's my younger sister, but when I hear her talk on the phone I can hear, um, like, in between, when she's speaking I can hear her take little breaths that I don't hear other people take.
R:  Yeah.
L:  On the phone, so wo- would you say y- you think you're probably physically in as good a shape as people that -- of your own age?  
R:  Um --
L:  -- you think your endurance is as good?
R:  Probably not.  No.  But I'm not terribly active, either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, um, oh I know that -- I used to be a synchronized swimmer --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- when I didn't smoke and then I could hold my breath under water for, jeeze, long, long time.  I can't do that any more.  But again, I haven't -- that's been years, it's -- it's you know, there's a practice element in there, too.
L:  Right.
R:  To keep on doing something you've got to be able to maintain it and if -- if I, you know, I stopped now, I don't know if smoking has all that much to do with it or just a lack of practice.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to say.  Have you ever tried quitting?
R:  Not seriously.  I never have.  I um, I probab- I -- I really would like to not be a smoker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I enjoy it too much to give it up right now.  And nobody can make -- make you do it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  And um, my doctor's always offering me patches and I was, well, if I t- put a patch on then I can't smoke at all, right?  Right.  And I'm like, well, I'd better not.
L:  Yeah, my brother -- my sister's never tried quitting and I have two brothers, um, only one of them's ever tried quitting.  Actually in the past he's -- he's quit twice and gone as long as, I think eight months, he said, without smoking but he's gone back to it, and then um, on Easter he -- he quit again -- I guess he'd been planning that -- he just picked a date and then, so, I guess like, three weeks before Easter he said that Easter was going to be the day he quit, so he -- he's gone on a week and a half now, he's doing okay again.
R:  Good for him.
L:  But for him the um, I mean, he had the incentive of, you know, he didn't -- he didn't wonder whether there was any health problems down the road, but he said just, um, when he looked at the money that he was spending on his cigarettes, too, it was just getting ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, it's getting -- it's getting to be worse and worse.  Here in Minnesota, there's a bill now -- we have this huge state deficit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the governor has proposed, and it's probably going to pass, a dollar a tax per pack.
L:  Just the tax is a dollar?
R:  Just the tax.
L:  Wow.  And how much does a pack sell for there?
R:  Um, I don't smoke, like your regular, named brand, Winston, Marlboro, but I think they're like, four fifty -- well -- I -- I think you could probably get them for three fifty if you were careful.
L:  And it'll be a dollar more on top of that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  My sister and her husband, we um, there's an Indian reservation about an hour from here and they go to that that Indian reservation to buy their cigarettes, but I think she s-- I think they're still paying, um, now, what did she say?  She told me, like eighteen dollars for a carton.
R:  Oh, that's cheap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cartons here are over thirty dollars.
L:  Wow.
R:  I smoke really, the cheapest cigarettes I can find and I, you know, because they're always coming out with new ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I go into the store I just say what's your cheapest carton of cigarettes --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I -- I pay about fifteen dollars.
L:  Hm.
R:  -- [inaudible] ends up being sixteen fifty with tax and now I imagine that'll go way up, too.  But I don't even know if that's a good deterrent, um --
L:  I was going to ask you that.
R:  People keep coming up with the money, and, you know, I heard about this tax and it didn't -- it made me angry but not because I personally thought I was going to have to quit, but because [SIGH] cigarette pack, I mean, they say it's going to be a deterrent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they're just really unfairly taxing the smokers to make money.  Because they're trying to close this deficit and how can you on one hand say what we're doing is so bad and wrong and on the other hand enjoy the taxes that you place upon us.  I just think that's hypocritical.
L:  Yeah, a friend of mine was saying the same thing not that long ago, and um,
