L:  I'm Mary Gardner from Evansdale, Iowa.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, this is Craig Wareham.  I'm from Dorchester, Wisconsin.
L:  And I'm Mary Gardner from Evansdale, Iowa.
R:  Hello [LAUGH].
L:  Hello.
R:  I guess our conversation is about how to keep well.  That's what the recording said anyway.
L:  Um, yes.
R:  Well, I myself don't usually have no problem about getting sick at all.
L:  I'm usually pretty lucky but I take vitamins and --
R:  Yeah, I take a vitamin a day.  That's about the extent.
L:  That must be pretty good [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I had lot of my g- girls are sick, I have three daughters and grandchildren and they're sick around me, and so far I'm [NOISE] doing pretty good, huh.
R:  I do know that compared I don't get sick but when I do I get sick pretty good, but I haven't this year at all yet.
L:  Do you -- they said when you have a cold how long do you wait before you go to the doctor?
R:  Actually I -- I don't usually.  I just buy over the counter stuff and treat it that way.
L:  I do too and then after a week if it doesn't go away then usually then I'll call.
R:  I don't.  Whenever, you know, I know that usually most people, most of the people I work with do the same thing but and I usually have to be on -- almost on death's door before I go to the doctor which I know isn't right but ...
L:  It seems like most guys are that way, more that way.
R:  Then I've got sick days at work that I usually don't use them up at all.  I just, on a personal basis, I just use them that way.  I use them whenever I want.
L:  That would be nice [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If you didn't have to use them for sickness.
R:  Well, I keep a couple in reserve till, uh, till, um, till the end of the year and then if -- then, um, well they carry over but it's -- it's enough that that way at least I got a couple just in case.
L:  Yes, because a person never knows.  I'm pretty lucky there, too, don't catch a lot of colds and flu.
R:  Do you know the recording said what about seven days what -- what were they saying?  That -- they said there's --we -- we are not, uh, not -- they're saying, uh, what seven days?
L:  Whether -- how soon you go to the doctor when you catch --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a cold?  After seven days then I go, about a week.
R:  Usually, every time I do try to go to the doctor and I'm feeling better than I -- also when I'm feeling better just when I got ready to go [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's probably psychological I know but --
L:  Maybe not, you know.  Maybe you wait so long that it really does start going away.  I get bronchitis though if I wait too long.  Have you ever had that?
R:  I think once a couple of years ago but then I never went to the doctor for that either 'cause I -- because I had to take off to go in for surgery 'bout -- about two weeks after --just before I had that.  I mean just two weeks after I got past I had bronchitis I used to like didn't go to the doctor with that since I had to take off work to, uh, go to the doctor for that.
L:  For what?
R:  For I had to go in for surgery.
L:  Oh.
R:  For an hernia operation that I had that about I think it was three years ago, but I know --
L:  Yeah, you'd have to go for that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] -- so with the bronchitis like which I might have had I just, like I said,  took over the counter stuff.
L:  Usually with me it'll take an antibiotic to get over bronchitis.  But do you smoke?
R:  Yeah, I s- smoke too, so --
L:  Yeah, I do, too, so -- thought maybe you didn't.  Maybe why you didn't have to go [LAUGH].
R:  So, I didn't know if it was the cigarettes or if it was the -- or if it was, um, a cold that -- that's kind of in the past so ...
L:  Are you healthy -- pretty healthy person then otherwise, huh?
R:  Usually, uh, I haven't -- the last -- that was the last time I looked at a doctor in fact was for that operation about three years ago.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  And I know I don't the -- the flu shot every fall either like I probably should because say I work in retail but --
L:  You work in retail?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, then, you probably be round about sick people.
R:  A lot of times, yeah.
L:  Well, I hope that doesn't cris- -- disqualify us.  I just acid- disconnected my call waiting.
R:  You -- you did -- did what?
L:  Do you have call waiting?
R:  Oh, no, I -- I'm just on a -- I'm on a -- a not a cellphone but, uh, remote phone --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- antenna phone whatever you want to call it.
L:  I disconnected my s- cell -- call -- my call waiting and they said they'll disqualify you if it beeps like that and mine just beeped.
R:  Oh, sorry I don't know what's -- they said when eight minutes is up they're supposed to pop in on us, so ten minutes whatever.
L:  They will but I'm afraid that just ruined it for us.  I hope not, because I disabled it before, you know, my time came up at ten o'clock, so I shouldn't have even got that call [MN].
R:  Well, I didn't hear any beep so I guess --
L:  It must --
R:  Wait a couple more -- like couple a minutes wait and see.
L:  Yes, I don't want it to disqualify us.  I think this is really neat.  I just heard about it, that you could do these surveys.
R:  I, um, I got -- I heard about it through the -- actually through a freebee board on the Internet.
L:  Oh, I heard it from the Internet, too.
R:  It's from, um, the one I was -- yes, it's free dot com is where I saw it.
L:  From where?
R:  It's got just called -- it's called, "Yes, it's free".
L:  Oh.
R:  YIL.
L:  And I heard about it, um, free for mom.
R:  So, I just called the number up because -- I take it from work I called them for any answer and I said, "Yeah, I have a answering machine", and I noticed there were a couple of calls on it.  If you would have said, "Hello", I don't know about why it would have done that, but -- think maybe I'm getting -- we're getting off the subject here.  I hope that doesn't ruin anything but -- but, um, uh, but sometimes you get pretty strange messages on answering machines anyway.
L:  Oh, I sure hope that that doesn't disqualify us, that they won't take it.  We'll find out.
R:  But eight minutes is a long time to talk about what the subject they gave too.
L:  Pardon?
R:  The eight minutes is quite a while to talk about that -- the subject about going to the doctor and all.
L:  It does seem like a long time but I had one last night too, and it was about food and it seemed like we ran out of things to talk about.
R:  [NOISE] I guess --
L:  But this is a cold and flu season so it's probably why they would like us to discuss it.
R:  Well, mine is more like, um, allergies right now I think than cold and flu but --
L:  I've been having those, too.  My three daughters had strep throat, too.
R:  [NOISE] And you didn't get it?  That's like --
L:  No.
R:  -- that's pretty, um, pretty catching I know.
L:  Very contagious.  So far I've been lucky, and I've been around all three of them.
R:  Uh, usually when I get a cold it's just in my -- like a sinus cold or in my gums where it's you don't know whether you've got a toothache or if you -- if you've got a cold.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And luckily so far it's just been a cold.
L:  You haven't had a cold this year?
R:  No, not as far as I n- just a sinus type cold in my -- in my gums.
L:  I started having a cold and I take zinc when I think I'm going to get a cold.  Right away I take zinc and it seems to help.
R:  Recently, I got some product to test.  Sure that was through another type, survey type thing, probably to test for, um, for colds.  It's like a pre-cold thing that you -- like it's very helpful -- so that they're not -- and I think that helped, too [NOISE].
L:  What was it?
R:  It's like a -- like a s- a -- you don't have to talk too much about your survey stuff but, um, that was um, uh, like a pre- -- you -- you spray it.  Like you're supposed to be like you take it if -- if you think you're coming down with a cold and you -- then you, um, use the nasal spray.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And then even after the cold you're only supposed to still doing it for like a preventive thing.
L:  Oh, I've never heard of it.
R:  It was some kind of thing I did for a survey test [NOISE].
L:  Well, that is neat.  I'd like to try out something like that.
R:  What --
L:  I enjoy doing surveys too
R:  Yeah, I do quite a few of those on line.
L:  That's where I do mine, too.
R:  Do, uh --
L:  This is the first one that I've had that was a phone one.
R:  Yeah, this is one this is kind of different but then I've seen this through Penn State, so I figured it was legit.  Yeah.
L:  It's easier than writing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's does you U Penn.  You p- up -- you -- U Penn, University of Pennsylvania because I printed out the information off the -- when they sent me a email.
L:  Mm.  I did mine over the Internet.  I applied and everything and then they wrote back and said that I had been accepted.
R:  Yeah, that's what I did, then I just printed off the stuff when I got the email.  It says up to three calls on here so it says, so --
L:  I was wondering about that.  Do we really only get three calls?  Is that three in a month?
