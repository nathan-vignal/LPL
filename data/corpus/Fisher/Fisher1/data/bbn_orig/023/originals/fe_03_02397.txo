L:  Hi, it's Jennifer.
R:  Hi, my name's Jennifer too.
L:  Oh, my goodness! [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What state are you in?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  I'm in Maryland. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  There's one -- at least we're not -- we know we're not the same person.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, which do you think is worse?  I -- I guess I think the cigarette smoking is, um, because it's written on the packet so it's harmful to you.
R:  Oh, actually, um, you know I -- I might agree with that.  I -- I really, the one that really jumped out at me was over eating, only because I've had so many personal experiences with people in my family who have be- become obese an- from over eating, not just from medical um, medical issues and they've actually had so many awful medical conditions come up just because of that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ah, but some of them were smokers, too --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- so, I mean that's why I can see why they're both -- th- they're so related, it's health wise.
L:  In a way, all of the issues are harmful to you physically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in a w- in the other way, they can all be controlled and not happen to you.  So --
R:  Hm, yeah.
L:  Because y- you can control each one of those situations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You really can.  Um --
R:  Yeah that's true, yeah, each one of those are -- they're all addictions, that's why.
L:  Yes.  That's what they are.
R:  All of them.  And the only time you can't control it is if it's a medical problem, like Prater Willy's syndrome, which is um, one of the ah, people who have that syndrome and that over eat, it's physiologically there.
L:  Well, see, but psychologically it's there and that c- can be controlled.
R:  No, no Prater Willy can't.  Th- children are usually the -- the, ah, recipients.  Th- Prater Willy is ex.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And psychologically you can't manipulate them, even if they're on um, medication.
L:  You think so?
R:  No, I know so, because I have a medical background [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, no, it's true.  Prater Willy's syndrome um, you may even have seen it on Oprah.  There was a child there, that was three years old and she was three hundred pounds --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or close to it, but she never felt the need -- ah, she never felt satiated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when she ate, and in fact she -- she thought she was hungry all the time, to the point where she could rip off locks off the refrigerator and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's the um, that's psychological -- psychological where you can control it with means of ah, control, modification --
L:  -ion, right.
R:  -- or -- or therapy that way.  That's different from this.  This is an actual medical issue, just like diabetes.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, that scenario, over eating, it's awful.  It's awful but th- the child can't control it.  Normally they -- they have other problems that go along with it too, but that is -- that -- I've seen that as a common problem in some children who have that syndrome, and it's awful.
L:  -- but can I ask a question on that?
R:  What was that?
L:  W- W- What percentage of the population suffers with that?
R:  With Prater Willy?
L:  Yes.
R:  It's a genetic deletion disorder.  Um, it -- it's a -- it's l- it's -- people are becoming more aware of it.  It's very small.  It's considered a chromosomal disorder --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but it's the same thing as having [COUGH] it's the same, I think it's the same percentage as having Angelman syndrome which is also on the same chromosome, chromosome number fifteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, remember that we all have chromosomes, but there are sections of our chromosomes that can be deleted.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And they don't necessarily manifest the same time, y- you know, well they normally do.  If it's the same section they will manifest in that disorder --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and just happens to be that chromosome number fifteen has several different disorders that are related to it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and one is Angelman, where they have a small face --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kind of flap their hands, have a mobius mouth, [COUGH] mobius face rebate.  You don't see any expression and -- but on the same chromosome, if you have a different deletion you have Prater Willy and those children -- they're both very drastic things children can ever go through --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they have shorter life spans --
L:  R- yeah, I would expect they would.
R:  -- than other children.  Yeah, but in that case they can't control over eating ever, even with medication.  They just don't know.  It's, you know, it's just a really horrible, horrible disorder to ever go through.  And --
L:  Right.  But I think in aspects of what they're asking us through this survey --
R:  They're thinking about over eating as in you have that choice to over eat.
L:  R- right.  Th- the choices that we make.
R:  Yeah, I think on one point it'd be -- you know what, everything, every one of those choices, you can control it --
L:  Right.
L:  -- and I think, as you let it go further and further down the road it gets harder and harder to do that --
L:  -- and harder.  Right, right.
R:  -- and yeah, you know, it- it's so psychological.
L:  Yes.  Um, mind over matter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All of it is.  It really is.
R:  Yeah.  But I really -- I have something against over eating.  I think it's a very bad thing, physically to -- and you see such drastic effects that don't get changed as -- as easily as smoking.  Whereas if you smoke and you quit, for every year that you stop smoking, you actually -- your system will not revert one or two percent, but it will revert in extent --
L:  -- to an extent, right.
R:  whereas with over- yeah, but with over eating though, once you do damage to your liver, that's that.  And if you constantly put the stresses on your kidneys and your liver from over eating certain foods and by getting the secondary conditions like diabetes, or other li- maybe liver dysfunctions from doing certain other things that, and then like, drinking alcohol, for instance to excess you can always leech a cirrhosis of the liver --
L:  Right?
R:  -- you can't turn that back --
L:  Right.
R:  But then there's also lung cancer which you can't turn back either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's from smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, gosh you know, when I think of all those things, I just think, wow, they're all kind -- they're all really bad.  In excess.
L:  Right.  That's -- that's -- that's -- that's wh- that's what they're looking at, I think.  How do we value um, the usage of these products and what they do to you.  Um, because, for me, I'm a hundred and sixty pounds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel I'm overweight, and whenever I say, "Boy, I gotta lose ten pounds", somebody's looking at me like, "We wish we can be your size.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Why do you feel you're over weight?"  I -- I don't look at -- and I don't look at it as a health conscious issue, just the issue of, you know, I can stand to lose a l- little bit of weight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  N- not trying -- I'm -- I'm a diabetic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a bad back, um, I have high blood pressure.  Typical, normal, um, diseases that blacks in their forties start developing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, but I choose, you know, I -- I didn't choose to get the diabetes or the high blood pressure.  It's more hereditary, as we were talking about, but I choose not to smoke and to drink to worsen my condition, so tho- those diseases --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's where a lot of people fall in -- fall through the cracks.  Um, but we can't say we're not an educated nation because we understand what ah, problems are associated with these habits --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I call them habits.  I don't call them addictions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because um, an addiction is something you choose to do, so that's why it's a habit.  You choose to smoke.  You choose to drink.  You know, you should know your limits.  You should know if you can't drink.  I -- I had a brother die of alcohol- of alcoholism.  A sister of a cocaine overdose, so guess what, i- it was in my family and I c- I was exposed to it but I chose not to let it play a factor in my life.  And I think that's what they're looking at.  What causes the most harm in society, which one do you feel is -- is the evil --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- o- of -- of the others.
R:  [COUGH] right.
L:  Um, and I -- I just see drug abuse and alcoholism -- I was -- I'm a social worker so I'm a counselor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I -- I see those both w- side by side --
R:  Right.
L:  They're together.  Because they're both addictions and true, you are never cured of it but you can be the better for it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I feel.  You can overcome it.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  Y- you make your choices in life.
R:  You do.
L:  I mean, l- look at us now, you know, in the sixties we made the choice to um, well it l- l- let's go back even further.  Um, we, as Americans, came o- ah, Americans came over -- British came over, rather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and took the land from the Indians.
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and made them slaves, bought whites over, made them slaves, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- blacks over, made them slaves, but even bought whites over and made them slaves.  But we've grown from that.  We've learned, we've prospered, we've gotten better.  So why can't we get better in these areas as well?  Why would you spend five dollars on a pack of cigarettes and burn it up?  That's just like taking a five dollar bill and burning it up, if you ask me.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  People with eating disorders, like you said, that's more psychological, um, drug addiction is -- is, becomes psychological but I think you've got to go a long way before it becomes
