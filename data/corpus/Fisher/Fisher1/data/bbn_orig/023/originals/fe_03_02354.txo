L:  Emily.
R:  Marla.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, ha- have you done this before?
R:  No, this is my first time.
L:  This is my first time too. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I -- so I guess, do we just each take our turns in telling which one is the worst, or ...?
R:  That's fine.
L:  Okay, um, do you want me to go first?
R:  Well, I already know what I wanna say, so that's up to you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, go ahead.  Then you talk.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, well, out of the list they gave us, I personally think gossiping is the worst, um, because --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to me you hurt other people's feelings, um, and you're involving other people in that and most of the other things that I can remember that were listed, to me, are more of a personal thing as far as your health or, um -- other than smoking, which I know second hand you can get hurt from that, but to me it's more of a personal based type of reason why you would be hurting yourself.  Um, also I'm a christian so I know gossiping is considered wrong in the bible for reasons of, you know, you just -- you don't talk about other people, you don't be judgemental, that type of thing.  It's not our place in life to do that, um, I'm really not sure what else to say. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [COUGH] well, I guess based on my personal experiences, um, I'm a registered nurse, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- obviously all these are [LAUGH] bad for your health and I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't think that they're -- I've seen the -- the effects of every one of these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, in the hospital and gossiping, like you said, also, um, it isn't right to do, although a lot of people do do it and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it can hurt feelings and it can also put a lot of stress on you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, emotionally.  So, basically I c- -- I -- I can't pick just one that is worse that the other.  I think they're all pretty equally, um, bad for you and bad for you health actually, so --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, I don't know what else to say about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And that's what I'm thinking.
L:  [LAUGH] For ten minutes, this is really hard. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] On personal habits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, do you smoke?
R:  Uh, no I don't.  My husband --
L:  No.
R:  -- does, but I don't.
L:  Oh, does he?
R:  A- and actually I do have, um, um, some health issues based on his smoking now.
L:  Okay, second hand.
R:  I have, um, a problem with my breathing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- based on the fact that -- they've told me because of his smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I do know, as I said, that that is something that you can get second hand.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I mean, from a personal standpoint I guess I could say even that -- that's really -- I mean, I do know it's bad because like I said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's affected my life now.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um ...
L:  Um, drinking alcohol, as far as occasionally, I -- I don't see any, but at long term affects I can see a lot and especially, you know, working around people in the hospital that come in, um, that have a lot of problems, and then, so --
R:  Right.  And I agree with you.  I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- occasional sm-, uh, drinking is not, you know, if you're not going to the extreme with it and you're not putting yourself or someone else in danger I don't --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- there's anything wrong with having a drink on occasion either.
L:  Mhm.  Caffeine, that's a biggie. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I drink a lot --
L:  I think --
R:  -- of that, so --
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- pass.
L:  I try not to.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I know.
L:  I don't drink coffee or tea, but -- but, you know, I try, uh, as far as soda -- I just don't like coffee or tea, that's the only --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reason why I don't drink it, but, uh, as far as soda I try to get the caffeine free --
R:  Right.
L:  And again, for me, it just makes my heart rate -- which is weird 'cause some people like, "It makes me more calm", but for me it makes me more jittery --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if I drink it, so ... And over time that also has a bad affect on your body, but I don't have any personal -- like, that doesn't bother me.  If somebody else drinks lots of -- I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on a personal basis.
R:  Well, the only thing that I've noticed with that is that my husband; it seems like when he's smoking he drinks coffee quite often and I've -- I've been told that that kind of goes hand in hand, or it can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause my mother in law also used to smoke for years, like thirty years and she quit about five years ago and she smoked -- or drank a lot of coffee at the same time and she still drinks coffee but not as often.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I do notice my husband when he's drinking coffee he tends to smoke more, it seems like.  So, I don't know if there's something with the nicotine and the caffeine that might kind of go hand in hand.
L:  Yeah, that could be.
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have noticed that, so ...
L:  What about like on a per- -- like as far as what bothers you the most, like out of -- out of all these?  If somebody else is do- well, like not doing it, or doing it.  What bothers you, like which one would you say?
R:  Um, I mean -- you mean caffeine and all that?
L:  Like, yeah, I mean, like what really --
R:  I'd probably say smoking honestly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be the next one just because I know that there is a lot of second hand smoking that does, you know, bother other people.  And like I said for per- point for my own self --
L:  Right.
R:  I know that, um, I've been trying for years to get my husband to quit smoking and we've had three children and when I was pregnant with our first children I s- -- first child, I said, "You know, you really need to quit", and he kept saying he would but then he hasn't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and he has a stressful job so I know that he uses that -- I don't know, I wouldn't say as an excuse maybe, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It seems to be his reason for why he's not, um, [NOISE] you know, smoking -- or not quitting right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I do know that that, you know -- that to me is probably the one -- the w- -- the worst thing, you know, for health reasons --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be smoking, definitely.
L:  That -- that would be my -- I mean, that would probably be the -- out of all these --
R:  Right.
L:  That's the one that bothers me the most too and then gossiping would be second.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause the rest of 'em if somebody drinks a lot or drinks -- I mean, that doesn't bother me.  I mean, that's your own, you know --
R:  Unless they're driving.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Drinking and driving then --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- that bothers me 'cause you're putting other people's lives --
L:  At risk.
R:  -- in danger.  Yeah.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, that would be like my third too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's what I feel like.  'Cause all those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really do affect you.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, -- but if somebody uses a lot of caffeine or overeats or exercises; that can't affect other people, so --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Affects --
L:  I feel the same way.
R:  -- their own life.  I mean, and it would affect me if it was like my mother or somebody that was close to me --
L:  A personal --
R:  -- if they overate.  Yeah.  Or something and it was putting their health at risk and -- and to the point where, you know, I thought it was gonna be harmful to them and I was close to them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But just overall, for other people in general, yeah, I agree with you.
L:  Okay.  Um, I wonder if -- do they just -- does it beep, or cut you off once --
R:  They -- they said there was supposed to be some kind of recording or something that come on and tell us when ten minutes is up, so. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Oh, geez. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I was think- -- thinking, "Okay". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you from?
R:  Um, Oxford, Ohio.
L:  Okay, I'm in Indiana.  Indianapolis.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, that's not too far. [LAUGH]
R:  How did you hear about this?
L:  A friend of mine.  She --
R:  That -- my sister in law.
L:  -- she's been doing it.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my sister in law she's -- we were --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- talking on the internet 'cause she lives in Florida and she was telling me about it and so I emailed last night and got the whole information in and today [LAUGH] -- I was surprised.  I thought, "Wow".
L:  I know.  At two o'clock promptly --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the phone rings. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That's the same here.  I registered last night too, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kinda funny that at -- right at two o'clock I just couldn't believe it.  I was like, "Oh, my gosh, they're already calling". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't know what else to talk about.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, I don't either.  I -- can you remember anything else that was on the list, other than what was it; caffeine, smoking, go- gossiping, and what was the other one?
L:  Uh, overeating and not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- exercising.
R:  Not exercising, yeah.
L:  Overeating only bothers me -- well, I can say this, I had a meeting the other day at work [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there were two ladies there and we had [COUGH] a whole box of doughnuts.  It was like probably two dozen.  There was eight people there total and there was two dozen dough- doughnuts and only three of the women -- only three of the women ate and, um, the doughnuts and I tell you where there was only like three doughnuts left out of twenty four when we left.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  It was a five hour meeting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that kinda bothered me just because I was like -- they just kept eating and eating and eating.  I was [LAUGH] just like really pissed off. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There was twenty four doughnuts in there and there was only three people eating them and they were almost gone. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's like almost eight doughnuts a person.
L:  It almost made me sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I was just sitting there like, "Oh, my gosh", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it -- are they gonna stop? [LAUGH]
R:  Gee.
L:  But none of us other people -- you know, we never -- it wasn't like they offered which -- I didn't want any anyway, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  It's just the principle of the thing too --
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, it's kinda like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Geez, you're kind[?] of making a pig of yourself, so to speak" [LAUGH] 
L:  It kinda made me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It really did, it made me sick.  'Cause when --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you think about how many doughnuts were there, I was just like, "Oh, man".  I -- I mean, I know physically I'd be sick if I eat that many. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So, that kinda made me -- so, I guess I ha- -- on a personal basis I dealt with that yesterday. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the other -- other only thing that they have on here was exercising.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  I don't exercise as much as I should, but now that it's getting warmer out I have been doing more of that.  In fact I've been trying to lose weight 'cause I've gained more weight the past year than I've ever had in my life and I've lost probably between five and ten pounds now from when I started --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- which is a good thing for me.  Um, I'm trying to get back down to about a hundred and twenty, a hundred and fifteen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I've got about, um, got about fifteen pounds to lose still. [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.
R:  I'm on my way. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I tend to exercise probably more in the summer.  I like to walk a lot.
L:  I do too.
R:  I like to just -- I mean, walk around town, um, you know, go for a jog sometimes once in a while.  Um, my daughters and I walk around a lot.  In fact it's so pretty out today we might end up doing that.  So, um, I think sometimes in the winter --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- people tend to put on the weight and -- and exercise less because it's cold and -- and all that, but in the winter -- I mean, the summer, I think you tend to be more active because you just wanna be out in the sun and enjoying all the flowers and, you know, everything out there.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  I'm -- I do the same thing.  We have a -- we belong to a gym but we only use it during the winter months and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] not as much as what we do when -- in -- the summer comes.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the summer is just so nice and you wanna enjoy your day and not feel guilty sitting in, so --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, I do exercise a lot more in -- in the -- probably two to three times a week.  I usually get up with my neighbour every -- every other day we walk and then the a- -- the days in between we'll ride bikes in the morning and she works at seven in the morning, so we get up at five. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my god.
