R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi [LAUGH] I'm Jean.
L:  Hi Jean, I'm Charles.
R:  All right.  This is truly weird.  Huh?
L:  Ah, are we supposed to start?
R:  I -- I don't know.  They said -- they haven't asked us a question yet, have they?
L:  Well, I think -- the question was about what do we think is worse, gossiping or, um --
R:  Oh, well, obviously, I -- I feel it's smoking because it's detrimental to your physical health and so many people have died from it, so I don't know that many people have died from the other things.  What do you think?
L:  That's a -- that's a good point.  Um, yeah, I might -- I might agree with that, only because smoking not only affects yourself but it also affects the people around you.
R:  That's what they say. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I would believe it.  I mean, I don't want to go to places where people are smoking.
R:  You don't?
L:  No, I -- I -- I --
R:  Ouch, ouch!  Pardon me, I just stepped down on a piece of glass on the floor, um, oh God, it's bleeding!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry --
L:  That's okay.
R:  I'm walking -- I'm in my -- I'm packing, you know, and I'm in -- I'm in the, ah, the bedroom, without any shoes on, so I just stepped on a piece of glass.  Um, I didn't mean to be rude.  Well, smoking, and you don't go to places that, ah, have smokers.
L:  No.
R:  Well, what do you think of the, ah, idea of, ah, New York coming down on, ah, bars and restaurants, saying no smoking allowed? --
L:  I think it --
R:  -- I mean, that's a tourist place.
L:  Maybe it's a tourist place, but I think it's a great idea.  I think that you don't need smoking in the buildings to have a good time and setting designated smoking areas is appropriate, as long as they're outside and not in the middle of the traffic flow.
R:  Well, when -- when they have designated, ah, smoking places, um, they're off to the side, um, and they're smaller than the main area, that's been my experience anyway.  But as I understand it, New York, ah, Mayor has decided that no smoking is allowed and when visitors come to the city from other cities and other countries, and they smoke, and ah, when you go to a restaurant or a bar, you generally smoke, I mean, this is only very, very recently, I think, that um, people are so aware, they've known all along that smoking is harmful to the health, but now, you know, you're almost crucified [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- by people.  They come up to you and attack you, practically, on the street, you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, I mean, it -- it, that, you know, that kind of attitude to me, is infringing on a person's rights, you know, because they're not dumb, they can read a label.  They know that, ah, that the tobacco company lied, ah --
L:  Or mislead.
R:  -- seven people in front of a congress, [LAUGH] you know, they're telling them --
L:  They mislead, they didn't lie.
R:  They did what?  They mislead?
L:  They mislead, they didn't lie --
R:  They lied!  They said nicotine wasn't h- wasn't harmful.  That's what they said.  They said nicotine was not harmful. [SIGH]
L:  Well, yeah, that would be false. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Seven of them.  So, you know, but -- but -- but, I think -- I think it is a -- ah, I think it infringes on a person's rights, ah --
L:  But what about my rights to be smoke free?
R:  You don't have to be in place where a person is smoking.
L:  But in a bar, then all of a sudden if it is -- if it's not a smoke free environment, then I'm subjected to all the people around me who are smoking, and I --
R:  Right, and most people do smoke in bars -- that -- you know, that's my point about -- about New York because, ah, I -- I mean, it's amazing to me that ah, that it went through because it's, you know, a tourist place, th- they don't have the same restrictions, the people that come into New York from abroad, or, you know, other, ah, states.  Th- they don't have th- no smoking restriction.  They wanna have a meal, afterwards, if they're smokers and light up, or have a drink, ah, smoke with some beer or whatever --
R:  Yeah. Well I --
L:  -- and I think that they have a -- they have the right to do that and I don't object to designated areas, but to say, no smoking at all?
L:  But do you think those designated areas are effective?  Because even if it is a designated area, the whole bar smells like smoke.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I don't think it's effective enough just to say one room is a smoking room, 'cause that smoke is just going to get all over the place.
R:  Ah huh.  Well --
L:  And it's also not fair to the bar tender and to the wait staff who have to be um, in the presence of all the smoke, tw- you know, eight hours a day.  And they're -- they're kind of stuck, you know, they wanna serve and they wanna help everyone but they're going to end up getting all that smoke second hand that they wouldn't get otherwise.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  And California is currently a smoke free for clubs and restaurants and they've been that way for several years now, and every time I -- I go there, I love it, I mean, it's just nice not to smell like smoke at the end of the night.
R:  Y- y- y- you were not a smoker when you were smelling like smoke?
L:  No, ah, when I go to clubs in Dallas and oh, Arizona, y- you leave and you're -- you smell like smoke, and you never smoked.  I mean, it's just -- it's just -- the smoke is so strong and especially in a club environment that it just gets into your clothes and your hair and you can't avoid it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then California with -- with their laws, no smoking in doors, you go in, you come out and you smell exactly the same, and that's nice. [PAUSE] And I would prefer that, so, as far as people smoking, they can smoke all they want as long as they don't infringe on my right to have a -- to have fresh clean air.
R:  And where do you find fresh clean air?
L:  Well, besides California?  I don't know --
R:  Oh, don't be funny. [LAUGH] Don't be funny.  I lived out there [LAUGH] that's not exactly fresh clean air.  You get up and get ready to go to the beach and by the time you got there, in half an hour it'd be fogged in [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'm not --
R:  -- it's not exactly clean air.
L:  I'm not counting the smog, that's a different issue.  We're talking about smoking.
R:  I know, but you were talking about fresh clean air.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Then you were saying, you know, California has fresh clean air.  I don't know how they can lay claim to that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I mean, when you look out and look over the city, you know, there's all this fog and things and industry, what little they have.
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  I don't think California is a -- maybe another -- another place in the States, but I wouldn't call California that, ah, that free of ah, smoke or --
L:  Yeah, I guess, I- I'll concede.  That's -- that's -- that's true.  So, what do you think about gossip in the workplace?  I think that was one of the other topics.
R:  Are we supposed to talk about more than one subject?
L:  Well, I -- I don't know what else to say about smoking.
R:  Oh, y- yeah, I'm kind of pooped out about smoking, too.  Um, gossip in the work place.  Well, um, I have not worked for a number of years, and ah, at the time that I was working, the issues that are today's issues were not, ah, considered at all, and I'm talking about um, sexual harassment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, the um [PAUSE] [SIGH] Gossip -- I like to gossip.
L:  It's fun.
R:  I don't know why.  I mean, I -- I if I don't like someone and I feel that I have a valid case against them, you know, if I'm going to be judgmental, then, you know, I enjoy, you know, gossiping.  I do.  I don't have many friends, I've a small circle of friends but I -- it's one of those things that I like, you know, I enjoy reading and gossip.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so, I mean, I certainly don't think ah, the workplace -- I -- I -- I think, you know, you create a bad situation in the workplace though, because, you know, it -- it could be -- it could be detrimental to your
