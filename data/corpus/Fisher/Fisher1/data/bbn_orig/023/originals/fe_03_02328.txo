R:  Hi, I'm Christina.
L:  Uh, hi, I'm Ryan.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  Ha- have you done this before?
R:  Yeah, this is actually only my second time, --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- so I'm not so good on it yet but -- [LAUGH]
L:  This will be the first time so I'll be --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- less than good at it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, um, pretty much I guess we just have to answer the question, um, so the question was, "Do you get sick between seasons [MN] [LAUGH]?"  Well, I actually live in LA so I'm going to have to say, "No", because --
L:  Oh, probably not.
R:  -- we have no real seasons.
L:  Absolutely.  I, uh, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I used to live in, uh, in Sacramento and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where the weather was kind of similar there too.  The [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- difference between seasons was -- there was nothing.  There was nothing at all.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm, uh, I'm in Missouri now and we definitely have a difference in seasons.  We can --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- go from, you know, a wind chill of sixty below in the winter to a hundred and ten degrees --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and high humidity in the summer, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I think the, uh, there are quite a few people, you know, who -- a -- a -- bugs definitely go around when the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- weather changes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think I'm susceptible to it a little bit but, um, it doesn't seem to wel knock me out as -- as much as it -- as it seems to knock out other people.
R:  Right.  Um, I used to live in Philadelphia.  I went to college in Philly, at Penn actually and, um, um, I used to get sick when I first moved there, um, because the seasons, where I'm from, aren't really so pronounced.  So, when I first moved to Philadelphia like we had definite like, definite wi- winter versus summer versus fall, like everything was very clear cut as to which season you're in.
L:  [MN]
R:  When I first moved there I got sick a lot but then like I guess my body just got used to it, um, but as far as like treatments go I guess I take a lot more vitamin C than I used to before I moved to Philadelphia and then, um, every now and then I take echinacea when I start to feel a little bit sick, even if it's not just like a winter like a seasonal change --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if I just start to feel sick I take -- take echinacea and like I -- I very rarely get sick anymore.
L:  Really?
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Knock on wood [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but, yeah, I -- I -- I -- I haven't gone to the doctor in a very long time.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it -- in -- and, uh, you bring up a good point and I wonder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if, you -- you mention that -- that when you first moved out there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to Philadelphia where the seasons change that you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- seemed to be more susceptible to it, I -- I, you know, I wonder if it's something that your body has to, uh, has to get used to those dramatic changes and if you, you know, I was born and raised in Missouri and my body was a little bit more used to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the dramatic changes, so it doesn't hit me as hard as it might necessarily hit someone who is from Arizona, California, somewhere like that where the seasons --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't change and they get thrown into the middle of it.
R:  Right, yeah, I -- I've definitely believe that.  Um, it's just like your body can only take so much, you know, like it has to adapt to certain situations and then when you -- when you suddenly change your body isn't ready for it and then that's when you really get sick, but I think that like once you've lived for -- in somewhere for more than a year like your body d- has chan- s- like it's definitely so called evolved I guess --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to whatever climate you're in.
L:  You talked about --
R:  Like right now, like, right -- what?
L:  Go -- go ahead.
R:  Oh, I mean like now I -- I've moved to LA and like, I mean LA compared to Philly, uh, to Philly like there really isn't a comparison for -- for, um, differences in climate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like LA never changes.  It's always sunny, it's always between like fifty and seventy [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I w- -- I was oddly enough in Los Angeles yesterday.
R:  Oh, were you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was very nice. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was very lovely.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's great here and I, uh, like the worst that will happen to me is I might sneeze [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's it.  Um -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I'm sure right now I -- I've been living here for almost a year and I just feel like maybe like if I moved back to Philly at this point I'd probably get sick again.
L:  Absolutely, absolutely.  You --
R:  Right.
L:  You mentioned that you -- you take more vitamin C or when you feel like you're -- you're getting sick you take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- echinacea.  I -- I don't do that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, and, uh, and probably to a fault and -- and I -- I think what happens with me is that I don't get sick often but when I do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I get sick.
R:  Really?
L:  I mean, you know, it really knocks me out and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I probably ought to do more preventative things to keep it from happening --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- because when it does -- when it does happen it's rare and it knocks me out, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I guess, and -- and I don't know if it's like -- if it's a manly thing thinking, "Oh, I'll be fine.  I can just ..." you know, "I can beat this cold".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "I can, you know, I can wait it out. I don't need any of that stuff", but, uh, you know, they've -- they've come to me four days later when I'm curled up in bed and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I'm a little less manly.  My -- [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] No, I want my mommy. [LAUGH]
L:  My wife -- my wife has certainly called me a great big baby, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I prob- -- I probably ought to do more preventative things.
R:  [LAUGH] Right, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't know how well echinacea actually works.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I've been reading studies lately where they just have that pretty much, uh, like echinacea does not work, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I mean as far a- -- I used to be a Psych Major and do --
L: Uh-huh.
R:  -- I used to do a lot of like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- research and stuff like that and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- as far as I'm aware, like if you can convince yourself that it's working it'll work.
L:  So --
R:  You know, like that's why they have placebo --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- studies to prove that it happens and, uh, it to- it totally does.  If you think that something's helping you, you -- you're body will do it [LAUGH].
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Right, so I'll -- I'll look into you taking it up and telling that it works.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's my cure all for diseases.
L:  Yeah, it's whatever works for you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and you know I -- I wonder if because, uh, that's not something that -- that I think people talk a lot about here, you know, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- echinacea, or the -- I don't want to necessarily call them alternative medicines because I think your herbal remedies are certainly becoming --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more and more mainstream, but it seemed like that really was a California thing.  In the year and a half that I lived in Sacramento, um, you know, you'd go to John but you saw whatever and get, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- an extra boost of whatever in your -- in your -- in your juice or in your treat or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it -- it seems like it's -- it's a little bit more accepted a- at least in California was than it is here in the conservative midwest.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.
R:  But do you take vitamins and stuff or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do you just completely unlike that kind of stuff?
L:  [LAUGH] No, I don't [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's a wonder I'm not walking --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- dead all the time but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you -- I -- I've vitamins here, you know, I'm i- i- societally speaking here in the Mid West -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are certainly well accepted and that sort of thing, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it just seems to me that -- that in the time that -- that we were in California it seemed like there was a lot more wider acceptance of, you know, d- doing -- not necessarily having to rely on a doctor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to make you feel better and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which I think is a good thing, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Y- y- you don't necessarily have to go to the doctor all the time and s- sometimes there are -- there are things that you can try, things that you can do, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like you said if they work for you then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- by golly keep doing 'em.
R:  Right, and then as far as like the doctor thing like I never had an HMO.  I always had a PPO until I started working after college and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so then I have an HMO and I avoid going to the doctor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like if I feel sick I want to fix it myself because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- first you have to pay for your primary care physician because like, I mean like I can go off for hours on HMOs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but like you have to have a primary care physician and then most likely he'll either say, "Oh, there's nothing wrong with you.  Go home", --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or he'll say, "Okay.  You need to see someone else" and you have to pay for that other person too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I'm like I just feel like if I -- if there's anything else that I can do I will try it before I go to the doctor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and if I'm like throwing up and like totally sick two weeks later then I'll consider going to the doctor [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But until -- until I run out of options over the counter or whatever, like herbal remedies, I will go to Chinese shops --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and eat like snakeskin.  I don't care [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.
R:  Anything to not have to go to the doctor.
L:  You'll try acupuncture.  You'll try cats.
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  You'll try anything [LAUGH].
R:  I could have appendicitis I wouldn't care [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, I mean it's definitely -- getting sick is not -- not really an issue to me anymore --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, um, but back when I was in school I used to go to student health all the time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like if I got a cough that was funny I'd go to student health.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, generally I would have worse colds there than I would here.
L:  Yeah and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it [MN] and -- and I know the, you know, the -- the science, uh, supposedly says that it really doesn't matter if it's hot outside or if it's cold outside.  You get a cold because you're transferring a virus from, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- one person to the next but, you know, you -- you've -- you've lived in Los Angeles.  You've lived in places where the weather changes.  You --
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Certainly for you it -- it seems as though there -- there is a difference when it comes to your health or when it comes to your body being able to adjust.
R:  Right.  Absolutely.  I -- I've definitely seen that as a defence.  Um, I don't actually know anybody whose been getting sick here but back in Philly like we used to get sick all the time, but I also don't know if it has to do with the fact that we were in a college atmosphere where --
L:  Oh, that's very good.
R:  -- everything was being transmitted and like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you would sit in a class room with people just like coughing and being so completely sick but they don't want to miss class, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, I don't know if it's because of the weather necessarily --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or it's because of that, um --
L:  That's an excellent point.
R:  Right, so I mean, but I also live near UCLA and I also see a lot of sick people around here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like I did back in Philly, but I mean ...
