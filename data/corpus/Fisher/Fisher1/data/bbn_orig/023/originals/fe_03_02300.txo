L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Richard.
R:  My --
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Liselle.
L:  Hi, Liselle.  Did you get the topic of the day?
R:  Illness?
L:  Yeah.  Something about a cold lasting seven days if you don't go to the doctors.  And five days if you do.  Which I find to be, hmm, that might be a little bit true.  And something about the weather changing, too, right?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Do you get sick when the weather change --
R:  The only time I get sick when the weather changes is if I go outside and my hair's soaking wet and it's snowing outside.
L:  Mhm.  In the cold.
R:  But, uh, a common body reaction, though.
L:  Mhm.  Me too.  And I usually go to the doctors, get some penicillin, rest for a day and I'm fine.  But other than that, I have a couple aches and pains and -- like, my bones ache if it's gonna rain or something like that.  I guess you could say I'm old.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But you know, I'm not old.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  You sound --
L:  Or getting old.
R:  -- pretty young, huh.
L:  Mhm.  That's a kinda hard topic, don't you think?
R:  It is, is a kind of a hard topic.  I mean, I'm in the medical field, but they -- they say starve a fever, feed a cold.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH].
R:  You really can't starve somebody and expect something -- you know, expect to get better, but --
L:  To get well, yeah? 
R:  [LAUGH].  It's one of those -- your body re- has to really fight off, you know, the illness 'cause everybody has a dormant in their system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, your body's overdoing itself and if your body overdoes itself, and you don't have the vitamins there to fight it off, you're not going to get better.
L:  Exactly.  Like, you're speaking the truth, my sister.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  But, um, I don't get sick that much.  I used to have allergies.  They went away for some reason.  The older I get, the better my allergies get, so I don't even have to deal with that any more.  Maybe a cold every now -- every three years or something.  But other than that, I feel fine.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Thank the Lord.  [LAUGH].  
R:  What part of the United States do you live in?
L:  Uh, East Coast.  New Jersey.
R:  New Jersey?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, we -- I live in Ohio, but when we lived in California, none of my kids got sick.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  'Cause it -- the moist, humid -- not moist, it's the dry humidity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and out here, it's the moist humidity.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  A lot more --
L:  I think maybe germs can live better in the moist --
R:  Than in the --
L:  -- humidity.
R:  -- dry.
L:  Than in the dry.  
R:  Well -- well, if you think about it, mould will form quicker in moist than it will in dry.
L:  True.  Yes.
R:  So that's why the majority of the east coast get sick at winter time.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  So, were your kids born in -- in California?
R:  Born, yeah, in -- I can't say born and raised, but [LAUGH] 'cause they're only still little, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yes, they were all three born back there and --
L:  Oh, okay.  So maybe they're also immune to the dry air, too, since they were born there?
R:  And when we brought them out here, all three of them ended up with an ear infection instantly.
L:  Oh, gosh.  
R:  And it was like, oh, I'm moving back.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's why the elderly move that way.
L:  Uh-huh, and to Florida and stuff like that.
R:  Yes, because it slows the dying process down. 
L:  Oh.  Did not know that.
R:  [LAUGH].  It's like you have, you know -- you know, that whole, you gotta go, go to the doctor if it lasts more than seven days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you can only pump someone full of medication so much.
L:  Right.
R:  And they're gonna become immune to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you put them in a dry climate, and their body's not fighting to keep everything going.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  It's gotta also keep itself warm and uh fight off the sickness.  Mm.  That's very interesting.
R:  Kind of a hard subject to start off with, but --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we worked it out.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  So, that's why old people move down south?  They, like, migrate, like birds.
R:  Oh, trust me, they do.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, I have nothing against the elderly, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we live in a population -- this little city that we lived in, it only had four thousand people, I say only three hundred of them --
L:  In California?
R:  In California.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And only three hundred of those people in this town were under the age of forty.
L:  Dag.
R:  So, driving down the road kinda got irritating after a while.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Good that your kids --
L:  I bet it did.
R:  -- were always okay outside playing.
L:  Yeah, they can push a car --
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  -- slow as the cars are going. Mm.  I have to look into that, because um if that's really true, then my grandmother, maybe she'll do a lot better, uh, in Florida or Califor- well, in Florida.  We don't know anybody in California.  We have --
R:  My grandma just moved back up from Florida.  They lived there for the longest time --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and she broke her hip, so that whole --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- traditional move back around the family kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They came back up here and she has been nothing but sick for the last six months.
L:  Oh, man.  
R:  She's just not really gotten into the -- here's the climate change, you know, it's completely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- moist air.  That's why a lot of your elderly -- I don't know if you've stepped into a nursing home?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that nursing home is hot as could be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they consistently have that heater running.
L:  Oh. 
R:  It could be ninety degrees outside, but they're freezing.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they are.  That's true.  That's true.  My grandmother lived in, uh, a complex where it's nothing but old people were allowed to move into the apartments, and it's all -- she had the heat turned -- actually taken out, had her radiators taken out of her apartment and her apartment's still hot because she's on the tenth floor, but I see what you mean about they always keep the heat on.  That's true.  [COUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's like three hundred degrees, but, "Oh, I'm still freezing, honey".
L:  Mhm.  And with a sweater on.
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.  Always --
L:  That's why a lot of them in the summer time, a lot of people, you know, old -- older people, are more, you know, likely to um have fatalities because they don't realize how hot it really is.  They think they're cold --
R:  And they'll have a heat stroke.
L:  Mhm.  End up having a heat stroke.  
R:  Do you agree with the saying that they have, after a week?
L:  After a week, what?
R:  Go to the doctor?
L:  I don't wait that long.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] say a cold's not going to be serious and -- and after a day or if I feel my body aching, and getting a headache and stuff, you know, that after a day or two, I'm at the doctors.  I don't wait that long, I'm sorry.
R:  I don't think anybody really waits a week.
L:  Yeah, a week, um phew.  Goodness.
R:  You go walking into the doc, "Okay, it's been seven days".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I'm on my deathbed.  Help me".  [LAUGH].
L:  But now on the news and stuff, they say it's uh people go to the doctors and you can get over counter -- over the counter medicine that could heal you just as good as the doctors.
R:  Just as quick.
L:  And they say Americans are wasting money going -- going to the doctors for stuff that can be cured, but how are we supposed to know what to take?  Unless we ask the doctor?  And to do that --
R:  Very true.
L:  -- you have to go to the doctors.
R:  Because if you, like, the ER or something, "Well, I think you need to be seen".
L:  And that calls for more than a doctors.  And more frustrating than going to the doctors. 
R:  Well, the -- I -- it's not really off the subject, but those swing tests that they came out with, you know, I work with a lot of people who, like, oh, but they got so many vitamins in it.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  We got into this conversation last night, to where we wanted to take it because we heard that if you pour it into a regular soda can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it would eat straight through it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm thinking, well gee, why do you [inaudible] all this weight?
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  But we never did it last night because we got, you know, too wrapped up into what we were doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I have yet to do that.  That's one of those -- how could you consume it?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  If it's gonna eat through a soda can?
L:  Yeah.  Maybe that's why they put it in for -- for cans, because it does eat through the tin or aluminum or whatever cans are made of. 
R:  In Amer- well, not America, but on the news, they were also saying that all these -- all these vitamins and stuff can actually be hurting you instead of helping you.
L:  Mm.
R:  So go back to the natural, eat your vegetables and --
L:  Right.
R:  But how can you do that when they're spreading all the chemicals on them?
L:  Yeah.  You got that right, so, damned --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
R:  Damned if you don't.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Just grow your own.
L:  Yeah, right.  Grow your own or do what you been doing.  And feel satisfied for what you've -- what you got.  Mm.  Well, I think our ten minutes is probably gonna be up soon.  I don't know.
R:  Gee, this is a long ten minutes.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it is.  Well, I like a lot of vegetables.  I think that's healthy.  Love spinach and broccoli and stuff like that, and love lettuce.
R:  All the gr- green vegetables?
L:  Mm, and greens, yeah.  I like greens, too.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I like greens, cooked cabbage.  I don't like cold cabbage. 
R:  [LAUGH].  Cold cabbage is kinda nasty.
L:  Mhm.  [COUGH].  
R:  Have you been doing this study for a while?
L:  No, only one day.  This is my second day.
R:  This is your second day?
L:  Yeah, and -- I -- there's a timer on my phone and we're into twelve minutes.
R:  Twelve minutes?
L:  Mm.
