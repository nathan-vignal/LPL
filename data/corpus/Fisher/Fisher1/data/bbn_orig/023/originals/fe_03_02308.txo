L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Lisa.
R:  I'm Karen. 
L:  Hi.  I didn't even hear the second question they asked.  Did you?  
R:  Um, I think it said um when the uh -- when the seasons change, people get sick, do you?
L:  Mhm?
R:  And then it said, um, uh, there's a saying -- the saying one you didn't hear?
L:  Yeah, the second one.
R:  Okay.  Um, if there's a saying -- there's a saying that a last -- a cold lasts um seven days if you don't go to a doctor and a week if you do, do you agree?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I would have to say yes.  
R:  [LAUGH].  I find that rather funny.
L:  You know?  
R:  So, do you get sick when the seasons change?
L:  Not really, but I do have, um, sinus drainage, but I think that comes from just having allergies and when the seasons change, there tends to be, like, more pollen in the air and grass and I'll get sniffly and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Same here.  I never really get sick because of the season change.  I rarely -- never find myself to have a cold.
L:  Right.
R:  Other than that --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I find that fine, so I never have to go to the doctor, so I never know how long it lasts.  [LAUGH].
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In New York.  Where do you live?
L:  In New York.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  That's strange.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  No, um, I don't really think you can get sick for a seasonal change.  Um, I don't even -- didn't get sick when weather changes.  I think a lot of people say that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I don't really see how it can be true, per se.
R:  No.  I just think that possibly when um the cold air gets warmer, a germ lasts longer.
L:  Oh, that makes sense.
R:  So um, you know, it has to come from a germ.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It doesn't come from -- like the doctors always say, you don't catch a cold because you go outside without a hat on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- you know, it's -- I -- I don't -- I agree with you, that I don't think you can get sick because the weather per se, if you go outside without a jacket or whatever.  But because germs last longer in warmer weather, um, that's probably -- you know, how -- how one gets sick. 
L:  So what do you do to prevent illness, I think was the other question?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I don't really have to do anything.  You know, I just -- um, you know, I eat healthily and uh, you know, I just go along what I do -- you know, I don't even think about it.  How about you?
L:  Right.  I think I only really get sick like once a year.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Um, I stay fairly healthy, to uh eat well, like you said and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- you know, exercise and try to maintain, like, a positive attitude and I think that usually keeps me from being, um, sick. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  And then -- and then once a year, you know, it's just kind of natural from living in New York, we're exposed to a lot of toxins and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you know, I don't know, bad things in the air, I guess, with so many people living here in such a small space that your body eventually will -- will have to release the toxins and, like, I visit the doctor and he's like, "You were here last year this exact day with the exact same problem".
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  And he's like, it's just natural.  Your body just builds up toxins and you have to release them, no matter how healthy you are or how many precautions you take to not get sick, this will eventually happen.
R:  Exactly.  When you -- when you get worn -- you know, worn down, that's when you feel the most, you know, that's when you're most susceptible so you just have to make sure that you get a lot of rest and um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, just keep your body not -- from not getting tired and you don't -- you don't ever really feel, like, if you do even catch a little cold.
L:  Yeah, and that's true because if I run myself ragged and I'm going out a lot and not sleeping right or not eating right or drinking too much --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- then I think I'm more --
R:  Exact --
L:  -- susceptible to getting sick and I'm slugging and trying to do too much and eventually I'll just like break down and be sick.
R:  Yes, it's hard to get out of that.  It's hard to get out of the rut when you get into it.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.  I feel like ten minutes has already gone [LAUGH] -- 
L:  You feel like what?
R:  [LAUGH].  No, but I -- that -- that, you know, that's just that -- you know, if you don't -- if you just take care of yourself, then you know, most likely you won't get sick, and if you do, it's not going to be anything more than, you know, just a little cold due to just normal, you know, every day --
L:  Mhm.  And my friends that are chronically sick seem to be the ones that are malnourished and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't sleep on a regular basis, so they never go to bed the same time, they may live on four hours of sleep and think they're okay and you know, have a liquid lunch and a liquid dinner --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not eat --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- right, and I'm like, "Why are you always pale and sick and sniffly" and you know?
R:  Well, that's because they don't take care of themselves.
L:  Exactly, so I think I -- I think health, if you try to maintain a certain level --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of health and your body runs more efficiently and you won't get as sick.
R:  Exactly, and if you don't have time to get sick -- I don't -- I never -- I don't have time to get sick. 
L:  You know, no one does --
R:  So --
L:  -- living in this city.  
R:  Right, so it -- you know, just if you don't have time, you just don't let your body, you know -- if you don't feel well, you know, you take a little while and that's really all you have.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To recover, so you just can't -- you can't um --
L:  And it's like --
R:  -- can't let yourself --
L:  -- I try not to go to the doctor because you -- he's just going to tell me what I already know.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  And you know, you might get some penicillin --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- you almost feel like there should be, like, a delivery service for penicillin, instead of paying the doctor fees and --
R:  Let me tell you, it should be sold over the counter.
L:  -- the prescrip- exactly, and it's like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you -- they tell you to take it for a week and if you didn't go to him, you'd probably be well in a week anyways, you know?
R:  Exactly.  Well, that was -- that -- that's the saying they just said on the -- on the recording, that if you go to the doctor [LAUGH] --
L:  It'll take the same time, or it'll take a week or -- as if you don't go to the doctor.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, a cold is a cold.  You can't -- you know, can't really do anything about a cold.  Just to let it go away.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Get rest and, you know, drink some fluids.  [LAUGH].
L:  But it is pretty crazy.  Like, when I've worked in an office environment, one person gets sick, everybody tends to get sick --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and it's like --
R:  It breeds.
L:  -- or are people not, like, washing their hands, are they not, like, covering their mouth when they -- or their nose when they sneeze?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, how does that happen?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's what ha- that's the problem, you know?  Germs are airborne, so if -- if somebody is sick, you know, you're bound to get it if you're in the same, you know -- especially --
L:  Vicinity.
R:  -- living with, you know, two kids and a husband, we just went through getting sick and I -- I'm --
L:  Oh.  
R:  -- the only one who didn't get sick, so you know, it -- it's really -- you know, you could keep everything clean, but it's -- you know, you touch one thing, you know, and you -- you have a germ.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's uh, you know, it -- it's -- it's inevitable sometimes, but as long as you -- you take care of yourself and you eat right and sleep well and, you know, and it -- you know, everything should be fine.  
L:  Yeah, I agree.  It has to be hard to have two kids that get sick and then you don't end up getting it.  That's pretty lucky.
R:  Yeah.  My husband got it, too, so it uh -- you know, three babies, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Um, you know, so it's -- yeah well, it's hard because you know, I had to take care -- you know, when I take care of them, it -- you know, but usually -- usually adults don't get most things that children, you know, get these days.  Strep throat, ear infections --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Just a lot of common colds that, you know, and -- that kids can't really handle as well.  
L:  Right.  Their immune systems not as strong, I guess --
R:  Exactly so.
L:  -- as ours are?
R:  Exactly so.  You know, but they snapped right out of it, so it's -- you know, that's -- like you know sometimes you get sick and you take care of everything else, so --
L:  Are they in school?  Do they get it --
R:  Yeah, nursery school, so you know, they -- they bring home a germ and everybody has it, so it's -- you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Just -- there's nothing you could do about it.  Well, you know, you could keep them away from people, but you know what?  You -- you either spend your whole life in a bubble or you deal with getting sick --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- every once in a while.  So --
L:  And I think most of us would rather deal with the latter.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, what else?
L:  Yeah, I wonder how long we've talked?
R:  I don't know.  I don't a timer on my phone.
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Mine says twelve thirty three, but I know I was on hold for a while, so I'm not sure --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- how long, because they were looking for another person.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  Mm. 
R:  I don't know --
L:  What else did they ask us talk -- talk -- to talk about?
R:  What?  
L:  I think that's about it, right?
R:  Well, yeah, I think we've covered all -- I think three topics.  
L:  Yeah.  I don't know what else I could say about illnesses, really.
R:  Me either.  [LAUGH].  So we could just say "la, la, la" until they -- I mean, I -- I know -- have you ever done one of these before?  This your first one?
L:  I did one yester- one yesterday.
R:  Oh.  
L:  But they have phoned me three times in the last twenty four hours.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So that's a lot.
R:  Yeah.  They called me yesterday, but I guess the other person wasn't interested.
L:  Mm.  
R:  So they hung up.  
L:  Yeah, yesterday the one I did was on food.  
R:  Oh, that's funny --
L:  And if I'd rather eat -- cook at home --
R:  I guess --
L:  -- or eat out, so that was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- pretty fun.  
R:  Yeah, that's funny because that's the one I got.  They must just do -- like, one topic a day?
L:  Yeah, that's probably what it is.  Mm.  So is this your first one?
R:  Yes.  
L:  It's not bad.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, it's -- ten minutes is quite fast, but like the illness one, it's like --
R:  There's really not much --
L:  -- I don't know if they want --
R:  -- to talk about it, as far as illness.  I mean, do you get sick?  No.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Go to the doctor?  Yes.  [LAUGH].
L:  Unless they want to know about, like, chronic illnesses or like if any of our family members suffer, but they didn't really say that.
R:  No, they -- I think they were just basically talking about a cold.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, but other than sinuses, I think that both of us don't get sick, so [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  So I'd have to say --
L:  I don't know how we all manage to stay so healthy in New York, considering what the city promotes and the night life and the culture and as many people within the --
R:  Well, I wonder how --
L:  -- from all this city --
R:  -- really -- really how healthy we are?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's true, too.
R:  You never know --
L:  And I think we're --
R:  -- one day, you know, that could happen.  You know, one day you -- you're healthy and happy and then one day you go somewhere and it's like, you know, you always have to wonder --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- what's happening.
L:  Or what's in the food that we eat, is it --
R:  Oh, yeah.  All those things on like --
L:  -- genetically processed?  
R:  On those health risks, you know, that stuff from the salad bars?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's nasty.  And the restaurants --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- like, going out to eat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They do all those shows on the, you know, restaurants and
