L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Uh, my name is Bonnie.
L:  I'm sorry I didn't catch your name.
R:  Bonnie.
L:  Bonnie.  Hi, Bonnie.  I'm Anita.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I was -- my phone's breaking up and I could barely understand what the message was.  I know it's about illness.
R:  Oh, its, um, -- oh, yeah its about illness.  Um, it -- a lot of people get sick when the seasons change and, um, a cold lasts seven days, uh, if you don't go to the doctor.  Do you agree with that?  That's the question.
L:  Okay, um --
R:  Is it breaking up still or ...?
L:  I put my antenna up so I'm hoping that will help, um ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, uh, with the -- why how about you start it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.  This is my second call so --
L:  This is my second my second time too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, and then the guy I had yesterday was very scary so I'm glad it's -- 
L:  Really?
R:  -- not a scary person today.
L:  I see you know the person I had yesterday lives not too far from me and we just kept yakking and yakking and then we got cut off because the ten minutes were up.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] but, um --
R:  That's funny.  
L:  Okay, so ...
R:  Are you in Philadelphia or ...?
L:  I'm in, uh, Sar- Saratoga in Montgomery County.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm from Doylestown originally.
L:  Actually the other person yesterday was up by Perkasie.
R:  Oh, that's funny. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's where my dad works.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].  This is too crazy.  Okay, so now do you --
R:  So, illness.
L:  -- get seasonal illnesses.
R:  Yeah, well I mean I have allergies right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So -- and I know like a lot of my friends do 'cause that's part of like when the seasons change you get ill but I don't know if that counts because although it's like really uncomfortable does that count like being --
L:  You're not really doing anything about it.
R:  Huh?
L:  Youre not really doing anything about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  See now I don't have seasonal allergies but my son does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know if I can discuss him or not but, um --
R:  I don't -- I don't know like what we can and can't discuss honestly.
L:  I -- I don't really either.  This one I'm finding a little bit more difficult than yesterday's, um -- I mean not -- not conversation wise but topic wise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I do know for me personally if I did have allergies I wouldn't go to the doctors after seven days, um, even the way I am with a regular cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not gonna pay fifteen dollar code payments out for the doctor to tell me I have a cold.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, so, um, that's just being --
R:  Fortunately I have five dollar code to pay now but, um -- yeah I know still it's ridiculous 'cause he's gonna say, "All right, drink some orange juice, have some soup".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, we know that --
L:  Yeah and there's noth- --
R:  -- and the cold is like one of the worst things you can have because there's nothing you can do.
L:  I know.  I -- I always say I'd rather be throwing up violently for a week than to have a cold for three days.  You just can't function with a cold. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  I mean your head -- it's like you're walking around with a balloon around your head.
L:  Yeah, and you can't breathe.  You can't sleep.
R:  You can't think.
L:  You -- you can't do anything and then everybody wants you and you're so miserable and your nose is red or so red and swollen you can't tell if it's running.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Your whole face feels raw.  You feel hollow.
L:  You sound very young.
R:  I'm twenty six.
L:  Twenty six, okay.  Well, I guess to me that would be very young.  I'm thirty nine.
R:  Uh, I don't know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's not much di -- that much different, I don't know.  I don't know.
L:  Well, when you get to be my age everybody seems like a kid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, like, um -- but [inaudible] -- you know I don't have seasonal allergies, um, but I do know -- now you --you said you're in Doylestown, um, you're -- if you lived close to Shearer -- see like I'm kind of like in a toxic triangle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the air affects me that way.
R:  Right.  Oh gosh, yeah.
L:  But we have the Limerick Towers, we have, um, Occidental Chemical and the landfill --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm right smack in between all three.  It's a triangle around my house.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, you know, I ...
R:  How's your water?
L:  Well, I have a purifier so that I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The water isn't too bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was just gonna say that must taste great. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know Phoenixville hospital's water tastes like a sewer.
R:  Oh.
L:  You have -- that's -- that's nasty.  I mean it even smells.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know when water isn't supposed to have a smell.
R:  No.
L:  But, um -- but, uh, the problem I have is you know there's certain days the way the winds blowing -- 
R:  Mhm
L:  -- that it's catching all those toxins and everything that I'm all congested, but other than that I don't have allergies so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think this applies, at least not to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately like every time the season changes, like when it goes from really warm to really cold or really cold to really warm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get sick and I don't know what it is in my body chemistry but I've been like that since I was a little girl so it does apply to me but, um, I don't know, I mean, I just suck it up and take some Panadol cold.
L:  Well, can you take -- get shots or something for the allergies?
R:  Yeah, but I don't like shots so --
L:  I don't know anybody that does. 
R:  -- I avoid them at all costs. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No,  it's --  you know, it's not a pleasant thing you know to go and get stuck in my arm and have like a sore arm for half a half a week, you know.
L:  You know, because my son, you know, I just give him Zyrtak.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  And that works?
L:  For the most part it does, yeah, um --
R:  What's he allergic to?
L:  Oh god.
R:  Everything?
L:  Well, for our type stuff it's mould.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but he's allergic to cats and dogs, rabbits --
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, he's got a life threatening egg allergy and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's allergic to, of all things, roaches, dust and dust mites.
R:  Roaches?
L:  Um, yeah he --
R:  Yum.
L:  Yeah, he's -- he's allergic to roaches.  Thank god I don't have any.
R:  Oh, my god --
L:  But --
R:  -- well roaches are more like a city thing, I think, aren't they?
L:  Uh-uh.  No, no.
R:  No?
L:  They can be anywhere.
R:  We never had 'em in Doylestown so I just don't know but --
L:  Well, see, um, back where I used to live it was still in the suburbs but I was living in an apartment building and --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- apartment buildings --
R:  -- you can't control your neighbors.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I mean, they could be anywhere and it's, you know -- but anyway when my son he -- I think he was ten months old when he got skin tested for the egg allergy but they test you for about twenty four different things.
R:  Right.
L:  And roaches was one of those things that popped up.
R:  Ha.
L:  But I didn't even know people could be allergic to that.
R:  Yeah, I've never ever heard of that.
L:  But, um -- no, I know --
R:  I mean normal pet allergy you hear about all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, roaches --
L:  But, you know, I know this is --
R:  -- and what other bugs?
L:  He's aller-  -- okay, let's see, cats, dogs, rabbits, mould, dust, dust mites, um --
R:  Oh, dust mites.  That's hard.  They're everywhere.
L:  -- roaches and then he's got the life threatening egg -- egg allergy, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  But, you know, I -- I know that this one is so off the subject --
R:  That's fine.
L:  But, um, [LAUGH] but I can smell a roach.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah and it -- to me it smells like brown sugar, and it drives me crazy when I'm grocery shopping and I go down the bakery aisle, because I'm sure I can smell a bunch of roa-  roaches but it's the brown sugar.
R:  Well, brown sugar's not a bad smell.
L:  It's not really a bad smell but if I smell --
R:  I never associated that with a roach.  I never really had a lot of exposure to them.
L:  -- I -- I only did --
R:  Fortunately.
L:  -- because I lived in that apartment building and it just seemed that every time I'd smell brown sugar --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'd spot a roach and I -- back then I didn't bake, you know, I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before kids and, um, and I'm referring to like your age, um -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's okay.
L:  But, um, I didn't really bake, so I didn't have any brown sugar but I would smell it and then I would spot a roach and now whenever I smell --
R:  Some kind of association.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's --
R:  That's weird.  I never would --
L:  -- like that's what it smells like.
R:  -- associate a good smell, like to me that smells like cookies, brown sugar. 
L:  Well, the --
R:  Now, you're gonna gimme nightmares.
L:  To me -- they're really not a good smell anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, if I smell brown sugar -- I'm like, you know, there better not be any in here -- but, um -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  That's me.
R:  The only experience I ever had with roaches was I, um -- I stayed over this girl's house that I didn't know very well when I was about fifteen years old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I turned on her bathroom light and the floor moved.  There were so many of them.
L:  Oh my god.
R:  I called my mother and made her come and get me.  It was awful.
L:  I would have done the same thing.
R:  And my -- it was like about forty five minutes away too so but --
L:  Oh god, no I would have done the same thing.  Oh, just get me out of here. [LAUGH] I --
R:  No, then the worst thing is I took my backpack home and we opened it up when we got home and this bug the size of my -- my index finger plus my thumb crawled out.
L:  Oh my god!
R:  And it -- it had a neck, and it turned around it's neck --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it looked at me -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I never screamed so loud in my life.
L:  Okay, well wait a minute, was it black or was it brown?
R:  It was black.
L:  It was black.  Okay, that was a water bug.
R:  Oh, but it -- it was really long.
L:  It looks like a roach.  It really does, it looks like a roach but they're water bugs.
R:  Oh.
L:  And --
R:  Well, well, anyway my mum freaked out here --
