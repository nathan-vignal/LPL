L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, my name's Ryan.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Shirley.
L:  Shirley.  How old are you?
R:  Ah, gosh, I'm sleeping.  Okay.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes?  
L:  Do you remember what the topic was? [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, something about smoking, smelly smoking.
L:  I think it was for bad -- bad habits --
R:  Agh.
L:  What do you think's -- what do you think's worse, ah, gossiping, smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine excessively, or ah, I kind of forget the last one.
R:  I don't know what the last one.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Oh, I guess smoke and drink is bad enough.
L:  Do you think so?
R:  Yeah, don't you?
L:  Well, I mean, it depends on what you're talking about.  If you're talking for your health or if you're talking for --
R:  -- well, for anybody's health.
L:  [COUGH] Well, emotional or physical.  For physical, certainly, you're right.  I think smoking's actually a -- I think smoking would be the worst.
R:  Oh, it turns out being emotional as well.
L:  Yeah, well, in -- I -- I think, I -- I -- I'm not a big fan of gossiping, but I, ah, I think that has a certain emotional benefit.
R:  I like gossiping.  If you don't pay attention to it, you're fine.
L:  Absolutely.  Or if --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you don't get caught up with it.
R:  There you go.  Smoking, you know, you get second hand smoking and whatever drinking always affects some other people.
L:  Mhm.  I'm in the ah, I'm in the process of trying to cut out caffeine myself --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- I'm trying to cut out caffeine from my diet.  I drink a -- I drink a lot of soda.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just, I don't know, it's just that ev- ev- everything I've read, or doctors have told me, caffeine's not that good for you, too much coffee, too much ah, caffeine, kind of screws up the way your um, th- th- the chemicals in your body work.  And it -- it's um, it's -- it's an addictive drug, just as nicotine or ah, alcohol can be.
R:  Well your body needs some caffeine.
L:  Yeah, you know, it's -- it -- they say um, I know, I used to get a lot of migraines and they say if you feel a migraine coming on drink something with caffeine in it or it -- it thins your blood so it allows um, the blood to get your head, whereas you know, with -- with a migraine or any kind of headache it's really just a constriction of the blood vessels going to your -- your brain or your head.
R:  So some caffeine helps actually --
L:  Oh yeah.  It's sup- it's supposed to in the beginning.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, I don't know, it doesn't work for me, so [LAUGH] 
R:  I see.
L:  I don't know.  What um, are y- are you at a work place where ah, gossip is rampant or is ah --
R:  I don't pay attention to gossips, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not at all?  You don't just listen on the side sometimes when someone's talking around?
R:  No.  I really don't care.  It's none of my business, you know, and ah, if people like to talk, um, well it's -- I'm not one, you know --
L:  Yeah.  No, I -- I -- I agree --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  No, I agree with you, that's very admirable.  I um, do you live in a state, or do you live in a place where ah, smoking in public places, like restaurants or um, you know, ah, stadiums, is forbidden?  Or illegal?
R:  Ah, well, the laws have been changed regarding that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um -- I think the best --
L:  Are you on the East Coast?
R:  I think, yes, and I think that's good.
L:  Yes.
R:  So what about you?
L:  Absolutely.  I live in -- I live in San Francisco --
R: Oh.
L:  -- and ah, it's been -- it's b -- it's been that way ever since I lived here and --
R:  Oh, interesting.  That's good.
L:  -- and b- something funny about -- I -- when I go ah, when I w- go back home into the mid West, um, it's very cold in the winter and if you go to a bar or somewhere, you can still smoke inside and i- i- it almost makes me sick. [LAUGH] after a night of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just being involved, but ...
R:  Okay, so there you go.
L:  Yeah.  So there --
R:  I guess you really get more affect by that, right?
L:  Yeah, oh absolutely.  I mean, and I -- I actually used to be a smoker -- I started smoking when I was in high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I just quit a few years ago.  And ah, in just that process of quitting kind of just made me, not want to be around.
R:  Good for you.
L:  Yeah, so I don't know.  What about you?  Got any ah, any bad habits you quit or kicked?
R:  Ah, yeah, sleeping. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh man.  Um --
R:  Well [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  What, ah, [inaudible]?  What other topics were there?  There's smoking, drinking, alcohol, caffeine --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  I guess --
L:  -- pardon?
R:  -- that was, you the, to me bad habits and ah, whatever [several inaudible words] last one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, whatever it was I think -- I still think that, you know, drinking and smoking is the -- the worst things, as far as, you know --
L:  Any kind of habit or, just the ones they're listing?
R:  Oh.  I don't know, I mean, it's not very good whatever ah, it was, I guess, and whatever you said --
L:  Yeah.  What ah --
R:  Like I said, I was sleeping [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
R:  Well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's fine.
L:  What um, s- what do you think are, besides the ones that they listed, what kind of habits are y- do you find most annoying in a -- in a person.  Like, what are your pet peeves about a person?
R:  Ah, well, two things really bother me actually.  So we could talk about that hab- I don't know.  So maybe not showering [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's a good one, especially working in close quarters with people.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  [COUGH] excuse me.
R:  You know.  Um, I don't know, [several inaudible words] and not picking up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, ah, garbage, you know.
L:  Littering and such.
R:  That's correct.  I think that's really annoying.  Waiting for somebody to -- to do that for you.
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  Yeah.  So what do you think that's annoying?
L:  Ah, I ah, lying.  I hate -- honesty's a big thing with me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, but, that's exact- well, that's true.  If I found out you know -- you know, I'm just meeting someone or if we're just becoming friends and I already found out you lied to me, that's, you know, lowers the person a few notches on my, you know --
R:  So, they are good.  That comes in a very close kind to gossiping actually, I know it --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So they go [several inaudible words] it's yeah, it is terrible, you're right.
L:  I mean, it's just, especially about -- I've run into a lot of people [COUGH] over the years, that ah, seem to -- it's almost not -- not help by lie.  And I mean, you know, wh- wh- whether it be just little innocent lies or just embellishments or something, there's really no need for it unless, you know, I don't know, there's no need for it.  So, I don't know, that -- that tends to bother me especially if I find out about it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Oh, I think no- nothing should um, surprise you.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  Absolutely.
R:  Well, people are capable of whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  I um --
R:  I think you like talking, don't you?
L:  Huh?
R:  You -- you like talking, don't you?
L:  Oh, sometimes I do.
R:  Sometimes you do.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes I just like sitting around listening.
R:  Oh.  Oh, well --
L:  But um, they cau- they caught me in a talkative mood, so [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yes, I was going to say I'd probably like more listening actually.
L:  Yeah, no.  Tell me ah, ah, let me think here.  What do I want to know?
R:  You know actually, [inaudible] don't mind interrupt, you know, listen as well.  Think that's a great thing.  Um, I'd say that's one of my good qualities, you know.
L:  Listening?
R:  Oh yeah.  You know, I mean, people talk to me a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, usually I'm a very good listener.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless I really don't feel like listening --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so then, I guess I talk instead. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] How about that.
L:  Oh goodness.  I um, gosh, one of my -- my w- actually bad habits slash pet peeves they were talking about, I'm in the process of doing laundry and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- no -- not -- not that habit, just some of the people in the Laundromat, I mean, w- when they leave their stuff in there for a half hour afterwards, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that kind of bothers me. [LAUGH] Especially when n- nothing's available, and then --
R:  Well --
L:  Th- then there's a sign above the ah, machines that says if you leave your -- your stuff in here, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people have a right to take it out and put it on top --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if you do that, then the people get all mad at you when they come back, you know, half hour, forty five minutes later, why's my stuff out of the drier?  Or the washing machines, [inaudible] I mean, other people gotta use it.
R:  Right.  But usually there is somebody taking care of it.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Not at all?
L:  No- not in this one, at least. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh well.
L:  Usually there is, you're right, I have been to places where there is taking care of them but usually --
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Yeah, I mean, [SIGH] I don't go to that problem and I actually hardly do my whole laundry, you know, like, um, take out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, whatever that was[?] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
R:  Yeah, you know, so.  No hassle.
L:  [LAUGH] I wish, I dream of that.
R:  Well, so why can't you do the same?
