L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.  Hi, my name is Kiesha.
L:  My name is Caroline.
R:  Hi Caroline.  Um, do you want to start?
L:  Well, personally, I feel that drinking --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ah, is the worst kind of think that you can do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  I think, ah, it's out of smoking and drinking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I think smoking does a lot of damage, um, as far as cancer is concerned and different things, so I think it would be out of those two, as far as the worst, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've seen a lot in my family as far as smoking and drinking, so those affected me the most. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think it's because I really don't smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I have seen the tolls that it takes on my mother --
R: Oh yeah.
L:  -- ah, so, I mean, she's in her seventies and can't even wa- walk.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, she can't function as well as she used to, not just because she's in her seventies but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because the smoking has taken it's toll on her lungs and on her circulation and on her feet and everything else, and -- but unfortunately no matter how much we tried to get her away from the smoking, she just never gave up.
R:  Right.  I think it's v- it's hard, because it's, you know, addictive and so, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that's the whole thing that -- but I -- I think it's a good -- moving in a good direction for people with these new, like nicotrol and different things like that to help people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kick the habit, because I think a lot of people want to stop, but it's hard, because it's you know, a habit that they've had for so long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, where we live, um, drinking is -- is a big thing.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's why, I mean, I deal in the school systems and, um, there are y- a lot of young people, I'm talking, twelve, thirteen --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, that are drinking and their drinking, I think, in a lot of cases because their family lets it go on and they just think it's a social thing rather than an addictive thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Um, in my family I have, like, two uncles that are like, totally different people when you see 'em sober and then you see 'em, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- drinking, so, it's like, you know, a horrid shock for me, for me to see my uncle that I love and care for this certain way, and then when he's drunk, it's like a totally different mad man, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I definitely think, you know, drinking is a big, you know, bad habit to have and personally, I don't drink or smoke so, and those are one of the reasons, I mean, a couple of the reasons why I don't, because I've seen my family, basically, you know, in those situations and you know, it hasn't been positive.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the same thing with me.  I mean, my grandmother had a speakeasy and, ah, and on holidays, 'cause it's an Italian background, we -- we had wine, ah, not that we got drunk or anything, but we had wine.  Ah, but nowadays, you know, where I live, in -- which is a different area, ah, I mean they have kegs of beer outside their house --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and they think it's like, common and, ah, the kids, like I said, very young.  The -- the -- parents, unfortunately don't realize that they're alcoholics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because a lot of times alcoholics deny what they really are.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  And then what happens is, the poor children live in that environment and they unwillingly or unknowingly just fall right into the habit of being the same way the parents are.  Do you find that with your uncle?  Did he have a background of people drinking in front of him?
R:  Um, no I -- I think my, um, granddad did, but it's like, his kids, they don't drink because, you know, they see what, you know, it's done to him, so I think, um, it's two -- you know, two sided.  I mean, some people look at it as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, this is something I'm not going to do because I've seen the effects of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there are other people who, you know, well, I'm going to try it, my dad did it and they continue the cycle, so I think in families if you recognize that there is a cycle --
L:  Right.
R:  --that's occurring, you try to break it, you know, you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- educate yourself on it, you're able to stop the cycle, but, if you know, some people who weren't educated on it then they continue the cycle, so [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, see my brother is -- well, you should say three of my brothers and sisters don't smoke.  One does 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that person just decided on their own they were going to be like my mom and they didn't care.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, me, I saw the smoking, I saw the ah, alcohol, I saw so many different things, I mean even in my times I saw people taking LSD --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, I just felt that I didn't want anything to control me and I wasn't going to look stupid, like, you know, and do stupid things that I was going to regret the next day.
R:  Right.
L:  So I -- I was fortunate enough, ah, never to touch the stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  And in my household we just don't do it.  Now, I have a daughter who is twenty seven and because -- I never knew she smoked, because in my house she just would never pull out a cigarette, and just recently, ah, she got very ill and debilitated for a while, ah, because it did something to her blood flow and it did something to her lungs.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  Um, so why is it just drinking?  I think drinking, because with the job that I have, I'm very involved with the drinking and seeing that.
R:  I have a question for you:  What, um, in -- I live in Dallas, and one thing that we just did in the city of Dallas, the mayor restricted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like a lot of, um, bars and stuff from having smoking throughout the whole place.
L:  Oh, we have that -- we have that too.  We have that.
R:  What do you think about that?  'Cause we're getting a lot of controversy.  We just did it and so there's a lot of people against it and a lot of people for it and so it's like a big issue down here.
L:  I think it's -- I think it's good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because what I never realized, growing up, even though my mother smoked and I was in the environment of smoke, secondary smoke is one of the worst things that you can get.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, I -- if you want to smoke in the privacy of your home, that's okay --
R:  That's fine, right.
L:  -- but not where there's other people involved and where you can get other people ill.  Now, I was with a person, my first husband, for fifteen years and he was a four pack smoker a day.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I never knew about the secondary smoke and then I developed really bad cases of bronchitis and a lot of respiratory, and I often wonder if I went through this because he was in the house and he was smoking and smoking and smoking.
R:  Right, wow.
L:  So, I think people should have the option of doing it in their home, but not the option of just doing it because they want to do it and having other people fall ill.  You know.
R:  Right.  One thing that they were trying to push, like, the business owners, they're saying that they're losing a lot of money or whatever because the smokers don't want to come into their bars, or they going to like, surrounding areas, because, you know, they can't smoke or whatever, and they were trying to say that they could do like, a new ventilation system or something, but I still don't think that that would help.
L:  No.
R:  You know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Not smell smoke if you're, like, in the same restaurant you're still going to smell it to a certain extent and it will affect those who are not smoking.
L:  If they want to smoke, like my mom, if we go to a restaurant where we are in the Northern part of the country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, she has to go outside and smoke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, sh- she's not allowed, but she'll -- she'll say that I got to take a smoke break.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she'll go out and puff her little cigarettes and then come back in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And even though -- my mom can not walk a block and a half without stopping, that's what it has done to her lungs and that's what really bothers me and maybe, like you said, from seeing it, I would not -- I mean, God was very good to me, because when I tried to smoke my gums blew up.  They hurt me and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I said to myself it wasn't meant to be, I'm not going to smoke, when I was very, very, very young.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, and never did from that time.  You know, never took drugs, never -- even though I was, you know, in the hippy times and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those people, yeah, there was a lot of drugs, but I just --
