L:  My name is Anne.
R:  Ah, hello.  My name is Devon.
L:  Hi Devon.
R:  Hi.  All right, so, what was the topic?
L:  Which do I -- which um, do I think is worse, and ah, several topics were mentioned, including smoking, drinking, gossiping, etc.
R:  All right, so what do you think is worse?
L:  Smoking.
R:  Smoking?
L:  Yes.  Definitely.
R:  Why do you think that?
L:  Because smoking is harmful.  Harmful, ah, physically.
R:  I would agree with that.  I don't like smoking.
L:  Yeah.  I've never smoked.
R:  I'm not a big fan of drinking either because it can make you pretty stupid.
L:  Not necessarily, not if it's done in moderation.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Right, because drinking can be healthy.  Consuming alcohol can be healthy.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yes, research has proven that.  Drinking wine, you know, and beverage with limited ah, amount of alcohol --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is healthy.  I've given birth to three kids and at the hospital I was being given beverage with a slight tint of alcohol, and that was used to like, sedate me, after childbirth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it's healthy.  And gossiping is healthy also.
R:  Gossiping?
L:  Yeah, gossiping.  You like to know what's up with the um, who's in the news, right?
R:  Yeah, that -- that's true.
L:  Yeah, so yeah.
R:  I always like to find out what's up.
L:  Right.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  I don't like cigarettes either.
L:  Ah?
R:  Yeah, I don't like cigarettes either.
L:  Oh, you don't like cigarettes.
R:  No.
L:  It can look cool though, and it can look cool, but it isn't cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, it always makes me feel of old, angry truck stop waitresses.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Those yellow teeth.
L:  Yeah.  Right, because with me, cancer, when I think of smoking, I think of cancer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It does that.
L:  Right.  And it can also affect a man's sex drive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it does.  It does, and for women, you know, it c- it will harm you if you -- if you're pregnant or if you expect to become pregnant eventually, it ah, it can deteriorate your health significantly.
R:  Yep.
L:  Ah, make you ver- feel very stressed out, make you feel tired, make you have all the cravings.
R:  Yeah.  And it's, yeah, it's very addictive.
L:  Uh?
R:  Yes, and it's addicting.
L:  Yes, yes, it er, it can be addictive.  It can be addictive.
R:  I had an ex girlfriend who tried to quit and she like, bought a carton and tore it all up and threw it away and the next day she'd buy a new carton and was smoking again.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, that's interesting.  Very interesting.  That's cool. [LAUGH] Yeah, but -- but that's like -- but you know, everybody else has his own bad habit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, but it's all up to the individual, how they deal with it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Right?
R:  Yep, that's right.
L:  Yeah.  What's on the topic of gossiping?  What's your -- your -- what's your take on that?
R:  Ah, I don't know.  I'm -- I don't tend to gossip much.  I try to stay out of it.  I'm -- I'm young enough that there's still a lot of drama associated with gossiping and I just don't want to get involved in it.
L:  [LAUGH] So you don't read gossip magazines?
R:  No, not really.  No.
L:  Really?
R:  No.
L:  How about, ah, talk shows, or you know, like, Entertainment Tonight or Extra?
R:  Actually, I don't even have a TV.
L:  [LAUGH] You're missing out on a lot.  I tell you, you're missing out on- how about the news?  You don't even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- use the television for the news?
R:  I keep up on the news.  I have the internet, so 
L:  Oh.
R:  I surf the web and I get like, Time Magazine, so 
L:  Well, to my mind, if you have a computer, that's more than having a television.
R:  Yeah.  I like --
L:  -- because you're hooked up to the world.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  And you can watch the television by watching DVD's or you can download a movie and watch it, so that's like having a TV.  You can download radio stations, TV stations, and watch what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So you do have a television.
R:  Yeah, I do in a way.
L:  That's a television, radio, CD player, so many things in one, so you do have a TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, because most of the gossip that I observe, I get it straight off the net.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I subscribe to gossip columns.
R:  Yeah, I like to know what's going on, I just, I don't gossip as much in person.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  But it can be healthy, because you know when we talk about people who are much better off than us, financially and professionally, it gives us something to gravitate towards.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, that's the aspect of it that I like.  And I like to keep up with fashion.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I like to observe fashion trends in UK and get a lot of information on that via gossip columns, you know, Joan Rivers and Melissa Rivers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well my fashion's pretty out of date.
L:  Your fashion?  Your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fashion taste is out of date?
R:  Oh yeah.  I'm into, like, punk rock.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] What's your age range?
R:  Um, I'm twenty four.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- how old are you?
L:  I'm thirty five.
R:  Thirty five?
L:  Yeah.  I'm all of thirty five.  I'm almost ten years older than you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah, but I do have a lot of friends in your age group.
R:  That -- that's fun.  
L:  Yeah, it is.  You learn a lot from people who are older than you, younger than you, and even your age group.
R:  Yeah, I know a lot of people who are different ages.
L:  Right.  You just need to strike a balance, you know.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's it.  But, ah, what were the other topics they asked us to -- to over, right, when they -- they mentioned it to you, the topics we were asked to discuss?
R:  Yeah, they -- yeah they mentioned it.  It was -- it went a little fast for me.
L:  Oh yeah.  It was just a little bit too fast.  I -- I heard ah, like I mentioned, about three or four of the topics --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, well, I guess that would have been enough to --
R:  I heard, ah, I heard over eating.
L:  Oh, over eating.  What's your take on that?
R:  Well, it's bad. [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] Are you going to over weight?
R:  -- definitely unhealthy.  I'm not, um, my dad -- my dad had a heart attack, at like, fifty because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he ate way too much and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well I ke- I'm on -- I'm on a keep fit regime.  I exercise a lot, ah, I've never been overweight.  I'm five ten and I weigh only one twenty five.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- think I eat too much but I exercise a lot, too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm really hyper --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- like right now, I'm pacing around the room.
L:  Oh, well you know over eating is just ah -- it can be looked at as a bad habit or just as form of escapism.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Many people over eat because they're nervous or they're stressed out about a certain issue and that's the only way they know they can relieve themselves, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  By turning to something that won't complain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And nobody can stop them from eating unless they want to stop.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's something to do.  I don't smoke and I don't [LAUGH] 
L:  Well for me, I do eat a lot, but it's like, I have a worse metabolism because it's like, the more I eat, the more I lose weight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've always been a huge eater.  Huge, I really consume a lot, but then again, I'm tall, and you know, most tall people, you have to really eat a lot to keep up with that body mass.
R:  Yep, I mean, I'm the same.  I'm tall, I'm pretty thin, I just -- I eat a lot.
L:  Oh.
R:  I get bored and I just eat stuff and then I go running about.
L:  Oh okay.  So what was the other topic that you could recall, that they mentioned?  I mean, gossiping, overeating, smoking, drinking, I believe, gossiping 
R:  Yeah, there was drinking.  I don't know.  I don't -- I don't really remember any of the others.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  That was pretty much it, uh?
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's pretty much --
L:  What other interesting topics, though?
R:  Yeah, it was, ah, I don't know.  I just forgot what I was going to say.
L:  What do you do, are you a student?
R:  Yeah, I'm a student.  I'm studying, ah, behavioral ecology.
L:  Behavioral ecology.
R:  Which is, it's kinda like, it's basically the study of how people behave and why they behave that way, historically and that kind of stuff.
L:  Oh.  Why did you choose that course?
R:  Um, I'm interested.  It's something I'm really interested in.  I -- I study, ah, I studied animals for a long time and animal behavior and just why things behave the way they do in their environments and how it helps them get along and how they interact and, I just think it's fun.  It's fun to map out relationships between things.
L:  Okay.  So what do you eventually wish to do with that knowledge that you have garnered, and your qualifications?
R:  Um.  Well, that's a pretty -- it's a -- it goes across a lot of --
L:  It's open, right?
R:  -- of different careers.  You can go into ecology --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- studying how animals interact in their environment, you can go into psychology, studying how people interact with what's around them and it's -- there's a lot of job opportunities and it's pretty specialized, so --
L:  Okay, so you've never really pin pointed any one.
R:  Yeah, I personally, I would prefer to go into government work with the environment.
L:  Oh.
R:  So yeah.
L:  Oh okay, I see what you mean.
R:  But ah, yeah.
L:  Oh, that sounds interesting.  H- How much longer do you have to go before you complete your degree?
R:  Oh, I -- I -- I started like, because I come from a poor family.  I had to save up, I actually just started like, three quarters ago so I have five years or so.
L:  Oh.  Okay, okay.  Five years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you're doing it part time are you?
R:  Yeah, I work part time
