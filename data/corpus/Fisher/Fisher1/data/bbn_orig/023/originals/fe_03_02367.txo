R:  [inaudible]
L:  Hello -- oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Have you ever done this before? 
R:  No -- no. 
L:  Yeah -- me neither. 
R:  This is just for time.  I'm doing whatever I can. 
L:  For ten dollars? 
R:  Yeah I know [inaudible] there's how about -- yeah why are you doing it?  Are you just curious or is this [inaudible]
L:  Um, well it's true I got a little nervous about money, but now I'm just curious. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I'm a poor student again, uh, -- my name is Susan. 
R:  Susan -- my name's Andrew. 
L:  Hi.  So we're really supposed to talk about what -- which is worst? 
R:  Uh.
L:  Gossip, smoking, too much caffeine, alcohol, not exercising.  I guess what they -- what do they mean by which is worst? 
R:  Um.
L:  Morally?  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not sure.  I think it's probably just, you know -- I'm not sure.  I've never done this before [LAUGH] -- either do you -- I guess, um, I'm -- I don't know if they said just introduce yourself and then that's it. 
L:  Oh, you didn't hear the topic? 
R:  I heard the topics, but it -- we're actually supposed to talk about them?
L:  Oh, yes, I think we're actually supposed to talk about this.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh. 
L:  It's kind of funny. 
R:  I like gossiping, I like caffeine, I like alcohol -- I love it [LAUGH] but you know [LAUGH] I guess for me the worst thing for me would be uh, seeing people, uh, over eating, not exercise. 
L:  Oh, right, over eating -- that was one. 
R:  [inaudible] frankly speaking it's not a pretty site um, but that's just you know that's my take on this topic. 
L:  Right, well it would be kind of hard like -- I don't know what they mean by which is worst cause like being like  like in a way like I love gossip, and, um, but I -- but I that it's, uh, -- but I kind of feel dirty when I do it sometimes so like I sort of think it's morally can be -- considered morally wrong. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where as I don't think that smoking and drinking is morally wrong necessarily, although I don't do either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that what the, uh, -- the topic [inaudible] --
L:  No it said which -- what do you think is worst. 
R:  Worst, right. 
L:  But I don't know if they mean physically worst then I would have to say like smoking and over eating. 
R:  Right -- how do you define words -- I -- I guess -- I just personally think -- yeah I would say eat -- over eating definitely, um, is the worst and not exercising is like those two in combination are the worst than smoking and exercising, and you know. 
L:  But the also think interesting because I think your ans- -- like ones answer depends on how one lives or like -- right so do you actually exercise? 
R:  Right.
L:  Do you? 
R:  Oh, yes. 
L:  What do you do? 
R:  Um, I -- I'm a surf a lot and --
L:  You surf?  Where do you live? 
R:  Uh, I used to live in Santa Cruz, and then I moved to San Francisco, and, uh, now I actually live in Los Angeles. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  Um, and skateboard -- I used to do -- I've been doing that since you know I was like ten years old. 
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm thirty three now -- so that was my --
L:  I'm thirty three too.
R:  Oh, wow -- and you're going to school? 
L:  Yes I'm going back to school after many years in advertising I've decided to become a midwife.  
R:  Oh, wow so it -- because like due to the fact of the job market was -- was -- 
L:  No, not really.  I just decided that I didn't want to try and make money anymore, I wanted to try and do service.  How lame is that.  [LAUGH]
R:  You want to do -- you wanted to do some good things in this world? 
L:  Right. 
R:  Wow that's very, um, ultra -- 
L:  I know -- I know it sounds like I can't even believe it's me. Um, --
R:  Well that's good, there's nothing wrong with that I -- I, um, -- I'm in Los Angeles to pursue acting, um, and, uh, to write for movies so, um, that's why I'm in -- in Los Angeles now. 
L:  That's funny.  I'm, uh, -- I'm in New York City. 
R:  Okay in like Manhattan or --
L:  Right -- right in the heart of Manhattan. 
R:  Oh, yeah I was, um, where abouts in Manhattan? 
L:  In the east village.
R:  East village?  Yeah [COUGH] -- yeah I was doing a [inaudible] for a couple of weeks, um, during, uh, -- I was a photographer's assistant.
L:  Right. 
R:  And, um, went did some [inaudible] East Village, um, but it's some Brazilian -- I can't remember the name --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well they had like [inaudible] and they had like 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, um, my -- my other place -- my friend lives on [inaudible]
L:  [NOISE] That's nice.
R:  [NOISE] Um.
L:  Oh, right so -- so --
R:  So when's like --
L:  -- my theory was -- my theory was that you would -- you would think differently about these topics depending on, you know what you do, so you think that like, um, -- um, -- over eating and not exercising would be worst and I bet you're not over weight either. 
R:  Right -- right.
L:  Um, and [NOISE] I don't know never mind [LAUGH] -- I was just trying to be good and talk about the topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right so how do you make the topic end?  Can you just go to the next topic and push the button --
L:  No you're supposed to talk about for ten minutes. 
R:  Oh, for ten minutes -- how long has it been? 
L:  Um, it's probably been four minutes.
R:  Oh, gees, um, -- well I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Fuck it's like -- it's enough -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean gossip whatever -- I -- I don't -- I can't talk about this topic anymore it's boring, um, -- it's just like what's up with -- who cares really but, um, --. 
L:  Come on tell me a gossip story.  Tell me a story about how gossiping got you in trouble. 
R:  Um, I [MN] -- I -- I don't like -- well I've heard things talked about me before that I didn't appreciate that I found out. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think that's not pleasant, but I usually don't gossip actually.  I don't -- I just kind of think -- I just don't find it that you know like interesting really, talking about other people, um, unless I was personally like someone personally had injured me in some, you know in some way then -- then I could say, "Oh, so and so they're blah blah blah, cause they had, um, [inaudible] or maybe you know [inaudible] my character or whatever" -- um, that would mean whatever might of happened and [COUGH] [inaudible] gossiping is you know I think it probably happens a lot at work because work -- the work environment is -- it's such a strange environment where you can't confront people as you could in other situations because --
L:  You also spend most of their time there. 
R:  You saying --
L:  What do you --
R:  -- you move your time -- yes.
L:  What do you to for work now? 
R:  Uh, this is it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I normally -- well work for a catering company, and --
L:   For what?  I'm sorry. 
R:  A catering company. 
L:  A catering company -- right. 
R:  And then I am -- that's my main source of income -- I was in unemployment and I get laid off about a year and couple of months ago and then I've been travelling around and then I basically just burnt through my savings and, uh, --
L:  Where in LA do you live? 
R:  In Silver Lake. 
L:  Oh, yes. 
R:  Oh, yes this lake yeah.
L:  It's like, you know the East Village of LA.  [LAUGH]
R:  It kind of might be sort of ish, east village --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah it is just a little trendy -- little like hip place to be.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But yeah I -- gossiping I mean yeah people at work and if there is someone does something like you can't confront --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these people, you have no choice except --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you have to like talk about it cause it's on your mind and so you gossip and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think it's bad -- I mean I think it's almost healthy because you have to talk about it with someone. 
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, so, um, smoking I don't see in -- you know -- 
L:  Do you smoke? 
R:  I occasionally -- I used to but now it's very rarely. 
L:  Only when you drink?

L:  Really.  [LAUGH]
R:  I went to see this band or this musician [inaudible]
L:  Sure. 
R:  But -- you know her?
L:  Yes I've seen her. 
R:  Oh, you've seen her?
L:  I saw her a long -- I mean I'm not that like pulling that like, "Oh, I saw her before she was" no not like that [LAUGH] but I saw her about two years ago maybe in [inaudible] a small club. 
R:  Yeah I saw her in San Francisco, about two years ago as well and, uh, --
L:  I think it was in her tour for the covers album -- I think it was 
R:  Which album?
L:  Covers -- like [inaudible]
R:  Yeah I can't remember now that the new one was, you are free or something -- it was -- it was a horror -- it was really like -- I didn't expect the concert to be that tame, so mellow, she didn't break out any of this -- you know how some of the songs like you are free -- or that kind of rocking to have like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of rock and I was like, "God, this is so, so, so mellow" and me and my friends just got really like drunk, we just kept drinking, cause we're like, "God, this is so boring".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How many drinks did you have? 
R:  Uh, --, um, probably like four big glasses of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Jim beam -- like straight on the rocks and before that I suppose there was like four beers before that, with in a short period of time. 
L:  And --
R:  It was reckless. 
L:  [LAUGH] Reckless.
R:  Drinking was a reckless abandon.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then st- -- I was in the concert over the weekend called [inaudible] you know there is this big like concert in the desert with like forty bands and --
L:  No I've never heard of that.
R:  Oh, they're probably recording our conversation -- I'm sure right --
L:  Well, oh, yeah.
R:  I'm not going to incriminate myself but there was a lot of partying going on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- previous this weekend -- previous and so I have been abusing myself lately [COUGH] because I -- I have too much free time basically -- probably you know.  Not enough responsibility, too much freedom, you know what they say about i- idle hands. 
L:  That's right.
R:  Yes [COUGH] and yourself you -- okay you're going to be a midwife -- that's really -- you're probably going to move like up state.
