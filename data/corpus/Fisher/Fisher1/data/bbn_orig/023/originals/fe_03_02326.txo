L:  -- um, migraines, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, some, uh, allergies.  Um, do you have any illnesses?
R:  No, actually I'm glad I don't.  I sometimes have, uh, problems with my skin, like I have acne.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.  I started when I was thirteen and I'm twenty three now and I still have it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's, um, it's not bothering me really.
L:  Ah.  My daughter in law has, uh, some things she's -- called Proactive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's wonderful.  It, uh, --
R:  Is it really working 'cause I saw it on TV and --
L:  It works -- it works wonderful.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, it's the best product I've ever seen in my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, she gets it through the mail.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it's a little bit expensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it clears up all of her problems.  Um, I've never seen anything work so wonderful in my life.  I mean it --
R:  Maybe I should try it.
L:  Yeah, I'd be --
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, beats like Clearasil or any of those type of products, but --
R:  [NOISE] So, what do you do, um, to take care of your illnesses?  I mean do you -- are you on medication or you -- do you try to watch your diet, or ...?
L:  Um, yes, I'm on medication.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I go to -- I have a few doctors, different doctors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a neurologist, um, uh, let's see --
R:  And, um, --
L:  -- a family physician.
R:  Okay, and what a-
L:  I try and watch my diet and --
R:  Like do you eat certain foods?  I mean do you try to eat a lot of vegetables, or fruit, or ...?
L:  Uh, I kind of watch my diet and try not to o- -- eat certain foods, uh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The allergies right now the po-, I live in Iowa so the pollen count's really high --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the dust is really bad here.  It's real dry here and dusty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm really, uh, suffering --
R:  You live in an industrial area or in, uh, more like the country?
L:  It's industrial.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so the dust has really been bothering me 'cause we have a lot of -- we have a lot of industry -- industrial areas like John Deere's and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of business places around and it's, uh, been real dry here.  I don't know where -- what area of the country you're from but it's pretty dry here and --
R:  I'm in LA.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I -- I live in LA --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I was raised in Chicago.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, my [LAUGH]
R:  But in LA I feel like my wellness is just getting better because of --
L:  I used to live in LA.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Mhm, yeah, you, uh, oh gosh, twenty, uh, thirty years ago .
R:  [NOISE] Oh, it's very like it's -- it's sunny so I feel that my mood is constantly, you know, like on the happier side and then --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- it seems that people work -- work out more like I try to work out, you know, two or three times a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's really good, I think, to stay well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then also, um, it seems that people watch their diet better here like they eat a lot of like low fat foods, um, fresh foods.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, yeah.  I lived there in seventy three [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and let's see I'm forty six now.
R:  And was your, um, w- were your illnesses better when you were in LA?
L:  I was so young then [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm forty six now, so I guess age has taken a little toll on -- for the illness part there.
R:  I think that's everybody.  I think, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as you get older it just happens.  Like, uh, my mum, she's, um, I think, forty eight or fifty.  I don't even -- no, fifty three actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm, and she, um, I can tell that she, um, is more tired, like she's not really ill but she needs more sleep and stress bothers her more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like you can't really put that much pressure on her.
L:  Mhm.  I've got arthritis of the neck, which came about -- I wondered what was wrong.  I kind a -- when I slept I'd wake up with some headaches and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's why I go to a neurologist, and I thought, "Well, gosh.  That was funny 'cause I've always been pretty healthy" but they said I had spurs of the neck.  I went to a chiropractor and I thought, "Well, I have to get my neck popped" and he said, "No, your neck has arthritis', and I thought that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm not that old to have arthritis but I do.
R:  No, it's just comes, you know, genetically.  Like I'm twenty three now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I have some bags under my eyes, and I've had them ever since I was like twelve --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, there's like in our genes.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I just put make-up over them so you can't see them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, that's usually something that happens to older people too.
L:  I have very bad bags under my eyes, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's genetically.  That's what the doctor told me.
L:  Yeah, my -- it runs in my family too.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And how do you think the seasonal change, um, affects your, um, wellness?  Do you think that, um, you know, especially the cold winters in Iowa affect your wellness or illnesses?
L:  I was healthier in LA.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Much healthier.  The winters were -- well, we had a mild winter this winter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When they're harsher, I'm sicker.  I'm, uh, they take their toll on my body, my skin --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my, uh, wellbeing.  I'm sick a lot more, more colds, more bronchial trouble --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, trouble breathing.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'll have to get an inhaler once in a while, which isn't good [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't like that very well, but I s- I'm a smoker.  I don't know if you are or not.  You're young and --
R:  No.
L:   -- hopefully you're not a smoker.  I am and that's not very good.
R:  Oh, you should quit that.  That's going to help --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your wellness a lot. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You should lea --
L:  I've been trying to slow way down -- I'm -- I'm going to be a gramma here soon, so I promised my children when the grandchild is -- it's going to be my first grandchild.  I'm going to quit smoking, so I've slowed way down, so I'm on the way to quit, so my grandchild is due the end of June, so I'm almost done with the smoking, so [LAUGH] I'm feeling a lot better so -- and I've been exercising, walking and trying to do, uh, crossstitching, and -- and that way my health is feeling better, and eating better, and eating a lot with the not smo- [LAUGH] with trying to slow down on smoking.  I've noticed that a lot, but, oh, yeah.  That sounds wonderful like you're in real good health, though.  That's wonderful.  Age has a lot to do with that.  It sounds like you take good care of yourself, though.  Yeah, my oldest son is thirty, my youngest is thirteen.  I have a big da- -- age difference throughout my children.  I have a twenty six year old and then a thirteen year old that'll be fourteen in June , so there's quite a ag- [LAUGH] quite a span there.  And my son, my oldest son is a staff sergeant in the army.  They live in North Carolina, so I'm going to go visit them in, see, in June, close to when the baby's due so that will be very nice.  The weather there is wonderful.  It's like California.  It's beautiful [LAUGH].  I'm anxious to go again [LAUGH].  I lived there for a couple of years and then moved back to Iowa so the weather there is just -- it's like a California again [LAUGH].  Do you watch -- how is the, er, fruit still, uh, plentiful there in California and ...? [NOISE] Ma'am?  Are you there?  Hello? [NOISE] Hello?  Hello?  Are you there?
