R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah, what's up?
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  So we have to talk --
L:  I'm --
R:  We have to talk about how we're -- how um we -- we handle --
L:  Seasons change --
R:  -- being ill with the uh change of the seasons?
L:  Right.
R:  All right.  So what do you do?
L:  What do I do?
R:  Yeah?  When you're -- when you're uh --
L:  I really don't do anything. Um, like in the -- whenever it really gets cold --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I'm usually fine, you know?  I'm -- I'm the kind of person that doesn't really get sick that often.
R:  Right.
L:  But when it starts to get warm, like right now --
R:  Right?
L:  -- um, I get really bad allergies.  
R:  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're getting --
L:  And get it, like --
R:  -- that right now, too.  
L:  Yeah.  So, I take -- I take allergies -- I think allergy uh medicine sometimes, but mostly somehow I just suffer through it, but it only happens right when the change starts.  So I mean, after about a week or two, I kind of adjust to it.
R:  Right after -- right after the big rain, right?
L:  The big rain?
R:  So that -- so that it rains a lot?  I know that after it rains for about a week, like on and off --
L:  Mm?
R:  -- constant rain, that everything starts to bloom, then you have a problem with the allergies?
L:  Ah, I never really thought about that.
R:  That's the -- yeah, that's when we get it the most.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, Claritin has over the counter now.
L:  Yeah, I just picked some up the other day.
R:  So you -- did you try it?
L:  It never worked.
R:  Did it work?
L:  Never worked.  No.  
R:  No?
L:  They say -- they say take one every twenty four hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm always tempted to take two of them, but they if you take two, then it'll make you real drowsy and you'll pass out.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they say that --
L:  Don't like that --
R:  -- if that doesn't work, then you should try to get a prescription.  But I never liked Claritin.  I tried it.  I never liked it.  I like Zortec.
L:  I'm not -- I'm not the type to take pills too often. 
R:  So --
L:  The only pills I like to take are vitamins and I don't like to take pills or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that.
R:  Well, when I feel like -- when I feel like I'm coming down with a cold, I usually take zinc.  
L:  Zinc?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So what does -- what -- what's zinc supposed to do?
R:  Zinc's supposed to -- it's supposed to do something to your immune system.
L:  Right?
R:  But I find whenever I'm getting sick, if I take a zinc supplement, it um --
L:  Right?
R:  -- it cuts down -- if I do catch a cold, it cuts down the length of it. 
L:  Right.
R:  Or I'll take a um -- like, the stress tab vitamin, that have the --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- B complex and the C and the zinc.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And usually that helps too, so --
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I guess I'm -- I'm pretty [inaudible] if I just -- I just let it take its course.  Actually -- I actually got really sick um -- there's this, like, cold virus going around.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  About a week ago, and I got sick --
R:  Oh, I got that, too.
L:  -- for the first time in my life, and um, I didn't really take anything.  I actually had to go to the doctor and get some antibiotics.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And that's the first time I've really had to do something like that.  So hopefully --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- that doesn't happen again.
R:  How long did it last?
L:  Mm, I mean, about two or three days.
R:  Really?
L:  I have to take the pills for -- for ten days, though.  
R:  I had a um -- I had a virus, a cold, a couple of weeks ago.  It lasted about two weeks.  It went into bronchitis.  It was nasty.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was a nasty cold.  
L:  You see, I don't -- I don't -- I don't want to get used to, is taking pills.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you know, you -- your system builds up an immunity to them.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  And -- and the virus also, like, in terms of uh, like, it's a population wide scale --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and I've read things about uh, germs and viruses, getting immunity to the different antibiotics because they use them so much, like there's this little tuberculosis strain out right now.
R:  Oh, is there?
L:  It's supposed to be -- it's supposed to be like a new strain that -- that mutated because, you know, tuberculosis is so heavily -- like, there's so many sorts and things against it that just -- it mutated.  And just --
R:  Well, isn't also because of --
L:  -- pick out --
R:  -- people, they don't take the antibiotics like they're supposed to?  
L:  No, the problem is that they're taking anti- antibiotics too much.
R:  Yeah.  For every little --
L:  Like --
R:  -- thing?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Like, people --
R:  Every time you have a little cold --
L:  -- get a sniffle and they -- and they get a prescription and eventually, like, the body doesn't respond well to the prescription any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that they just -- antibiotics and all different types of things like that.
R:  Yeah.  This is -- this SARS thing is pretty scary, too.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I thought I might of had SARS 'cause I was --
R:  Really?
L:  No, I was getting sick.
R:  Did you go to the -- did you --
L:  Right around the -- the whole SARS thing.  No, but um, SARS is pretty serious.
R:  Did you go to the doctor about it?
L:  Yeah, this is -- this is the sickness that I was talking about.
R:  And he ruled it out, right?
L:  Just like with your cold.  Yeah, just like with your cold, but I asked the doctor if it was SARS, and she laughed at me.  
R:  Yeah?
L:  She said if it was SARS, you'd be coughing up blood.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I didn't know that.  
L:  Yeah -- yeah, SARS is pretty serious.
R:  I thought that -- well, they said that you have -- that you can't -- you have a hard time breathing?
L:  Yeah --
R:  But I don't know that you coughed up blood.
L:  Yeah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, you know --
R:  Well, if they -- yeah, if -- well, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what else do we have to talk about now, about the -- something -- they gave you three --
L:  I don't know.  Yeah.  They gave us three topics, but --
R:  I couldn't hear the third one.
L:  -- all I can remember is the illness and what do you do when you're coming down with a cold, and that's about it.  I mean, that's all I can remember.  But I mean, I guess we can talk this topic to death. 
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's right.  [LAUGH].
L:  But --
R:  I guess so.
L:  Actually, for -- I -- I feel good about not really having to, um, worry about illness.
R:  Yeah?
L:  But at the same time, it kinda scares me because I -- you know, I'm -- I just kinda -- I just feel like everyone always deals with serious sickness --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at some point in their life.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I'm thinking, like, maybe I'm just getting bad habits now because I don't go to the doctor at all.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't worry about that, so when I get older and it should be, like, a regular routine.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Like, you should go for checkups every six months and you know, like prostate cancer and colon cancer --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and all that type of stuff?  I've just -- I'll be in the habit of not going and it's gonna end up catching up to me.
R:  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's nature's way of getting you ready for that, right?  Things start breaking down.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I gotta get in the habit of going to the doctor, even though I don't think I need to.  
R:  Well, you should anyway, just for a check up, right?
L:  Yeah, but what good is a check up?  
R:  If there's nothing --
L:  You know?
R:  -- wrong with you?  [LAUGH].
L:  But -- but you know something was wrong with you.  Like, if -- if something was wrong with me, then I'd go, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know people who go get check ups just because, you know, "It's six months, I'm going to get a check up".
R:  See, I think when you do, then sometimes they find things that are wrong with you.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Like, they look for things.
L:  I'm pretty skeptical of the whole medical field myself.
R:  Are you?
L:  Like -- yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm thinking right now?
R:  What?
L:  I'm thinking to study, is probably about how people can't stay on topic.
R:  You're probably right.
L:  No, it just -- it just occurred to me --
R:  You think so?
L:  -- because they give people these topics and they give them ten minutes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- bu- but once you talk about everything you really know about a topic, you're not gonna repeat yourself, you're just gonna talk about something else.
R:  Talk about something else, right?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's a very interesting study.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause you know, these studies that, they usually don't tell the people what they're really studying.
R:  No, 'course not.
L:  They'll tell you, yeah, we're studying this, but they're really studying something else and --
R:  It could be something totally different, huh?
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Right, 'cause we talk about who you -- when you're uncomfortable, you talk about something different.
L:  They could be counting the words that people use, see how many times we --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- repeat a word.  Yeah, it could be something crazy like that, you never know.
R:  Counting the words?  Could be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It could be.
L:  How many times did we say "there"?  How many times did we say, "did" --
R:  "Cold".
L:  I think just -- I don't know, crazy stuff.
R:  How many times we say "cold".  How long are we supposed to stay on for?  Ten minutes?
L:  Ten minutes.  I don't know if this was a ten minutes or -- was it -- I'm sure -- I'm sure that -- I'm sure they're gonna tell us.  In fact, I'm in front of my computer so as we talk, I'll just go back to the website and see what the instructions say.    
R:  Do we have to just -- I -- I would -- I would think that they would break in.  
L:  Yeah, they probably will.  Yeah, you know what?  They probably will because --
R:  Because they're recording everything right now.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  But speaking of illness, [LAUGH] um -- yeah, that's about all I do.  I don't really pay attention to any of that crappy[?] stuff.  I just --
R:  No.  Wash your hands a lot?  
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah, I don't -- yeah, I try -- I try to do that.  I try to do that at work.  Uh, I don't know, I'm the kinda person -- I had chicken pox when I was young and that's about it, so --
R:  I had chicken pox two years ago.  
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Awful.  
L:  Wow.  So -- so you never had it when you were younger?
R:  My kids -- well, my kids were vaccinated and my -- my son's friends came down with it and I didn't know about it, and um, I had found out about two days later when he was already broke out, so I'm thinking, oh, I've never been vaccinated, what am I going to do?
L:  Mm.
R:  So I called the doctor and they said, "Well, you actually have to wait, like a week or two, to see if you come down with it" and that they can give you a serum, like almost like an anti serum to just like help counteract it.
L:  Right?
R:  And ended up by -- I came down with it.
L:  Mm.
R:  So when I went to the doctor, they said, "Well, why didn't you tell us ahead of time?"  I said, "Well, I did tell you".  They said, "Well, we could have given you something two weeks ago.  Reception didn't give me the right information.
L:  Right.
R:  So now I had to suffer with the chicken pox.
L:  Wow.
R:  And that was bad. 
L:  How'd it feel?  I mean, like --
R:  It's awful.  
L:  It's just like really itchy all the time?
R:  Oh, it was horrible.  It was, like, mosquito bites all over your body.
L:  Wow --
