R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hello, this is Michael.
R:  Hi, Michael.  This is Camilla.  I --
L:  How you doing tonight?
R:  Good.  I actually go by Penny.  That's the nickname.
L:  Oh, okay, right.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, Michael, so there -- did -- I was wondering what topic we got?  Illness?
L:  Illness, uh-huh.  Yes, they're talking about, um, the common cold, I guess.  They said if you --
R:  Have you had one recently?
L:  Uh, no, not really.  Have you had one?
R:  I -- I came down with something.  I was in Lawson with my husband at a golf tournament and -- and um, came back with a stuffy nose and a sore throat and weakness.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  But got over it.  Got over it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But rest always does me well.
L:  Oh, really?  I had a sore throat this afternoon and I don't know if it's the beginning of a cold or what it is, but I take what they call Olive Leaf.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Which is basically a -- uh, some kind of vitamin and it cures me like -- I take it every day and so it keeps a lot of the common colds away from me.  'Cause I had a boss, I was doing some taxes during the tax season and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- he was like coughing all the time and sneezing and like he wasn't covering his mouth and he was spreading germs --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I -- I didn't get sick at all.
R:  Oh.  Where --
L:  So --
R:  -- do you -- do you buy that at a uh, vitamin store or --
L:  We get it through, like, the vitamin shop, through -- through a mail order catalogue.
R:  Oh.  How did you hear about it?
L:  Ah, my mother does a lot of research on health food stuff and things like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I guess she read about it someplace.
R:  Mm.  M- my --
L:  But, um, I been taking it probably about two years now.
R:  Oh, gee, that's amazing.
L:  Yeah, and my -- and um, my um brother has four children, like all under the age of, like, seven, and um --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- they were not taking and they just started probably about a month or so ago and he said that his youngest boy who was -- had all this red face and everything, it all cleared up, like, within a week of when he started taking it.
R:  What is it, a liquid form or --
L:  No, it's a capsule form.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's called Olive Leaf.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's um -- that's interesting.  I haven't heard of that.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.
R:  Well, my mother's, um, cure for the common cold is, uh, zinc lozenges. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and that's, uh, upon getting the first sign of a cold, that's what she takes and sends to us and that seems to work as well, so --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  Wha-
R:  But uh --
L:  What is it, a -- a vitamin pill or is it a --
R:  It's -- it's almost like a um -- oh, like a tum- like, that type of uh thing, you suck on it and it uh --
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.
R:  But it has the zinc in it and that's supposed to work.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then, my daughter on the east coast, when colds come up there, which they've had the winter snows --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she makes the homemade uh, chicken soup and that seems to be a -- a remedy that has always worked.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That helps for us, too.  I -- I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Chicken soup goes way back.
L:  Yes, they say.  I haven't had any chicken soup in a while, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't usually take it when I get sick either.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, why, do -- do you still use chicken soup or --
R:  I have.  I -- I -- if I've had a cold and it seems to persist --
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I've done that, made up some, uh, homemade chicken soup and it seems to go away.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  But um, otherwise, if I tell my mother and speak to her --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- she'll send me the lozenges, but for me it's always rest.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and I've just uh -- if I feel I'm coming down with something, I'll just go to bed early and uh -- uh, sleep what I can and -- and mine seems to be -- go away.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.  Well, I had a boss, used to tell us to take, um, if you had a sore throat, to um, um, lemon juice and vinegar.  Lemon juice -- I'm sorry, lemon juice and honey.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you would -- you would boil that up in water.  And it would supposedly uh take away --
R:  How interesting.
L:  -- to cl- to clear your sore throat.  She was back from the depression era, so --
R:  Sure.
L:  Uh, I guess --
R:  Did -- do you believe what, uh, they asked us, that uh, that the seven days about the uh length for a cold to persist?
L:  No, I don't think it lasts that long.  Usually I'd say like three or four days.
R:  That's what I would say, too.  I would say that something longer than that, it's probably some form of a virus.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And then what about -- do you go to a doctor if you have a cold or --
R:  No, do you?
L:  No, uh, no.  I don't --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- hardly ever go to a doctor.
R:  You only go there when you really have to.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm afraid to -- afraid to go see them, but --
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  Uh-huh, 'cause they --
R:  How -- what an interesting, uh, theme, just to bring up on illness, which uh I was just watching TV on the SARS --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is similar, not to the uh common cold, but I guess more to the flu.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It is a form of illness, but um, it's said they had three symptoms, and I guess that was having a temperature over a hundred and -- and um --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  God, I can't remember what the other things were.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh, you --
R:  I guess the -- the body, the body feeling real weak and tired and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Well --
R:  Anyway, I --
L:  Luck -- luck -- luckily it hasn't hit our country yet.
R:  No.
L:  So -- yeah.
R:  No, although they -- I was listening tonight and they said something about uh Coachella[?] there is a gentleman -- a young uh man in his twenties that had visited China, but came back uh very ill and he's in quarantine in his own home for ten days.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where's he live?  In -- in America?
R:  Coachella, Coachella, yeah, in uh -- somewhere I guess past San Diego, down that way.  I -- I don't really --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- know where Coachella is.
L:  Oh, well, no, no.  They -- they say Toronto's pretty bad and they were giving out warnings to the baseball players up there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  About uh the -- about they said if you sign autographs, make sure you have your -- your same um -- use your pen and don't use a pen from the fans 'cause of the contacts with the germs on the pen.
R:  Mm.
L:  And um basically they -- I guess they're basically saying, like, in the airports, to try and keep your mouth covered and stuff like that so you don't pick up germs that way.
R:  Mm.
L:  And uh -- but I guess one of the ways to prevent a cold is to wash your hands, like, before you eat and everything.
R:  Yeah, that's what they say --
L:  And --
R:  -- wash your hands frequently.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, is probably one of the best.
L:  Uh-huh.  And don't put your hands on your face, 'cause that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that's where they say, like, most of the germs are in the mouth.
R:  Yeah, isn't that --
L:  And that --
R:  -- interesting?  They say don't touch your eyes or your mouth.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've heard that.  When you think of it, that's our -- our whole system there with the nose, the mouth and the uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- eyes, it's all connected so why not?
L:  Yeah, I know, yeah.  'Cause -- 'cause I guess, um, once you touch -- if you have dirty hands and you touch your food and -- and everything, then you eat the food, it's in your body.  
R:  Well, sure.  When you think about it, how much germs are on our hands, what we touch --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all day long?  You know?
L:  No, I know, yeah.  Like, just different -- like, even at work, just papers that everybody passes around the office and things like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Definitely.  
L:  Or that --
R:  Yeah, or even if you go to the grocery store, anywhere you go, if you think about it you're touching things that other people have touched.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Not that that's uh -- you know, I'm not that kind of a -- a nut, really.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I just -- but I do wash my hands a lot.  I -- I work at a -- uh, volunteering with cancer patients --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  
R:  -- and they tell you to wash your hands very, very often, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that's how -- to teach me, anyway, even more than I would normally do.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, my mother always told us when we were little to wash our hands all the time before we ate and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that, so I guess we basically washed them at least three times a day back then, and um, usually now I wash -- I got away from washing my hands before lunch, for -- for a while, but now I start -- I started doing it again.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  'Cause -- yeah.  'Cause -- well, I work with a company called Hemophilia[?] Health Services and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um one of the things I do, as I touch um -- um, medicine that people have sent back that's expired and stuff like that, so it's been in their homes --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and everything. 
R:  -- boy.  Yes.
L:  So, um, so there's a lot of germs --
R:  Boy, you --
L:  -- on that.
R:  You really do.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you really do. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'm retired so I -- I just do mostly volunteer work and that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- minus with the uh cancer patients, but yes, so we both are in areas where uh --
L:  Uh-huh.  There's --
R:  -- there could be contami- contamination and stuff.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Yeah.  Do they have pro techniques at the cancer place?
R:  Ah, other than they tell you to wash your hands all the time, you know?  We -- um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with my work, I'm just making sure they're comfortable, giving them blankets or food or juice or giving them lunch, really, that's the food --
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, just basically making sure they comfortable and talking with them and it's a very fragile time in their life --
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- anyway, so um, I'm just -- 
L:  So --
R:  Try to make light of -- light of the day and the situation as much as possible.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  But, jeeze, how interesting.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're all -- we're all in the health profession, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that was interesting that we got connected.  What uh city are you in, or where --
L:  Ah, Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'm in um Cathedral City, uh, California.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.
R:  Boy, we really -- they really --
L:  Uh-huh.  How -- how did you find out about the program?
R:  Um, my girlfriend from Hawaii, um --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- uh, just got on.  In fact, she's been doing it three or four times and --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  Yeah, and in fact, I have to tell them, um, one Tuesday -- next Tuesday I'm not going to be here, so I didn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  Usually I'm always here, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just this [inaudible].  Is this the first time for you, Michael?
L:  This is my first time, yeah.  They -- I saw them advertising in the local paper here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And um they were, like, call this number or check out their website.  After I call them, um, the guy just told me -- well, basically they told you everything he told me in the little ad they had in the newspaper.
R:  Mhm --
