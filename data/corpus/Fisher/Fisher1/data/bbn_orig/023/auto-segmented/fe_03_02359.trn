THEY'RE TRYING TO EN- ENACT ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS PASSED OR NOT  (fe_03_02359-B-0022)

BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WHO DRINKS IS AN ALCOHOLIC WHO IS ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL BUT EVERYBODY WHO SMOKES IS AN ADDICT TO NICOTINE  (fe_03_02359-B-0031)

NO SMOKING AT ALL  (fe_03_02359-B-0063)
HOSPITAL  (fe_03_02359-B-0064)
AND [LAUGHTER] I'VE OFTEN SAID THE ONLY REASON THAT SMOKERS GET PNEUMONIA IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE AND SMOKE  (fe_03_02359-B-0065)
WOW  (fe_03_02359-B-0066)
NOW DO THE PATIENTS GO DOWN THERE AND SMOKE  (fe_03_02359-B-0067)
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES SOME OF OUR PATIENTS WILL ACTUALLY GO IN THEIR BATHROBES  (fe_03_02359-B-0068)
OUTSIDE  (fe_03_02359-B-0069)
AND YOU C- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL YOU HAVE TO GO IT'S LIKE ALMOST ACROSS THE STREET  (fe_03_02359-B-0070)
ACROSS THE CIRCLE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT AND THEY ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE ANY PLACE IN  (fe_03_02359-B-0071)
