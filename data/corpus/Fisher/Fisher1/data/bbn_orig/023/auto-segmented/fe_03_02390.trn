NOT EXERCISING  (fe_03_02390-A-0005)
AH WHAT ELSE WAS THERE THERE  (fe_03_02390-A-0006)
OKAY  (fe_03_02390-A-0007)
ALL RIGHT WELL I OKAY THEN I GUESS WE'VE GOT THREE SMOKING  (fe_03_02390-A-0008)
ALCOHOL OR NOT EXERCISING W- WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH IS WORSE  (fe_03_02390-A-0009)
RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS YEAH MODERN MEDICINE SAYS THAT AN OCCASIONAL DRINK OF AH SO MANY OUNCES OF AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0010)
OR WINE  (fe_03_02390-A-0012)
IS GOOD FOR YOU  (fe_03_02390-A-0013)
AND OF COURSE AH THE EXTENSION OF THAT IS AL- ALCOHOLISM WHICH IS IS AH EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL UM PROBABLY WOULD YOU AGREE MORE DETRIMENTAL THAN AH SMOKING  (fe_03_02390-A-0014)
ALTHOUGH LUNG CANCER [LAUGHTER] AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0015)
IS IS PROBABLY WORSE THAN ALCOHOLISM WHICH EVENTUALLY EFFECTS THE AH THE AH LIVER YEAH SO  (fe_03_02390-A-0016)
AH AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AH DIE OF LIVER UM UM WHATEVER IT IS  (fe_03_02390-A-0017)
WELL OKAY IN  (fe_03_02390-A-0019)
IN TALKING ABOUT HABITS UM DID YOU EVER SMOKE  (fe_03_02390-A-0020)
YEAH WELL I SMOKED FOR YEARS AND I SPENT MANY YEARS TRYING TO QUIT IN FACT I SAY SOMEWHAT FACETIOUSLY ANDREW I'M A EXPERT ON QUITTING BECAUSE I QUIT SO MANY TIMES BEFORE I FINALLY MADE IT  (fe_03_02390-A-0021)
AND AH IT WAS THE HARDEST THING I EVER HAD TO DO OF COURSE I'VE NEVER BEEN AN ALCOHOLIC YOU SEE  (fe_03_02390-A-0022)
SO I GUESS AH I COULDN'T MAKE A COMPARISON THERE UM  (fe_03_02390-A-0023)
WHEN I DRINK IT ISN'T AH HABIT FORMING AT ALL FOR ME AH WHILE I KNOW THAT NICOTINE WAS  (fe_03_02390-A-0024)
AND AH WELL WE MAY AS WELL TOUCH ON THE DO YOU EXERCISE I DO EVERY DAY  (fe_03_02390-A-0025)
OH  (fe_03_02390-A-0026)
AH HUH WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW FAST YOU'RE WALKING BECAUSE Y- Y- THE OBJECT THERE IS TO GET AEROBIC  (fe_03_02390-A-0027)
AND UNLESS YOU'RE HUFFING AND PUFFING UM THAT'S NOT REALLY EXERCISE IT'S SORT OF LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT TENNIS IS EXERCISE WHEN IT REALLY ISN'T BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY STOPS AND STARTS  (fe_03_02390-A-0028)
IN THE GAME SO YOUR HEART RATE GOES BACK TO A MORE NORMAL AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0029)
PACE WHEN YOU'RE SAY AT THE NET PLAYING DOUBLES OR WAITING FOR THE OTHER PERSON TO SERVE OR WHATEVER THERE'S THERE'S QUITE A FEW RESPITES AND AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0030)
TO GET REALLY THE BENEFIT OF EXERCISE YOU HAVE TO STAY AT A HIGHER LEVEL FOR A A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME AND AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0031)
LIKE IF YOU'RE WALKING IN A CITY YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A STOP LIGHT OR SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD AH SOMEWHAT RUIN THE BENEFIT OF THE EXERCISE  (fe_03_02390-A-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_02390-A-0033)
UM 'COURSE IT AH I PUT WEIGHTS ON MY ANKLES AND I CARRY WEIGHTS IN MY HANDS WHEN I AH POWER WALK  (fe_03_02390-A-0034)
POWER WALK IS JUST THROWING YOUR ARMS UP AND REALLY LET'S SAY GOING AS FAST AS YOU CAN WALK  (fe_03_02390-A-0035)
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE  (fe_03_02390-A-0036)
I HAD A A GOOD FRIEND EXPLAIN TO ME A A MINISTER FRIEND OF MINE WHO SAID  (fe_03_02390-A-0037)
AH HE HAD TO QUIT RUNNING AND AH I KIND OF TEASED HIM ABOUT THAT AND HE SAID NO WAIT A MINUTE HE SAID WHY DON'T YOU TRY SPEED WALKING AND I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN POWER WALKING AND HE SAID TRY TO WALK AS FAST AS YOU CAN  (fe_03_02390-A-0038)
AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE HUMAN BODY AS A MACHINE IS MORE EFFICIENT AT RUNNING THAN IT IS AT WALKING FAST AND SO YOU STRESS THE BODY MORE BY AH WALKING AS FAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN  (fe_03_02390-A-0039)
IS IS HARDER ON THE BODY THAN IT IS RUNNING  (fe_03_02390-A-0040)
SO AH IT'S THE WAY THE MACHINE WAS BUILT SO [LAUGHTER] I I WENT INTO WALKING BECAUSE THERE IS LESS POUNDING AH ON THE TOTAL BODY  (fe_03_02390-A-0041)
SKELETON WHEN AH YOUR NOT RUNNING AND BEING SEVENTY TWO YEARS OLD WHY AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0042)
YOU REACH A POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO PROTECT SOME OF THOSE THINGS  (fe_03_02390-A-0043)

AH RECOVERY TIME WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING YOU HURT A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S JUST PRETTY STANDARD AH THERE'S THERE'S NEVER A REAL PANACEA OF OF  (fe_03_02390-A-0045)
TIME TO EXERCISE  (fe_03_02390-A-0046)

HAVE TO PUT AN INPUT IN IN ORDER TO HAVE  (fe_03_02390-A-0056)
THE LATER YEARS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02390-A-0057)

AH WHICH YOU CAN BUY AT ANY HEALTH FOOD STORE AND YOU START REALIZING THAT AH AH CERTAIN TYPES OF OILS THAT YOU USE AND CAN TAKE AND AH IF YOU GET ON A GOOD OMEGA THREE OIL  (fe_03_02390-A-0060)
AND IF YOU TAKE C. O. TWO TEN AND DON'T SMOKE TOO MUCH AND AND GET EXERCISE EVERY DAY YOU CAN PROBABLY TAKE THAT THAT EXPECTANCY OF LIFE MAYBE TO SIXTY SIXTY FIVE OR BETTER  (fe_03_02390-A-0061)
THERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO TOO YOU CAN GET A BOOK ON CAYENNE PEPPER AND IF YOU WERE TO TAKE CAYENNE PEPPER EVERY DAY IT WOULD KEEP THE WHOLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM  (fe_03_02390-A-0062)
IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE EASIER ON THE HEART NO HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LIVE  (fe_03_02390-A-0063)

AND IT'S WELL WORTH IT DEPENDING ON ON HOW YOU VALUE LIFE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02390-A-0067)
A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T CARE AH AND LIFE DOESN'T MEAN THAT MUCH TO THEM AND AH SO THEY SAY OH WELL I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER THING AND NOT LOOK AT THE LONG RANGE PICTURE  (fe_03_02390-A-0068)
LOOKING AT THE LONG RANGE PICTURE AH DOING SOMETHING WITH A DISCIPLINE TO IT EVERY DAY  (fe_03_02390-A-0070)
ONLY IS GOING TO EMBELLISH ALL THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE STUDY OR  (fe_03_02390-A-0071)
UM IF YOU HAVE TO GO IN THE MILITARY THERE'S A CERTAIN DISCIPLINE THERE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AND AH  (fe_03_02390-A-0072)
AH THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY MISSING AH IN MOST YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY IS A SENSE OF DISCIPLINE  (fe_03_02390-A-0073)
