OH HI  (fe_03_02369-B-0003)
UM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT PERSONAL HABITS AND WHAT WE THINK IS THE WORST  (fe_03_02369-B-0004)
DO YOU WANNA GO FIRST  (fe_03_02369-B-0005)
YOU KNOW WHAT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU I THE I FIRST I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE I THOUGHT MAYBE WAS GOSSIPING  (fe_03_02369-B-0006)
BUT THEN THEY WENT INTO SMOKING AND I KNOW PERSONALLY I THINK BECAUSE I MYSELF PARTICIPATED IN A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT PERSONAL HABITS THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SO FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I THINK I'VE DONE ALL OF THEM  (fe_03_02369-B-0007)
UM AND I MYSELF QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES TWO YEARS AGO  (fe_03_02369-B-0008)
AND UM I THINK THAT IT IS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ADDICTION BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS SUBSTANCES TO QUIT  (fe_03_02369-B-0009)
UM NUMBER TWO IT NOT ONLY AFFECTS YOUR ENTIRE PHYSICAL HEALTH I MEAN IT AFFECTS YOUR LUNGS IT AFFECTS  (fe_03_02369-B-0010)
YOUR HEART IT AFFECTS UM IN YOUR THROAT IT AFFECTS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR BODY UM I THINK IT ALSO AFFECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU  (fe_03_02369-B-0011)
UM IT AFFECTS YOUR FAMILY  (fe_03_02369-B-0012)
UM IT AFFECTS YOU KNOW JUST STRANGERS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT AFFECTS THEM I THINK IT AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF SMOG THAT WE HAVE THE AIR AND THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE  (fe_03_02369-B-0013)
SO JUST IN THAT REGARD I THINK IT'S JUST A REALLY DANGEROUS THING TO HAVE OUT THERE AND I THINK BECAUSE SOCIETY PRETTY MUCH UM  (fe_03_02369-B-0014)
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL OR IT'S YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S BANS OUT THERE BUT YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH ALLOWED TO DO IT PRETTY FREELY STILL I THINK IT'S STILL LIKE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF THAT AS WELL  (fe_03_02369-B-0015)

YES  (fe_03_02369-B-0017)
DON'T YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN'T I CANNOT BELIEVE MYSELF I STARTED SMOKING WHEN I WAS AGE ELEVEN AND I'M TWENTY SEVEN NOW YEAH I IT'S CRAZY BUT IT  (fe_03_02369-B-0018)
IT WAS I I TRIED STOPPING ABOUT A MILLION TIMES  (fe_03_02369-B-0019)
AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP I STARTED STOPPING WHEN I WAS LIKE SIXTEEN AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP FOR A YEAR AT A TIME SO I HAD W- I HAVE I HAVE REALLY GOOD WILLPOWER  (fe_03_02369-B-0020)
SO I'M ABLE TO STOP AT A YEAR AT A TIME BUT THEN I W- THERE WAS SOMETHING STRESSFUL WOULD HAPPEN IN MY LIFE LIKE A DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER OR EXAMS AT SCHOOL OR SOMETHING AND I WOULD JUST GO BACK  (fe_03_02369-B-0021)
BUT UM THE THING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IS I NEVER UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE OF MY YOUTHFUL AGE THE ACTUAL LIKE TOXICITY OF WHAT IT WAS DOING TO MY BODY UNTIL I STARTED GETTING REALLY TERRIBLE HEADACHES AND MIGRAINES  (fe_03_02369-B-0022)
AND IT GOT SO BAD THAT I STARTED HAVING HEADACHES AND MIGRAINES EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE  (fe_03_02369-B-0023)
AND I FINALLY WENT IN AND CHECKED MYSELF INTO THIS HEADACHE CLINIC AND THEY TOLD ME RIGHT AWAY LIKE YOU HAVE TO STOP SMOKING  (fe_03_02369-B-0024)
AND THEY'VE ISOLATED ME IN AN ENVIRONMENT FOR TWO WEEKS AND I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GO CRAZY [LAUGHTER] AND UM BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS MY HEADACHES WENT AWAY  (fe_03_02369-B-0025)
AND SO I SAW LIKE A VERY DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN STOPPING SMOKING AND MY HEADACHES  (fe_03_02369-B-0026)
SO I KINDA DID AN EXPERIMENT AND I WAS ABLE TO THROUGH SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING LIKE STOP SMOKING  (fe_03_02369-B-0027)
AND I HAD A LAPSE WHERE LIKE AT LIKE SIX MONTHS LATER I FINALLY GOT A CIGARETTE HOLD OF A CIGARETTE AND I SMOKED AND I HAD LIKE THE WORST MIGRAINE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE  (fe_03_02369-B-0028)
AND SO EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE LIKE THAT WAS TWO TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO I I STOPPED SMOKING AFTER THAT BECAUSE LIKE THE MIGRAINE WAS THE WORST I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE I COULDN'T SEE I COULDN'T WALK  (fe_03_02369-B-0029)
AND I JUST THOUGHT OH MY GOD THIS IS REALLY WHAT I'M DOING TO MYSELF AND IT JUST IT LOST ITS ALLURE ENTIRELY  (fe_03_02369-B-0030)
YES  (fe_03_02369-B-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02369-B-0033)
AND DON'T YOU THINK LIKE PE- A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WHO SMOKE I THINK A LOT OF THE OTHER BEHAVIORS THAT WE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE NOT EXERCISING  (fe_03_02369-B-0034)
AND THE NOT EATING RIGHT AND THE GOSSIPING I THINK A LOT OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING IT WITH GO ALONG WITH THE SMOKING  (fe_03_02369-B-0035)
DON'T YOU THINK  (fe_03_02369-B-0036)
DON'T YOU THINK YES  (fe_03_02369-B-0037)
'CAUSE I MEAN I'M I'M ALSO LIKE A PRE LICENSED THERAPIST AND THERE'S THIS WHOLE LIKE THING ABOUT ORAL FIXATION  (fe_03_02369-B-0038)
THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND LIKE UM ABOUT SATISFYING YOUR URGES THROUGH YOUR MOUTH IT GOES BACK TO LIKE BEING A BABY AND WHEN YOU'RE A BABY LIKE YOUR LEARN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND SOMEHOW WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER LIKE YOU DIDN'T SATISFY THOSE URGES ENOUGH WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER  (fe_03_02369-B-0039)

WELL 'CAUSE THEN I KNOW RIGHT NOW I MEAN IT'S PART OF MY LIFE WHERE I'M REALLY INTO FITNESS SO I THOUGHT WELL NOT EXERCISING YOU KNOW THAT'S TERRIBLE TOO  (fe_03_02369-B-0046)
'CAUSE YOU KNOW NOT EXERCISING I THINK REALLY CONTRIBUTES TO A LOT OF LIKE DEPRESSION AND UM LOW BODY IMAGE AND LOW SELF ESTEEM I THINK BUT  (fe_03_02369-B-0047)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02369-B-0048)

BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY EVERYONE THAT'S THE BIG THING THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG THINGS ESPECIALLY AS A WOMAN WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO QUIT SMOKING WAS BECAUSE EVERYONE TOLD ME  (fe_03_02369-B-0052)
AS SOON AS YOU QUIT SMOKING YOU'RE GONNA GAIN TEN POUNDS BECAUSE IT'S THAT YOU HAVE THAT SAME ORAL FIXATION AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO YOU JUST INSTEAD OF SMOKING YOU'RE STILL NERVOUS YOU WANNA FEED YOUR FACE WITH SOMETHING  (fe_03_02369-B-0053)
AND YOU START EATING AND SO MY DOCTORS TOLD ME WELL OKAY YEAH THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IS EITHER CHEW GUM OR SOMETHING OR YOU EXERCISE INSTEAD WITH THAT NERVOUSNESS  (fe_03_02369-B-0054)
