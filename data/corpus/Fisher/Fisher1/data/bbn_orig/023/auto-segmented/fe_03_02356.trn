BUT IT IS ILLEGAL TO DRINK AND DRIVE SO AS FAR AS THE LEGAL ASPECT IS CONCERNED I WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO WITH  (fe_03_02356-A-0035)
ALCOHOL BUT SMOKING WOULD PROBABLY BE  (fe_03_02356-A-0036)
MY SECOND CHOICE  (fe_03_02356-A-0037)

HEALTH AT INCREASED RISK AND THAT WOULD POSSIBLY FURTHER DOWN THE LINE INCREASE EVERYONE'S HEALTH COST  (fe_03_02356-A-0052)
YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE ON AN H._M._O. OR YOU HAVE PERSONAL INSURANCE OR WHETHER YOU JUST WALK UP TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND PAY THAT INCREASES EVERYONE'S HEALTH COST  (fe_03_02356-A-0053)
