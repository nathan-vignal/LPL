HI  (fe_03_02388-A-0001)
HI JEAN I'M CHARLES  (fe_03_02388-A-0002)
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO START  (fe_03_02388-A-0004)
WELL I THINK THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT WHAT DO WE THINK IS WORSE  (fe_03_02388-A-0005)
YEAH I MIGHT I MIGHT AGREE WITH THAT ONLY BECAUSE SMOKING NOT ONLY AFFECTS YOURSELF BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU  (fe_03_02388-A-0009)
YEAH I WOULD BELIEVE IT I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO GO TO PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE SMOKING  (fe_03_02388-A-0010)
NO I  (fe_03_02388-A-0011)
I  (fe_03_02388-A-0012)
THAT'S OKAY  (fe_03_02388-A-0014)
NO  (fe_03_02388-A-0015)
I THINK  (fe_03_02388-A-0016)
IT MAYBE IT'S A TOURIST PLACE BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I THINK THAT YOU DON'T NEED SMOKING IN THE BUILDINGS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND SETTING DESIGNATED SMOKING AREAS IS APPROPRIATE AS LONG AS  (fe_03_02388-A-0017)
THEY'RE OUTSIDE AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW  (fe_03_02388-A-0018)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_02388-A-0020)
BUT DO YOU THINK THOSE DESIGNATED AREAS ARE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE EVEN IF IT IS A DESIGNATED AREA THE WHOLE BAR SMELLS LIKE SMOKE  (fe_03_02388-A-0029)
YEAH YEAH I I DON'T THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE ENOUGH JUST TO SAY ONE ROOM IS A SMOKING ROOM 'CAUSE THAT SMOKE IS JUST GOING TO GET ALL OVER THE PLACE  (fe_03_02388-A-0030)
AND IT'S ALSO NOT FAIR TO THE BAR TENDER AND TO THE WAIT STAFF WHO HAVE TO BE  (fe_03_02388-A-0031)
UM IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE SMOKE  (fe_03_02388-A-0032)
TW- YOU KNOW EIGHT HOURS A DAY  (fe_03_02388-A-0033)
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF STUCK YOU KNOW THEY WANNA SERVE AND THEY WANNA HELP EVERYONE BUT THEY'RE GOING TO END UP GETTING ALL THAT SMOKE SECOND HAND THAT THEY WOULDN'T GET OTHERWISE  (fe_03_02388-A-0034)
AND CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY A SMOKE FREE FOR CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_02388-A-0035)
AND THEY'VE BEEN THAT WAY FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW  (fe_03_02388-A-0036)
AND EVERY TIME I I GO THERE I LOVE IT I MEAN IT'S JUST NICE NOT TO SMELL LIKE SMOKE AT THE END OF THE NIGHT  (fe_03_02388-A-0037)
NO  (fe_03_02388-A-0038)
AH WHEN I GO TO CLUBS IN DALLAS AND OH ARIZONA Y- YOU LEAVE AND YOU'RE  (fe_03_02388-A-0039)
YOU SMELL LIKE SMOKE AND YOU NEVER SMOKED I MEAN IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THE SMOKE IS SO STRONG AND ESPECIALLY IN A CLUB ENVIRONMENT THAT IT JUST GETS INTO YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR HAIR AND YOU CAN'T AVOID IT  (fe_03_02388-A-0040)
BUT THEN CALIFORNIA WITH  (fe_03_02388-A-0041)
WITH THEIR LAWS NO SMOKING IN DOORS  (fe_03_02388-A-0042)
YOU GO IN YOU COME OUT AND YOU SMELL EXACTLY THE SAME AND THAT'S NICE  (fe_03_02388-A-0043)
AND I WOULD PREFER THAT SO  (fe_03_02388-A-0044)
AS FAR AS  (fe_03_02388-A-0045)
PEOPLE SMOKING THEY CAN SMOKE ALL THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY DON'T INFRINGE ON MY RIGHT TO HAVE  (fe_03_02388-A-0046)
A TO HAVE FRESH CLEAN AIR  (fe_03_02388-A-0047)
WELL BESIDES CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02388-A-0048)
