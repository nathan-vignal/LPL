HI  (fe_03_02310-A-0001)
MY NAME'S TERRY  (fe_03_02310-A-0002)
HI BRENDA HOW ARE YOU TODAY  (fe_03_02310-A-0003)
I'M FINE  (fe_03_02310-A-0004)
WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO IS I GUESS TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO PERSONALLY DO WHEN THE CHANGE OF SEASONS AND IF WHEN YOU BEGIN TO FEEL YOU'RE ILL  (fe_03_02310-A-0005)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02310-A-0006)
I PERSONALLY DON'T GET SICK FROM THE CHANGE OF THE SEASONS OTHER THAN SPECIFIC ILLNESSES LIKE WHEN THERE'S A HIGH COUNT OF POLLEN  (fe_03_02310-A-0007)
AND I'M MY SINUSES MAY ACT UP BUT THEN I KNOW IT'S MY SINUSES SO THEREFORE I USUALLY TAKE OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS  (fe_03_02310-A-0008)
SO AS FAR AS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CATCH COLDS WHEN IT CHANGES FROM YOU KNOW SUMMER TO FALL OR FALL TO WINTER WINTER TO SPRING OR THEY SEEM TO  (fe_03_02310-A-0009)
I DON'T KNOW [SIGH]  (fe_03_02310-A-0010)
I THINK THAT PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET COLDS MAINLY BECAUSE OF  (fe_03_02310-A-0011)
WELL COLDS ARE TRANSFERRED BY NOT WASHING HANDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT  (fe_03_02310-A-0012)
[MN] TRIES TO KEEP MY HANDS IF I KNOW I'M GONNA BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND GONNA BE TOUCHING  (fe_03_02310-A-0013)
LIKE ALL THE ELEVATOR DOORS OR LOTS OF DOORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT THEN I'M TRY TO MAKE SURE REMIND MYSELF NOT TO DO PUT MY HAND NEAR MY FACE UNTIL I HAVE A CHANCE TO WASH THEM  (fe_03_02310-A-0014)
WELL HAND SANITIZERS THEY SAY CAN WORK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT THEY DON'T WORK AS  (fe_03_02310-A-0015)
WELL AS THEY SHOULD YEAH  (fe_03_02310-A-0016)

'CAUSE THEY WORK BETTER  (fe_03_02310-A-0018)
BUT AS FAR AS GOING TO THE DOCTOR IT DEPENDS UPON IT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS HOW OFTEN WHEN YOU DO HAVE AN ONSET OF AN ILLNESS DO YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR  (fe_03_02310-A-0019)
RIGHT AWAY OR DO YOU WAIT A WEEK TO SEE IF YOU GET BETTER BEFORE YOU GO [LAUGHTER] TO THE DOCTOR WELL I THINK TO ME IT DEPENDS UPON EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02310-A-0020)
WELL I THINK IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU'RE FEELING WHAT THE ILLNESS IS I MEAN IF I HAVE UM  (fe_03_02310-A-0021)
TRYING TO THINK OF A SPECIFIC THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME GO TO THE DOCTOR LET'S SAY IF I THOUGHT I SPRAINED MY ANKLE OR MY HAND OR MY ARM THEN I PROBABLY GO TO THE DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M GETTING A BRACE OR AN X-RAY TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT BROKEN IS PROBABLY THE BEST  (fe_03_02310-A-0023)
