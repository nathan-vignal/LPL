I'VE HAD A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT SMOKED A LOT AND THEY ENDED UP DYING YOUNG AND SO FOR ME  (fe_03_02394-A-0016)
I THINK THAT HABIT IS THE WORST BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE PERSON BUT IT AFFECTS THE REST OF THE FAMILY TOO  (fe_03_02394-A-0017)
I THINK THAT WAS IT  (fe_03_02394-A-0018)

SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN TO THAT PERSON THAT THEY WERE GOSSIPING ABOUT THEY'RE GOSSIPING ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON  (fe_03_02394-A-0035)
AND THAT'S WHEN IT I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS KIND OF  (fe_03_02394-A-0036)
