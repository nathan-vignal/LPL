HELLO  (fe_03_02308-A-0001)
HI I'M LISA  (fe_03_02308-A-0002)
HI I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR THE SECOND QUESTION THEY ASKED DID YOU  (fe_03_02308-A-0003)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0004)
YEAH THE SECOND ONE  (fe_03_02308-A-0005)
[LAUGHTER] I WOULD HAVE TO SAY YES  (fe_03_02308-A-0006)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02308-A-0007)
NOT REALLY BUT I DO HAVE UM SINUS DRAINAGE BUT I THINK THAT COMES FROM JUST HAVING ALLERGIES AND WHEN THE SEASONS CHANGE THERE TENDS TO BE LIKE MORE POLLEN IN THE AIR AND GRASS AND I'LL GET SNIFFLY AND STUFF LIKE THAT  (fe_03_02308-A-0008)
RIGHT WELL THAT'S GOOD  (fe_03_02308-A-0009)
WHERE DO YOU LIVE  (fe_03_02308-A-0010)
IN NEW YORK  (fe_03_02308-A-0011)
THAT'S STRANGE  (fe_03_02308-A-0012)
NO UM  (fe_03_02308-A-0013)
I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU CAN GET SICK FOR A SEASONAL CHANGE UM I DON'T EVEN DIDN'T GET SICK WHEN WEATHER CHANGES I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT BUT I I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW IT CAN BE TRUE PER SE  (fe_03_02308-A-0014)
OH THAT MAKES SENSE  (fe_03_02308-A-0015)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0016)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0017)
SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO PREVENT ILLNESS I THINK WAS THE OTHER QUESTION  (fe_03_02308-A-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02308-A-0019)
I THINK I ONLY REALLY GET SICK LIKE ONCE A YEAR UM I STAY FAIRLY HEALTHY TO UH EAT WELL LIKE YOU SAID AND YOU KNOW EXERCISE AND TRY TO MAINTAIN LIKE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE AND I THINK THAT USUALLY KEEPS ME FROM BEING UM SICK  (fe_03_02308-A-0020)
AND THEN AND THEN ONCE A YEAR YOU KNOW IT'S JUST KIND OF NATURAL FROM LIVING IN NEW YORK WE'RE EXPOSED TO A LOT OF TOXINS AND AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02308-A-0021)
I DON'T KNOW BAD THINGS IN THE AIR I GUESS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE LIVING HERE IN SUCH A SMALL SPACE THAT YOUR BODY EVENTUALLY WILL WILL HAVE TO RELEASE THE TOXINS AND LIKE I VISIT THE DOCTOR AND HE'S LIKE YOU WERE HERE LAST YEAR THIS EXACT DAY WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM  (fe_03_02308-A-0022)
AND HE'S LIKE IT'S JUST NATURAL YOUR BODY JUST BUILDS UP TOXINS AND YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM NO MATTER HOW HEALTHY YOU ARE OR HOW MANY PRECAUTIONS YOU TAKE TO NOT GET SICK THIS WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPEN  (fe_03_02308-A-0023)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0024)
YEAH AND THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IF I RUN MYSELF RAGGED AND I'M GOING OUT A LOT AND NOT SLEEPING RIGHT OR NOT EATING RIGHT OR DRINKING TOO MUCH  (fe_03_02308-A-0025)
THEN I THINK I'M MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING SICK AND I'M SLUGGING AND TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH AND EVENTUALLY I'LL JUST LIKE BREAK DOWN AND BE SICK  (fe_03_02308-A-0026)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_02308-A-0027)
YOU FEEL LIKE WHAT  (fe_03_02308-A-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0029)
AND MY FRIENDS THAT ARE CHRONICALLY SICK SEEM TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE MALNOURISHED AND  (fe_03_02308-A-0030)
DON'T SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THEY NEVER  (fe_03_02308-A-0031)
GO TO BED THE SAME TIME THEY MAY LIVE ON FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP AND THINK THEY'RE OKAY AND YOU KNOW HAVE A LIQUID LUNCH AND A LIQUID DINNER AND NOT EAT RIGHT AND I'M LIKE WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS PALE AND SICK AND SNIFFLY AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02308-A-0032)
EXACTLY SO I THINK I I THINK HEALTH IF YOU TRY TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF HEALTH AND YOUR BODY RUNS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND YOU WON'T GET AS SICK  (fe_03_02308-A-0033)
YOU KNOW NO ONE DOES LIVING IN THIS CITY  (fe_03_02308-A-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0035)
AND IT'S LIKE I TRY NOT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE YOU HE'S JUST GOING TO TELL ME WHAT I ALREADY KNOW  (fe_03_02308-A-0036)
AND YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT GET SOME PENICILLIN YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A DELIVERY SERVICE FOR PENICILLIN INSTEAD OF PAYING THE DOCTOR FEES AND THE PRESCRIP-  (fe_03_02308-A-0037)
EXACTLY AND IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_02308-A-0038)
YOU THEY TELL YOU TO TAKE IT FOR A WEEK AND IF YOU DIDN'T GO TO HIM YOU'D PROBABLY BE WELL IN A WEEK ANYWAYS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02308-A-0039)
IT'LL TAKE THE SAME TIME OR IT'LL TAKE A WEEK OR AS IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR  (fe_03_02308-A-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0041)
BUT IT IS PRETTY CRAZY LIKE WHEN I'VE WORKED IN AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ONE PERSON GETS SICK EVERYBODY TENDS TO GET SICK AND IT'S LIKE OR ARE PEOPLE NOT LIKE WASHING THEIR HANDS ARE THEY NOT LIKE COVERING THEIR MOUTH WHEN THEY OR THEIR NOSE WHEN THEY SNEEZE LIKE HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN  (fe_03_02308-A-0042)

MHM  (fe_03_02308-A-0045)
YEAH I AGREE  (fe_03_02308-A-0046)
IT HAS TO BE HARD TO HAVE TWO KIDS THAT GET SICK AND THEN YOU DON'T END UP GETTING IT THAT'S PRETTY LUCKY  (fe_03_02308-A-0047)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02308-A-0048)
