R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm -- my name's Timiko[?]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I live in Oklahoma.
L:  My name is Pat and I live in Illinois.
R:  Illinois, okay.  Well, have y- -- is this the first time you've had one of these calls?
L:  This is the second time b- --
R:  Second?
L:  -- but the first time I had it, the lady that I talked with, she didn't understand it, just like I didn't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, of how it works or -- have you ever did it before?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, this is my fourth call.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what usually happens?  Do you just talk about the topic and 
R:  You just talk about the topic and then right at -- about, mm, at ten minutes they'll come on and say, "You have thirty seconds --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, please say your goodbyes".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then at the end of that you have, um, uh, about a -- little, maybe a minute or so to give feedback --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on how you felt about talking about the topic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then that's it.  Yeah.
L:  And you get a check in the mail or something?
R:  Supposed to be -- I haven't received any money yet but my understanding is, you're supposed to be paid for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for each call.
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought too.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And so that's what I wasn't sure of.
R:  Uh-huh.  I haven't received any money yet on any of my calls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, like I said, this is my fourth call and I'm not sure, 'cause I haven't gone back to the website and read any more either --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, as far as when they cut checks or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But my, um, I had two calls yesterday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so, my first call was, oh, a good month or so ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So there was a good lapse in there.
L:  Right.
R:  I had forgotten all about it.  Um, until they called yesterday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But as far as the, I mean, the topic today, um, I haven't really made any changes.
L:  I haven't either.
R:  No? [SIGH]
L:  I just went on life as usual.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's not really too much you can do about situations like this, that's not, you know, in -- out of your control, you know, really.
R:  Right.  Right. I do --
L:  And you can't stop doing, you know, living your life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because of these things, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I just think, um, [SIGH] think it as a way of life and that it's gonna happen, you know.
R:  Right, right.  I do know as far as like, my, like, travelling airplane wise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um. of course, we haven't flown by airplane, oh, a couple of years now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, we just got back from a trip.
R:  Really?  [NOISE] A- --
L:  And, we went to Florida and people was asking me, at my job, you know, did I find Disney to be crowded and I didn't find it to be as crowded as it normally would've been --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, 'cause a lot of things had been cancelled --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of the war, also.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So I think it scared a lotta other people, you know.
R:  Right.  Well, and see, we're supposed to go somewhere in -- in August, uh, for a wedding actually, and I'm thinking, "Oh, I don't know if I can do it!"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whereas, before --
L:  You would just do it [MN] --
R:  -- you know, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't hesitate to fly.
L:  Right.
R:  But now, that part, as far as my life, I -- you know, I think twice about.  But towards anything else, I -- I just go on with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't worry about  you know, something being on the sidewalk or 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I -- I just go on.  But flying  that I think twice about now, you know, since we -- we have to go somewhere!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  I guess because, you know, it's a thing like this, you just -- I enjoy taking trips --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I know that you really gotta just go on with your life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, what's gonna happen, is gonna happen, I feel --
R:  I -- I n- yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And you just can't stop living because of these things.
R:  True, true.  See --
L:  And all our kids are grown too, so we said, "Well, we're together, so if anything happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at least we'll be together".
R:  Yeah.  See, we have two little ones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have a two year old and a two month old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I think --
L:  So that makes you more skeptical about things.
R:  Right, exactly.  So I say [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, when your kids are grown, you know, it's a thing like this, well, you're just gonna go head on and live your life and enjoy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you've made so many sacrifices in your life already -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You feel that when God comes and gets you, he's gonna come and get you, regardless, you know?
R:  True, true.
L:  You just have to step out on faith and just go head on.
R:  I know.  And that's what, you know, I'm at the point now I'm thinking, "Okay, [LIPSMACK] well --" you know, if it was just me and my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- husband then it'd be like, "Okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can do this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But my children, well, you know, I'm thinking, "Oh, no, no, no --
L:  Right.
R:  We'll just have to drive!" [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it makes you different when you have little ones to worry about.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So -- in that -- that part I, you know, I'm thinking twice about, but anything else it's just, everyday --
L:  Life as u- yeah.
R:  -- I just go on as usual.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [NOISE] [SIGH].  I --
L:  I can imagine the people that live in New York, I know they probably --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- still very shook up over it.
R:  Sure.
L:  Which I would feel the same way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if it had been in Chicago somewhere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, and it makes you w- and I always wonder, since I don't live in the downtown sector, I always say, "Well, if these things are gonna happen, they gonna hit buildings downtown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- first".  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or near the airport.
R:  Well, see, May nineteenth we had -- oh, April nineteenth, we had the bombing here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In, uh, ninety five.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and, um  I didn't even think with that  I -- I still don't -- I don't remember changing my routine, really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All that much.  Even during that.  You know.  And it was here.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I -- I think I've just, you know, learned or just, you know, just went on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just went on.
L:  I mean, it's kinda hard to -- to stop your life.
R:  Right.  And I didn't have anyone, you know, affected by it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as in the bombing.  So that ma- --
L:  Yeah, you didn't know anyone personally either --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, i- it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- makes a difference, I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you have people -- it's the same way like, when the war started.  I feel sorry for the families that got, you know, have children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and especially families that have two children in the war.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But when it doesn't affect you and your immediate family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the only thing you can do is to pray for the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- safe return of all the other people.
R:  Right.
L:  But you just can't really stop, [LIPSMACK] you know, I mean, you just can't get yourself in a tizzy over --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so you -- you'd be a nervous wreck.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah, oh yes, yeah.
L:  You have to grip yourself and like I tell people, that you just have to trust in God and trust your faith and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  And all this is -- I feel this really in his hands, you know?
R:  Y- yeah.  And a lot of this, I mean, this w- the war, the bombings, you know, they make you think twice about how strong your faith is.
L:  Right.
R:  How strong, you know, um  and I think that's why, you know, some people are able to go on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just, you know, well, if it happens it happens.
L:  Yes, that's right.
R:  You know?  And -- and -- and it's like for myself, I'm at that point where, you know, my everyday life I'm just, you know, if it happens, it happens.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then when it comes to flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something I have no control over whatsoever.
L:  Right, you don't --
R:  You know, I just sit in there.
L:  Right, yes.
R:  You know, it makes me think, "I know, okay, I know, I know my faith is strong!" [LAUGH]
L:  You're right.  But you're still -- your han- y- your life is like, in someone else's hands too.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's what makes you so scared.
R:  Yeah.  So 
L:  And then you hear these things about the airlines, that they drink and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And I know all these people are humans, just like the rest of us.
R:  Sure.
L:  And all of them have problems in their lives, just like we all have problems.  And a lot of people feel that drinking or taking drugs or, you know, artificial things like that, is gonna pacify them, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even though they feel that they're in control, they're not in control.
R:  No, no.  No.
L:  And that's the sad thing a- about it, that you have to step out and let other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- take control of you, you know, in your life.
R:  Yeah.  Right, right.
L:  That's the scary thing about it.
R:  It is, it is.
L:  It makes you --
R:  I mean, like, driving around, you know, I'm driving and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's sorta, I'm -- I'm in control of my car, but in a airplane [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, but you don't know about the other person and their driving.
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  Because people have been killed, you know, just going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to a simple place.
R:  Sure, sure.  Yeah.
L:  And i- there's so many things to be fearful of.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That if you are afraid of everything that you hear --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You won't be able to do anything.
R:  No, no.
L:  And you can't live your life like that.
R:  True.
L:  Uh, it's very scary.
R:  Mhm.  Well, you wouldn't -- I don't think, you know, I wouldn't enjoy life.
L:  Right.
R:  If I was walking around now because of the, you know, the bombings or the airplane crash, i- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I wouldn't be enjoying life.
L:  No, you'd be --
R:  If I was just 
L:  -- afraid of everything.
R:  Afraid of everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  You know --
L:  'Cause there's so many things to be afraid of.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And they have you, you know, they -- i- i- it's just like the smallpox.  They telling you, you know, they're gonna give us a shot and then they given all the pros and cons about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you think, well, should you have one or not?
R:  Right, right.
L:  And -- and [COUGH] well, they give 'em, medical personnel, the shot first of all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  People have died from it.  And then they get this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other thing over in China that people are --
R:  Yeah, that SARS.
L:  -- dying from.  Yeah.
R:  I know!  Ooh!
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had the anthrax.  There's always --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel, gonna be something.  I think all these things are ways to eliminate life and make room for other people.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And they have to have some kind of measure to do it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's not -- it's really not ex
