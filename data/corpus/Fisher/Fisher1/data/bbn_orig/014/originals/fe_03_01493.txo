R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is Esther, how are you tonight?
R:  Esther, it's Marsha, I'm fine, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Well, we're supposed to talk about any changes we've made since September eleventh.
L:  Right.  I can't really think of a whole lot that I've changed.  I think I'm a little more watchful and I listen a lot to the news more so.  Um, I don't travel a lot but I have had some second thoughts when I had to.  I happen to have been in Washington visiting my family when all this happened, and couldn't get back home.
R:  Oh, that must have been horrible.
L:  I'd -- I -- I eventually took the train.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had my grandson and oh yeah, it was quite ... quite devastating.
R:  Were you a long -- were you way far away from home?
L:  I'm in -- I'm living in Atlanta.
R:  So you were a half a country away practically?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  My goodness.  And you had come by plane?
L:  I had flown there, right.
R:  We had some friends who were --
L:  And that was the airport that was open l- the latest, when all the others opened -- it was a long while before they reopened, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh my.  We had some friends who were airborne when it happened.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  They were on their way from Buenos Aires to London.
L:  Mm.
R:  And --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- no, they were on their way from Buenos Aires to New York, sorry, and --
L:  Coming back home?
R:  No, they were -- they were coming from Buen- -- they're -- they're, uh, Argentine.  Uh, and they were stopped mid flight, they were put down in --
L:  Mm.
R:  I think they were put down in Rio.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, were three or four days before they could go on.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  They were on their honeymoon, they were coming to New York for their honeymoon, poor things!
L:  Oh my goodness, they were on a honeymoon too!
R:  Yes.  And -- and --
L:  Well, that was an adventure.
R:  They ha- -- they had an adventure.  Uh, they have --
L:  Well, have you changed anything that you do normally?
R:  Not a thing.  I -- I think --
L:  Not a thing.
R:  -- I think what -- I think we may be a little more circumspect about some of the things that we do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that -- that hasn't stopped --
L:  Where do you live?
R:  We live in Connecticut.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we're quite close to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to New York.  As a matter of fact, um, my, um, fr- uh, one of my first cousins and his son both worked at the Trade Center.
L:  Oh goodness, were they okay?
R:  Well, I -- I called my aunt [LAUGH] I -- I -- I managed to get 'til six o'clock in the afternoon then I called my aunt, and, uh, my cousin -- cousin's office had moved out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, a few months before, but his son did work on the eighty fourth floor and had the day off.
L:  Ooh, wonderful.
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  Wasn't that a blessing?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, so it was -- it -- it was kind of close to us too in -- in -- in the sense that, you know, you -- you kinda felt this could -- could happen.  But I don't think -- I -- I live in a, um, a suburban area, and I don't -- I don't -- I can't see anybody making any point, and I think they do this so that they can get a big splash in the newspaper and on the eleven o'clock news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, for their cause.  I don't know how -- what kind of points they can make by blowing up the -- my local supermarket.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I know.  Well, they've relaxed our ratings a little bit and I'm hoping --
R:  Well, we've been out of the country for the past four months, so this is all news to me.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We -- we -- we just gotten back.  So this is all -- this is all new that, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, uh --
L:  Where did you travel to?
R:  Oh, we -- we spend the winters in South America.
L:  Oh, kay, wonderful.
R:  Anything but snow! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, a- and -- and --
L:  Are you -- are you -- you don't work then?
R:  No, no.
L:  Uh-huh, wonderful.
R:  No, I've -- I've been -- I retired early.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm very glad to have done that, thank you very much.  Uh --
L:  Mhm.  I retired a few years ago myself [NOISE] and --
R:  Isn't it wonderful?
L:  -- I'm enjoying it immensely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have two grandsons.
R:  And you should enjoy every minute of it 'cause you -- you -- you've earned it.
L:  And I'm -- I'm really enjoying them, so ...
R:  But I don't think my husband and I have ever -- have -- have changed our plans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I -- I have noticed in the airports that we've been through in the past three years, um, things are quite stricter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In one airport we were in, um, it wasn't that I changed things, they've changed things.  They went through every piece of everyone's luggage who was getting on the plane.
L:  Yes.  I've had that happen.
R:  But I mean, open everybody's luggage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I had never expected that.  Uh --
L:  Uh, my carry on was in -- everything was dumped out. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well that's not -- they did that to the carry on, but this is the checked luggage.
L:  Oh huh.  Oh really?
R:  Before it went on --
L:  Everybody?
R:  Everybody who got --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- on that plane.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Everybody's --
L:  Oh, that must have taken forever.
R:  I- it did.  It did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I wasn't -- and, you know, nobody complained.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nobody said --
L:  Well, I guess we all wanna be safe.
R:  Uh, [MN] well, yeah, yeah.
L:  I can't get my mother to come visit.
R:  Oh --
L:  She's now -- now she's saying, "Well, it depends on whether they're having a war"!
R:  Oh, jeez! [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, you know, friends of ours asked us that before we came back.  Um, 'cause the war had just started in -- in March and we were planning on coming back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the beginning of April.  "Are- aren't you afraid to go back?"  And, um, well, the --  "No! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's where I live, I'm not afraid to go back".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but several friends of ours who had plans to -- to come to this country, uh, were thinking about not doing that.
L:  Right.  Now, I do think people have been affected [SIGH] by not maybe having jobs, a lot of people are being laid off.
R:  Oh, it's really --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- socked the airline industry.
L:  Tourism and all -- all of those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things are way down.
R:  Well, I don't think the economy helps any, either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, so we're -- we're --
L:  I think we've all been affected that way, our money's gone down the tubes.
R:  I know.  It's -- it -- but it's still better than working for a living.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I'd like to think that I could hold onto it a little bit and I hope it goes back up, but it doesn't look like it's going there yet.
R:  Well, I -- I don't -- I don't know -- I -- I just don't -- don't know where this is all gonna end.
L:  I know.
R:  I don't think we've seen the end of it.
L:  I think the gas pla- -- is your gas coming down up there?
R:  Gas has always been very high in the north east.  But you know what, I -- I live -- because I live four months of the year out of the country and gas is -- what is it, two dollars -- it was ... fifty dollars to fill a Volkswagon tank.
L:  Wow.
R:  Every time we filled it.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's a lot of money.
L:  So it's expensive in South America too?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, uh, [MN] very expensive.  And I th- -- I -- I don't think this is -- this is -- this is just local, I think this is the whole world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think.  And I don't think we've seen the end of -- of -- of, um, terrorism.  I don't care how many wars we win or not win, fight or not fight --
L:  We never know.
R:  -- um, I -- I think that there's always gonna be some crazies out there.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  And that scares me.  That does scare me.
L:  Do you get to New York very often?
R:  I -- New York has started to bore me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  I -- I just don't -- I don't have the urge to go to New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ...
L:  Is there a place to gamble or something in Connecticut?
R:  Oh, lots, it's the largest ca- -- the largest, uh, casino in the world.
L:  Indian?
R:  Yeah, the Indians.
L:  Right.
R:  Quite a place.
L:  I thought I had heard that.
R:  Quite a place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't think they have, um, they have had any problems because [LAUGH] of terrorists!
L:  Right.
R:  They're --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, loo- --
R:  -- chuck full and packed.
L:  Mhm.  Well, most of the places where they usually have enormous crowds don't seem to be having that.  I know that, uh, they said the mardi gras wasn't so crowded and jammed this time.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Uh, and, uh, I'm thinking of going to the Kentucky Derby and I was told that [LIPSMACK] I wouldn't have any problems getting a hotel.  Before, I had been told, "Well, you're gonna have trouble getting downtown and if you are going you're going to have to stay the whole weekend or three days", they have a minimum of three days --
R:  Oh, oh my.
L:  -- but I was just told that that's all changed, so ...
R:  Well, I think -- I think things are -- things are -- people are thinking twice.  You know, and now that you mention big things like that, maybe I would think twice about going to some place that drew a lot of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My everyday life hasn't changed but I'd -- I don't know that I would go to the superbowl.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know that I would --
L:  Well, Atlanta was one of the places that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was kind of, um, under, uh, --
R:  Scrutiny.
L:  -- threat at one time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why, what's here that everybody is so concerned about but --
R:  Well, I think you're a hub.  I think, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, you're like New York.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're like the New York of the south.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're -- you're -- got a big --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or Chicago, uh, you're a hub.  Uh, and that --
L:  Well, I guess I thought about it a little bit because of that, because there was this scare around, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know if it was fourth of July, but they were saying, "Don't go to the malls on some particular date" and, you know, of course I have a mall right -- almost around the corner from me, so I kinda thought about it.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that kind of thing passes your mind.  But --
R:  Well, if you're --
L:  -- I don't dwell on it too much.
R:  Well, if you're right in the city I think it's very different.  Um, from -- I think you've lived differently when you live in the city than when you live in the suburbs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, city life is very different from the suburbs.  I think I would be much more ...
L:  Concerned, mhm.
R:  I think I would be much more wary if I were in a big city.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Because a big city has lots of -- lots of different people, lots -- I think percentages --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- right there, start playing into a --
L:  And we always have something going on here, like the superbowl or some other big tournament of some sort.  Lots of festivals.
R:  And that brings in a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and a lot of people, that's where -- that's where terrorists --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or something like that could hide.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I -- I mean, I -- I've got a field with horses in front of my house! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh!
R:  We're -- we're --
L:  It must be beautiful there.
R:  Well, it is, it's lovely.  When it gets warmer it'll be even lovelier! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right now -- right now it's not so --
L:  Well, the temperature here's been pretty nice.  We've been like, s- mid seventies.
R:  Oh, that's lovely, that's lovely.  I came back with a tan and I'm fading. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I need -- I -- I n- need warm weather again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is already -- it snowed, I haven't shoveled in three years!  And it --
L:  Yeah.  Is there some down on the ground now?
R:  No, no.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We've got -- it -- it -- it's gone away.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] it's -- it's just not spring enough yet [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for me!
L:  Well, you seem to have a wonderful life.
R:  Well, we try -- we try.  We try.  We've -- we've worked hard --
L:  Well, I think it's marvellous that we can still go on, that we can keep these things and hold them in place but we don't take them to the extreme and we go on with life.
R:  I think that's -- that's -- that's what you have to do otherwise they win, don't they?
L:  Right.
