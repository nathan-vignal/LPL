R:  Hi, my name's Raven, I live in Montana.
L:  I'm Jeanette.  I live in Seattle.
R:  Cool.  [LAUGH].  So, did you know anybody in September eleventh?  Did you have --
L:  Um --
R:  -- any relatives or family out there?
L:  I -- my, uh, my twin brother lives in New York.
R:  Does he?  Did he -- was he involved in it at all?
L:  He -- no, he was fine, but like, spent, like you know, a day of not knowing that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I know the feeling, yeah.
L:  So it was just -- you know, we --
R:  It -- it is -- it was -- it was scary.  It was a horrible, horrible time.  I can remember when it happened, I -- I was running late that morning and I had a six -- my six week old daughter and my two year old son, and we were supposed to go to church that morning for like a women's Bible study.
L:  Mhm?
R:  So, I -- I packed them up and I didn't even turn on the TV, anything.  I was just running really late that morning and I went down to church and I -- I went -- I walked in late and everybody was real quiet and they're, like -- and the events of this morning -- and I didn't know what happened.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I felt so stupid, saying, "What happened?" when it was such a huge thing.  And --
L:  I know.  You know, I, um, I had just been laid off, so I was enjoying sleeping late.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And I woke up and all there was -- there was a phone message from my mother saying something like, "Do you know if Michael's okay?"  Michael being my brother --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and, um [COUGH] an- and, like, no information of course, 'cause my mom is inept at leaving good messages.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And, yeah, I had no idea what was going on and then I -- you know, um, you know, I tried to get through to him and couldn't, on the phone line.
R:  Oh goodness, yeah.
L:  You know, just got a, you know, all circuits are busy.  And then turned on the news and, you know, and --
R:  And it -- 
L:  -- it's all there was that day and I was --
R:  Oh, the whole week.
L:  -- just -- so nerve racking.
R:  It was horrible.  [LAUGH].  Oh, it was -- it was scary, though.  It was just -- and I -- I ended up at, um, I didn't know anybody -- we had a lot of people were affected in my family advertently, because of it.  Like, I had an uncle who was in Kentucky who was visiting his father and he was supposed to fly out that day --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- from Kentucky and he didn't get a flight out.  He had to -- had to end up taking a rental car back from Kentucky to Montana because he couldn't get home and, I mean, just little things like that, and then my -- his son was actually working in the Pentagon, in the wing that got blown up.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  They'd transferred him one month prior to that, but it was his buddies, his area, his desk is gone.  I mean, you know, here he was, it's totally gone, and he wa- he was in Italy at the time, but it was just, you know, weird [LAUGH] that it was just like weird things that, you know, you wo- you would know some- like, something happened to everybody.  You know, you know somebody.  You know --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I had a close friend who -- who um lost her last living relative.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's just so hard, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you -- yeah.  Oh, so the topic was actually, ho- how -- how has it changed your --
R:  How has it changed.
L:  Right.  And so, ah, I have to get anti anxiety medication from I suffer from post traumatic stress.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, pretty much for, like, I don't know, six months to a year afterwards, I just like because a person who cries, like, at the drop of a hat.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  And part of it was, you know, I mean, right after September eleventh, I like -- every time there was, like, a Red Cross commercial I would cry, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Just --
R:  I can remember that.  Just -- just that feeling of just -- and -- and -- and the little things, like, I would cry when -- when I saw, like, commercials about patriotism, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Just things like that.
L:  All of it, yeah.
R:  That just really gets to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and just weird things like that, that -- yeah.  I -- you know, they were saying things, like, right after September eleventh that things like marriages went up and people took more vacations and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, for me, the opposite happened.  I got a divorce because of September eleventh.
L:  Really?
R:  And it was a wonderful thing.  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Don't get me wrong, it was a wonderful thing.  Um, I -- I finally -- it -- it dawned on me that, you know, like yeah, life is short and -- and what the heck am I doing [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Right.  It caused -- it causes, like, really, really pervasive, just people sort of --
R:  It does.
L:  -- assessing their lives.
R:  It does.
L:  And, um, taking stock and, like, reprioritizing things.  
R:  It -- it -- that's exactly what happened to me.
L:  I mean, I know also some people who left their [inaudible] senior project management jobs with Microsoft --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- to you know --
R:  To -- to take a breath and just, you know, live.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  I, um, I spent that entire year, like I said, I was laid off, um, right before September eleventh and, uh, the economy has not improved much since then.
R:  No.  I know.  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, but I spent, you know, a year just travelling around the country and visiting all my friends and maintaining my relationships and you know -- that -- that was sort of how I reacted --
R:  Yeah, and you --
L:  -- to that, you know?
R:  And that's like my --
L:  Self assessment.
R:  It -- it -- it wasn't a good thing that happened, but I think the results that America got out of it in some ways were good.  You know what I mean?  Jus- just --
L:  Yeah, although --
R:  -- the way that we pulled together.
L:  -- some of the legislation that has passed as a result is just sort of very terrifying.  I mean, some of the [SIGH] uh, you know, the [inaudible] Patriot Act, um, while there's some, like, really, really helpful provisions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, also has like totally, totally restricted rights to free speech and rights to assemble.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, really, really primary constitutional rights.
R:  It -- it -- it's a scary world, you know?  It's just -- it -- it's scary what they're -- wha- what's happening is just -- it is.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and [COUGH] under the sort of umbrella of anti-terrorist -- anti-terrorism, you know --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- all this legislation that is just -- you know, give us license.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Let us do whatever we want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're afraid right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  This legislation will pass --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, it's just -- I'm worried that, uh -- uh, there's -- there's going to be a lot of more stuff like that, that you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the face of the sort of immediate fear, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  People will sort of surrender their rights, so it'll be like, "Yes, make us safe".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh -- and uh, I'd rather be free --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than safe.
R:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.
L:  It's terrible.
R:  I -- I feel the same way, too.  I -- I was in, um, I actually lived in Vancouver for a few years, Washington --
L:  Okay?
R:  -- and um, just speaking of terrorism, um, for uh, the millenium, when they cancelled the celebration in Seattle --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I can remember we were thinking about going up there, but then I had just had my son, my son was just a few weeks old at the time and we're of course clo- closer to Portland and we didn't go to Portland, not only because my son was too little, but just because we were afraid that whoever was in Seattle was going to come down to Portland [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R: -- and that all the people would be coming from Seattle to Portland just because it was, you know, one of the nearer places to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I can remember that, that fear, just -- just, "Oh, I don't want to leave the house.  I'm afraid the -- the world's going to blow up".  I mean, we watched that TV expecting something to happen in New York City --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on -- on the millenium, you know?  We -- we're freaked out.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I can -- I can --
L:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, and -- and just, um, the first time I flew after September eleventh, I -- I didn't [SIGH] I'm not generally, like -- I'm generally pretty fearless.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Like, I've never been, like, afraid to fly.  I don't -- I'm not afraid of things.  Like, I'm not afraid of spiders, you know?
R:  Oh, I am.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But I -- you know, the first time I flew, first of all, going to the airport and having there be, you know, armed forces there?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Standing at attention with guns was totally surreal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and -- and then -- and then just, like, realizing that I was actually really, really anxious, just sort of vaguely generally anxious --
R:  Well, yeah, because you're more aware of that kind of stuff.
L:  -- the whole time I was flying, you know?
R:  Yeah.  It -- it makes you more aware of -- of threats, of -- of things like that happening on, you know, flights.  You know what happened to us?  We came back -- I ended up -- met somebody and actually got married last year, too, so that was another [LAUGH] effect --
L:  Wow, you've had a busy year or two.
R:  I have had a busy year.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And we went on our honeymoon and we flew out to, um, to Seattle actually, and on our way home, um, to Montana, there was some kind of a commotion on -- on the plane and apparently, um, a women was upset with a stewardess for some reason, or steward, excuse me, it was a male, and um, and she got into a verbal argument with him and said something along the lines of, you know, "I could have your job for this".  Well he, in light of Sept- September eleventh had her arrested and hauled off the plane.  I mean, in front of everybody.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was some kind of a -- a verbal skirmish and -- and he just said, "You know what?  Because of this happening last year, there is no way you are going to threaten me".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  They just had her hauled off and it was just -- I mean, and she wasn't -- I mean, she wasn't a young teenager that was just [inaudible] you know, something along those lines.  She was -- you could tell by the clothes that she was wearing that she was -- she was -- she was of some means, and she -- she thought herself better than other people, from the -- her attitude that she had.  You know?  It wasn't -- you know?  And -- and it was just like, "Wow" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they just had her hauled off in cuffs.  I mean, they cuffed her and they kicked her off the plane.  [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  And it was just, okay, I'm not going to talk wrong to him.  [LAUGH].
L:  Seriously, I mean -- on -- on the one hand, like, nobody likes someone who's rude to, like, customer service people.  I mean, I find that like, appalling, but --
R:  Oh, I do, too.
L:  -- I saw, you know, but like that guy exercised what power he had been granted.  Like, because she -- she -- she bugged him, you know?
R:  I -- yeah.
L:  That's sort of terrible.
R:  It -- it -- it was just, like, okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Just like, okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  And so everybody was just, like, you know, the whispering the whole flight and [LAUGH] but it was crazy.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  "Don't talk to that guy".
R:  I'm telling ya.  Well, then he made a funny -- funny joke about international bathrooms.  He said something along the lines of, "This is a domestic flight, but we have international bathrooms", just to kinda lighten the mood.  What did he say?  He said something like, um, "Well, uh, when ya -- ya have to go, you're rushing.  When you're in there, you're a-peeing and when you're done, you're finish".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  It was, like, okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's just lighten the air some.
R:  I guess so.  [LAUGH].  It diverted us for a while.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  I mean, I can't imagine, you know, what it was like to work in the travel industry --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- right after September eleventh.  That's why -- that guy was lucky he still had a job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Exactly.  In light of everything I know, I -- I actually went to a travel and tourism school, that's what I was supposed to do with my life before I had kids [LAUGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- um, that -- I went to technical school for that and it was a bad technical school, it was a waste of money.  Anyway.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, that's what I was going to go into, but I went down a different path, went down retail instead, gone into retail management and so on and so forth, but um, and I was thinking that, you know, I don't think I could get a job right now in -- in the -- in travel and tour- tourism, what I was trained for, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's just nothing available --
