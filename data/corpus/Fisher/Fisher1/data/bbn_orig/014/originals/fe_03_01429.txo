R:  Hello, my name --
L:  Hi --
R:  -- is Kelly.
L:  Hi, Kelly, my name's Jim.  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Hi.  I'm from Philadelphia.  How are you today?
L:  Oh, fine, and you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.
R:  This is my first time doing this, so uh, I guess, uh, you kind of just if you want to start me off, and --
L:  Uh-huh.  This is my second.  Yeah.  Um, so the topic is changes that you've made in your life since September eleventh?
R:  Yes, that sounds correct.
L:  Uh-huh.  Mm.  I'm not sure if there've been definite changes, I mean, physical changes that I've made in my life.  Um, although I -- I guess I'm very aware of just kind of a new philosophy or ideology out in the world -- in the country, that uh, I'm starting to pick up that, um, I -- I think there are a lot of people who are defining their life before and after September eleventh.
R:  Yeah, I think that's pretty true.  I've kinda come across that myself with a lot of people that, um, you know, I've spoken to.  I know my husband and I, we've had a baby since September eleventh, and I can't honestly say that that was my reasoning, but I think, you know, in our case, we had met so many other people while I was pregnant that decided to expand their family, get married.  You know, there was, like, these huge lifestyle changes and, um, um, it was something that we had planned on anyway, but I think people tried to make, like, a more positive, uh, outlook in their own lives, and um, you know, because they felt so much loss for all the other people that lost family and -- and so on.  Um --
L:  Mm.  That --
R:  -- and there ju- there's so much going on, on the television and things that people say they've made total lifestyle changes.  I don't -- I mean, I can't honestly say I have, other than having the baby, um, and again, I don't know that it's directly related.  I just feel like, um, you know, those of us who have had children and so on feel more fortunate, you know, to have an expanding family and, um, you know, that -- that we really feel sorry for all the people that had a loss per se.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I can't say that I've met anyone who's made a -- a real lifestyle change, you know, because of that.  That actually sur- I mean, I've heard that, but I think you've explained it to me better, that they feel like they've got to make, you know, positive changes in their live, um, what is kind of a reaction?
R:  I guess.  You know, I think some people think, like, you know, they realize life is short.  Life can be short, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- shorter than expected, and you know, I guess all the people that are doing so much hesitating in their lives look at September eleventh and say, you know, "What am I doing in my li- you know, have I done everything up to this point that I really wanted to do?"  You know, "Is there anything in my life that I'm holding back doing", and you know, I mean, I've actually heard people make comments, you know, where they're like, "Oh, I haven't travelled enough, I haven't done this", and no- not to say that they're turning their whole life around, but I think they're trying to look at, you know, the fact that there were so many young people, it's just such an unexpected thing, that you know, can they say in their own lives, "Yes", you know, "I've -- I've done all -- every minute of every day with my family in the way that I wanted to" and so on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  But I don't know that there is -- like I said, huge lifestyle complete changes, um --
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- wow!  I mean, that -- that kind of thinking, um, I -- I just can't apply it to myself at all.  You know, like that kind of event would then turn me to think, um, "Oh well, life's short.  Mm".  You know, I don't think that, um, anything similar is going to happen to me and my life's not any longer or shorter, so I've kept on living pretty much, you know, the way I was before.
R:  Right.  Right.  I -- I guess, like, for me, I know, um, right after it happened, a group of friends and I went up to New York, probably about three or four weeks after the tragedy and there was just a sense of -- you know, you -- you came off the subway and there was all these pictures around and there were so many people staring and grieving, and you know, I have family that -- that lived up there, not that I knew anyone directly that was in the building, but they say, you know, that -- like, I guess I came home with, like, a sense of wow, you know, there was so much loss and -- you know, I have to just -- I -- I think, like, oh, my God, none of those people knew that that was going to happen that day.  But, you know, it -- it -- I guess it was just such a large event, it really opened your eyes because it's so publicized, even though in every day life things happen where, like, you're sad, you're not -- like, oh okay, there was a car accident up the street or this or that and I'm not going to turn my whole life around because of one incident, but you know, I guess you figure there's so many young pe- young, old, every age it [MN] like, discriminate -- discriminating against no one, you know, when it did happen, and -- and with the war going on right now, I guess you just don't know.  Every day, you're like, oh my goodness, you know, I send my daughter to school and there could be [NOISE] snipers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hello.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I'm still here, yeah.
R:  I'm sorry.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they send, um, you know, bags of food with the kids, just in case they end up going into lock down and I guess, you know, I have people out there, other parents and stuff, that are just paranoid.  Um, I don't feel in that sense that I'm -- I'm going to stop living, you know, and I'm not going to let my child, um, you know, do different things because of what -- what occurred.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  I -- well, I -- I live in Chicago, and last year I was mugged twice, so I -- I feel for more -- you know, my personal safety is more of a matter of, um, you know, just the local area --
R:  Right.  Right --
L:  -- than, uh --
R:  -- and I've had that happen myself one time, and I know, it does kind of like change -- I -- I think things change, though, once you have been mugged.  I mean, you know, my situation it was -- there was a gun involved, things like that.  It really --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- opened my eyes up, like, oh my God, you know?  I had lived in the city my whole life and just never expected something like that to happen to me.  Did you feel like anything in your life changed after that happened?
L:  Uh, definitely.  Um --
R:  Like, more cautious or did you feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a little more fur- fearful?  Had you had any similar incidents prior to then?
L:  No, I -- I've lived, uh, on the south side of Chicago for twenty years and ever since then, um, things have changed completely.  Um, I -- I fear for my personal safety, um, all the time, and I -- I carry, uh, a small thing of mace with me, which um, I -- I actually got to use on the second mugging, and that, um, you know, saved me.
R:  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I mean, I'm glad that -- that, you know, you were able to react, but it -- I mean, to have it happen twice, that's awful.  Were they totally unrelated incidents?
L:  Yeah, completely unrelated.  Yeah.
R:  Do you work late at night, or is it, like -- was it something where you were travelling, um, on public transportation, or late, or in a -- you know, remote area --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or anything like that?
L:  Right.  Both of them were -- were late.  Um, and one was, um -- yeah, it's become my worst nightmare as far as upsetting.  I'd just gotten off a train, it was a train platform at ten o'clock at night and these two guys, uh, jumped me as I got out.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Um -- yeah.  Oh, boy.
R:  Mine was a whole night work thing, you know, I was working an evening shift and, uh, got out of my car one evening and was coming home and out comes two guys from, like, behind another car with the gun, you know, wanting my purse and kinda just playing a little bit with my head, I think.  I don't know that they actually wanted to injure me, but I wasn't real sure, because my trunk was open.  I'm thinking, are they gonna put me in the trunk, you know?  You kinda go through that state of shock.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, but it was probably -- one of those -- it felt like a TV -- like I was on TV.  I think I'm just like, this isn't happening to me, you know?
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, wh- where's the camera, yeah.
R:  When you walk away from it, it's just like y- you have so many, like, oh my God, you know?  I had lived in a -- it was right near my home.  Um, it was very late at night, though, there wa- it wasn't a time of day where there'd be many people around and, you know, when the police, um -- I had to notify the police and so on and go and look at some pictures to see if I could identify anybody, um, that I thought might be my mugger, because they thought there were -- you know, things, incidents happening at the time.  Um, when I went there, it was just like, you know, I'm in shock, oh, my God, just around the corner from my home --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, uh, life just changed a lot.  Like, I just -- I felt, like, unsafe for a long time, because I always had a -- you know, it wasn't like something where I was going to change my job.  But people said, oh, you know, you should of carried a gun and I'm, like, "What?"
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] no, I shouldn't, you know?  Like, I don't feel comfortable doing that.  I mean, mace, yes.  You know, I -- there were things like that, where I kinda felt more cautious.  However, it wasn't something that was really in my control.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I -- I don't feel like I wasn't being street smart or whatever.  I did live in the city my whole life, but um, it was very shocking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda opens up your eyes a lot.
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.  Yeah.  September eleventh, um, harking back to that, um, I think it's -- I mean, yes, um, terrible tragedy and all of that, um, but uh, the role of our government, um actu- I spin my wheels more about, um, um, yeah, what our government [MN] reaction to it and the path that we're on now as a result of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- you know, a few commentators talk about, you know, um, Bush really blew it, um, in his state of the union address right after.  He -- he gave absolutely no
