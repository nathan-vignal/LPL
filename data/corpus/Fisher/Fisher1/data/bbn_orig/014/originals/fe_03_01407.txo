L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Hi, I'm fine, I'm Deb.
L:  Uh, my name is Daryl.
R:  Hi.
L:  Pleasure meeting you.
R:  You too, where you from?
L:  I am from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania --
R:  Oh, I'm --
L:  -- and  you?
R:  Mount Joy, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, what is that?
R:  Mount Joy, right outside of Lancaster.
L:  Okay, just outside of Lancaster.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so that's funny.
L:  Excellent.  [LAUGH] I think that's funny.
R:  Yeah, I know.  You know the other day I got a call with somebody, my friend that lives like two minutes away from me.
L:  Oh really?
R:  It was so weird.  Yeah, that was -- that was -- it was --
L:  Oh, so they actually connected you with, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to -- to speak with somebody in your area.
R:  Yes.  That was so weird.  I didn't -- I didn't expect that, we laughed half of the time but, um -- so, anyway, as far as the topic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I honestly can say I really haven't -- as far as plane travel, any of that kind of stuff, I have not changed anything.
L:  Yeah, I can say, uh -- like to say as well, that yeah I haven't really changed anything.  I don't really see a -- a -- a reason to, uh, make any major changes.  Um --
R:  I agree.
L:  You know my kind of -- you know, the way that I kind of feel about it is that if something is gonna happen, especially if people really are willing to sacrifice themselves to get you, they gonna do it anyway.
R:  Right.  I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH] There's not a whole lot you can do about that.
R:  I agree, I agree.
L:  You know.  Um, not trying to say that, you know, that you shouldn't take precautions --
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, you do what you can do but, you know, I don't sit around thinking about this kind of stuff.
R:  No, I think you live like that and what -- what is your life?
L:  Yeah.  Well, actually --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- that's -- that's not living.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I -- I honestly -- probably the biggest is that, um, that, you know, you hear an airplane, the difference is like your thought process to be honest.  You know, I hear an airplane and, you know, before an airplane was just an airplane, now it's like you look up, you know, and you remember --
L:  And now -- now -- now it's a bomb.
R:  -- and you think.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly and -- and that is the  big- -- that's probably the biggest thing everything -- you know, everything is --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- has a little different perspective.
L:  True.
R:  I don't live my life different but I -- I -- I do -- there are things that mean different things to me now.  But, um, yeah, I don't stock up on -- you know, I know people stock up on water and -- and --
L:  No, I mean people are buying gas masks --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- and, you know, it's like, "Oh, come on".
R:  Taping windows shut.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean people are doing things that they would never have -- have even thought about -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I mean just, you know, a few short years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, one thing that I am very keenly aware of, when it's time for you to check out, you will check out.
R:  That's -- yeah, you don't have a say [LAUGH].
L:  Whether you're ready to go or not, you will check out.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I honestly said -- like we live near, um -- well, P.M.I.'s not too far from me.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm not like super close but I said, you know, "Honestly, if -- if ..." and I know that was concerned a target at some point and everything or -- and I said, "You know what, if that was hit my whole family is out on the street".  You know, I don't want the after effects, I don't want the -- you know, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna [NOISE] happen and that's just -- you know, nothing you can do to stop it, nothing -- I'm gonn- -- I'm not gonna change anything and -- and make myself miserable.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  But, uh, yeah -- I mean, I -- I feel bad for, you know, kids today what -- what more they'll have to do and -- and deal with and -- and, uh, you know, who knows what else is gonna happen in -- in --
L:  You know, since then have the travel industry -- I think -- I know it's picked back up it's not back where it used to be --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but I guess it still is on the rise, right?  They are reporting an increase in travel and so forth.
R:  I think so, I think so.  And that's one -- I mean I -- I never traveled, I mean except for a little trip -- trip to the beach but --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean I --
L:  Okay.
R:  We don't -- I've flown once on my honeymoon, that was the only time I've ever flown, um --
L:  Oh, so you are married?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh excellent.  Congratulations.
R:  Oh, thank you.  Are you married?
L:  Ah, no, I'm single.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  No, I'm single.  How -- how long have you been, uh, actual- -- should I say, "Happily married?"
R:  Yes, happily married.
L:  Okay, happily married.
R:  Um, I guess going on twelve years.
L:  Twelve years, oh wow, congrats.
R:  Yeah, with four kids, you know.
L:  Wow, four kids.
R:  Yeah, so it's, uh -- and they haven't really -- you know, even with them -- my oldest is eleven and -- and although he realizes everything and -- and knows -- they're not too -- they're not affected actually at all I can say.  Um, you know, we have the war on constantly and they don't even -- I don't -- I don't wanna make it a big deal even for them, you know, why?  Why make their lives worry about it?  I know some of my neighbors have kids that worry about every little thing, you know, and it's like that's not -- that's not a kid -- a life for a kid.
L:  No.
R:  Why should they worry, what's gonna -- you know, what's that gonna help?
L:  No. I mean the main, uh, thing about, uh, you know, when you are young is that you -- you can basically live carefree --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and just kind of enjoy life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- up to a point.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, when you get into your teen years then you should become more, at least, aware of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, what's going on in the world --
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  You know, you wanna be because you're -- you know, you're -- you, know after that is adulthood and you wanna definitely be -- be at that place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in your life.
R:  Right, I agree.
L:  But, um, no none of that --
R:  Well, and -- and I like them to know what's happening and when that happened, you know, I sat there with that -- you know, we watched the World Trade Center fall fifty million times.
L:  Exactly, so did I.
R:  They -- they knew it but, um, I didn't make this big, you know, we're going to die, you know, I don't think that -- that helps and I don't think changing -- I mean spending, what -- what's stopping spending?  Why, you know?
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't understand that. 
R:  No, I -- I --
L:  People like, "Oh no, I've got to hold onto my money" well, look, you can't take it with you.
R:  Yeah, exact- -- my thought exac- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, look, you can't take it with you.  So, it's like, you know --
R:  My -- yeah, and who can predict what the economy will do?  I know that's the big thing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  "Oh, we're going to lose our money" you know, and --
L:  And look, you know, you say who can predict what the economy's going to be except Alan Greenspan [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly [LAUGH].
L:  Look, he's the only one who knows what it's going to be [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  The only man who knows.
R:  Yep, yep, but, uh --
L:  But, um, you know, I will say this in relation to, um, like travel.  I don't do a whole lot of traveling but I have been places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like now I am just, uh, uh, more aware of like people in my surroundings --
R:  Right.  Yea- -- good point.
L:  Like if I'm -- like was in a bus station and I'm going to New York, you know, I take the bus or take the train up to New York to go hang out with some friends for awhile, for the day or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, I am more aware like when I see people just kind of leave bags around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that kind of thing.  Uh --
R:  Now, how do you feel -- like have you been on a plane like --
L:  Oh no, I haven't been on a plane since September eleven --
R:  -- been on a train?
L:  -- no, I haven't.
R:  'Cause I'm thinking I don't know how I would feel if I actually sat in a plane.  I -- I guess I'd be looking around, you know, like, "Okay, is this the one".
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, you know, since I don't do it I don't even have that to really go on.
L:  When you say -- heaven forbid they'd be wearing a turban or something.
R:  Well, ex- -- and isn't that said because --
L:  Isn't it horrible?
R:  -- it is exactly right?  It's exactly right and -- and, uh -- and -- and I pity any of the Arab Americans in the -- you know, in the country because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's got to be awful for them and it isn't fair.  
L:  Mm.
R:  But, uh -- but I -- I know if I would see that it'd be like, "Can I have a different plane?" you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess that's not fair.  But, um -- but, I think, yeah, like that -- I mean, you made a great point about more aware of your surroundings.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because that is so, so right.  Now, have you -- like do you feel nervous on a train when you go, at all?
L:  No.  No, no not at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, because you see my thing is is that if something is gonna happen it's gonna happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's not a whole lot that you can do to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stop it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it's best that you kind of have yourself in a position and in a mindset where you can quickly marshal the necessary resources or forces, however you wanna put it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, to kind of get things, uh, back to where they used to be.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, functioning at a -- at an optimum.
R:  I agree.
L:  So, uh, you know, I -- I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that kind of stuff and I try not to watch -- you know, I -- I -- you know, I see the war on TV, you know, as soon as they -- it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it comes on, I turn it off.  I'm tired of seeing that [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm actually -- I did -- I watched a lot --
L:  Oh god.
R:  -- at first and now it's like I -- if I even have it on once a day that's -- that's even rare.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I look in the paper to see what's new but, yeah, I -- I was obsessed at first, I really was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was just -- I don't know, but now it's like, "Okay, let's get on with -- let's get on with it and let's get this over with" and --
L:  I really wish I had gone down to the site to actually see the buildings.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Um, I really wish I had went there.  You know, I've seen it since, uh, you know --
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  -- things have been cleared away.  Yeah.  
R:  Oh really?
L:  I mean it's -- yeah, it just cleared away.  I mean, I lived in New York actually for about nine years.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  Uh, and I came back about three years ago so I've been here, you know, a couple of years before nine eleven --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- uh, but, uh, yeah, I really wish I had just gone down.
R:  Oh, that --
L:  I wanted to actually see the devastation.  Because, you know, I've been in the World Trade Towers on many a day.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, taken the Jersey transit trains, you know --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- there and, you know, coming from New Jersey, Hoboken and so forth.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but, uh --
R:  Yeah, that would have been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something to see.
L:  Yeah, I really would have liked to have seen it just to see what the devastation looked like.
R:  I would have even loved to have, you know, to have been one of those that went out -- went out and volunteered.  I mean, obviously with four kids I was not available --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, you know, I had a neighbor who was in E.M.T. and she was actually slotted to go, she never went --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I was like, "God, that'd be nea-"  I mean, not neat but, you know, I think everybody in this country felt like they wanted to do something.
L:  You know what was really horrible about when that happened -- uh, nine eleven happened is that here in Philadelphia, I don't know if you heard, but, uh, down, uh, in University City, over in University City, you know it's where all the colleges are, Pen and Drexel and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, even though it's renamed now.  Uh, what happened was that there were people that were pulling the cab drivers -- you know, if you looked Arab, you know, American --
R:  Oh no.
L:  -- um and Sheiks.  You know, they had nothing to do with this at all, that's Hindu --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but people are so ignorant, you know.
R:  Right, that -- yeah, that's -- that's awful.
L:  Yeah, they're so misinformed, um, they were pulling these people out of cabs, cab drivers, they would, you know, stop them for a ride, would go and, you know, open the, you know, the door, yank them out and beat them up.  I mean they were like -- I mean, really vicious beatings.
R:  Yeah, and that's an awful --
L:  Oh, that's horrible.  Really, really horrible.  I mean and these folks had nothing to do with that.  You know, nothing to do --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- with that massacre.
R:  I know.  Yeah, it -- it was very unfair to them, you know, and I'm -- I'm sure they've taken quite a bit since then, you know, in the -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in the last year and a half.
L:  But, you know, I kind of look at it like ignorance is like a bouncing ball, every race has a time to go through it [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
