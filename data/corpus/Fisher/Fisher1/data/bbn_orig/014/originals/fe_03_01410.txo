L:  Hello, this is Dawn.
R:  Hi, this is, uh, Aton, how you doing?
L:  Great, great.
R:  Um, so I guess the topic is September eleventh?
L:  Okay, yes.  Can I ask a real quick question?
R:  Sure.
L:  What company is this for? [LAUGH]
R:  What company?
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  What the survey or wh- ?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I just know it's a study through the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, oh okay, I know what this is now then, okay.
R:  Oh, you do a lot of these or ...?
L:  No, no.  I -- I remember signing up now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.  So, what changes have I made since September eleventh?  I'm, well, I'm a little more cautious.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, not taking plane rides.
R:  Do you not fly at all or ...?
L:  Um, well, there's been a couple of times we have decided not to.
R:  Really?
L:  Because of -- well, one right after it happened and one recently because of the war.
R:  But -- but you -- you haven't decided not to fly at all?
L:  No, no we haven't made that decision.
R:  But just because of the timing of the two --
L:  Right.
R:  -- flights you had, um, but I guess you're -- you're more -- a little more cautious about when you're gonna fly.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean as far as myself, um, I'm kinda young so, um, I flew right after September eleventh actually, like the first week in October, um, and I've flown a bunch since then.  I mean, I'm not -- I don't not do it but I'm definitely more aware of, you know, feel- -- you know, I mean, you can't help but think about it when you're on a plane ride --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, sometimes, but, uh, I mean I've flown probably at least five or six times since September eleventh and once actually just recently during the war I went to, uh, to Europe which --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- which was a little scary at first but, um, you know, I mean I sort of -- I sort of like to go by, you know, the theory like if something's gonna happen it's gonna happen.  I mean you -- you do what you can and minimize the risk you're in but I'm not gonna, you know, live in fear and stop, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going out all together.  Um, but, uh, you know, I mean, I guess -- I guess everybody sort of thinks twice, you know, on plane rides, you know, onc- -- since it happened.  Um, I guess the other thing is, you know, you sort of just -- I mean, I go to, um, school at the University of Maryland which is, uh, you know, pretty close to DC, about seven miles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, being that close like we hear things all the time, you know, about threats or, you know, one day, I think, a couple of weeks ago they said, you know, "Don't go into DC on Friday" you know, they think something's gonna happen.  So, it's -- I mean being in that area it's sort of like a constant, you know, stuff might happen.  So, you know, you're aware but, you know -- I mean, every time they like raise a terror alert, you know, I can't -- I don't really, like, go into hiding or anything like that.
L:  Well, neither do we.  We --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, have you changed the way you do thing financially since then?
R:  Financially?  What do you mean?
L:  I mean, just not spending as much money because of the economy?
R:  Um, I mean, I would say probably not.  I think that for me, since I'm in college, it just sort of, you know, depends on, you know, the money I have [LAUGH] at the moment.  Um, so I don't -- I'm not really at a point where I can, you know, uh, spend more, spend less to, you know, help the economy or -- or to save.  
L:  Mm.
R:  It just sort -- you know, not driven by that.  But, um, I would say, like -- I mean, also being close to DC, you know, when it happened, you know, I knew a couple of people that had relatives that died, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as well -- as well as, like, plenty of people that, you know, had, uh, parents that worked at the Pentagon or, you know, World Trade Center and so, you know, just being around them, you know, you sort of -- you sort of think more about, you know, th- -- people that are close to you and, sort of, you know, maybe things that you wouldn't have thought about as much you -- I -- at least I sort of think about more, you know, just 'cause, you know, you never know what -- what can happen.
L:  It seems like it was closer to you than -- I'm in Ohio.
R:  Oh, you're in Ohio?
L:  So, yeah, it didn't -- it didn't affect me as much as it might have.
R:  Yeah, that was the interesting thing because, I mean, I was, you know, I was right there and it was like -- I mean, it was a, you know, a big obviously story for everybody in the country but, like, for us it was sort of like a local story, like this is -- or at least the Pentagon part of it, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this is happening in our backyard and, you know, our -- our school, like, we closed the next day and, you know, people thought maybe they would target our school, you know, 'cause we're a big college campus and, you know, um, so it just sort of like, you know -- I mean, I was just saying, I was on another one of these calls with somebody, uh, um, it's for me being, you know, being young, being twenty one, like, before September eleventh, I mean, really never had like any kind of war, you know, that would make me think.  So, this is the first thing really that -- you know, before I was sort of like a peaceful and, you know, prosperous time to me, you know, growing up as a young person and then after September eleventh it was really a dramatic shift in just how I think about, you know, the world and what can happen, you know, because I had never, you know, really been forced to, you know have -- been confronted with something like that before.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean people of -- you know, older people, you know, of course have Pearl Harbor and things like that but for peop- people my age growing up it was like the first thing that really, you know, sort of caused you to think and, you know, realize that, you know, noth- -- the sort of, uh, you know, minute details of your life aren't as important as some other things.
L:  You know, it's funny though.  I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm in my thirties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and this was totally the -- September eleven's probably the biggest thing that happened in my life as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we had, other than, I think, Vietnam, there wasn't too many -- nothing catastrophic like this.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's really ever [LAUGH] been anything like --
L:  No.
R:  -- like it.  I mean, you know, asides from -- I mean, just of, you know, on American soil, you know, of that, you know, randomness of, you know, innocent people killed and just, you know, total, you know, destruction, I don't think has ever been, you know, witnessed.  So, I mean -- I mean nobody really knew, you know, how to react or what to do or, you know, what to change.  I mean, I know a lot of people have said, um, you know they got more patriotic.  I mean, I'd say I was a little bit but -- like I remember I came home and, you know, my parents had an American flag in the window, which is like something they've never ever done before but, you know, I guess right after September eleventh that was, you know, what people were doing.  They want- -- it meant something else having an American flag.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, than before.  So, I guess, you know, that was one way.  Uh, but I mean, even, you know, almost two years later like I thin- -- I would say it's still, you know, I still think -- I mean, you still hear, you know, reference to it.  You know, there's still, you know, major affects of it even this long later.  Um, so, I mean, I don't know.
L:  Well, its affected our -- our family financially because my husband owns a small business.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And after September eleventh, um, there was a dramatic decrease in our business.
R:  What -- what kind of business is he in?
L:  He's a graphic artist.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And it's just people cut advertising.  Um, it was kinda a trickle down effect from other things.  Big companies that had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- been hit harder didn't use -- use us for advertising and now, um, our financial life is a whole lot different than it was two years ago.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, we have to be much more careful and we -- we think a lot more before we buy anything --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because of -- because of that.  And before that we had never had anything like that happen to us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I think al- -- like I also, um, have worked at a few newspapers as -- um, and, you know, you just see -- I mean, even looking at jobs, you know, for places I apply or, you know, whatever people are -- you know, have less openings than before and, I mean, it's just -- as far as the economy, I think, you know, everything -- I mean it was so good for, you know, so long and then--
L:  Right.
R:  -- something like this hap- -- it's just such a dramatic shift that, you know, some people weren't prepared, some people, you know, were just like --
L:  And we live in a big manufacturing town -- we -- we --
R:  Oh, really?  Where -- where in Ohio?
L:  Toledo.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we have lots of factories here and there is a huge amount of  people, um, have -- who have lost their jobs recently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they think that that's also a trickle down, um, because those people aren't selling cars and, um -- it just seems -- and it might be partially the war too, I'm not sure.  But, um --
R:  Yeah, I mean it -- it certainly hasn't gotten better.  I mean, you know, maybe people have -- people, I guess, usually think war, you know, helps the economy of production but I don't know that it -- that it has --
L:  I don't think it's helped anything. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so much this time.  Actually I have -- a good friend of mine goes to school out in, uh -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Boulen[?] Green.
L:  Ohio?
R:  Yeah.  So, I --
L:  That's a half hour from here.
R:  Yeah.  So, I --
L:  My son takes a gifted class there.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I went up there one time, uh, Toledo area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah, we -- we're down there quite often, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Are -- have you always lived in Ohio or ...?
L:  Yeah, I -- except for I went to college in Florida.
R:  Oh really?  What --
L:  Yeah, I -- I went to a small church kinda college.  It was a -- it's called Warner Southern and I -- I just -- I got an associates degree there.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, that's the only time I've ever been out of the -- the city.
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, to go to college.
R:  Yeah.
L:   So ...
R:  I'm actually going, uh, to Orlando this summer.
L:  What -- what --
R:  To work, uh, to work at a newspaper there.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, so it should be -- it should be fun --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- time in the summer.
L:  Is -- is it -- I think it's called the Orlando Sentinel.
R:  Yeah, the Orlando Sentinel is where -- it's where I'm working.  So, I'll see all that, you know, Disney stuff and, uh, and all that craziness, I guess, in the summer.
L:  Oh, you know, we -- I -- when I -- when I went to college it was down in Florida and, um, we got passes there for Disney.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yep.  But this isn't talking about September eleventh, is it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  But, but, um -- so, yeah, I think that it's drastically changed our lives.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know maybe you're younger --
R:  Do you have, uh, do you have children or ...?
L:  I have four children.
R:  Four children.  What -- what ages are they?
L:  Thirteen, eleven, six and three.
R:  And, I guess, I mean for them as we- -- you know, as well, you know, I'm sure they had --
L:  Um, there was a lot of questions.  Um, I remember the day I picked them up from school, we were all -- I remember there was a bunch of us parents standing outside and we were ...
