R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Mary.
R:  I'm Michele.
L:  Hi, Michele.  Uh, where are you calling from?
R:  Caitland, Ohio.
L:  Caitland, Ohio.  Oh, I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh.
L:  And how'd you find out about this?
R:  Actually, online a couple of months ago.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What, uh, what location on line did you find it with?
R:  Um, there's a website called big big savings and they post a lotta stuff like freebies or places --
L:  Really?
R:  -- to do surveys.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Very -- very interesting! [LAUGH]
L:  Never heard of it.  It's called big big savings?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, mm-kay.
R:  Yeah, go in -- go in and go to the forums and you might get yourself some free stuff! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, [SIGH] I suppose we better stick to topic. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Being as that's what they called about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So anyway, the topic was, what, uh, changes, uh, if any, have been made since September eleventh occurrence and how you are looking, doing or what not!
R:  Hm.
L:  So what, uh, what's up with you?
R:  Well, it didn't change my life as far as doing things a lot, you know what I mean?  I didn't change how I act or -- or things that I go out and do, any more than I did before.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, I don't know. [LAUGH]  I mean, of course I was influenced by it, but as far as, you know, buying things or, I don't know, you know, just stuff.  I di- -- that didn't really change it.  How about you? [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, I would say it probably made more of an impact on us than that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the, uh, uh, various things I would say would've changed, uh, for us, um, you know, I think we kinda lost our kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] trust and kinda like our assumption that life is pretty normal and nice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the people around you are pretty normal and nice, as opposed to now it's, uh, you look at people and wonder, you know, are you here legally or illegally in our country?
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]  I guess that's just being paranoid.
L:  Are you an illegal alien?  Do you have the right to be here?  And, if you're here legally, are you doing the right thing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, so I guess it's made us more cautious.
R:  Mm.
L:  Especially of, uh, foreigners because obviously --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a group of 'em that are doing such a good job on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing the right things.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  And [LIPSMACK] it's also made us more wary of, uh, shutting our doors and locking our doors and being more cautious of, you know, should we go down to the mega mall or should we not --
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  -- go down to the mega mall?  What's going on politically?  It may not be a good deal! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I know my husband, he travels a lot, uh, for his job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's had to make some changes.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh, yeah.  That -- especially when it first happened.  He had to drive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some places that he used to fly --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- because he couldn't get a plane.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he then -- when he could get a plane, he then had to, uh, show up two and three hours ahead of schedule, you know, just to get on the plane --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, to go through all the procedures.  Uh, we left, uh, the week after -- my daughter and I did, uh, we had some place scheduled to be [LIPSMACK] and -- on a plane -- and we had to leave, also, earlier --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because, uh, you know, they were going through all our luggage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of my friends had a, um -- that went with us -- had a fingernail file, you know, the kind that collapses down.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  They didn't think anything of it, I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't think things like that if you don't have that kind of a criminal mind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, of course the people looking, did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, you know, and it was confiscated, and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, understandably, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, those kind of changes, um, you know, time wise we have made.
R:  Hm.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, see, I've never gotten -- you know, I've never flown any ways, so that didn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  That's why it didn't influence me on that behalf.  And I've always been a little paranoid, so as far as being cautious and stuff, so it's just kinda like, okay, yeah, I know now I'm paranoid for a reason! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, there's a lot of evil out there.
R:  Yeah, there is.
L:  There's a lot of people doing wrong.  And s- not everything that people do or think or say is right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't care what people say --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And another thing that has changed is that we -- we've got, uh, four children, our youngest now is sixteen, but [LIPSMACK] we have changed in the fact that we sat down with 'em and kind of gave them a, what maybe considered politically incorrect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't care, I look at it from reality, and say, "Hey, you know, there are some people out there, including you know, things like muslims and what not, their so-called religion --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is evil, it is wrong, and it's do- making these people, you know, mindlessly do some really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stupid, wrong and wicked things, and this is not to be tolerated and it's -- you don't care culturally, if it's cultural garbage or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the culture stuff, there are things culturally that are wrong --
R:  Mhm.
L: "-- period,  Okay?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I said, you know, "This is not right and you need to learn about -- a little bit about this so you can understand what's wrong with these people and be very wary of them, uh, because, you know, that is an undermining of everything that they do.  Th-- it's a framework from where they come from --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and so you've gotta be very careful with those kind of things".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, you know, so we -- we've done a lot of educating of our kids from that standpoint so that they can be much more discerning --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and definitely not accepting of so called other, you know, cultural things that are definitely wrong.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  So, it's changed us from that standpoint.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think another thing that's changed is that we are more conscious of people who hurt and we've spent more time praying for people who lost loved ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And our -- I know our church has.  And, you know, realize that there's other people around, you know, obviously besides us in our own neighborhood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it's made -- made us more aware from that standpoint.  I don't know about you, did any of that kinda happen around where you live?
R:  Well, um, actually, where I live, about -- n- not even twenty miles from me I'd say, this was, well, maybe two months ago, there was that guy smuggling people into United States.  Did you hear about this?
L:  No, but they're happening all over the place, right?
R:  Well, he was, uh, giving -- getting birth certificates and stuff for people who had died and -- and giving them to these people and, you know, he was from twenty miles away, and h- -- but he'd been doing this ever since September eleventh.
L:  Oh, great guy.
R:  Yeah.  And they just busted him like, two months ago or, you know, just --
L:  Good for them!
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]  But, you know, that's kinda like, okay, that hits home 'cause it's so close, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Illegal alien --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- trafficking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, that's so wrong.
R:  And it was -- it was like, you know, it was people that were associated with, um, those groups, you know.
L:  Doesn't surprise me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have lousy values, they don't care about lives, the only thing that counts is themselves, money and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We don't need that kinda stuff.
R:  No, I know, they're so brainwashed, you know, there's [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I mean, th- those group of people, if you read anything about the news and what not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm not talking about the liberal media who tries to paint everything wonderful --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm talking about the reality of these kids, you know, th- over in that -- those countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they teach their kids, like in Palestine, that it's great to grow up to be a suicide bomber --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and blow up, you know, and stuff like that.  And they -- they do that to their little kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they say[?] brainwash 'em into evil.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, that's the kind of -- I don't care what you say -- culturally, that stinks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that's so wrong.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  You know.  So -- and then people who do perpetrate evil like September eleventh, another thing is that, you know, we've come to think more in terms of, hey, that is definitely a wrong act to do -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it should have consequences.  And those consequences, you take those many lives, my goodness, you need to pay the price.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it's -- that's just not to be done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you just don't get away with that kinda junk.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.
L:  So, it's made us a lot more aware of that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'm -- yeah, as far as what I was saying as not physically aware, just as my -- how I act in public and things has -- hasn't changed but my self awareness has.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like --
L:  Mm, not exactly, but ...
R:  I still go out and enjoy life and have fun but there's, you know, it's still in my head that okay, all this stuff has gone on and ... you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I still go out and --
L:  [SIGH] --
R:  -- do whatever, you know, go out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to eat or go to the mall.
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you be just a bit more ...
R:  Cautious.
L:  Discerning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cautious and so [NOISE] less accepting of maybe people who, you know, run around and try to look good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, even people like, um, Ted Bundy and Geoffrey Dalmer[?] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all those wicked people who bumped off oodles and oodles of serial killer stuff --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- they ran around looking good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And did i- lots and lots of evil [COUGH] when you least suspected it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's -- I'd say it's -- it's changed, um, you know, there have been lot of things, like you say, some things have stayed the same --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- you know, uh, we're still flying, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband's still flying.  That -- that hasn't changed any.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And so, [SIGH] oh, some of my political views probably have changed to be a lot more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- conservative! [LAUGH]  I don't know about you, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I, uh, definitely, um, [COUGH] -- things like that make me [LIPSMACK] very disturbed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... other than that [SIGH], so not much has, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- changed on your end then, I take it?
R:  Yeah.  Well, not as, you know, as acting as in like, acting
