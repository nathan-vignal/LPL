R:  Hi, this is [inaudible].
L:  Hi, my name is Margot.  [PAUSE]
R:  Hi, Margot.  [PAUSE]
L:  Yes.  And what's the topic again?
R:  Um, how our life has changed how -- since September eleventh.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] all right, um  well, I didn't want us to travel by plane after that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] when we took a trip in to LA, uh, we live in Mason[?], Arizona --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I was kinda scared, you know, but, um, and then we traveled to LA in, uh, was it Feb- yeah, February.  February we had a trip and it was something that we were given as a gift.  It was someth- we participated in a, um, something and it was -- so it was presented to us as a -- as a gift.  And so we went ahead and went and -- and I felt safe for being with my husband but I -- I was glad that I didn't travel that soon after September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have you traveled by plane since then?
R:  No.  I haven't [LAUGH] traveled by plane, on purpose!
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  On purpose.
L:  We usually only go on one plane trip for the year.
R:  Uh-huh.  And, um, I was supposed to and then I- I just didn't feel comfortable with it, so I just decided not to.  So all my traveling has been by car.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I always feel better traveling by car.  So more in control and you can go where you want and if I go to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- go to cities or states where I have family I can, you know, I'm not -- if you go by plane and someone picks you up I have to always go where they wanna go or when they wanna go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So   But after September eleventh I watch the news more.  [LIPSMACK] I, um, I watch the -- I watch the local and the national news more and I also read, um, more of the news in the newspaper after that.  And I think I was more aware of things.  And I watched and I was more careful too and I -- I made sure I locked my doors and my van and, you know, sometimes I'd go out a- to get into my van and it wasn't -- and I forgot to lock it.  I mean, it's in the covered patio but we don't have a -- a carport, we don't have a garage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I locked my van more often, I was more aware of keeping it locked and -- and just watching, you know, um, for all kinds of safety issues.
R:  Ri- --
L:  Watching, looking out for strangers and I always take my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- take my k- children to school and drop 'em and pick 'em up and   They've had some +incidents right in their grade school, where people are patrolling, tr- and trying to lure kids into their, um, car with money or candy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Happened in the last month.  And it's happened at a s- school in Tempi also.  My husband works in the Tempi school district.
R:  Uh-huh.  I --
L:  And so, you know, just any kind of safety issue is just like, you know, and you watch and  [LIPSMACK] and everything but it's uh --
R:  And i- and I'm the same way too.  I was, uh, really careful before but I'm even more careful now than I was, um, before.  I was always one to lock my door but now [LAUGH] it's like, I make sure I have my chain on my door, my deadbolt lock, everything is, um, [LIPSMACK] locked up.  I live in Michigan and I live in a college town.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh [MN].
R:  So, you know, there's just a little bit of everyone here and -- and you just never know.  And, um, my boyfriend happens to work for the Defense Department.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, it's the -- it just, you know, it's like -- and basically he tells me, you know, "It's okay to fly.  It's not okay to fly", and -- and that's the main reason why I haven't flown, because they don't even feel that it's really safe.  So, better safe than sorry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So  I -- so I don't bother to, um, so when we see each other, 'cause he doesn't live in Michigan, so when we see each- one another, we always travel by car, um, instead of flying.
L:  Right.
R:  It takes a little while longer but at least the two of us feel a lot more safe than, um, actually travelling by phone.
L:  Right.
R:  And one other thing, I -- I've always been a news watcher, you know, first thing in the morning I get up and watch the news 'cause I'm a school teacher also.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so first thing in the morning I get up and I watch the news.  But one way that it's affected me is the way, um, my family.  I'm -- because I'm the only one that lives here, none of my family lives in the same town that I live in.
L:  That's how I am too. 
R:  And -- yeah -- 
L:  I'm the only one --
R:  -- and I've got i- --
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] that lives here.  I ha -- my -- my closest relative is -- well, actually, my sister moved to Phoenix a year and a half ago but before that she got a job teaching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- h- here.  She teaches for the Phoenix d- Day School for the Deaf.  She teaches deaf, um, school.  She teaches English and History to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- high school students.  Deaf sch- uh, students.
R:  And it's hard.  So that's -- that's one of --
L:  And up until then my closest relative was four hundred miles away.
R:  Oh my!  No -- well, mine is only two hours away.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I just keep more -- definitely keep in contact with them a lot more.  Um, if I'm leaving to go somewhere then I make sure that I call one of my family members and tell them where I'm going and give them numbers.  And then when I get there I make sure I check in with them again, and just try to be a little bit more careful about, you know, where I'm going --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and making sure that someone knows where I'm going.  Um, for something -- oh, you just never know what could possibly happen.  So 
L:  Yeah, normally only the people that we're gonna visit, or my in laws, you know, know we're when gonna be gone or something, or where we're gonna be.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm a little more careful about that now too, in leaving numbers.  And what we've -- we do also is that I always stop the mail, we stop the paper, um, and we con- we contact a real close friend or neighbor that can watch our house, and sometimes they'll even come in and close the curtains and open 'em.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have a drink of water, watch TV for a while, you know, and make it look like somebody's here, and they'll park their car in the driveway for a while.  And we usually call the police and notify them we're gonna be gone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything.  And so, [LIPSMACK] we do that kinda thing and we're -- and I think I've emailed more too, I -- I make more contact with my family because you realize something can happen and your life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- could just be snuffed out in a m- second, you know, and things like this can happen. And so it seemed like life is more precious and my family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- seem more precious to me, and I'm away from them and it -- it's been really hard because I moved down here with a girlfriend, I was single, we both met our husbands here, and my husband will probably never change his job, he'll probably never move out of state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  H- h- he got -- he has a doctorate degree and, um, he'll probably stay here, where he's -- where he's at.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I have to always travel a long distance -- I'm twelve hundred miles from where I grew up.
R:  Oh my!  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- I grew up in Wyoming.
R:  And I --
L:  North western Wyoming.
R:  And I think it's hard just being two hours away, 'cause my family is really close --
L:  Oh, I know that --
R:  -- and there's eleven of us, so 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I would love to live two hours from family --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that would be wonderful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And so, you know, I'm the only one -- well, myself and I've got two other, um, siblings that don't live there, but all the rest of 'em, you know, they -- well, I'll go home and they're always doing something together, you know, bringing all of their families.  And so you -- you miss that.  I miss that aspect of it.  And -- and not being readily accessible and them not being readily accessible to me.
L:  Yeah.  One -- one great thing is, our family reunions on both sides are usually in the same state.
R:  Oh.
L:  And lots of times we can coordinate 'em and because of where they, um, where relatives live and everything, when we go on our trips, we can usually see family on -- on my husband's side and my side, and two different years we were able to do two family reunions, one on his side and one on my side, the same, um, week.
R:  That's great.
L:  And it worked out.  And -- and this year we're doing the same thing, we're going to a camping reunion up in Utah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the beautiful mountains up there.  And -- and then we've got my mother's seventieth birthday re- um, party.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And it's actually -- the r- the day we stop the reunion we start the party for my mother!
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So we're doing it all -- and it's about the same area.
R:  Cool.
L:  And it's usually kind of a central area to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we have to drive, oh, you know, five hundred -- about five hundred, six -- six hundred miles, to get up there.  But my mother lives, um, four hundred miles away, so we usually stay with her --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- even if we're going up to the reunions on the -- my husband's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- side of the family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we're [several inaudible words] so, my husband gets twenty one days off but he doesn't usually take that many [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he can't afford to take that many.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But at least we get to travel and [LIPSMACK] -- and I just -- well, th- the older I get too, I mean, you don't appreciate your mother as much as until you get married --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and have your own children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so when something like a big disaster happens, you really, you know, your prioritize and you really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- realize what's really important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  And that's -- and you realize how --
L:  -- and that is your loved ones, you know, that's what's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so important.
R:  Yeah.  I -- and I [inaudible] --
L:  I've got four children.
R:  Whoa!
L:  E- except my --
R:  Yeah, it always comes back to your, you know, to your family.
L:  -- my youngest is turning eight and my oldest will be tw- turning twenty, I've got [MN] yeah, they're seven, eleven, uh, fourteen and nineteen right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  My nineteen year old is in Indiana.  So 
R:  Oh, that's close to me!  [LAUGH]
L:  He's in -- he's in Huntingburg, Indiana, and --
R:  Oh, I don't know where Huntingburg is.
L:  That's near Ja- it's -- he's -- he -- I don't even know, I had to look on the atlas to know where it is.  Actually, he f- he flew to Louisville, Kentucky, he's serving a mission for our church.
R:  Oh wow!
L:  So he flew to Louisville and then he was in Lexington and then he was in some other small places in Shelbyville.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then he was transferred to, um, Huntingburg.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- it's pretty small and it's down in the south part of the state.
R:  Oh wow -- okay, yeah, that's a little ways from me.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Um, another way that I've been affected is with my job.  They are, uh, much more strict
