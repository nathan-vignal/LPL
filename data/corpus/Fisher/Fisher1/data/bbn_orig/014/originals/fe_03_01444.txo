L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Yolanda MacLeod.
R:  My name is Shelley Burn.
L:  Nice to meet you, Shelley.
R:  Nice to meet you, Yolanda.
L:  [NOISE] So, I suppose we're supposed to talk about how, um, we've changed our life since September eleventh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the incident that took place in oh one.  You wanna start and tell me?
R:  Well, um, physically I haven't made any changes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mentally I've made a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, how so?
R:  Um, I used to be, um, very trusting [NOISE] and, um, very safe and secure feeling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I am not any of them things anymore.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I, you know, I'm pretty much on egg shells, because now you, you don't know, anymore.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  We've been invaded.
L:  That's true, that's true.  Um, for me, it was a surprise, and yet again it wasn't.  Only because, like, I read the Bible on a regular basis, and one of the things that I learned was that Jesus said there would be wars and reports of wars, and see that you're not disturbed, and that nation would rise up against nation.  It was just interesting because, although I read that scripture many times, I guess it didn't hit me that it would be right here in the United States.  I knew that they were warring in other countries, and that they've done so, like, for years, but it was just a surprise [NOISE] when it actually hit so close to home.  I live in Philadelphia and it's, you know, for the planes to hit New York, I mean, that's not far at all.  So many of my friends were affected, and there were fourteen people from my religion that were, um, either missing or declared dead, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that was, that was very [NOISE] hard.  It was hard.  But one of the things that, ah, helped us all [NOISE] was in the Bible --
R:  Oh, is --
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] -- in my car.
R:  Is this your phone or my phone?
L:  No, I'm outside and the wind was blowing, so I'm gonna get in the car.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  So you won't hear all that noise.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, I --  I know that it's important to be on guard and to be careful of my surroundings, and I also know that reading the Bible has proved to be true in many instances, so in one way, in a large way, it has made me, ah, stronger in my faith, and in another way it's just made me realise how vulnr- vulnerable we all very much are. [LAUGH]
R:  We surely are.  None of us are infallible.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, um, I didn't, um, -- I wasn't a real religious person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I was disabled.  That's -- I saw September eleventh on television.
L:  Okay.
R:  I happened to be up and I saw the second plane hit, and I was -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- just mortified that that could happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I was more angry that our government allowed it to happen.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Because they knew.
L:  I thought that was interesting when they showed -- like later, clippings that, you know, there -- they had been warned, they started to go out and do something, and then they thought it was a false alarm and so they kinda went back home.  [LAUGH] Like, oh, my goodness.
R:  I think the United States is very lax in, in things like we were just talking about.  That, you know, they're not -- that they're infallible, that they --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- can't be touched, and --
L:  Right.  In this day and age, I mean, unfortunately it took something like that to happen, but whew -- 
R:  I think --
L:  -- that was like really a hard blow.
R:  I think it could have been avoided.
L:  It could have.
R:  Um -- they ultimately are responsible for coming over here and doing it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I blame our government for allowing it.  I think they knew.
L:  It was just a horrible horrible incident.
R:  It is a horrible thing --
L:  And --
R:  -- and I think about them poor people almost every day.
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  That lost loved ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --  and just the domino effect that it had on people's lives, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  It's just a awful awful thing.
L:  Because one of my friends -- in fact we have the same name, [LAUGH] her name is Yolanda also, she was explaining to me that, um, she was running late for work, and she's usually never late for work, and then after she got to work, she left the building.  [LAUGH] She said she'd never leave the building 'cause there's so many things that she could get while she's inside.  She -- but she left the building to get something, and then when she went -- as she was approaching the building again, she saw the first plane hit.  Not the building where she worked, but the second one.  And she just couldn't believe it, and she kinda just stood there, like in shock.  She said, and then, you know, everybody, of course was, like, oh, my god, what happened, this that and the other, and then the second plane hit, she said, and she knew that that was no accident.  And you know, the first one -- like many people said, the first one you think, wow, I can't believe it happened.  Second one, she said she knew it was no accident.  So as she was trying to run in the opposite direction because she didn't know what to then expect, she said the crowds were like pushing her forward to where, you know, the incident took place.  She said it didn't seem like -- she said it didn't matter how fast she was running, it seemed like they were just pulling her back, you know, and she, she saw so many things that television did not reveal.  Like the people that fell out of those -- that were jumping --
R:  The trauma.
L:  -- out of those windows were on fire, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was just devastating.  To see another human being on fire, and then the people she knew that she worked with were in those buildings.  Like I said we're Jehovah's Witnesses, so we knew that there were other members of our religious affiliation there, and it was just so traumatic.  It was so traumatic.
R:  Oh, my heart goes out to her.  I'll never take public transportation in any form.  Ever.
L:  Well you know what, I was always afraid of flying because I -- I was, like, -- I never even thought of terrorists.  I was just afraid of flying because there's no, like, air patrol.  In the event that the plane goes down, you're going down.
R:  Thank you, that's what I always said -- 
L:  But, you know --
R:  -- you're going down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, if you're in a car accident, of course somebody could come and help you out, whether they're, you know, with the police, the fire -- a -- a citizen could come and help you out --
R:  That's what I always said, -- 
L:  -- but a plane --
R:  -- "If I break down, I can walk".
L:  Right.  But, you know, a plane is something different, but in light of what has happened September eleventh, it's like, you don't even know what to expect -- forget the plane falling down, you gotta worry about somebody's gonna, you know, threaten your life.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So...
R:  I know that I'll never take public transportation, so travelling for me is out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it doesn't hurt my feelings, I'd rather stay home and be safe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, ...
L:  Or walk or get in your own car.
R:  I figure with my luck I'd be on the plane that they terrorized.
L:  Exactly, right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  Oh, my.  That's just such an awful thing.  I was kind of, um, pleased though, um, last year, when that time came they didn't -- like, ...  Sometimes a person could be in a process of healing, and then -- I thought maybe they were gonna overdo it and just replay all of the devastating scenes over and over again, and that would just hurt all the grieving families, but I think they were a bit more considerate.
R:  Up here -- and see up here, we saw it different.  I'm from Maine --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- well, I'm from New Hampshire, but I live in Maine.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  And um, we really felt that they overkilled it up here.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  We were all complaining up here, enough, enough already.
L:  Oh, right, right. 
R:  You know, you can't look at the little kids crying anymore, you can't look at the parents crying anymore, how -- you know, it was just awful.  Day after day, all day long.
L:  Oh, my.  See, it was a little, a little better here.  I don't know what they -- they --  they did in New York, but it was just a little better here -- oh, no, I don't know.  I don't know.
R:  It --
L:  'Cause -- 'cause I was hoping like, on the radio, I was hoping that they didn't play the last conversations of some of the loved ones that died over and over again, because I just think that that would hinder anybody who's trying to heal.
R:  To heal, absolutely.  That was what we were saying, you know. How many times do the families have to watch all this on the television?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And we don't even have cable up here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And every channel, all day long, for weeks, that's all there was.  It was just awful.
L:  See, that's not good.  That's not good.
R:  Yeah, I didn't -- it got to the point where I didn't pick up a newspaper, I didn't pick up a magazine, I just couldn't take it anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, the morning I -- I cried all day long the morning I watched it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was just awful.
L:  'Cause it was like, when it happened, it was so devastating whether people were there, knew people that were there, or not, it was just so devastating that it was as if the entire United States was just closed, you know what I mean?  Like, like for days, for weeks --
R:  Right.  And it's not, like, --
L:  -- that's all we thought of.
R:  It's not, like, it was an accident, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- an accidental fire or anything.
L:  Right, it was deliberate. 
R:  -- which would have been bad enough in its own right, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to have done the way that it was done i- is just mortifying to me.  It's -- I never thought about it happening over here, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Vietnam, World War One, World War Two, Korean War, it's all over there in another planet in my mind, you know.
L:  Yeah.  And then --
R:  And now --
L:  And I think too, like, there was another plane crash, but it wa- it was said that it didn't have anything to do with, you know, terrorist attacks, but another plane crash in New York like shortly after that.  It was like, how many more things can that city, or the people that reside there take?
R:  I don't have a lot of faith in our government, and I don't believe almost anything -- I believe almost nothing that they say.  And I know that --
L:  I can understand why.
R:  -- that's -- you know, a lot of people tell me I'm very cynical, I need to have more faith, I need to think more positive, and I just can't bring myself to do that when I've watched the track record.
L:  Well, I'm going to tell you, I -- you know, I understand from the Bible that we have to
