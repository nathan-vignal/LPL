L:  Hi, my name's Diane.
R:  Hi, I'm Theresa.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh, what kind of changes have you, uh, made?  I mean, we haven't been on an airplane since then [LAUGH].
R:  For a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  No, not since September eleventh.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- actually fly that much but I don't think I would fly now knowing what I know about September eleventh and I know I'm a lot more cautious when I go out to the store, kinda looking at, you know, different things and people and just kinda, you know, being more aware of my surroundings.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you're like that too. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, I think I've tried to caution my family and stuff to be aware and, uh, to go ahead and tell people, you know, if you -- if something's suspicious go ahead and report it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, for real.  You notice any little thing, you know.
L:  So -- yeah.  Well, do you live in a big city or ...?
R:  Oh, I actually live in Columbus, Ohio, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's about, I'm thinking, two million people here so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we have a, uh, large community of like Somalian's and stuff that live here too so, um, I'm always leery with different things like that.  I mean, not necessarily people in general but, you know, you're just always watching out.  I hate -- I hate to say this but I feel like I'm more cautious of Arab looking people --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- because of September eleventh and I ha- -- you know, I don't want to stereotype anybody but it makes me feel bad 'cause it's like I don't know for sure, do you have a bomb, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Sure.  Well, I -- I live in Kansas City and I know that prior to September eleventh that they had had a convention here and they were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talking about, you know, being against the US and stuff here and I think they even, uh, you know, had like, um, things over their head so that people couldn't identify 'em and stuff and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and then, you know, here we are in the middle of the country and you know it's not on the coast, like you think that would be more vulnerable but --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- I just think it shows that we're not invincible.
R:  That's true.  I think that's -- that's probably the main thing for me that -- that really changed was, you know, here I thought, "Well, we're above all that" kinda, you know, we are, um, we don't notice, you know, they can't touch us kinda thing 'cause we're away from those borders of all those other people, I guess I kinda thought.
L:  Right.
R:  And now it's like, you look at it and you go, "Oh my gosh, they could have -- you know, they can do this to us from all the way over there".  They were thinking about this all the time and, I think, it also makes me think about that, um, in a way we are more money driven than a lot of countries because, you know, those guys that took those, uh, classes to fly those planes into buildings, they basically, um, you know, they didn't even check their references or anything they just said, "Oh, you got the cash?  Okay, come on".
L:  Sure.
R:  And when I thought about it that way I'm like, you know, where did we go from being -- I realize you need to trust people but, come on, we're talking about somebody who could probably fork out like twenty or thirty thousand dollars all at once and nobody even asked a question like, "Where are you getting this cash?"
L:  Right and then there's like that James Woods that saw those guys on the plane and alerted authorities and --
R:  Yeah, and they did nothing, you know [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know -- but, I think, you know their element of surprises has been given up as far as that's concerned but then I know that they've trained as far as, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, driving big trucks and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, you know, it's like I've noticed I've gone down the highway and, you know, you wanna look at people to see if they look --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- like 'em.
R:  If they look that category.
L:  Or Muslim or something like that.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I -- you know, and I think too what has changed is I get really mad when the celebrities talk out about, you know, what the government's trying to do and, you know, how --
R:  Oh, me too, girl. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's -- I mean, I -- I am willing to accept a little bit of infringement on my privacy for my safety.
R:  I am too.  I -- I totally agree with you there.  I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I hate the way that they stand out as if they cornered the market on knowledge when it comes to stuff like that, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You're like, you're an actor, what do you know about foreign policy, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, have you been there and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, and then I look at the news and I see that, you know, of course there's going to be some people that don't want Salot[?], uh, Saddam out of -- out of power but, you know, then again he was terrible to his own people.
R:  Yeah, that was just -- I mean, even to know that he was that close to what Hitler was like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just says to me we should have done this, you know, a long time ago.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Back in the eighties when we had the chance, we should've -- or back in the early nineties, we should have got rid of him then [LAUGH].
L:  Sure.
R:  You know, that's -- 'cause, you know, these poor  people have suffered long enough and -- and, I think, that we need to take a look at it from September eleventh perspective there and say, "Anyone of these countries hate us with a passion and they could do it again".
L:  Right, 'cause they're raised to not like Americans.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, they -- they preach about it in their Mosques and all that, I mean, we had no --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- idea.
L:  I went, um, to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- before the war was in Yugoslavia I went over there and that's where one of my grandmothers was from and I encountered when we went -- we were with a group and we went to a restaurant and I know there were different pictures on the wall and they're like, "Are you Americans".  We're like, "Yes" you know, and they're like, "Oh, we won't serve you" and, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that was first time I had encountered that kind of anti Americanism.
R:  Wow.
L:  And so now I see it on TV and I think I really can understand, you know, what happening on the news and stuff, that they -- that they'll just top that and, you know, they didn't know us and --
R:  Yeah.  Like, I mean, they've learned that from a very early age.  I guess if you were kinda, I'm gonna say the words "programmed" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to believe that then you would probably do that as well.  I mean --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- if that's your nature, that's what you gonna end up being.
L:  But, you know, I've gone to Europe only a couple -- a couple of times and my dad has, um -- well, my -- she was my grandma's first cousin --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I guess it's first cousin once removed from my dad, and -- and she's in Austria and, you know, I'd like to gone to visit her but with this climate I don't think that I'm as willing to do so and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I know like I have a niece who wanted to go over to Spain and you just think, "Well, that -- that's not wise to do".
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, I mean that's what I changed, mainly my travel plans.  And, I think, I'm watching like Fox News a lot more and that kind of thing.
R:  Oh, yeah, I [LAUGH] -- I watch Fox News too, you're so funny. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, and, you know, then I -- I mean it would just seem so blatant how a lot of the other news channels were trying to mak- -- you know, have negative news and, you know, focus on the --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- negative things that happened, instead it, you know, it was going relatively well over there.
R:  Exactly and then, of course, the one thing they said was like about those relics that we destroyed and everything, you know, it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you don't consider the fact that we freed all these people from an oppressive dictatorship, you just automatically assume that now we've ruined a -- a pot from civilizations beginning --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, what I mean, give me a break.
L:  And we didn't do it, it was the --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, their own people and, you know, we didn't --
R:  They blew up their own oil
L:  -- allow it to happen, it happened is what I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, you know, so I think it's changed my attitude.
R:  Yeah, I --I agree with you.
L:  [LAUGH] A lot but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, mainly it's like travel and, I mean, I haven't really done that, uh --
R:  Yeah, I tend to stay closer --
L:  -- I think, like my husband works in a big building here and he's more concerned about his safety and that kind of stuff.  And it's --
R:  Yeah, I actually came home to be a stay at home mom after all that happened too, because I realized I wanted to spend more time with my family.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  And, uh, just did not want to be away 'cause if something would happen to one of 'em what would I do kinda thing, you know.
L:  Sure.  Well, my husband's work, uh, they've increased the security and stuff.  I used to work there, I used to be able to just go in there and -- and now there's no way I would be able to do that.
R:  I don't blame ya.  I mean --
L:  Sort of, you know, well, they won't let you either and, you know, I can't even go in the garage and that kind of stuff where -- whereas before I was able to do that type of thing.
R:  Yeah, my aunt actually works for the Defense Department, kind of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, they -- they pretty much process all the money that the military's gonna make, uh, for all the war stuff, you know, dishing it out and everything and that's -- that's what happened with them.  They have certain codes and if they come in after September eleventh they can't -- certain people can't even be in the building, only military personnel.
L:  Oh my goodness, yeah?
R:  Yeah, so if she doesn't have that clearance she's not even allowed in to go to work that day.
L:  Oh, well that's something.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, I don't know, I mean, has anything changed for you besides, like, maybe your eating habits, or attitudes, or traveling, maybe just being more alert?
R:  Yeah, definitely more alert.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just more aware of surroundings, kinda watching different people when you go places now that you might not have watched before, that kind of thing for me.
L:  Mhm.  I mean, I don't have Arab neighbit- neighbors but, you know, we did have a friend and, you know, he's divorced from this girl I work with and you wonder what all went on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in that relationship.  What caused them to break up.  I mean, I think a lot of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is just cultural differences --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- contribute to that but, you know, you just don't know.
