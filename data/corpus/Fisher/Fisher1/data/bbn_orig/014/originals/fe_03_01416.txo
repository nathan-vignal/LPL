R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, hi, my name is Peggy and I live in Philadelphia.
R:  Hi, my name is Annette, I live outside of Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh, hi, how you doing, Annette?
R:  Good, how are you today?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.  So, what changes have you made, if any, since September eleventh [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I've always been, uh, a spiritual person but I think I really tried to take one day at a time and, um, look at, you know, what's going on in my family life, my work like, you know, and with the people who are in my, uh, extended family, if you would, since then.
R:  Mm hmm.
L:  And, um, to go to bed, I guess, each day with having, uh, closure, I'd guess you'd say.  You know, not leaving any big loose ends [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my -- you know, I didn't lose anybody in my family, um, that day but --
R:  Oh, did you know anyone?
L:  But, yes, within my, like, my church community one of the young ladies, um, lost her father that day.  And, uh, you know, I think we all lost --
R:  I think we lost some innocence that day.
L:  -- a lot, you know.  Uh, you know, as a -- as a huge community and a small community, you know, we did.  And how about you?
R:  Well, I -- I kind of agree with ya, I think I kind of re-evaluated by life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  As far as what, um, what was important, what's -- you know, and what things weren't as important -- [NOISE], sorry my young son just walked in. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's okay.
R:  Um, I mean, I think part of it was just -- it was so, um, just out of my realm of thought --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that anything like that could happen.  
L:  Mm.
R:  In fact I remember when I first heard about it I was getting my hair cut and someone walked into the store and said, "Oh, planes were, you know, crashed into the Trade Center".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my thought was not commercial liners --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess that was just so far beyond my realm of my belief --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was more -- you know, I was thinking like the airplanes you see --
L:  Yeah, like a two seater type plane.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause I -- it was just -- it was just so out there, I guess.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then, you know, after that I know a lot of people, you know, went that they didn't want to go to malls and stuff like that because of -- they were afraid that, you know, some other attacks gonna happen there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I never really, you know, went into that.  I -- I agree with you, I just kind of, you know, I just kind of reevaluated my life as far as the things that were important with my family and things like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that and just, you know, just kinda like -- I -- I guess you kinda look at, you know, what have we been doing that's important and what's not [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  And refocusing there.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know for me, um, you know I try to look at each person I see each day and appreciate, you know, the person being in my life, even if they're someone who [LAUGH] drives me crazy!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- and I know for a -- you know, for a real immediate affect the -- within two weeks of that I really went from being like a ten hour a day corporate kind of a person to it's a job --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause that was really out of balance in my life even though I've, you know, been living more of a spiritual life for the past eleven years but it was still not in balance there.
R:  Mhm.  Now, do you feel like since -- I mean, I -- I feel like the whole country experienced this but since you were like physically closer, do you think that had a -- more of an impact --
L:  Well, I think that --
R:  --on you?
L:  -- um, for me, uh, I think the time that it happened was just at a time when maybe I was ready to be a little more open to that and life -- um, I'm fifty two years old now.  I had just turned fifty two weeks before that happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for me it was, uh, that whole day and the two weeks after that were like really just looking at, you know, where you are in life.  And, um, 'cause I -- I notice with a lot of my coworkers and some of my family and friends that it had like an immediate impact but it wasn't longer lasting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, and I guess too maybe because of the way I've been brought up and I've lived outside of our country that, um, that's -- that's not a normal thing here but it is pretty much everywhere else.
R:  Right.
L:  So that, um, that level of blanket of security for me just got like pulled down [LAUGH] you know what I mean?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh -- 'cause I've lived in war torn countries before and, um, you know, I think we maybe took that part of it, as a nation, for granted too much.  I think that, um, it's kinda like when you have a catastrophic illness and you get close to -- to dying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it'll either have a completely changed lasting effect on your life or it'll be like, "Oh, ho hum", you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think everybody chooses to respond to that in a different way, you know, um -- you know, and I think it's -- you know, when it's kinda like when it's -- the message is ready for you to get it, you know, the lesson or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  --  otherwise you get it again.
R:  Right.
L:  And, unfortunately, I think that's what's going to happen here.
R:  That it's gonna be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess, I think you have to be open to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To -- like I say what's kind of -- and I think probably -- it's probably what's going on in a person's life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and probably age, like you pointed out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like I'm forty four right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think, you know, as you're older you start looking kind of and evaluating your life a little bit more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whereas, I think, when you're a little younger you're kinda like living here and now and now and not necessarily looking at those types of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to make changes in your life and your -- in what you're doing and [LAUGH] everything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Did it -- did it impact people in your family, in your community, in a way where you saw lasting changes or ...?
R:  Not really.  I mean, the only thing I was concerned about is that I had a brother who -- who travels quite a bit and travels to New York and I knew he was out of town but I just didn't know where.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he actually -- well, he happened to be on an airplane that day --
L:  Oh my Jesus, mercy.
R:  -- and, um, flew in to Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I asked him, I said, "Well, you know, what -- what was that like?" because they were, I think, still in the air when all this was kinda going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he said -- he said he landed and he said the one thing he noticed, um, was that there was somebody with, like, a machine gun at the airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he really didn't think too much about it.  He thought, "Well, maybe something's going on locally".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, of course, he found out, you know, later on what -- what happened and everything but, you know, that was kinda weird.  It was just kinda like -- you know, and that was kind of scary because I was trying to get a hold of my sister in law and to find out what -- you know, during that whole day 'cause, you know, the telephone circuits were just so busy that day.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And trying to get through to people and then I was trying to get through to my sister in law and she was actually at a doctor's appointment and so it was just kinda like this whole stressful day of just making sure that, you know, he was okay.  And -- and thankfully he was and wasn't really anywhere near, you know, anything that had happened but it was enough to kind of put some stress in, you know, and just be worried.  And, like you said, to kind of reassess and, you know, take a look at those family relationships.  I feel like I've made more of an effort to be closer to my family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that regard.  But, I mean, as far as  long lasting change per se, no.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm just listening to what -- [LAUGH] I have some children over here today and what they're doing.  But, um --
L:  Well, the kids know how to take everything in -- in stages. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  If we all had their resilience your life would be different.
R:  Well, that's one of the things, you know, my husband and I are trying to explain September eleventh.  My -- my oldest has just turned six.
L:  Oh my, yeah.
R:  And so trying to put into perspective as far as all the changes and just, you know, because there's been heightened security.  We have a -- Dobbins Air Force base is here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so there's been some heightened, um, security and changes in what they've done and just trying to, you know, explain what happened in September eleventh to him, um, you know, is just kinda -- on their terms and level that they can understand without also scaring them, you know, as well as being kind of an interesting experience.  And he's kinda taken it as, you know, there were bad men who -- who flew an airplane in to a building --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and kind of that's how he's kinda processed that whole thing.
L:  Mm.  Well, he's right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I think, you know, I guess in some respects I'm thankful in that it -- it hasn't affected his day to day life.  It's not something that he's thinking about, worrying about and that type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- [NOISE]
L:  It's got to be harder for kids to even comprehend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all that kind of stuff.
R:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, what did you say?
L:  I said it's got to be very difficult for children to comprehend any -- anything like that because I know for me one of the things that my concern was that week was that when children kept seeing it over and over and over again --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was did they think it was happening over and over and over again.
R:  Right.  Well, and then also, you know, the fear of, you know, could that happen to me or be -- you know, could I -- you know, or the fear of, you know, if I got on an airplane --
L:  Yeah, is that gonna happen?
R:  -- could that happen type thing.  And, you know, I think, well my children
