L:  Hi, I'm Sheryl.  I'm in Georgia.
R:  Hey, I'm Gail, and I'm in Georgia.
L:  Hi, Gail.
R:  How are you, Sheryl?
L:  Uh, all right.  I'm over in Gainsville.  How about you?
R:  I'm down in Stone Mountain.
L:  Cool.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about changes that we made in our lives as a result of September eleventh?  Is that what you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- understood?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, gee whiz, um, mostly none.
R:  Yeah, and that's with me.  You know, I didn't run out and buy duck tape --
L:  No.
R:  -- and I didn't --
L:  No.
R:  -- run out and get gas masks or anything --
L:  No.  
R:  -- like that.  
L:  No.  No.  Uh-huh.  Well, you know, that'd be all more like the current war thing, you know?  They're talking about like September eleventh, two thousand and one, about maybe they wanting to know if you quit traveling and stuff?
R:  I wasn't traveling anyway.  
L:  No, me neither.
R:  I know -- you know, I mean, it did make me look at my, you know, patriotism.
L:  Yeah?  
R:  Um, and of course, I -- I did put up flags, you know, supporting my country.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, you know, like my team --
L:  Yeah?
R:   -- you know, how dare you do that?  There was some anger and some resentment, and mostly it was because of the clip, I don't know if you saw of that day --
L:  Over and over.
R:  -- of that how -- oh, Pakistan, and you know, they're over there dancing and laughing and singing --
L:  Yeah.  The right bastards.  I swear.
R:  -- and you know --
L:  How could you do that?  I mean, we're not even doing that when the people are getting killed in this war now.
R:  And then they --
L:  Nobody's gleefully celebrating anything.
R:  Yeah.  And it -- you know, part of it made me question, you know, okay did I harbor resentment?  No, I kinda felt like -- you know, I didn't want to think I did, but then you know, when I would see somebody, you know, from the Middle East, or you know, if I'm in the gas station or something, you know, I mean, these people probably weren't even from Iraq or -- or you know, Afghanistan or Pakistan, they could have been East Indian, but you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because --
L:  Yeah, because of --
R:  -- I had that mindset, you know?
L:  -- their ethnicity, possibly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't even really feel like I experienced anything like that, Gail.  Um, I mostly had more extra fear that -- that sense of foreboding that something else was going to happen just any time, and it took a really long time for that to diminish.  And then having this start up now with the war, that also made me have lots of extra fear, but you know, I don't -- I don't know that I made any lifestyle changes.  Of course, we flew the flag and everything and that everybody felt all the grief for all of the people that so unjustly died.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really bizarre to have the sky empty for so many days after it happened and everything was just so dead silent, that you couldn't help but think about it.  Of course, if you -- also if you read papers and ever, ever turn on the TV --
R:  It was always there.
L:  You know, it was -- it was ever present and it -- I'm not saying it shouldn't have been, but it was just sort of a first for us right here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was just so different and just so extremely scary.
R:  And, you know, usually like when things that extreme happen, I will watch them over and over and over, but for some reason, that, after that day, I didn't want to see that any more.
L:  You know --
R:  I didn't want to see it at the year anniversary, I just didn't want to -- didn't want to see it any more.
L:  You know, and then I felt like -- I did see it more than one day, but I was sort of felt like an obligation to the people that died, like, I would be turning my back on them if I didn't at least, like, make it a moment, you know?
R:  Yeah, like a memorial?
L:  But then I had to turn it off after it's been on for fifteen or twenty minutes, but I would always -- if it came on or something, I would always just have to have, like, at least a moment just to remember the people that didn't --
R:  Just can-  yeah.
L:  -- know they were going to die when they went to work that day.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And it was just such a horrific thing and it really hasn't -- I mean, here we're not that far from two years away now, you know?  Wh- what, a year and a half, I guess, we'll call it a year and a half.
R:  That it happen?  Well, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's been a year and a half, and it still feels like it was yesterday afternoon in a way.
R:  In a way, yeah, because of what we're doing now.
L:  And then with the people that live there, I can hardly even comprehend how it must be for them, just having it down the street, you know?  I did watch it.  I did watch the films more than once.
R:  And I think, you know --
L:  You know?
R:  I think that, um, you were saying that you had, uh, a greater increase in fear, and I think that was the one thing that I refuse to do, you know?  I -- they could blow me to kingdom come and back, but they are not going to scare me.  It's just not going to work.
L:  Well, I couldn't help it.
R:  I mean -- it was just more with me, it was just anger.  They made me extremely angry to the point where I was, like, you know what?  I couldn't care less if we just wiped out South East -- South East -- uh, South East Asia off the map.
L:  Well, they went --
R:  Period.
L:  -- and did their thing in Afghanistan, you know?  And we have family members that are still deployed there.  Ourselves.  You know, that are still part of that effort to make sure that they don't have any secrecy or way to store their weapons or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so I do know people that are still over there in the service in the army, and then they're -- I know they're still hunting and finding weapons caches and stuff and I think that's probably a good thing.  It -- it makes me feel, I guess, every time I hear about them destroying more of the weapons, a little less dread.
R:  Yeah.  A little bit more relieved.
L:  You know?
R:  Because, you know, it -- I felt also -- I kinda felt like, okay, with everything that went on after that, it was kinda like swatting mosquitos.  Okay, you got this one, here comes another one.  You got this one --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- here comes another one.  You got this -- you know, it's like, is it ever going to stop?
L:  But we're not sneaky people like that, you know?  So, it's so alien to Americans, was we fight our battles in the daytime, out in front.  You know we're coming 'cause we give you lots of warning ahead and chances to change you ways and stuff.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We do.  I mean, we're not terror people and that's -- that's what makes me have a continued fear about terrorists, is that they just -- they just don't care who they hurt --
R:  No, they don't.
L:  -- or when.
R:  They don't.  It -- it -- I mean, and it could be from the two year old to the ninety two year old, you know, they're gonna take whoever they're gonna take, and I think that's one of the reasons I've decided, you know, it wasn't going to alter my lifestyle, you know?  Still going to get on a plane, train, automobile, whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, but I did say, you know, should that happen again while I'm on a plane, I guess I'm gonna be the next [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Because [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, I hear you.  You know?
R:  You know, if -- if you -- if you don't bring a gun to the fight, then I figure I got at least a fifty fifty chance.
L:  I really don't think that they're going to get away with that kind of thing again.
R:  No.  I don't think so either.
L:  Because now we know we were -- we were sleeping, but now we're watching.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And I did feel kinda hyper vigilant, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I did, too.
L:  With it, but I -- like I said, I was just to stay at home and working and stuff and never really getting to travel or anything, so it couldn't affect me like that so much.  And I guess people are kind of -- it's picked back up a little bit, hasn't it?
R:  Um --
L:  People going places?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it --
L:  You know?
R:  -- has picked up, but you know, I mean, um, and you know what it got me thinking, you know, is this the fall of America as a super power?
L:  Nah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, no.  You got to wonder --
R:  It's like if this -- if this --
L:  -- fir- at first, but --
R:  -- were a start, you know, does it start with September eleventh and then, you know, think --
L:  Well, that was a beginning of something big, unless it goes back even farther, and then the [inaudible] and the embassy bombings and everything were really the start, you know, during the -- during the Clinton administration, was a lot of stuff happened before he got out of office, that they didn't retaliate for.
R:  True.
L:  And I personally have felt like the Republicans have been a lot firmer --
R:  Oh, yeah.  They're doing a --
L:  -- since they've been in.
R:  They're -- they're scrappy, that's definitely true.
L:  You know?  I mean, I -- and -- and they keep doing what they need to do, however they get criticized, and I personally was not polarized so much one way or the other.  I'd rather vote for the person than the party.
R:  Yeah.  But you know, that was like --
L:  But I feel like they've really been -- I'm -- I'm really, really glad it was their administration and not something weaker.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if I could see Gore, um, being -- taking this tough stance after September eleventh?
L:  Uh-huh.  No.
R:  You know?
L:  So, you know, and that's another thing I felt like, is those people, they feel like they're killing in the name of God, and the God that I know never said to do anything such of a thing like that.
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  And I don't know why they don't seem to realize that we all come from the same place and we're all headed back to the same place, ultimately.  You know?  
R:  And then it's, you know, it had me thinking too after September eleventh when they were saying that, you know, they see them leaving with a caravan of Yukons and then, you know, this Western thing and this Western thing, yet they -- they're blowing up our buildings because they hate us, but they're driving our cars, they're wearing our clothes, they're eating McDonalds, you know?  
L:  They're -- 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- they're worshipping your culture, you know, because --
R:  So --
L:  -- we have -- I mean, it's sort of uh, on a [inaudible] kind of a sake freedom.  They're -- they're going to look at our culture and how we're allowed to speak and even encouraged, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to speak our minds and ain't nobody going to come and punish us for what we're saying here today.
R:  Oh, right.  Right.
L:  You know?  And that's the beauty of the place and it is worth fighting for.  You know?  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I feel like, you know --
