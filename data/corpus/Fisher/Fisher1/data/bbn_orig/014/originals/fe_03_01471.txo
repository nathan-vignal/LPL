L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, this is Pam.
L:  Hi, this is Alma.
R:  Hi Alma, where are you at? 
L:  Middletown, New Jersey.
R:  Okay, so you were closer to the attacks than I was --
L:  Where --
R:  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay, whereabouts in Michigan?
R:  In Hillsdale Michigan, which is right down by the Ohio border.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, how closer are you to, to New York City?
L:  Ah, too close.  We are, we are right across the bay.  A large portion of people from Middletown commute into the city for work.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and I think we lost more residents per capita than any other town.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  We lost about thirty seven people.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  So ah, yeah, we -- it was -- had a great effect on our, on our town. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  My biggest response to that, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the thing that bothered me the most was that I have never in my life been afraid like I was afraid that day.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it was just that we didn't know what was going to happen after that.  We, we were all in, in Pennsylvania that day --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- we were out in the woods, and didn't know what had happened until we came out and found that the -- that the state parks, the state park office was closed and we couldn't figure out why until we, you know, got to where we could hear, [LAUGH] hear the news.
R:  Oh.
L:  And of course when we got home and you look across the bay and there's nothing but smoke where those buildings were, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, where your grandchildren [LAUGH] have been taken to the roof and everything, and, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, yeah, it was just -- it was hard to take it in.
R:  So I'm -- this had a far greater impact on you that it did me.  
L:  I --
R:  Because, you know, I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I was here watching it on TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, listening to it on the news, and it was like, you know, to me it was, um, unfathomable.  I could not imagine it, it actually happening.  I could not imagine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, you know, the twin towers being gone.
L:  Right.  And that, that was exactly our reaction too, and then of course for weeks after, you know, there were the obituaries where the -- or at least memorial notices -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in the paper, and it just seemed to go on and on, and now every little area around here seems to have a memorial or a memorial garden, so it's -- it's, it's like we can't get away from it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm, I'm sure that you can't.
L:  But, ah, so as far as -- I guess the question was what changes have we made since then? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'd say I'm even more reluctant to go into the New York City [LAUGH] than before.  And ah...
R:  Um, it has made me very much, um, it's -- it's made me afraid, and I have never ever felt that way -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in all of my forty five years of being alive I have never felt --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, afraid, because we've been attacked on our soil before.
L:  Right, and it's just the, the uncertainty of where, and when, and what, and [inaudible] --
R:  Yes, yes.  And I live in an extremely rural area --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and -- but even in this area, um, everyone was, especially the day after the -- the day of the attack everyone was very very somber around here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the day, the day after the attack and following that, um, -- you've seen the commercial where it definitely changed America with everyone putting out their flags.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  And it really did, and I think that, um, it's very fair to say that, that the terrorist attack, actually as a nation, brought us together.  You know, everyone, everyone had an opinion about it, um, you could even walk up to total strangers and discuss what had happened, because I think it affected every single one of us, even though we weren't like, right there, it still --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was, was such, um, a huge impact, and everyone was, was very very -- in our area especially, and I'm sure in your area --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was extremely patriotic, you know, there were flags flying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, everyone was putting out flags, a newspaper came out with a flag that you could tape to your window if you wanted to.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [MN] but still it was very scary, and the thing that bothered me, that, that really bothers me quite a bit is that, um, I'm afraid that we will go through -- we haven't done it yet, which is surprising, is that after World War Two, or during World War Two we rounded up [PAUSE] and we put them in prison camps.  Can you hang on a second?
L:  Sure.
R:  Thanks. [PAUSE] Alma?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm sorry about that.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Um, --
L:  So you think it's going to have a negative effect on civil liberties, in, in effect?
R:  Well, I'm afraid of that.  It hasn't happened yet, and I'm very surprised because I know that we rounded up all the Japanese and threw them in prison camps, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and detained them -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and we haven't seen that so much yet, but I did notice, we have a family from Syria --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that live here in Hillsdale.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, their store really really took a nosedive afterwards.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I've always considered myself to be very open and unbiased --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and unprejudiced in my opinion -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it really bothered me that the community that I live in was so quick to judge, thinking that these people were associated with bin Laden and with the terrorist attack, when it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, these -- you know, the people who actually own, it, um, were born and raised in the United States --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was his father that came over from Syria due to the Catholic and religious persecution.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But noone -- but, but not a lot of people know that.  And --
L:  No.  And, and certainly it's, you know, it's happened everywhere.
R:  Yes.
L:  It's, it's a very -- it's very hard, because the profile of the -- of not only the September eleven terrorists, but the other attacks, the Mogadishu attacks were all -- you know, [LAUGH] they were all Middle Eastern males between seventeen and forty.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, and so, how do you not profile?  And --  and, like, so I guess --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I can still see doing that at airports, or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, places that apt to be, ah, -- at risk, and at the same time you certainly don't wanna harass, like you say --
R:  The innocent.
L:  -- innocent people -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- who have absolutely no connection and they're as horrified as anyone else with, with what happened.
R:  Well, we also know that in the state of Michigan, that one of the largest Arabic influences, and the largest Arabic immigrant population is in Hamtramck, Michigan.  Which is about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two and a half hours from me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we do know that there were cells over there, and there is a little town, it's called Cold Water, Michigan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is to the west of me, and Cold Water has, um, right now we do know, and everyone knows it, that we have federal agents in Cold Water because --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of the amount of, um, Arabic men that are there.
L:  Yes.  And I, I'm sure that's true anywhere, that has a large Muslim community, and, and --
R:  Yes, and it's very scary.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is very scary.  But [LAUGH] I, I think to some extent they, they should have spoken out more strongly after this happened.
R:  I think so too.  I, I felt that we should have been over there the next day, honestly and truly.
L:  And I think --
R:  My husband --
L:  -- the Muslim community should have spoken out more after this happened -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  Also -- also.
R:  My -- my husband is an ex marine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, and I was, um, a marine wife [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I really, I really felt that after the attack, I really felt that we should have been over there in Iraq the very next day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I had a very very strong sense of, um, why are we dragging our feet?  And this really bothered me, because it was like, you know, we are one of the strongest, richest, most powerful nations in the whole world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I, I felt that at the time, right after the attack, that we should have been doing something [MN] right away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, right away, because what had happened to all of it, the innocent blood that had been shed really really bothered me.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I had a really hard time with dealing with it, and I even told my son, um, that night when I put him to bed, September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I told him, I said, "Brandon, if we don't wake up in the morning, know that I have always always loved you --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and that you are definitely my heart."  And he woke up the next morning and he was like, Mom, we're still here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, [LAUGH] it's like, "Yes thank God we're still here."
L:  Yeah.
R:  And another thing that really bothered me, um, was that there's two military bases here in Michigan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the skies, we have the Detroit to Chicago airport, and I'm, like, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're, like, in between, so we, we definitely see the jets, and hear the jets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there were -- there was nothing in the sky that day.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it was like, "Oh my God, the sky is silent."
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that shocked me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then it was later that evening, it was probably about eleven pm that we heard the military, um, jets go over.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I knew they were military.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that also sent a -- a great sense of fear through me.
L:  Yeah.  We've, we've got three military installations here, and of course they've been flying, you know, flights over New York City -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regularly [SIGH] so -- and also --
R:  Well I don't --
L:  -- I work for a defence contractor [LAUGH] so I, I work with a lot of ex military -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I'm sure you do.
L:  -- men too, who --
R:  And I'm sure they felt the same way, it's like, "Let's go there now, let's just load 'em up and go now."
L:  Well, of course at the time our focus was on Afghanistan rather than Iraq.
R:  Yes.
