R:  Hi, my name is Brenda.
L:  Hi, my name is Connie.
R:  Um, well this is the first time I do this so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  So, that's okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I thought they were gonna start with questioning and, um -- well, the topic is September eleven.
L:  And how it's changed your life and then I'll tell you how if -- it's changed mine.
R:  Um, it really hasn't changed my life.  Um, I used to live in New York actually and I went down there and I seen the affects and the rubble and everything.  Um, I have family down there but they weren't, um, affected like so many others that lost a lot of people there, um, family and friends.  Um, I did have, um, a friend of mine that was working there the day that it happened and she was lucky that that day she didn't go to work 'cause she was sick.  And so she, I guess, um, missed out on that, you know, terrible day.
L:  Right.  Well, how has it affected your life because that was the main question we had to discuss?  
R:  Um, may- --
L:  Have you changed anything?
R:  No, I really haven't.  Um, even when, you know, I -- I was living in New York and I moved out I -- security and that sort of thing was never really an issue and, I guess, I'm kinda laid back and I really don't think about it too much.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I also hav- -- I have a son who lives in Manhattan and, of course, that day was very scary for me because it took me several hours to get in touch with him.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then several hours more until he was able to get in touch with many friends who work in the area.  And, fortunately, everybody was all right.  Um, I did go up, um, a few months later to look at the -- excuse me, one second.  Trash?  [NOISE] Okay.  Okay.  [NOISE]  I'm sorry, my son in law's just leaving.  Um, I did go up and, you know, went down to Ground Zero and was quite moved by everything I saw there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, actually a few months later [LAUGH] right after the eleventh, exactly three months later, I moved into a -- I live in Philadelphia and I moved into Center City, about a block and a half from Independence Hall and people were saying, "Oh, you shouldn't do it, it's not safe, you'll be right in the middle of anything if they attack Philadelphia" but I'm not that kind of person.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I -- I said, "This is what I wanted to do and my life is to live where I'm living and that's it, I'm gonna do it".  So, it didn't really affect my life that much.  Um --
R:  Well, now -- now that you say that I live in Norfolk, Virginia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where it's kind of like if you look at the center of, um -- well, now with the war that's going on, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, well when the -- nine eleven happened, um, I'm in a building where the Coastguards are at and the World Trade Center we have -- it's like two blocks away.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The federal building was, uh, you know, a couple blocks away so I -- you know, we were like in the middle of everything and, you know, they sent us home.  And, you know, a lot of people were nervous and were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even thinking that, you know, this area might get, you know, hit next because of everything that surrounded -- we're a naval city.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Basically, all the ships are around here and, um, they were thinking that, you know, this area might -- might be, uh, targeted.  But I was doing my routine, going home, goin- coming to work and it -- it really didn't change my -- my way of doing things.
L:  Nor mine.  And, um, I -- there's been a lot of controversy since I live right near, um, Independence Hall.  They -- they had closed the streets in front of it because of terrorist --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I was one of [LAUGH] the petitioners who signed, um, the petition to get it reopened.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And, you know, now that it's part of, uh, the, uh, United States Park System they did not want it reopened because they felt that there was too much, you know, in the way of security --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for them to cover.  They felt that was out the barriers there.  But I'm one of the people that also believe that the barriers only show that they've won.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  That people [LAUGH] can't just walk up and, you know, go see Independence Hall and -- and all that is around the area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that just opened April first --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I'm one of the happy people who had it -- um, so really, uh, things like this, including the war, don't change any of my plans.
R:  No.  I mean, I'm ready this year with, um, taking -- I went to Miami, I'm going to Orlando to Disney, um, in June and, you know, I hear with the, um, you know, not with the SARS and all these things that are going on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm like, uh --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- I'm still --
L:  Actually the SARS scares me more than the terrorism.  Uh, in three weeks I'm going to Israel for a month.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that's [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  As I said, I'm not the kind of person if I wanna do something I go ahead and do it so nothing changes.
R:  [inaudible] yeah, uh, 'cause I was thinking about taking a -- you know, the airplane ride being that they have that SARS going around and is it safe, you know?
L:  Well, exact-  -- as I said that's scares me more than going to the Middle East.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, what I'm going -- you know, I'm going to take a mask and gloves like everybody else for the plane ride.
R:  Mm, yeah.  [MN] I don't know it's just the -- I mean if -- if you stop doing things you wanna do then you're not living you're not do- -- you know.
L:  That's exactly my attitude.
R:  You just --
L:  So, we really agree on that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I can't, uh -- my children and friends are saying, "Don't go now" you know, but I wanna do this now and that's what I'm doing [LAUGH].
R:  Then -- then they win if you stop doing anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the things that you wanna do or that you normally do, they've won.
L:  I agree.  I absolutely agree.
R:  You know, it's like they said, you've just gotta keep doing what you're doing, you're normal routine, don't change -- I mean, of course, you know, if your neighborhood gets shut down then, you know, you have no choice but, you know, but to obey the rules but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but in things if you're gonna take a trip, you take a trip.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean it's like they say, "When it's your time, it's your time" it doesn't, you know, really matter where, you know -- your plans because if you're gonna go at a certain time then that's it.
L:  Yes, but I think you and I are in the minority here because I don't say most people think that way.  I think most people do change their plans.
R:  Mhm.  So, they -- they, um -- um, how do they say, uh, they're -- they don't choose to live their live -- uh, live as living dumb, kind of --
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, yes exactly.  I've never done this before and ten minutes is a very long time --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to talk one very specific topic.
R:  Mm, yeah.  Also, um, what do you think should have replaced the buildings?
L:  Oh, well I've seen the designs, um --
R:  What did they decide on finally because -- or did they decide?
L:  Well, they had two the last I -- and I'm not exactly sure which one.  But I like them both and I do believe something tall should be built.  Not necessarily an office building but, you know, something that stands as high or higher than the Twin Towers.
R:  Well, wasn't -- wasn't that what they decided on?  I thought I heard something about that.
L:  I -- I think so.  I can't remember the details right now.  But I remember that I was pleased with the, uh, the design because, um, I think putting up two skyscrapers was not the answer --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but putting up something that went, you know, high in the air --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was appropriate.
R:  Mm, okay, yeah.  'Cause, um --
L:  And I like the fact that the ground, Ground Zero, you know, uh, is going to be like a memorial park.  And I thought that was very necessary.
R:  Right, it was a combination of the
