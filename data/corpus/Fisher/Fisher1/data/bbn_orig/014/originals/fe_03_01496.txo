R:  Hi, I'm Janine.
L:  And I'm Angela Wolf. [NOISE]
R:  H- hello?
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah, I can hear you.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, my name's Angela and, um, I'm from Tennessee.
R:  Okay.  I'm Janine and I'm from California.
L:  Okay.  Have you made changes to your life since September eleventh?
R:  Uh, I'm a little scared, you know, but I live in a small town in California so ...  But I -- I, um, I think I'm more patriotic, you know.  [COUGH]  What about you?
L:  Well, I noticed like, right after September eleventh, um, I seemed to feel more patriotic as far as, um, more people in the neighborhood had flags flying than usual and, um, uh, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- schools were, s- uh, selling the ribbons, uh, that were red, white and blue, that, uh, the money went to support the September eleventh, um, people.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, it was difficult for us because our wedding -- two year wedding anniversary was September the eleventh.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And we were on vacation at the Outer Banks in North Carolina a- when it happened, and so we sat in front of the TV for like, three days and cried.  And it's like, it's just our luck, you know? [MN]
R:  Did you know anybody in the September eleventh?
L:  No, I didn't, uh, did you?
R:  No, I -- I re- I didn't and, um, I'm -- I'm sorry that happened but I'm really grateful that I didn't have any family there, you can just imagine how they're feeling right now.
L:  I can -- I can sympathize too --
R:  And it feels like it just happened yesterday.
L:  Yeah, it's still fresh in our minds, especially, you know, we -- we -- with -- the war, I think, has bought a lot of the feelings of September eleventh back, talking about the terrorism and things like that and, uh, you know.  So, I wouldn't say that we've changed since then but it's like, I don't think that I would want to necessarily go to a large building, uh, if I didn't have to.
R:  Yeah, me too.  [COUGH]  I think, um, [COUGH] I think I'm -- I'm even steering clear of, uh, airplanes.  I've never been on one and I always wanted to before the September eleventh, but I don't think I do now.
L:  I've only been on an airplane one time and, um, I felt secure and it was, um, it was after September the eleventh, we had already made our plans, it was the November following September eleventh, and, um, I flew from, uh, Tennessee to Florida and took a cruise.  And, uh, my husband and I, we were trying to make up for [LAUGH] some of our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, our anniversary.  So --
R:  Oh, I can imagine your anniversary wasn't pleasant.
L:  Uh, no.  But we ended up having a hurricane on that -- that trip, so ...
R:  Oh my goodness!
L:  Hurricane Michele.  So, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just our luck.  But ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it -- I can imagine.  I, uh, [COUGH] see, the town I live in, the, uh -- we have a lot of people standing out on the corner and stuff and the -- you know, a lot of 'em are out there [COUGH] about the war [NOISE] but there is some out there that are just out there because they lost family in the September eleventh thing and [COUGH] --
L:  Like a -- like a protest?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or --
R:  Well, we're protesting against the protestors.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- and we were for the war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, we were just out there and, you know, and get a couple of people start crying and [LAUGH] it's sometimes though, it's not pleasant.
L:  Yeah.  And now we have the yellow ribbons up for the war a- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, you know, uh, since -- since everything happened, I really feel that the country has become more patriotic and we are flying more flags, and I think people are more aware of, uh, you know, what -- what's going on.  I think that I got -- because it w- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was on vacation at the time, and I was able to sit in front of the TV, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it affected more than if I went on with my normal routine at home.  Like with the war, I'm able to, you know, go about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my everyday business and, uh, I just think it -- I think it affected me more at the time.
R:  Mm, well, [COUGH] I think -- 'cause it was like, a really shock to me when I -- 'cause I was at my, um, aunt's house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my daughter, um, [SIGH] was only -- not even a month old.
L:  [SIGH] Oh!
R:  And I was just like, "What did I do?  What did I bring my daughter into?" you know.  But then, you know, it was just -- it was a really shock to me and it hadn't hit me until [COUGH] you know, because I -- I'm young, you know, so I'm like, I never really experienced any type of war or anything like that, and, um, I just think it didn't sink in until [LAUGH] later on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then [MN] I didn't realize the seriousness of it [COUGH] and, um, and then when you start hearing about other terrorist attacks and army attempts then i- i- that's when it really hit me [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was like, "Okay, well, this isn't good".  But, um, I -- I -- I was really scared [COUGH] for a minute there because, you know, my daughter was only a month old, and being a new mom you -- you're kinda paranoid.
L:  Yes, I have a s- -- a six week old right now.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  And, uh, you know, the war just started right after he was born and I'm like, "Oh no!"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I imagine. [COUGH]  I, uh --
L:  It's scary.
R:  So was your, um, is -- what does your husband feel about it?
L:  Um, well, he -- I think that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as the September eleventh goes, I think it really affected him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the fact that he was ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] We were -- like I say, we were able to sit in front of the news and so he was there and [MN] we just sat there together and cried, and after about two days I said, "We've got to get outta this hotel room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've got to get on and -- and, you know, we have to go out to eat and just l- live, we're on vacation!  And -- and i- if we let them -- if we stop our everyday lives --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then they've won.  It really -- if we change our life because of that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- then the terrorists have -- have served their purpose".
R:  The -- yeah, yeah.  [COUGH]  And I think that it is important for everybody to remember [NOISE] that, uh, [NOISE] that was their purpose and, you know [COUGH], was to frighten us, and that's what they [NOISE] did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, um, I mean, I feel -- I feel a lot more s- -- I feel safe, I just think that [NOISE] hello?
L:  I'm still here.
R:  Oh, I don't know what that was!
L:  Okay!
R:  [LAUGH]  I know it wasn't my phone!  Um, I, um, [LIPSMACK] lost my train of thought! [LAUGH]  No, um --
L:  [LAUGH] That you feel safe.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yes.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- you know, I -- I -- I feel safer because I know that, you know, it -- it's gonna be kinda hard for terrorists to attack --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now that we know [NOISE] what they're planning to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  I -- I feel safe in my community.  I mean it's -- I'll go walking at night.  We live in, I would say a small town, there's probably fifty five thousand people, um, in this city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, the city, uh, that I actually grew up in, next -- next to it, has, you know, only probably half that, probably like, twenty thousand.
R:  Oh wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and we only had one red light in the whole town, so ...
R:  So, have you traveled si- um, besides, um --
L:  Um, yeah --
R:  -- the cruise?
L:  Y- well, since we -- we -- well, we had the cruise and then, um, we've been back to the beach, we went back to, uh, the Outer Banks in North Carolina, uh, but we've not made any other flights, um ...  But we have several family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- that travels a lot, um, um, I have a -- my husband has a cousin that's at Berkley right now, and so he travels --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot across country.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's not affected him in the traveling part, you know, since September eleventh.  But I think it's in the back of everybody's mind, that ...
R:  Yeah, it is.  I mean, I -- I've traveled to Moro[?] Bay and that -- which is, um, it's like a, um, beach --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and probably three hours from here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I've traveled to there and to Sacramento.  And then I went to Reno, but th- that was about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't really go too far from where I live. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Before I met my husband I didn't travel hardly at all.  And so, uh, I mean, I've only been to like, three surrounding states, [LAUGH] which is -- which is not too far away, 'cause we have a, um, um, we're on the border between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Virginia and, um, several states nearby.  North Carolina's close and South Carolina's close.  And that's really the only places I have been.  And so, he took me to Florida and of course, uh, we actually went on the cruise --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which was a big deal, that it be flying on a airplane.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  And, uh, the -- the long lines that, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, in Atlanta where there's some really long lines and some really strict procedures after September eleventh, and I didn't know what it was like before, so I didn't really see the big difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I could tell --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that people were talking about it.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I can imagine.  I, um, I'm never [NOISE] -- I haven't even been in a airport, so I really -- I don't know how it is right now or how it was before.
L:  Uh, you said you're fairly young.  I'm -- I'm thirty.  I'm --
R:  I'm -- I'm eighteen.
L:  You're eighteen, okay.
R:  I just turned eighteen on the ninth. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] So, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I'm -- I'm thirty with my very first baby and he's six weeks old, so ...
R:  Well, congratulations.
L:  Well thank you.  He just had to wake up.  I had to hold on the line for a few minutes before somebody came on --
R:  Really?
L:  -- for the survey.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I was in the m- -- uh, I'm a --
R:  I was ho- -- I was hoping they weren't gonna ask me to talk about the
