L:  I'm Alice.
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania and you?
L:  I'm -- I'm in West Virginia.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, this is gonna be an interesting topic.
L:  Yeah, um, we really haven't changed anything.
R:  I haven't either.  I -- I would just say I'm wary.  It isn't like I stocked up on water and I'm waiting for a bomb to hit the house but --
L:  That's the way we are.
R:  I mean, yeah, I -- I -- I wonder.
L:  Yeah, you wonder what's going to happen next but I don't really think it's gonna happen here. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm not -- there's nothing much I can do about it.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I mean what am I gonna do?  I'm pretty clos- -- not that far away from Three Mile Island so I --
L:  Ooh.
R:  I kind of figure if I get hit, I get hit. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh my gosh.
R:  What am I gonna do?  Go hide in the basement?
L:  There's not -- yeah, there's nothing you can do and the only thing that kinda has affected us is my husband's a nurse and he had to decide whether he wanted to get a smallpox vaccination.
R:  Oh, and did he?
L:  No.  Um, he can't get it because our children have eczema so you're not allowed to get it.
R:  Your children have what?
L:  Eczema.
R:  Oh oka- -- oh really?
L:  Yeah, eczema, yeah.  So, you know, you worry about that, uh --
R:  I thought that if -- if -- so it's even if your children do?  
L:  Right.
R:  I thought it was -- oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See now I had four smallpox vaccinations when I was a child and none of them ever took.
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] And so I don't know -- at the time my doctor said, "Oh, you must have some kind of natural immunity" --
L:  Mm.
R:  And then my doctor now said there is no such thing as a natural immunity.
L:  Well --
R:  And I said, "Well, whatever, it's -- I guess I won't get smallpox". [LAUGH]  Whatever it is.
L:  Oh.  My husband's had to have three M.M.R. vaccinations [NOISE] and none of 'em have taken.  They'll work for awhile and then his employer will test his immunity and there won't be any immunity to.
R:  Oh, that's bizarre!
L:  Yeah, isn't it weird?
R:  Well, they've gotta quit giving it to ya.
L:  I -- I -- I guess, I don't know why that would be with some people.  Uh, my friend's little girl just, uh, she found out she has some kind of genetic immune disorder and all the vaccinations she got as a child don't exist in her system any -- anymore either.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  So, maybe it has something to do with that.  Maybe there's something --
R:  Ha.
L:  I don't know but --
R:  But I don't -- I guess we should be saying that we  wanna travel less and, um --
L:  [NOISE] Mm, I don't.  I don't -- I did my flying before and we had flown to California and, not that I had any plans of flying across country [NOISE] we have two small kids now, but we haven't even considered flying as an option for vacations or anything like that.
R:  Because of nine eleven?
L:  Right, right.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  I don't -- um, the last trip I took we drove but I don't -- it wasn't because of nine eleven it was just because we had the dog and it was easier.  I -- I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't -- I -- I don't think I have any fear of a domestic --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I probably wouldn't be touring Europe right now but I don't know if its nine eleven or the war in Iraq.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, I think it's probably more the war in Iraq.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  My -- I've had a couple of friends go to, like, England and, uh, I worried about them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I --
R:  They're giving away airfare.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, it's --
L:  It's kinda [NOISE] chances of anything happening are pretty slim but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but still -- [LAUGH] I just know how my luck runs. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I would be on the airplane when something bad happened so I -- I don't know, that's one thing I guess I have changed that I don't wanna fly for a while.  I'm -- I'm not saying I won't ever fly again but, uh, I just don't want to fly right now.
R:  I don't know, I -- I'd probably would.  I don't know that I'd go overseas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Only because I don't think America is looked upon so greatly right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In other countries.  
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'd be leery but that's more the war again, not nine eleven.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, I keep thinking about that millennium thing, I didn't do anything about that either where --
L:  No, I didn't either and nothing happened.
R:  Well, that was crazy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people that were stocking up on wat- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I just thought that was total insanity, to be honest with you.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Well, yeah, I don't know -- I mean I was kind of worried -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a few weeks after it happened, you know, different things would worry me.  You know, you thought something else was gonna happen and -- but now that a couple of years have went by I really don't think about it a whole lot.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I don't either but I -- I mean it's -- its affected all of us in probably subconscious ways, you know.
L:  Right, right.  I think I view certain people differently.  I'm sus- --more suspicious now.
R:  This is true.
L:  Right.  I mean, I --
R:  Which is probably not good.
L:  Right or wrong, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Correct.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right or wrong, I think, whenever I'm in public places and I see that people that could possibly be a terrorist I -- I think, "Well, you know, what are they up to?"  You wonder if people are going to start doing suicide bombing and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and things like that.
R:  This is true.
L:  But that's really -- there's not -- where I live there's not a lot of diversity.  We have a university --
R:  Oh, are you by the university of West Virginia?
L:  No, no, no, I -- we're close to Marshall, Marshall University.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  And so -- but that's really all.  I mean, I don't, like you said, hide in the basement or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't worry about things like that much.  I -- I would go to New York.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, I would too.  There is absolutely no --
L:  I would go to Washington.
R:  -- reason I wouldn't do that.  Actually, I would like to go there . [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I would too -- would too.
R:  I -- I --
L:  But I'm not sure I'd fly. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'd probably wouldn't fly because I just wouldn't.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's not that far away.
R:  Right.  I'd probably take a train, it's just easier.
L:  Right, right.  But, um -- [NOISE]
R:  And -- I'm trying to think what else.
L:  The bioterrorism thing, I guess, you know, after nine eleven with Anthrax and stuff I -- I worry about --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that 'cause my husband is a nurse.  But, again, what can you do about it?  [LAUGH] There's not anything you can do about it so --
R:  No, there isn't.
L:  I'm kinda that type person you'd make yourself crazy if you --
R:  Yes, you would.  You would absolutely make yourself crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- you know, I -- what about like wondering about spending money or not spending money or ...?
L:  Oh, I don't worry about that at all.  We -- we bought a house this year.  We bought a new automobile this year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- spending money doesn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Course the field my husband's in there's always a need for it.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess if he was in a different field I might worry because his father in law got laid off a couple of weeks ago and he's an engineer so, you know, it isn't just construction workers and people like this that are getting laid off anymore, it's people --
R:  Right, it's everybody.
L:  -- who have degrees.  But in health care there's usually a need and I guess I don't think about it that much.  He -- there's always a job for a nurse so I don't really worry about it.
R:  Do you wor- --oh, my call waiting keeps beeping, driving me crazy.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I stay at home with the children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  So, do I?
L:  But, um -- whenever September eleven happened --
R:  It won't come out.
L:  -- I was pregnant and I was going in for my ultrasound to see the baby was a girl or a boy --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- and all that was going on over the intercom while I was getting my ultrasound so I have an ultrasound -- all her ultrasound pictures have September eleventh on 'em.  That was the date that I had her ultrasound done.  But, uh, that's what we were doing when all that happened.
R:  Wow. [NOISE] I'm sure everybody knows exactly what they were doing.
L:  Oh yeah!
R:  I remember I was just like walking.  I remember going for a walk and coming in and my husband saying, "You're not going to believe this".  It's like, "Oh my god!"
L:  Well, I had it on, uh, Nick Junior. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I had on the Today Show so --
L:  We -- we had a two and a half year old at the time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and he watched Blues Clues --
R:  Right.
L:  -- every morning at that time and, uh, I think anybody could take over the United States and Blues Clues would not be interrupted.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Any of these TV channels, the Cartoon --
R:  They didn't interrupt it?
L:  No, no there were not letters on the screen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or there was nothing.  I mean Steven and Blue were singing this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my mom called me and she's like change the channel because, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I would have had no idea until I went out maybe and turned the radio on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But they don't, they don't interrupt for anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on children's stations.
R:  Well, I don't think they, um, they have clue.  I think it's all prerecorded --
L:  Well, yeah, it is.
R:  -- you know.
L:  It is, it's not live and you would think somewhere they -- they would have --
R:  Yeah, somebody would say --
L:  -- like an emergency --
R:  -- "Get your mother". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Tell mom to come into the room please.
L:  Well, they always have those emergency broadcast --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- system messages and things.  You would think that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- something like that would happen but it didn't and if I'd have been home that day I probably wouldn't have known until I put him down for a nap.
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, are you from the West Virginia area?
L:  Uh, yeah, I'm from -- I'm from West Virginia, I live in Huntington and, uh, which is close to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Kentucky and Ohio.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, and, uh, but --
R:  And how did you get involved with this pen thing?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have a, uh, stay at home mum email group --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and somebody posted it on the email group that you could do it and I signed up for it for fun.  Actually, I'd forgotten about it until just now.
R:  Did you call in?
L:  No, they call me.
R:  Oh, they called you?
L:  Mm, they called me.  Did you get called?
R:  I just called in which I never have done before.  So, --
L:  Oh yeah, well they, uh, what I signed up for on the Internet just said you would receive a phone call --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'd forgotten about it.  And, uh, when I followed up --
