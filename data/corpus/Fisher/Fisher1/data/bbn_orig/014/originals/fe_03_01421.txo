L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Fred. 
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer. 
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from St Louis, how about you? 
L:  Oh, my sister lives in St Louis.
R:  Oh.
L:  She, um, goes to law school at Wash U.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
R:  Oh, wow, okay.  I don't know anybody in Massachusetts.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't say anything.
L:  Um, this is sort of a hard topic actually.
R:  Yeah, I haven't really made any changes myself.
L:  I know, I don't think I'll be able to talk about this for ten minutes.
R:  Neither will I. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] well -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I don't know but maybe we could talk about if we think the changes that we've seen have been worthwhile.
R:  Worthwhile, yeah, --
L:  I mean -- 
R:  Especially with the airports and their increases in their security.
L:  Yeah, I haven't really paid attention.  I mean, I've noticed that they've -- sometimes make you check your shoes and they are a little bit more careful about checking people when they go in but --
R:  Right.  
L:  I mean, I haven't really noticed anything more than that really.
R:  Either have I.  Um, from, you know, all I gather is they've just [MN] -- they're a little more cautious but it doesn't seem like they're -- I don't think they're as cautious as they should be.
L:  Mhm.  Well, what more do you think they should do? 
R:  [SIGH] You know, I'm not really sure. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, as far as, you know, going -- going down to strip searching people but, you know, I --  I don't think that would be appropriate but then again we don't want anything like Sep- September eleventh to happen again.
L:  Right.  Um, [MN] I don't know, it also seems like whenever I fly from Louisville -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's where I'm originally from.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That the security there is much less tight than when I fly from Boston.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and so --
R:  Smaller airport maybe.
L:  What's that?
R:  I think maybe because of the smaller airport that you're at they're not -- they're not as, ah, I don't know, apt to -- to really ... I guess they probably don't think that anything is going to happen there in Louisville.
L:  Yeah, but don't you think they should have like a -- a national standard so that --
R:  That's -- that's exactly what I was, ah, about to get at.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I'm from St Louis so we're kind of directly in the centre and we have a lot of lay overs here in St Louis.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, you know, even St Louis, I think they should be a lot stricter than what -- what it seems like they are.  I --  I don't fly very much mys- I've actually never flown myself.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  No.
L:  Ahah.
R:  But, you know, just judging by what -- what we hear on the  TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they -- I think they could be stricter.
L:  Yeah, um, I don't know, I mean, it seems to me if someone is flying from Louisville they could fly, you know, anywhere --
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- so they could go from a lower, you know, security point.
R:  Right.
L:  To -- and then fly anywhere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, it seems like you'd have to have a national --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- level.
R:  Exactly, because, you know, they could start off from Louisville and fly out to Washington.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I sometime -- I sometimes notice more, um, I guess, army personnel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At airports, just I guess more security that way.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  But I think -- I think that just makes normal people more paranoid.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Than making them feel very safe.
R:  More comfortable, right.
L:  Yeah.  Um, but I mean other than flying I really haven't ... Um, I mean, when they -- when Bush issued that, um, you know, alert for, I forget what it was called, like an orange alert or -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- or whatever -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I got some e-mails at work saying, you know, be sure to wear your badge at all times.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Be sure to question people if they're -- if they don't have a badge on and you don't recognize them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they're not accompanied with someone else or -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, I mean at work I've gotten a little bit of, you know, advice about -- 
R:  A little more cautious.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, has -- has your work done anything like that?
R:  Um, I actually am a homemaker.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Stay at home Mommy is the new term.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, we really -- haven't really changed much.
L:  Yeah, do you have kids at school?
R:  No, they're toddlers. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But we are more cautious of people in the neighborhood, you know, we tend to pay attention to strangers in the area.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] My little one's wanting me to hold him, --
L:  Oh, how old is he? 
R:  -- probably has to start screaming here. He's, ah, almost two.
L:  Ah, okay.  My nephew is turning one next month.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] very sweet. Whoops.
L:  Yeah, I actually have a sister who lives in DC right now.
R:  Uh-huh.  Was she there around anything that happened? 
L:  No, she, um, has just been there for the past six months.
R:  Was she pretty -- was she pretty, ah, concerned about going out, was she -- did she do anything, you know, while she was out there? 
L:  You know, I don't think there's anything really that people can do in their day to day life, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean she lives a little bit outside of the city.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Um, and so she said just because it's DC, they're just -- I think there usually is a lot of --
R:  Security.
L:  -- army personnel, yeah, and security [MN] um, but, you know, I mean, you can't really just be paranoid all the time and,     um ... 
R:  I completely agree. 
L:  I mean the sort of thing, um -- I mean, for one thing it usually happens in, um, really urban areas. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, like New York and DC are more likely targets than, you know, Louisville or St Louis.
R:  And that's what -- that's one thing that I'm a little concerned with too.  I mean, they --  they --  they announce that all over the news and, you know, they --  they kind of give you that false security where, you know, a smaller -- I mean, St Louis is kind of a smaller city, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A large city but it's still smaller compared to everything else. 
L:  Right.
R:  But they kind of give us a false sense of, ah, security when, you know, announcing it all over TV and I'm sitting here thinking okay, they're announcing this on TV, don't you think that's gonna give them another idea to, okay, let's go ahead to the smaller city -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we'll get 'em where we're not -- where they're not expecting it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and, you know, I think the media, I think they ... personally I think need to calm it down a little bit and not [SIGH] ... you know, [NOISE] it's kind of hard to say they shouldn't talk about important issues like that but sometimes I think they need to be a little more, I don't know, maybe tasteful -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in what they say. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Yeah, it's a tou- I don't know, it's a tough thing.  The one thing that -- that I thought was sort of disturbing was that, um, I have a friend who I work with who, he is a Canadian citizen but -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- his -- his parents are from Pakistan or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, he was telling me about how his sister had to register, um, because -- I'm not exactly sure what it was but something about how she was from Canada and she was sort of Arabic and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I thought that was a little weird.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Um, --
R:  Yeah, another thing that, ah, concerned me too is, ah, I guess more the racial profiling that -- that happens.  I have a friend, um, that is from Hungary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he went to school out here, you know, actually went to Wash U and got a business degree and he was, ah, -- he just finished his masters and had the worst time getting a job out here because [NOISE] the looks, um, the -- I guess the Arabic -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look.  He --  he, you know, he is tall, dark skinned, dark hair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's, you know, ah, it's a little disappointing that, ah, they had to move back to Hungary because he wouldn't get hired by anybody.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that that's -- you know, it's a little disappointing.
L:  Yeah, I mean a similar thing I think happened around World War two.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  With the Japanese people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, that was much more extreme because they were actually shipped off to -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to these camps or whatever but -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, I don't know, in situations like this it seems like the government, um, you know, they say that they are trying to protect us but they do some things that, you know -- 
R:  Kind of don't protect us.
L:  Yeah, they're just a little bit, um, suspicious. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Or a little bit unfair I think. 
R:  Right.
L:  But, um. [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  It's kind of a hard subject to talk about for ten minutes.  
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] But as far as, you know, getting back to the topic, day to day life, nothing has really changed around here.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like I said, I pay attention to the TV more often.  I'm a little more cautious when I'm out and about, especially when I'm by myself with my children --
