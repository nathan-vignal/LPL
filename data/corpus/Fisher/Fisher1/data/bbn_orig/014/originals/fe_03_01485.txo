L:  [MN]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm fine.  How you doing?
R:  Good, good.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Maryland, what about you?
R:  Maryland?  Pretty far away.  Utah.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's quite a distance.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.  So it's nice to talk to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, the attack on September eleventh happened a, a little closer to you than, than over here.
L:  Yeah.  Right, yeah, because we're really not that far from DC either.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, um, it was pretty horrific, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.
L:  And, um, I guess of course a lot of things change, like in security --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the state and um, travelling and things such as that, but -- in, in our lifestyles, I guess.  For a while I guess I was more nervous with my kids going to school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I'm always nervous when they're not with me, anyway.  And, um, --
R:  Yeah, no I understand that.
L:  -- even my husband in a way, 'cause he's a trucker, you know --
R:  Ye- Yeah.
L:  So he's on the roads a lot.  And I -- you know, right after he really wasn't sure if they were finished or not.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If the terrorists was gonna do something else.
R:  No, it's true.  It's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was very scary.  No, when -- before the September eleventh, um, I really never paid attention to anything that was going on elsewhere in the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I just in my own little world, do my own thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then after that, like I noticed that I pay attention to the news a lot more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I start --
L:  I think what did it for me was when they blew up the USS Cole, the -- um, a navy ship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a couple of navy men were killed.  I think that's what bought it to my attention in that very swift -- with Osama Bin Laden and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I really -- I could never imagine that they would take it that far.
R:  No kidding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was incredible.
L:  Yeah.  Um, who could imagine such thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's one of the things you don't realise, and then it happens and -- and it does change the way you think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, like you said about your kids, just --
L:  Yeah, when the war started and all, I was even apprehensive about them going to the mall or, you know, we like to go to baseball games, and we were trying to debate whether or not it would be safe or not.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh no.
L:  And you know, every little thing, you know, is part of your thinking now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which before September eleventh you wouldn't have given it another thought.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  No, it's so true, so true.
L:  Yeah.  You see jets flying around all the time, and we are not too far from a military base either --
R:  Really?
L:  -- so there's always something going on [LAUGH] with them flying their helicopters and stuff.  I don't know what they be doing. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  That's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, we don't get much that -- much of that round here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, we should watch the news though, and...
L:  Mhm, yeah I always watch the news, and -- well I watch it, and then -- well, my -- some of my kids are older, but then my youngest daughter -- after September eleventh, when it first happened, she was really afraid, because I guess being a kid and that happening in school --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- you -- you get scared, you know, and a little while after that she was really scared a lot, but now, unfortunately, you have to -- I guess she's just learned to adapt.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, just have that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uncertance.  That uncertain feeling that, you know, who knows what's gonna happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if anything.  But it's still in her thinking.  I guess --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's in everybody's thinking.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did they show the September eleventh thing, um, to the elementary school kids when it happened?
L:  They sure did.
R:  They did?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, yeah.  So that would cause a little bit of fear.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I was kinda surprised that they had showed it to them while they were in school.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No kidding.
L:  And my daughter was like, "Well why didn't you come and get me?"  Although they did close the schools early and she wanted me to meet her at the bus stop [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I was just like, "I don't, I don't know". [LAUGH] 
R:  No kidding.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  So it does make you think, though. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just the different changes.
L:  And I'm not -- not much of a flyer anyway, I don't travel a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I guess if I did I probably would have -- would be -- I don't guess I would be afraid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it would be in my mind, if I had to board a plane.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  Even still -- even now, still, you know, especially with what went on in Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  You know. [MN] And they call us with this holy jihad against the United States [LAUGH] --
R:  I know, it's terrible.
L:  You know.
R:  It's so bad.
L:  [LAUGH] You never know what they might be planning. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No, I agree.  Like, I've never been much of a flyer, but even now, just -- more than just the fear factor, like, they just showed on the news that the biggest airline's about to go bankrupt because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of, of what happened even back in September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.  And it's just weird how it just trink- trickles down to just a airline going bankrupt.
R:  I know, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] So I guess a lot of people probably feel kinda like I do.  Maybe they just don't wanna take the chance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of getting on a airplane -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  -- right now.
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it is a -- it is a concern.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I guess we just keep on living.
L:  Yeah.  And my aunt, she works on a military base.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, she's looking for a new job now, because she said after September eleventh, it's like really hard... 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  ...to get on and off the base.  Um, because she doesn't drive, so someone always takes her to work, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they could no longer drive her close to the ba- building where she works.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Because -- 'cause they could not come on the base at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, incredible.
L:  So she has a nice little walk from where they can drop her off --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to where she actually works, and she's like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's a big inconvenience.
R:  No kidding.
L:  So there's just another example of how September eleventh have just changed a lot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.  More than just our own willingness to change --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, or inside, it's actually forced to.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yep, that's so true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then unfortunately there's some Americans who would like to take September eleventh out on Arab Americans, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could say, you know.  That's really unfortunate 'cause it's not really their fault. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I agree, completely.
L:  Mhm.  'Cause they are pretty much running away from that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, by coming here.
R:  Uh-huh, that's the whole reason they're here, to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- create a new life.  But that is unfortunate.
L:  Yeah.  I heard a couple of stories of the news of kids were harassed at school, and neighbors harassing neighbors because of, you know, they were Arab Americans and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then again, it kinda makes -- I guess I -- I would never harass anyone, but [MN] maybe if I had'd someone in my neighborhood who was an Arab and they were not particularly friendly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just, you know, act weird --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess maybe I would be a little suspicious --
R:  Right.
L:  -- after September eleventh, you know.
R:  Of course, mhm. 
L:  But I would never harass anyone. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No, well I heard a report where, um, they did the, the, um, -- they did some -- oh, what are they called?  Surveys --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about how people react when they see Arab Americans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, most of it wasn't so much the harassing and things, but they'd actually like realise without realizing that they would walk around people.
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  Instead of like going right next to them like we would normally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'd actually, like, go out of their way to get to, like, go around Arab Americans.
L:  Right, right.
R:  It was really --
L:  Just try to avoid them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's really tough.
L:  Mhm.  And then right after seven- September eleventh was the big anthrax thing. [LAUGH]
R:  No kidding.
L:  Oh boy, and they never figured that one out, though.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was just gonna ask.  So they haven't figured it out at all?
L:  No, uh-uh.  So then not only did -- was you dealing with September eleventh, but then you were scared, "Oh, what if something's in my mail?" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no kidding.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, these times are crazy.
L:  Yeah, they are. [LAUGH]
R:  No kidding.
L:  Then they started with the small pox scare.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, are they gonna give us with small pox, and -- 'cause they didn't order that small pox vaccinations for military and hospital workers, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So I was like, "Okay." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's amazing, what's gonna come up next.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess the war is big enough.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um...
L:  [MN] Sure does make you pray a lot.
R:  It does, it really does.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, get your, your life into perspective, where it should be, and...
L:  Yep -- yeah, that's right.  That's exactly right, yep. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  No kidding.  [PAUSE] I kinda ran out of things to say about September eleventh.
L:  Uh-huh.  So did you -- um, was there anything that you did different?  I mean, did it make you scared or -- I don't know.  I know it -- like the day after September eleventh
