R:  Hi, my name is Janette, who am I talking to?
L:  Katrina.
R:  Hi, Trina, whereabouts are you from?
L:  Chesterton, Indiana.
R:  Okay, I'm calling -- I'm from Buffalo, Minnesota.
L:  [NOISE] Oh!
R:  It's a pleasure to meet you.
L:  Same here.
R:  This is my first call, um, with Fisher and I understand our topic is what changes we have made since nine one one.  Um, would you like to start or shall I?
L:  Uh, you can.
R:  Okay, um, to be honest with you, I don't think we've made any changes as far as travel or types of security, things like that other than, perhaps, being more close with our friends and family.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because, I think, the incident on nine one one really brought about how -- how fleeting, um, our lives can be and how it can change in -- in such a rapid manner.  But, other than that, I don't think we've really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gone through any significant changes.  Maybe opening up our hearts to other and -- and donating more to charities, I know that's for sure.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.  I feel the same way.  I don't think -- think at the beginning a lot of people changed a lot of things and now it seems to be back to the same old way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like it's -- you know, it was that time and now that time has passed and you're going on with your lives.  Me, myself -- I'm sorry, No!
R:  You must have a little one nearby, huh?
L:  Uh, yeah, and he's cutting his hair.
R:  Oh no! 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no, that's not good.
L:  [NOISE] But we haven't changed our way of living since then.  Um, we just go one day at time. [NOISE]
R:  I know my husband was concerned about traveling as he does a lot of business --
L:  Travel.
R:  -- uh, travel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, after his first flight when he saw all the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, personnel and -- and security measures that were in place he -- he felt more comfortable about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I know he was on one flight where there was a gentleman of Middle Eastern descent who, uh, all of a sudden stood up and claimed that he was going to take over the, um, the plane.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And everybody just stopped and looked and then the guy sat down again and said oh, he was just kidding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And everybody was just absolutely stunned and as soon as the plane landed he was hustled off the plane and arrested because that's something you just don't do on a plane, I don't care who you are.
L:  Oh really, he got arrested?
R:  We think maybe he might have been mentally disturbed or something but, um, but my husband was real calm about it and said that it just reinforced his feeling that the airlines are doing what they can to prevent, uh, something like that from happening again. [SIGH] I --
L:  Right, I think they've taken precaution as far as the airlines goes.
R:  Oh, absolutely and it's -- it's -- they need to because it's one area that, um, that definitely needed some beefing up [SIGH] uh, simply because there was -- it was lax, you know, before this happened.
L:  What do you think about, uh, people coming over in boats?
R:  Um --
L:  Or ships?
R:  From -- from other countries?
L:  Yes.  I -- I haven't heard much about, uh, safety, security on boats and ships.
R:  I -- I haven't either other than the fact that supposedly --
L:  'Cause they can come on that too and that's what I was wondering.  I'm like, "Well, what about ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I would think that, um, immigration has been tightened up and -- and they're checking, um, identification more carefully, you know, and trying to screen, you know, a little bit better about who's being allowed into our country and who's not.  But it is an enormous task.  Um, I don't -- I guess I haven't really given that much thought simply because [LAUGH] I don't travel by boat, you know, so I haven't really thought of how that changes, uh, what -- those kind of changes would affect me personally.
L:  Have you guys had any, uh -- well, back when nine eleven was happening, did you have any -- Ow, let go! Any riots going on? [NOISE]
R:  No, no, in fact, we were out of town when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that happened.  Uh, my mother in law had had a heart attack and was in the hospital --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we were -- we found out she needed, um, uh, what'd you call it, nursing -- skilled nursing home care --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we were staying at a hotel and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got up that morning to see the tragedy that was unfolding on TV.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And just -- we -- we were just stunned and -- and didn't know what was really going on a whole lot, other than what we saw on the television --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and still had to accomplish what we were down there for, dealing with her, the doctors and the hospital and the social workers and the nurses and -- oh, it --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was a mess.  And the first thing that I noticed that was really odd was all these cars were lining up at gas stations everywhere across the city.  And I was going, "What is going on?"  I thought everybody was going to be fleeing the city.  [LAUGH] Maybe we were under atomic attack or something.  And it turned out everyone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was, um, filling up on gas because of the rumor that gas was gonna --
L:  On the gas prices.
R:  Yeah, and that they were gonna -- gas lines were gonna be shut off.
L:  [NOISE] How high did yours guys get?
R:  Um, at some stations it actually went up to almost five dollars a gallon --
L:   See there were a couple here --
R:  -- which is high for --
L:  -- that got in big trouble for doing that.
R:  Yeah, they -- ours did too, the few stations that did that.
L:  [NOISE]  Big trouble.
R:  Because it was definitely illegal but my husband said, you know, "Nuts with that, that's -- that's just, uh, screwy" so we just watched all these people, you know, in line for hours to get a [LAUGH] tank of gas.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  While we just went about our business.  So, I mean, that didn't even affect us.
L:  Exactly, it didn't affect us either.
R:  Yeah, we figured --
L:  Now, I've got a ten year old in school and there was times that the school took a lot of precaution, I mean, they watched every step, every visitor that came in.
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  Now it's kinda laid back but there's still security.  They've got new doors at the front and -- and I don't live in a really, uh, meanful, active city, you know, it's just kind of a laid back city and, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's what we are too.  We're out here in Buffalo, which is a more rural community and, uh, although we've got a fairly large high school but they've, um, instituted programs, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that one and have the local sheriff's department that has -- has worked with the, uh, school to make sure that, um, all the -- all the doors are locked now except for the main entrance.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And visitors have to register.  They're -- they're no longer just allowed to walk in and, you know, walk to child's classroom like they used to.  So, I mean --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I -- I think those changes are good.
L:  Right, exactly.  And -- and I feel it's good for all over, especially when you're a single parent and the other partner isn't allowed to take the kids.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause you hear a bunch about that but since September eleven they finally did something about it. [NOISE]
R:  Sure.  I do know that they --
L:  I know -- I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, go ahead, I'm sorry too.
L:  I know when I found out about it, um, I worked at Walmart for nine years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and when my son was born a year later I quit.  But a couple of months before I quit we were having a ten year re-grand opening of our super center.  The same time he was announcing our regrand opening was the same time we got the information that the airplane hit.
R:  Oh my god!
L:  [LAUGH]  So, it was a kinda good day but then we couldn't continue with our ceremony because we needed to stop and listen to this. [NOISE] 
R:  Well --
L:  We needed to respect everybody else so we never did have our re-grand opening [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  That's -- is -- that's a shame but I can understand how, you know, this would take precedence because that was just so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  It was just so horrifying, you know, to see it and it was just hard to comprehend that it was actually happening here in America, you know, it's -- it's just -- in some ways, because it was in New York it seems like it didn't affect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the people here in the Midland.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, I think, it really hurt every American, you know, and it's hard.
L:  Yeah, my mom was in Tennessee and my dad's a truck driver and the day before they had just drove by --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and were on their way home and she took pictures.  She's like, "I can't believe, you know, that within twenty four hours it's gone".
R:  Yeah.
L:  She goes, "I was just there".
R:  It hurts me every time I see that on TV where they've got like, um, shows, you know, like reruns or something that show the skyline with the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the Twin Towers.  It just breaks my heart to see them there and know that now there's nothing there.  It's just a gaping hole in New York, you know.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, exactly.
R:  Oh, it's just --
L:  And all the, like, kids and all the -- 'cause that's what a lot people preach about now the war.  You know, we're killing innocent people over there but then at the same token when you have a war or when terrorism happens, people are gonna die.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sorry, you know, yeah, if it happened to my children, yeah, I'd be really upset but, you know --
R:  All right, what was that beep?  Oh, I must have an incoming call [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you mu- -- I haven't heard nothing yet so ...
R:  I was supposed to disable that.  Okay.  Um, well how did you deal with your children with this?  Did you -- did you use special, um, time out sessions with them or -- or talk with them, or ...?
L:  Well, Samantha was eight years old [NOISE] when it happened and my son, he was just a year old, um, so he really has no clue but --
R:  Oh, I suppose not.
L:  She was more involved because my mom sent us pictures and we talked to her about it and, uh, Samantha really hasn't asked that much, she just basically, "Well, what happened?" and, "How come we have to go through --" you know, 'cause there for a while safety
