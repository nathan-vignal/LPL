R:  Hi? 
L:  [NOISE] hello? 
R:  Hi, this is Annie, who's this? 
L:  This is Angel.
R:  Hello, Angel.  How did you get involved with this project?
L:  Um, I found it -- signed up for it over the internet.
R:  Oh, me too --  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- me too.  So, how has your life changed? 
L:  Eh, it hasn't at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Where do you live? 
L:  Na -- I hav- nothing's changed for me.
R:  Really?   
L:  [MN]  
R:  What part of the country do you live in? 
L:  Um, West Virginia.
R:  Mhm.  You haven't changed anything about your feelings or thoughts, --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- lifestyle? 
L:  Um, lifestyle, no.  Feelings, mhm, maybe a little bit but not -- not a lot.
R:  Oh. 
L:  I guess I live just too far away.
R:  Maybe.  Are you out in the country? 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, it's like a half hour drive to any town from where we live.
R:  Oh, so maybe you just kinda feel, I'll say falsely safe.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  That you probably have a feeling of safety around you that otherwise probably don't? 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, the only worry we have is the -- the power plants around here.
R:  [MN] I'd say that would be a huge one. What about the water, what if they did something to the water?  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do you have a farm? 
L:  No, we don't have a farm.  We don't have a farm and ...  
R:  Yeah.  What would you do -- do if they contaminated the water way out there, because I'm guessing you just have one source of water, right? 
L:  Yeah, and its well water [LAUGH] it's not even -- you know, it's not city water or ... 
R:  Oh.  How close is your power plant? 
L:  Um, well, we live in the Hunter Valley and there's, like, five of them within a half an hour drive from us.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] 
R:  They're not nuclear power plants, are they? 
L:  No, they're electrical power plants.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Um, there's a nuclear one about [MN] an hour, an hour and a half, but it's --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not -- it's not a big one, it's hardly ever mentioned anywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there has been -- they've been watching it and everything.
R:  Yeah.  What the closest airport to you? 
L:  Charleston.
R:  It that a big one, a big international? 
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  A little tiny one, ha? 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, it's not tiny, but it's not in a major airport.  Around here it is.
R:  Yeah.  You don't have any friends or family that went overseas I guess, ha? 
L:  No.  No, um, we do, um -- the Jessica Lynch that was rescued -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- she lives like two counties away. 
R:  Well, gosh, I would think this would be a huge deal then -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- where you live? 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, her being saved and everything they're -- you know, being rescued.  Where my husband works at a guy knows her and everything.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So ... 
R:  That sure is nice they got her back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I [MN] -- I have a feeling they saved her just because she was female and blonde.
L:  [MN] Yeah. 
R:  Because the culture just seems to really like blond Americans.
L:  Yeah.  That and I kind of figured maybe they figured they would get a little more information out of her since she was female.
R:  Possibly, I haven't heard that tact, but I -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- suppose that's possible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [PAUSE] Oh. 
L:  Oh, I --  
R:  I'm in Southern Orange County, near Disneyland.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  South of that but right on the ocean. [NOISE]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very peaceful and it's very quiet here and I can hide my head in the sand to some degree. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Um, -- 
L:  We just recently went to, um, North Carolina and I was worried about the naval bases and stuff, terrorists and stuff down there --   
R:  Yeah, I'm -- 
L:  -- maybe doing stuff --  
R:  -- I'm very close to Camp Pembleton, just about thirty minutes away and I actually feel a little bit safer.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I like knowing [NOISE] that they're close by [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I'd be afraid they'd try to do something too -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, try and attack. 
R:  [MN] Well, they could, but they're --  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- on such a -- a look out they -- I don't think they'd ever get close.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really don't.  I'm really very proud of the way everyone has conducted themselves.  You know, the only other wars that I have reference to, I don't know about you, I'm fifty five [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, are the Vietnam wars and -- they went on for ever and ever and it was just so heinous [NOISE] this one is -- I don't think it's almost over but it sure seemed different to me for some reason [NOISE]  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] maybe because we had so many more reporters over there and stuff [NOISE]  
L:  Yep -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well -- 
R:  [NOISE] I want you to hold for two seconds, I have to cover up a parrot.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you hear him squawking?  He's such a bad bird.  You're a bad bird.  Mummy's on the phone, don't squawk [NOISE] [PAUSE] Do you have kids that live near a big city? 
L:  Um, I -- I only have two kids and they're eleven and five [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  
L:  But my -- 
R:  Well, my -- my son in law was in New York, he was working right at the trade centre.
L:  Well, now, whenever that happened and -- my grandma actually called me and said, "Did you see what's going on TV?"  And I said, "No."  I turned it there and I really scared I really wanted to go and pick my kids up at school but I fought it because they hadn't told them -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- there was actually supposed to be a big, um, thing with the governor and stuff coming to my daughter's school and they cancelled it and they didn't tell the kids what -- what had happened or anything. 
R:  Ah.
L:  So ... 
R:  Well, we sure knew we -- that -- that was scary it took -- he just happened to have a friend who grabbed him because he was pretty shell shocked and his friend dragged him down to the ferry boat and got him back to New Jersey.  He got the first and only boat out of the whole area -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Because that was a long, scary three or four hours.
L:  Yes, um, [MN] -- 
L:  And for some screwy reason the only person that could get in or out was me.
L:  Oh. 
R:  So I sort of became command center central for all of the relatives back there.
L:  Yeah.  Do you, um, think that President Bush handled it properly, or ...
R:  You know, I -- I know absolutely nothing, but I do [MN] -- I would vote for him again tomorrow even though I didn't vote for him the first time around.
L:  Well, this a -- 
R:  I think he's done the best that anybody could possibly do under horrific conditions. 
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  Especially those people wanted to be free.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's so clear.  I don't think he's lied to us any place.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And if he did lie I don't think it was by intent.
L:  [MN] Yeah. 
R:  Just maybe something he didn't know about.  I mean look what they've found today, those two thousand bodies.
L:  Oh, I haven't been watching the news, I haven't even seen that. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I just -- I sa -- 
R:  A thousand bodies of people that Saddam slaughtered.
L:  Oh.  Where they all buried in one grave?
R:  Apparently so.
L:  Oh.  I might have to go turn on -- 
R:  It's quite -- 
L:  -- the news -- 
R:  -- a quick flash it looked like separate graves from what I saw, but who knows, they haven't uncovered them yet.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's just one bad person.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah [MN] -- 
R:  You know, I tend to stay away from -- I travel a lot, um, I started driving up to Northern California, I go up once or twice a month rather than flying, um, for no other reason than at -- by the time I get through security and checkpoints I can be there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, the same six hours I sit around in airports, I'm in my own car and I'm there.
L:  You know, that is one thing, I've never flown but since that -- since September eleventh -- 
R:  Never flown?
L:  No, and I won't now [LAUGH] if it's some place you have to fly I'd just soon stay at home. 
R:  There you go.  Well, it sounds like you're in a very safe little environment there.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean -- 
R:  West Virginia is probably not on any -- 
L:  Actually it's -- 
R:  -- attack plan.
L:  Well, actually because of the electrical plants and the -- I mean our power plants supply electric to a lot more than West Virginia, it is on -- whenever we're in school we learnt that it was on one of the top ten lists of not -- 
R:  Huh -- 
L:  -- mhm, what would you call it?  They had a top ten list on TV but it was a different type of list. 
R:  For someone to hurt that plant they'd have to be total strangers, right, to -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- get in?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And you'd certainly see 'em coming if they were flying over it.
L:  Well, see there's so many of them close together -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- I live on Ohio West Virginia boarder. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, there's -- right across the river there's two of them, one of them's right in my sister's back yard and she was really scared to send her kids to school after that happened. 
R:  I'd be scared just to live that close to a power plant --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- to tell you the truth.  
L:  Because -- 
R:  We're not that far from a nuclear power plant right here, it's just a --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- few -- again, thirty minutes -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from us.
L:  You know, I guess that don't -- that don't dawn on me about that because I never talk about it and I've never thought about it, you know, a power plant being there, but ... 
R:  Yeah, you don't follow the cancer -- 
L:  [MN] No. 
R:  -- scares and the cluster outbreaks?
L:  No, I'd probably have panic attacks [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, how have your children reacted, do they -- are they more violent, are they playing war games -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- do they watch it on TV, do they know Saddam at eleven and five?
L:  My, um, -- my older daughter does, my daughter does.  My son, he don't.  He -- he just thinks it's TV, he don't realize what it is. 
R:  Huh.
L:  He kinda is into watching them, you know, the tanks and stuff, but he don't understand what it is, he's too young. 
R:  Does he copy it in his play?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  That's good. 
L:  He likes to see wrecks but [LAUGH] I guess that's normal kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm [MN] I remember when that -- the first morning of nine eleven I flipped on the TV and I saw what was happening and I heard them and I'll never forget the look on that reporter's face is -- he's so astounded and I thought that they were replaying something from the past as somehow I had missed it, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- because I was still kinda sleepy. 
L:  Yeah.  I know -- 
R:  And I just -- it was just so amazing to me, I thought how could I possibly not know about something like this?
L:  Yeah.  Well, my grandma called me and got me out of bed and I turned on --
