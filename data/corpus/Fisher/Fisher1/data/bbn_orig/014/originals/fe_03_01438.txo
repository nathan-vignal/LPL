L:  Hello, my name's Evelyn.
R:  Hello, I'm Amy.
L:  Hi, Amy.  So, what changes have you made since September eleventh?
R:  I don't really think that I've made any.
L:  Me neither.
R:  I don't think.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, it's -- oh, you think about it a little more and -- and worry about bad things that could happen, but I don't think that I've changed anything in my life at all.  
L:  Same here.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, we got to talk about this for ten minutes.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, let's see.  
L:  So, where were you when the planes hit?
R:  I was actually at school.  I was -- I just graduated in December from college.
L:  Yep?
R:  And that was -- I was still in school at that time, so we were getting ready for a pop quiz, actually, and a girl rocked in late to class and she went right up and spoke to the teacher and our teacher said, "Well, something terrible has happened.  We're going down to the Student Union to turn on the television, and we never did have that test.
L:  Good thing, huh? [LAUGH].
R:  It was a very good thing.  I was very unprepared, so -- and where were you?
L:  I was sleeping. [LAUGH].
R:  Oh!
L:  My sister woke me up and said a plane had just crashed into the -- one of the, um, Twin Towers.  And so I woke up and turned on the TV and --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- when I turned on the TV, that's when the second plane hit.
R:  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, that was definitely a strange day.  We sat there in that Student Union for probably an hour, just watching the TV.
L:  Now, were you close by?  To New York?  
R:  No.  No, I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh.  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  And you?
L:  Chicago.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  So then when there finally seemed to be nothing too much more happening, I got out of there and came straight home and plonked in front of CNN for the next [LAUGH] probably --
L:  Twenty four hours. [LAUGH].
R:  -- seventy two hours.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  After a while, then, I just had to turn it off.  Couldn't watch no more of that.
R:  I think I probably watched too much of it, just like I did with this war that was -- we're getting done with now.  I probably kept CNN on constantly, like an addiction.  It's more than watching soap opera.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  When the wa- when -- when that first happened, I watched a lot, when the war first broke out.  Ever since, I won't watch it.  It's just --
R:  How far into --
L:  -- too much --
R:  -- it did you watch?  Just a couple days of it or ...
L:  Just a couple of days.  Every -- you know, whenever a commercial would come on somewhere else, I'd flip on CNN.  I won't watch it no more.  My mom will constantly watch it.
R:  I do, too.  It's terrible.  I'm just the opposite.  I'll flip over to something else if CNN have a commercial.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, because some things that they're showing now, they shouldn't really be showing.  Like, the bodies and the actual gun battle.  I don't think they should be showing that.
R:  They're probably sitting -- but it's like -- it's kinda like a car accident to me.  It's one of the things that you don't really want to watch, but you kinda can't help it.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH].
R:  Just because it's there and you -- it's something that -- I remember coming home, I came home from the bar one time at two o'clock in the morning and couldn't go right to sleep.  My husband's laying there in bed sleeping, and I turned it on and it was -- they were just going into a battle and I was thinking, what in the world?  I come home at two o'clock in the morning and turn this on, and I couldn't turn it off, though, because it wasn't like it was a movie where I could just, you know, pick up the next day and find out how it ended.  I mean, this was actually happening right there as I was watching it, and I thought, "Oh my gosh, this is bizarre".
L:  Yeah.  My mom's been sleeping with it on.  I told her she has to stop doing that.  She's getting into bad moods.  [LAUGH].
R:  Pretty extreme.  [LAUGH].
L:  She falls asleep with it on and then her TV's on all night.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And I think it's subliminally doing things to her brain.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I use it to fall asleep to a couple of times only, because when they bring in all those analysts and all those retired generals and all that, that I don't really care to watch, it gets so boring that they'll [LAUGH] put you to sleep, but I have my TV sleep, so it'll shut off by itself.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  She doesn't use that option.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I can't imagine that.  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Okay.  Well -- [LAUGH].
L:  So, did you read any magazines from the September eleventh?
R:  Um, no, not really.  I collected all the newspapers that I could find around here.  That was about it, though, and put those all -- put them away, you know, put them in plastic bags and put them away, so my son can --
L:  Did you know anybody?
R:  -- have them.  No, fortunately, nobody at all.
L:  That's good.  
R:  About the only bummer thing was after that happened, I'm in the National Guard here --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and I thought, "Oh, yeah, I'm going away".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I might as well pack my bags now.
L:  Did they call you?
R:  No.  No.  Believe it or not, and I need to find some wood real quick here and knock on it because ever since then, nothing.  I mean, we've gotten a couple of close calls where we had to pack the bags and be ready to go, but we've not actually gone anywhere.  It's amazing.
L:  Mm.  Do you know anyone that's in the war right now?
R:  Um, there's people I -- I don't know exactly where they're at, though, people from our base that have gone, but I don't know -- they don't tell -- even they don't even tell us where they go- going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The only ones that are allowed to know are the ones that it affects, so -- but I know several people who have left.  I just don't know where they are.  I mean, they could still be stateside, for all I know.  Or they could be over there, I don't really know.  [SIGH].
L:  Yeah.  I knew one guy.  He was over in Afghanistan after the attacks and --
R:  He ca- --
L:  -- they sent him over there and then I heard he actually shot one of them.
R:  Wow!  
L:  He's, um, in the Navy. 
R:  That's pretty wild when it strikes people that you know.
L:  Yeah.  Luckily, nobody I knew was over in New York.
R:  Yeah, that just seems like everybody knew somebody, but I -- I didn't know anyone either.  And I don't even think I knew anyone -- or know anyone that knew anyone.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Which is guess is pretty lucky.  But it's scary.  It's one of those things that makes you think, when you're in your little world and nothing's going wrong, you just -- you never know.  
L:  So, did you ever think to buy plastic and duck tape?  [LAUGH].
R:  No. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I did not.  I did not at all.
L:  Someone asked me that earlier, so they called me earlier with the same topic. 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH].
L:  And they said about the plastic and duck tape.  I was, like, no way.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  Not at all.  That would -- just seemed ridiculous to me.
L:  That is not going to do nothing.  My mom actually -- we needed tape to -- we have a cream colored carpet and we're having a party, so we put plastic down, and she was -- she was embarrassed actually go have to buy plastic and tape.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Funny.
L:  She's, like, "I'm going to walk into the store and they're going to think I'm taping up the house".  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  She's, like, "I can't do it".  Luckily, we knew someone with plastic [LAUGH].
R:  That's just crazy.  Yeah, I just -- I thought that was a little too -- too weird, and people that I knew were -- were changing -- I'm a substitute teacher and there were teachers -- subs that I know that were telling the sub office they weren't available.  When was -- it was just a couple of months ago when they were -- that was the end of one of the Islamic holidays or something and they were saying that was probably going to be the -- the day they were going to attack.  This is before the wa- the war even started.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they were calling in and saying they weren't available that day and they didn't want to go teach that day because something was probably going to happen, and I thought, that's just -- you -- you can't live your life just thinking something's going to happen.
L:  Exactly.  We were sitting here, after the party, and we're sitting there talking about everything that's going on with, um, before -- it was before the war started, um, it was on February fifteenth, when they were doing all the demonstrations then, [LAUGH], talking about what's going on in the world and everything and the -- one woman said, you know, "It's sick that we're sitting here laughing about it", because we were laughing and I said, "If we don't, then we're the ones buying plastic and duck tape".
R:  Exactly.
L:  If you can't sit there and, you know, and try to make some sense of it, then we're bolting up the house.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So --
R:  So, what was their opinion of the demonstrators that have been doing this while the -- while the war was going on?
L:  I think that's -- they have the right to do that.
R:  It pissed me off.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Made me madder than anything.
L:  What makes me mad is the people who say that they shouldn't be protesting and if they don't like it, they should leave and they don't support America, what -- you know, they're not saying they don't support America.  They're just saying they don't support the war.  I don't support the -- I don't support the war.
R:  I don't believe that I'm a war supporter, but I -- I think that by not supporting what's going on by the country -- going on with the country, that like George Bush keeps saying, if you're not with us, you're against us.
L:  No, I don- [LAUGH].
R:  And ask someone who's in the military to see those people doing that, although, you know, like I said, I haven't gone anywhere, but to see those people doing the protesting, that can't do anything but bring the spirits down of the people that are forced to be there.  They see that.  I mean, they -- you know, they know what's going on.  People are telling them what's going on.  I just -- I can't imagine being there, being one of those people fighting and hearing from back home, or getting a letter from home or whatever the case may be, that people are protesting against what you're doing.  That would just make me feel so horrible, and it did make me feel horrible, even though I wasn't doing it.
L:  You see, I --
R:  I just think that was -- it's a horrible, horrible thing to do, to the human spirit.
L:  I don't think like that.  I -- I think, you know, you're protesting what -- you know, dir- you know, what the -- the government is deciding, not what the -- the -- the troops are doing.  The governments that are th- our government is the one who decided we needed to do this, and I -- I don't support Bush.  I didn't vote for him.
R:  Hm.
L:  I didn't want him in office.
R:  Oh, this could become a heated conversation [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- because I'm a total Bush supporter and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
