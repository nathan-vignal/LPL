L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Yeah, hi.  I'm doing good.  My name is Eta.
R:  Eta; my name is Christine.
L:  Christine.  Hi, Christine, how are you?
R:  Very good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Texas.
L:  From Texas.  Is this --
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Ill -- uh, Illinois.
R:  Illinois?
L:  [inaudible] Illinois.  Uh-huh.  Actually, I'm a little bit outside Chicago.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Is this your third call also?
R:  Yes, I did.  [LAUGH].  And then I lost it and I called back and took a couple times, but I finally got in, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, have you made any changes in --
L:  Actually, I did, yeah.  I did make --
R:  You have?
L:  -- a lot of changes because you can probably hear that I'm not from Texas.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  You do have a distinct, ah, accent.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I know.  So, I'm not -- you know, people always make fun of me when somebody says, "Where you from?"  Somebody will always say, "Oh, don't you here, from Texas?"  You know?  It's -- it's a standing joke here.  I don't know why.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not even funny.  No, actually, I'm from Europe, as you can tell, some, uh, raised in Germany, and then I went to school in different other European countries.  So what I did change most is that I'm not traveling.
R:  I see.
L:  I mean, I'm not flying at all.
R:  Not even local?
L:  Well --
R:  You don't mean, just -- or do you just mean international?
L:  I don't like to fly local either, I always drive, but I definitely do not fly international.  I have not been home and I'm not planning on -- you know, as long as the political situation is the way as it is right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I made a different -- a big change, you know?
R:  That is.
L:  Not seeing my family and, yeah.  And locally, no I didn't make any changes here.  You know, I live my life like I did before, within the United States.  How about you?
R:  Well, um, I haven't intentionally not flown [LAUGH], but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I don't -- to begin with, I wasn't a person that flew more than maybe once or twice a year anyways --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to visit family, and all my family is within the United States.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, I live in -- in a part of Texas that's uh, outside of Dallas.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we have a very, very high concentration of foreign people that live in our area because we're like in the Silicon Valley of -- of Texas.
L:  Oh.  I've never been to Texas.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I really have to go, but I've --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I never made it there, you know?  I always talk --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- about it and, well you know, if you don't have the reason, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you don't go.  It's not a vacation spot --
R:  It's not someplace you go if you don't have a reason.
L:  -- is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I -- I think not consciously, not completely consciously, I caught myself subconsciously paying more attention to the people around me.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Uh, at different times.  Um, I have neighbors across the street and on one side of me that are Saudi and it kinda makes you kinda like nervous a little bit because yo- they very much keep to themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  And so you don't know if cars that you see coming in and out or people coming in and out is normal.
L:  Mm.
R:  For them.  Like, I know my neighbors on the other side --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I kinda know them a little bit.  We've talked over the fence, we're on a first name basis, so I would know if there was, like, a strange -- something strange happening at their house --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that wasn't the norm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think paying attention more to, you know, what's going on around you, kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't gone to any major um, you know like events, like concerts or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Football games.  Um --
L:  Well, that is a lot of changes, though?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Only because I'm like -- well, you know, I can watch it on TV.  You know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, whereas before, my friends and I would be like, "Oh yeah, let's go to the Cowboy game", you know? 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And now it's like, "Let's just watch it on TV" and --
L:  Yeah, that is a major change, when you think about it.  You know?
R:  And watch -- you know?  And I think it's just 'cause we're scared.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, more than anything else.  It's -- it's fear of the unknown.  You look at everyone that you don't know and you wonder.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Kinda thing.
L:  You see, I actually, like, a little bit different because I am a foreigner.  You see?  To me, it's not that extreme.  I'm a foreigner myself and I'm used to being around foreigners and I have a much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bigger tolerance to anybody who is foreign.  You know?  I mean, whatever they have on their head --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, even the people with the turbans, they don't scare me because I see them more as, "Well, there's another foreigner.  Wonder how he -- he --he's doing in this country?"  You know?
R:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH].  And you know, I don't think I used to be that way.  I like to think I wasn't that way.  I mean, I was born and raised in New England.  There were no foreigners around.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, there weren't even any black people around [LAUGH] when I was growing up.
L:  I know what you -- I haven't seen a black people until I was in my mid twenties.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- up there is like, I think there was one or two kids in my whole high school of seven hundred and something kids, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we saw nothing.  There was -- it was -- it was not an issue, it was a nothing thing.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then I moved to Texas and, you know, around Dallas is so multicultural.  I mean, it really is.  I think if you wanted to, if someone walked down the street, they could probably find someone of every nationality, from every country in the world.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the same here in Chicago, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  There's like a big hub.
R:  Yeah, and so, um, it -- it was some cultural change for me, but I always just found it intriguing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- interesting, you know?
L:  Yes, I know.
R:  Like, all these people are different, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  An- and to talk to them and find out, you know, different things.  And that kind of thing.  And now I'm not as open, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm more reserved.  I -- I don't -- I don't think I'm like, "Oh, you know, you're a terrorist because you -- you're wearing a turban" --
L:  No, I understand what you mean.
R:  " -- you've got to be a bad person".  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  No, I understand exactly what you mean.  Yeah.
R:  So, um, that kin- those kinds of things.  I think I would fly.  You know, I say that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I would -- yeah, if I were planning a vacation or a trip to -- to go home, I -- I don't think I would hesitate to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- book on an airline.
L:  Overseas?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Would you go overseas?
R:  I don't know.  I never have been in my life.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I've never -- I've -- I've never -- yeah, I've been to Canada, but that doesn't count.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I've never been outside the United States.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As far as travel --
L:  Because that's a total different feeling, you know?  It -- it is a totally --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- different feel.  If you leave the continent and you -- you know, across the ocean forever, like ten, eleven hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it is very different, and then you know you are in a hostile environment all the time.  As long as you are in the -- a United States airplane, you are in a hostile environment.
R:  That's true.
L:  Then you land in Europe, to go into [inaudible] or France or -- or whatever, you know?  An airplane to go home, you are again in hostile environment because, you know, there is no good feelings between my country, you know, my -- my native country and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the Arabian countries either, you see?  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are in a hostile environment all the times, and there -- like, all this little pockets of things happening all over the world, you know?  The small size things that aren't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- blown up and we don't hear much about here in the United States, I get it from the email from my family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they are like small things happening, like mean things, you know, and yeah.
R:  I know, and I -- I sit -- I sit here, you know, and it's like I keep saying to myself, "Why?  Why do we have to be this mean to each other?  Why can't we just leave each other alone?"
L:  Isn't that the truth?
R:  I mean, it's kinda like, you know, I keep thinking to myself, who cares --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what God you pray to or believe in, as long as you're praying and your God doesn't interfere with me being able to pray to mine --
L:  Right, and when you go --
R:  -- what -- what do I care what you call your God?
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  You know -- you know what I think?  As long as people do have a God, whatever they call it, you know, that's fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have something to concentrate on and there's something that they can, you know, relax and feel well and ask for help and -- and you go with the solace or something like this, I think.  You know, I wouldn't know because, you see, I'm an atheist, but you know, I see that --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- that's the way I see that.
R:  But -- but you know what?  I mean, you don't go around, as an atheist trying to impose your belief --
L:  No.
R:  You don't find it necessary to impose the way you believe on --
L:  No.
R:  -- someone else.
L:  No way.
R:  Just like, I'm Catholic, but I don't feel the need to impose on you --
L:  Yeah, so's my husband.
R:  -- my Catholicism.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  It's like, that's fine, you know?
L:  You know, I'm vegetarian.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. Yeah, and I eat meat, so you know, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, you know, if you going to be --
L:  So does my husband.  You see?
R:  You know, we might not be best friends and be able to go out to dinner together [LAUGH] you know, kind of thing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or go to church together, but you know, that doesn't mean we have to even interact.  We could just leave --
L:  Right.
R:  -- each other alone.
L:  Right.  I think --
R:  That's -- that's what I don't understand.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, 'cause there's nothing in what you believe or in what I believe that, in my -- in my believing what I believe and practising what I believe, would inflict any kind of pain or anything --
L:  Absolutely not.
R:  -- on another person.
L:  Right.
R:  It shouldn't.
L:  You're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.
R:  You know?  And I just -- I -- I just don't -- I just don't understand that [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.  You see, my husband is -- husband's family is Irish.  I mean, they're American Irish, they're here since many --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- ah, generations, but they have all these problems in Ireland forever, you know, and it's just the same thing.  
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  It's just the belief system and I just -- I really don't understand it either, you know?  I just think people are people and we should just be friendly and kind to each other.
R:  I keep wondering if it's just political.
L:  I think so.
R:  In -- in that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not just the United States, but like all countries --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that war is good for the economy.
L:  Yeah, but not for --
R:  You know, and --
L:  -- the people, though?
R:  Not for the people, but --
L:  Not for the people.
R:  -- you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- it's like I -- I can't understand why -- why else, and then you know, I have friends who say, "Well you know, you gotta understand there are people that are certifiable and crazies out there", like --
L:  Definitely.  But they are here also.
R:  That they can --
L:  You know?
R:  That they can --
L:  They're here and they're there.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, you know, that -- that can -- they say -- they say to me, "Well, look at Hit- you know, look at history, look at Hitler".
L:  Right.
R:  "Look at, like, you know, Bin Laden, look at"  -- you know, and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I said, you know, "To me", I just have to say, "That's got to be they have an evil gene 'cause I can't begin to understand it", you know?
L:  Right, yeah.  There are some -- I think there are just people who are, like, definitely evil, you know?  They are evil.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  The- they have no conscience.  I don't know how that happens, so, but they have no conscience.  They are, like, through and through evil, and they're everywhere.  You meet them here, you know?  And I see people --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- sometimes, I just think, "My God, this cannot be a person".  You know?  They --
