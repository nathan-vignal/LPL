R:  Um, like, they -- they'll walk in place for a little bit -- 
L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
R:  -- and then they do some different aerobic -- it's not really aerobics, though, um -- 
L:  [inaudible] Um -- 
R:  -- [inaudible] but they're -- they're very low impact and just -- [inaudible] 
L:  Uh, h- -- h- -- h- -- it's been so long since I had [SIGH] been -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- called for one of these that it sort of threw me.
R:  Exactly.  But, yes, I'm starting back, um, trying to work out three times a week, um, hopefully --
L:  Ah. 
R:  [LAUGH] if I can keep that back into routine.
L:  Well, I, [LAUGH] yeah, huh, that's a -- that's a -- this is a trick question. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  I -- I was actually in the military, um -- 
L:  Ah, I, uh, used to work.  Uh, uh, now I'm -- 
R:  -- and so I was pretty vigorous into working out.
L:  -- well, due -- due to h- health situation, it's -- 
R:  Oh, wow! 
L:  -- when I -- when I feel -- 
R:  Well, I was in the marines.
L:  -- well enough, um, I -- I do water aerobics.
R:  Um, but I got out two years ago now and I guess it's just kind of a nature of you're told to do something and so you definitely want to [LAUGH] revert from everything --
L:  And cardiovas- -vascular. [MN] 
R:  -- that you were told to do when you get out, at least for me [LAUGH] but -- 
L:  Huh, and -- and it -- it -- they don't rip up the knees and feet and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it's definitely, um, something that I feel, uh, everybody should work out and then it does -- it depends on the person --
L:  It depends on, you know, which particular -- 
R:  -- as far as how much. 
L: -- sadist is running the class. [LAUGH]
R:  A workout doesn't have to mean, um, you know, going to the gym and ... exactly, exactly.  But I feel that everybody should at least -- 
L:  Argh [SIGH] -- 
R:  -- do something to, um --  
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- keep themself in shape to their own body.
L:  -- uh, right now -- right now I'm just having trouble eating at all.
R:  Um, as far as that's concerned, um -- 
L:  I'm -- I'm, ah, undergoing chemo right now and -- so that -- that puts a who- -- that put- -- that -- that explains the, er, exercise situation as well ... uh, but, uh, how about you -- how about yourself?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Right, and [inaudible] my -- for myself as well.  I've had knee surgery and so I understand how the -- the impact, um, because I -- I did a lot of things in high school -- 
L:  So that's walking in place?
R:  -- that, looking back, I shouldn't have, um -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that I didn't at the time think anything about because I was young and it didn't hurt then, but, um, didn't realize that ... exactly, exactly.  But, uh, yeah, I'm -- I'm really being in- into stretching.
L:  Some sort of calisthenics? 
R:  Um, I think everybody should, um, stretch.  I mean, and there's, you know, all kinds of different things for, [MN] you know, somebody who can't -- you know, had a broken arm or something, there's still lots of different exercises that you can do to -- to, um, recuperate the muscles and to get that -- 
L:  I -- I -- I gather you've been out of, er, from doing that for a while.
R:  -- working through, because my, um, my stepdad, he, uh, he had heart surgery, um, and he -- he's going through -- his legs there for a while were -- would go numb -- 
L:  I understand.  My husband, uh -- 
R:  -- um, because of the -- the low blood pressure down to his legs -- 
L:  -- is retired navy, so ... [LAUGH] Ah. 
R:  -- and now he's, um -- and he's -- he was pretty [inaudible] overweight, um, and now he's going through, uh, the same thing, the ork- -- the [inaudible] treatment, um, and he's losing a lot of weight and he's starting -- getting feeling back in his legs because he's pumping the -- when you move your muscles, you know, you pump blood back in, so it -- it just [inaudible] -- that's the way the body -- 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- was just designed, was to move, so, um ... 
L:  Well, [MN] my -- my husband has contin- -- continued with the working out, er, 'cause ... [PAUSE] It doesn't have to be military standard. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  It takes a lot of discipline to, um, to kee- -- at least keep a routine and that's why I think it's really important for people to, um -- I mean, it may sound really cheesy and dumb, but to actually write down a goal -- 
L:  Um, I've -- 
R:  -- you know, have a long term and short term goals of what you want and to write a routine -- 
L:  -- I've -- I've -- I've tried various types of -- 
R:  -- down of something, you know.  It doesn't, you know, necessarily mean that, you know, I'm going to run a hundred miles a day or something -- 
L:  -- uh, forms of working out over the years and I definitely like the [inaudible] the best.
R:  -- but just to say, "Okay, I'll get up in the morning and I'll stretch for five minutes before I, you know, go about my day" -- 
L:  Of course, now I've -- I've got so I have such bad joints that I think is about all I can stand in a class.
R:  -- you know, but if you actually, instead of s- -- just saying it, if you actually write it down, I fou- -- I found out that most people, when they actually see something that they hand written down and if they stick it on a note, on a little sticky note and stick it on the mirror -- 
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  -- to say, you know, "Work out today", that it kind of puts it into your mental and it gets everything else, um, throughout your life, if you're having any -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, stress from your work or whatever -- 
L:  But you -- but you pay for it later on.
R:  -- the case may be, if you just do -- get a few little bit -- 
L:  Yeah.  I, uh -- 
R:  -- of exercising in, um, throughout the week, then it kind of helps maintain everything else. [PAUSE] [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm a very forgetful, not necessarily forgetful person, but I just, um, tend to, ah, put things off.  I'm -- I procrastinate, so I -- [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  Yes, that's what it sounded like on my end, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that was weird.  Yes, that's what they said and so I was like, well, that was -- that wasn't very nice, they didn't even say -- 
L:  Yeah, um -- 
R:  -- your ten minutes is up. [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  -- and of course the tough thing is that once you -- 
R:  Wow! 
L:  -- stop doing something it's so easy to stay stopped, uh -- [LAUGH]
R:  I think something like that, I'm [MN] I'm not really sure.  Um ... okay.  This is my first one, so, um ... Yes.  Yes, and I answered the phone and -- yes, she has.  Yes, she has.  I know -- I know she's done a couple, I'm not sure, um, how many, um, but I remember her talking.  I think she's actually -- I think she's only done one, now I think about it, she's only done -- this is her -- so this will be her second one, so ...  Yes, that is.  [MN] That is very different.  I don't know.  I think we've said quite a lot on it, um -- well, how often do you do the, um, um -- I know you said that you do it when you -- whenever you're able to, but if you're able to, how often would you do it a week or a month or -- 
L:  Mm, I can see where writing it down would be a good idea ... ah, hadn't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I hadn't thought about that. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] boy, do I know that tu- tune. [PAUSE] Did we just get cut off?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hello?  Yes. [LAUGH] Okay, for -- for a moment I thought we'd been cut off or something there.
R:  Uh, that probably is the case at some places, probably is.  That's true, and I know it sounds kind of s- sad -- 
L:  Yeah.  Because, yes, I -- this is the second time for me to do one of these --
R:  -- but it probably is the case.
L:  -- and they're supposed to tell you when the ten minutes is up.
R:  May I ask what state you're in?
L:  Yes.  How rude -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] and, uh -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  -- my -- my under- -- my understanding is that, er, er, it's like getting paid after doing a -- the third one and, er, this is my second. [LAUGH] Yeah.  You say that it's -- that your wife's the one who set it up.  Uh, had -- had -- had -- has she done one, do you know?  [PAUSE] Er, these -- these -- they come up with some unusual topics [LAUGH] ... argh, and I'm trying to think of what else could be said on this topic [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Um, well -- well -- well, if I -- if I wasn't -- if I -- h- -- h- -- if I wasn't going through the chemo right now I'd be aiming for three times a week and it -- my class lasts an hour and, uh, which is plenty [LAUGH], uh.  Uh, I used to do some weights, too, but I -- they've changed things around at my club and I don't know -- I don't know what I'm doing on the machines and you can't get actual help.  Uh, it's wha- -- I -- I think if you -- I think if you aren't paying for a personal trainer, they don't want to --
