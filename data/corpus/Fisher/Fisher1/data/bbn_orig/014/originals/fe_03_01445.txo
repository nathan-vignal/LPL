R:  Hi, I'm Michael Rosenfeld.
L:  Hi, I'm Christina Brennan.
R:  Well, this is my first time doing these things, so what are you supposed to do, just discuss what's going on?
L:  Well, I guess so.  Um, yesterday I -- was supposed to be my first time, and noone answered.  Noone -- they just said, okay, now's the end of ten minutes, and noone answered.  So I guess it's -- the topic is what changes we've made in our lives since the terrorist attacks of nine eleven, I guess we're supposed to discuss and debate that.
R:  Interestingly enough, let me introduce myself.  I'm a student at the University of Texas, I'm twenty years old.
L:  And I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm thirty four years old. [LAUGH]
R:  Where did you find out about this -- like, wallet dot com -- out of curiosity?
L:  Um, just through -- I --  I do a lot of different stuff, freebie stuff.
R:  On the -- on the internet?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, like me. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Same thing, we got a little spare time, you always look for something that's free.
L:  Right.  Well, has, has this affected you in any way?  Like, what -- do you fly?  I guess as a student you didn't fly that much before, I guess you can't really afford it, can you, or --
R:  Well actually I fly a lot, since my dad's in the oil business I tend to fly -- I used to fly with them, I like to go overseas a lot for my spring break.
L:  Wow.
R:  So.
L:  Well, has that made you more nervous?  I mean --
R:  Oh, well yeah.  Well not rea- honestly it hasn't made much of a difference since I have terrible fear of flying before since I almost died in an airplane incident.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It's like regardless I'm always scared, so I usually just pass out drunk on an airplane.
L:  [LAUGH] What are you scared about?  You said your father's in the oil business, so I mean, I suppose he's in a lot of countries where there are terrorists, I assume -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're flying overseas a lot, so has that made you --
R:  Yeah, I feel nervous -- 
L:  -- more apprehensive about him and his safety since everything started, or...
R:  Yeah, truthfully I do feel somewhat worried for my father, 'cause he's in all these crappy countries that no -- noone wants to go to.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Obviously.
L:  And of course the benefit is you get to go to all these crappy countries [LAUGH] where noone wants to go.
R:  Yeah, I guess. [LAUGH] You get to travel -- I get a lot of frequent flyer miles off it.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  The --  the --  The best thing is our university, what we have, we have like color alerts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they post the color alert, it's like, yellow color alert, terrorist attack level is medium.  It sounds like you're at the beach.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then -- then they all have all these stupid requirements about -- they try to make it more secure, like, they have one security guard standing in front of, like -- the University of Texas is the largest university in America.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, they have one or two security guards, yeah, that's gonna help.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, has anything happened at the campuses or anything, or...
R:  Not that I know of.  I honestly don't think anyone would attack Austin 'cause it's --
L:  I -- I'm -- I'm in North Carolina and I honestly just feel -- [MN] my mom came down here to visit, and she's from Canada, and I honestly just kinda feel that -- she's like, well, you know, she heard about all the alerts, especially she came down I think it was last [NOISE] Memorial Day weekend, I think it was, and, you know, they went to, like, orange alert at that particular time.  They said, "That all the -" -- or maybe it was July fourth.  Whatever it was there's lots of travel, and they said, "Up and down the east coast that you should be extra careful", and my mom started freaking out and she was like, "I don't know how you can live down here, I just don't" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm like, you know, [NOISE] if I lived in New York or I lived in California where I feel might be larger, you know, sources of attacks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I might be a bit more nervous, but you know, I said, I just can't see North Carolina being a huge target.  You know, they're sitting over there, where shall we attack next?  Oh, North Carolina.  Oh yes, that is -- that is the heart of the America.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I, I just can't see it. [LAUGH] It's -- now -- now --
R:  They might -- I think they just go to the beach or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Now with the way they, they've done stuff, honestly, my husband and I laugh because [SIGH] it makes no sense.  When you send, like, anthrax to, like, Tom Brokaw, oh, okay it wouldn't be good if Tom Brokaw died, I wouldn't be happy or dancing around or anything, but honestly, the way they do stuff [NOISE] -- it would frighten me more if they showed that they really understood America, like, if they attacked Disney, with all the families there and children there and everything, it would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would really hit hard, I think. [NOISE] But, [MN] they just show they don't really know a lot about the culture, [MN] and what I think -- this has scared Americans, but I don't think it's scared it as much as if they'd really had a lot of knowledge about where to hit and what to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So...
R:  I agree with you.  The best thing is, I was reading Newsweek [inaudible] Newsweek, and they were talking about all of these psi ops warfare America's using.  And they're like, the do all this research on Arab culture, so they -- what they, what they did, it's really funny if you haven't -- do you get Newsweek?
L:  I used to when I was in high school, I used to read it regularly, but when you get older and you get a family you'll understand that with a two and a three year old, I don't even get time to read in the bathroom anymore. [LAUGH] I don't.  So unfortunately I wish I did, I really do.  But, um -- what did it say?  What --
R:  It's funny though, they're talking about they're using psi ops warfare, which means, like, they have people holed up, so they do -- they have loud speakers and they blare out insults against them, like calling them impotent and stuff, and they get so pissed off they just run at the tanks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They get blown up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because apparently it's, like, a big insult to be -- to insult your manhood.  It's, like, the grave- -- the  gravest thing you can do to insult them, they get so pissed off they just run at them.
L:  Wow.
R:  That's how they get people out of the bunkers. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  That's -- thats -- at least it shows they're doing research and they know what to do in order to take the enemy out, but wow, that's --
R:  It's pretty funny.
L:  That's pretty amazing, yeah, yeah. 
R:  They've --  they've improved on, like, with their methods, I guess.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Though I can't say I like Bush very much.  He doesn't seem to know what he's doing half the time.
L:  I totally agree with you there.  I didn't vote for him, and [MN] I know it's very anti American to say stuff right now about him, but I'm sorry, it's a free country, and I just [MN] -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  [SIGH] I don't feel we went over for the right reasons, I don't feel like it's fully disclosed why we went over --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, and I honestly -- if he was really doing it to free the people, then now he'd be going -- you know, one of the biggest abusers of people is China, you know.  I mean, just think of Tiananmen Square and everything else that --  that has happened, and, and as far as people's rights and, and people having no rights, and their civil rights being violated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, China is pretty big on the list of violators, and you know we're not going over?  Because they can defend themselves.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I --
R:  It's true.
L:  I truly believe that.  That, you know, that if he were really against, you know, [MN] --  he's picking on people that cannot defend themselves.  [NOISE] You know, Iraq cannot defend themselves, and, and, you know, I mean, Korea started up the nuclear reactor --
R:  Korea's the fun- yeah, that, that's the funniest thing.
L:  You haven't seen us go after them, but you've heard us talk a lot about Syria now, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, we only go after people who are easy targets.  So -- anyway.
R:  I think he had a personal vendetta versus Iraq because they tried to assassinate his dad. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Which isn't right.  You don't use the office. That's anti American, to use the office and to use so many people who are just so naive, that go, "Oh, America, America", and he's using all these sheep --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that just fall in line. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And it's just -- that's just as anti American to me as you can get.  It's just to use all these people because you know they're gullible.  [NOISE] You know.
R:  And then, like, they have these -- I don't know if the survey's true, they say, like, that people think that Iraq is responsible for terror- all these terrorists attack.
L:  They have not been able to conclusively prove anything.  They've had to dance around it, every time it's brought up they've had to dance around it.
R:  Well, we all know Iraq's a bastard country, but it's not --
L:  Right.
R:  It had nothing to do -- it didn't really care about America.
L:  Right.
R:  It was having there sitting drinking its French wine and enjoying life.
L:  To me it doesn't matter if they find weapons of mass destruction, that really doesn't matter to me because quite honestly the thing I've always said is, I don't care if they have weapons of mass destruction.  Prove that they are an immediate threat.  You're saying they're a threat.  Prove that they are an immediate threat to us.  Only then, if they uncover so plan and they go, "Oh, we knew about this all along, there's a plan to take out America", [MN] then that's one thing.  But [NOISE] -- are you there?
R:  Yep.  Hello?
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought I heard the phone click.  [MN] But, anyway, to me it's just the thing about, you know, prove that they were a threat to us.  Don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't prove anything else.  I don't care about weapons or anything, prove that they were actually a threat to us. [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's true.
L:  So, that's just me and my little opinion. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think a lot of people think like that.  So that I'm in Texas, supposed to be all pro Bush, the majority of people in my city, we're like, no, no, Bush is a moron and he doesn't represent this state.
L:  Really?  'Cause after this whole Natalie Maynes thing.  You know --
R:  Oh, those are the hicks in Texas.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- there's plenty of hicks, but, like, within the major cities, Houston, you have Austin --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're -- we're -- we're all, like, who -- who cares about -- Bush is a moron, you know, he's, like, -- he's a draft dodger, he's a cocaine addict, and alcoholics --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he's -- he's -- he's -- and then he's like -- he's very double sided.
L:  Well it's nice to know that some people actually, like, think for themselves in Texas.  Not to insult Texans, I really don't, but, I mean, the way they're portrayed in the media, it's like everyone's just like, oh, Bush, Bush, Bush.
R:  No, if you every look at the election results, not that many -- even though Te- Bush won Texas, he didn't win by an overwhelming majority, in my opinion.  There's a good percentage of people that don't like Bush.
L:  Excuse me -- no, I didn't call.  Okay, sorry.  The life of a housewife, um. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm glad -- [NOISE] oh.
R:  Oh.
L:  Honey?  The fax machine, the kids have played with the fax machine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry, we have call waiting and there's no way to turn it off once it starts.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Because the call wait the fax anyway, we can keep talking, I'm very sorry about this, I know it's very irritating, I know that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I keep telling my kids not to mess with it, and then when call waiting kicks in the fax
