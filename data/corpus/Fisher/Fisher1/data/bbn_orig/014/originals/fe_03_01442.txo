R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Michelle from Alabama.
L:  Um, my name's Libby from Virginia Beach, Virginia.
R:  Um, have you participated in these before?
L:  No, ma'am.
R:  I have one.  Um, a couple of months ago on allergies.  Um, this one is supposed to be about September eleventh, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and any changes you've made.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'm more aware of my surroundings since September eleventh, and very suspicious. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I understand that.  So am I.
R:  Um, we had a helicopter flying around here not long ago, it was, um, it was dropping seeds, planting trees.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we called the police, but we weren't the only ones we found out.  As soon as the police answered they said, "It's just a helicopter --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, planting trees." [LAUGH] But they were --"
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- were just dropping -- I mean, it was real odd 'cause it had this thing hanging down, and, um, it, it was suspended from a chain like thing.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it was just dropping seeds everywhere, so yeah, everybody was suspicious about that.
L:  Yeah, it sounds unusual.
R:  Yeah.  Very for this particular area.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I'm also more focused on the military right now and what they're doing -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and what they've done.  You know, and being more supportive of them.
R:  I've got a son in the marines, but so far he's not had to go anywhere, knock on wood.  Um, he's stationed at, ah, Camp June in North Carolina.
L:  Yeah, I live -- Virginia Beach is right next to Norfolk, so we have a lot of military friends and family, um, so -- and we knew people at the mil- at the Pentagon in Northern Virginia, so.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean...
R:  That was awful.  You know, you don't hear as much about the Pentagon as you did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, the twin towers.
L:  Yeah, they got -- New York got hit a lot worse, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Pentagon was a lot closer to home for us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I kinda cringe every time, you know, my family goes back up there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's just been so much happening up that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The sniper, and, um, the nine eleven, and just, just a whole bunch of things going on up that way the last couple of years.  And my daughter in law's from, um, Baltimore, and they went up during the time the sniper was, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- doing all the shooting, and I nearly panicked.  I thought, "Oh, I've raised idiots." [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Actually, I have friends that, um, work at the Michael, near where one of the shootings were, so I was terrified for her the whole time.  I mean, it's scary what people do now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You can't even walk, you know, around town without being afraid that some idiot's gonna be out there, and --
R:  Yeah.  There were -- oh, we had a discussion on -- I'm on a quilting news group.  We have a discussion on there about the, ah, Arab, you know, the Arab people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were, you know, -- you tend to forget that that's world wide, and, um, it got pretty nasty on there.
L:  Mm.
R:  And there were a lot of people on there that did not agree with the others, and it just got really ugly there for a while -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's cooled off now.  But I find them not very friendly at all.
L:  Mm.  I know.
R:  I don't guess I've met one that was actually friendly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- ever.
L:  My husband was over in Bahrain for a while, and he said "They were, you know, very nice and very polite and very, you know, it was different than being here and meeting people from there, they were very -- a lot more welcoming."
R:  Oh, yeah.  I guess them being over here and away from their home, they feel kinda alienated, I don't know, but I would never leave here and go to another country and just move there.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, I wouldn't alienate myself from my family and my friends.  But I wouldn't want to go to another country anyway, not even to visit I don't think.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right now it's crazy, I'm lucky that my husband's locally now, or at least in the States, instead of travelling overseas.
R:  Yep.
L:  That scares me, every time he gets on a plane, you know, you think, who knows what's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's good that they have, um, started checking a lot of -- you know, checking a lot more than what they did before nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think a lot of good's come out of that, but I think it should of came before that.
L:  Yeah, I mean, 'cause they didn't really check anybody who was getting on a plane.
R:  No.
L:  I mean --
R:  I mean, and they were -- they are aware, the CIA knows that they're here, and, you know, they should of had, ah, implementated[?] some kind of security before nine eleven.
L:  Mm.
R:  I was just in shock the morning I -- I turned the TV on and there, you know, I heard something on the radio about something, and I was just down at the end of the street, I'd just took my son to school, and I was on my way home.  And I thought, "Well let me see what this is."  And I turned the TV on and there was a plane -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and it was stuck in the side of the building, and then all of a sudden here come another one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then the -- you know, I thought then, you know, that's just too -- you know, why were they even flying that close anyway.  You know, I knew it had to of been done on purpose, and then when the second building hit -- the second plane hit the building I knew then, and it definitely was.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, we were on vacation that week in Florida.  It was just insane.  I was, so -- so surreal, it kinda ended our vacation before it even started.
R:  Yeah, I could imagine.
L:  And just so focused on other people, and like I said I had people that were near the Pentagon, so I was trying to get in touch with them, and I couldn't get in touch with them, so.  It keeps me in contact with people more. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] check up on everybody every so often.
R:  I know I've got a, a cousin in New Jersey that works -- well, it's her husband, he works across -- in the twin -- one of the twin towers buildings, but it just so happened he'd had to go out of town that morning, and he had -- he didn't go to the office that day.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, that was just fortunate for her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And her kids.
L:  Oh, I couldn't imagine worrying about your family anywhere near there.
R:  You know, I didn't realise until that happened there were a lot of people here where I live that had family and friends there that worked in the -- you know, in the twin towers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you just never --
L:  I noticed that too.  Yeah.
R:  You don't realise until something happens like that.  It's just like you go out and buy a car, you never realise there's that many cars like yours until you get it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  That was just -- oh, trying to keep my kids closer too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I kept them pretty close before, but now it's, like, ... I don't want them to go very far. 
R:  I couldn't get my -- get in touch with my son for days after that.  Everybody was calling their, ah, military family.
L:  Right.
R:  And I was about to go crazy.  Finally he called and he, um, I don't know if he -- he -- I don't think he even knew anything about it.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't think he'd even heard anything about it.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  He must have been --
R:  They just --
L:  -- training that day or something.
R:  They just young and they just don't watch TV, just don't watch the news or but -- you know, I don't -- he -- he wouldn't watch the TV at all then, I don't think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  You don't really...
R:  He don't watch it now.  He don't watch anything about the war or anything.  And I'm glued to the TV twenty four seven.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I thought, now that's just not smart, knowing you may have to go over there, you need to know what you're walking into.
L:  Yeah, I would think you'd be paying a little bit more attention to it.
R:  Cartoon Network, he does. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's twenty one, and he's still like a child.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes that's nice.  Sometimes --
R:  I guess it is if you could be that way, but I -- oh, I couldn't.  I'd wanna know.
