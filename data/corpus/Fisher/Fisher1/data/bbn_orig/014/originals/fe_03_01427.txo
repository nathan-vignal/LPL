R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Ina Lewis.  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Hi.  My name's Kim Fynt.  I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Hi, Kim.
L:  Hi.
R:  September the eleventh.  You were very near the scene.  [LAUGH].
L:  I guess I am closer than Georgia.
R:  Yeah.  I will --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say that I don't believe that I made a lot of drastic changes in my life or my regular routine, however I was extremely stressed out, like almost everybody else.  I think the one change that I might of made was looking at it twenty four seven, it was always on, and I didn't want to miss a minute of it.  Just --
L:  That's --
R:  -- the, uh, media --
L:  That's so tr- -- right.
R:  Mm
L:  Right.  I -- I feel the same way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think I really do anything different.  But, uh, [SIGH] saw it all the time on television [SIGH].
R:  So did I and I didn't really do anything different.  Um, I was busy thinking about what should I do [LAUGH].  I didn't run and give blood or any of those there patriotic things --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- although I guess I should have.
L:  You know what?  I will say that, um, I have not travelled by plane since that happened.
R:  You either?  Neither have I.  I --
L:  And I'm afraid to.
R:  Mhm.  It's pretty scary now, because it's so, um -- it makes one very insecure and be- plus the airport services are changed and the, uh, it changed the economy.  It did a number on these -- on the country as a whole, but it just, uh -- I was very protective of my grandchildren [LAUGH].
L:  [MN].
R:  I'm a grandmother --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was ch- I called to check up on everybody, uh, when it first happened.  I remember that now.  My -- my family lives here, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- called around the city.
L:  Well, when it did first happen, um, there were reports all over the country, you know, that things were going on and you never knew who was -- what was going on, on the first day.
R:  That's very true.  There were reports and some of them just weren't even true, but no -- I -- even the, um, the reporters are -- the people in office at that time didn't know themselves what was going on.
L:  Right.
R:  So they go ahead and report something and then they change it and it was just real unstable.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, no, but I am just -- I don't want to fly, I don't want to get -- I don't want to get there -- what do they say, you have to get there two hours ahead of time or something?
R:  They do, and even if you did all that, just the thought of it is a bit scary.
L:  I know.  I have two young children myself.  They're five and two.  I mean ...
R:  Oh.
L:  I can't imagine -- I feel like putting us on separate planes or something, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Just seems like a big mess, to do that.
R:  Yeah.  That was -- let's see, that was two years ago, I guess, two and a half years ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, one -- yeah.  Ah, were your -- your kids were too small to be in school that day, weren't they?
L:  Yeah, but my husband came home.  They --
R:  Oh, did he?
L:  Yeah, and we're really -- you know, we're really far away.  Although one of the planes did crash in Pennsylvania, but --
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
L:  Yeah, but it's far away from here and, um, they still -- they closed work and sent him home.
R:  I see.  Well, that's a -- that was a very natural thing to do.  Even some places way down here closed down and -- and sent people home.
L:  Ahah.
R:  But --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- my daughter -- my grandchildren's mother works in a -- a skyscraper in downtown Atlanta.
L:  [MN].
R:  She's, like, on the --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- thirty first floor, or something --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- like that.
L:  Oh, that must of been scary for you?
R:  It was very scary, and what happened on the day that it happened, I was still sleeping that morning and she called me and woke me up and she said, "Mama, the country's und- under attack".
L:  Mm.
R:  I said, "What?"
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, it took me a moment to get myself together to just really grasp what she has said, so then I turned on everything I could to learn what I could and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as we said before, everything was all up in the air and nobody really knew what was happening.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I just hope -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that it just never happens again, but it makes you not think that it won't happen again.
L:  I know, and I know there's been a lot of air travel since that time and everything's been fine.  I understand that statistically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we're safe.
R:  True.  Mhm.
L:  But I just can't bring myself -- you know, really, and it's the waits, too.  I -- I can't imagine keeping my kids in control [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Going through the -- the things that we'd have to go through, all the security checks and everything.
R:  It is, and then, uh, I don't think very many people have gotten -- have just snik- sneaked anything through security except that guy that they caught, that Richard guy with the bomb thing in his shoe or something?
L:  In his shoe, that's right.
R:  But you still don't know whether somebody like that might get past there or something.
L:  That's true.   That's true.  They had all those news programs about how they look at things, you know, your luggage and -- and it just looked so iffy, some of that stuff [LAUGH], you know?
R:  It does, indeed, and they, uh -- it looks very iffy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they look -- plus they tell you that they do random checks.  Now, that scares me a little bit, although I know they can't just check every single one.
L:  Uh, right. 
R:  But some criminal could look through this -- look through the system maybe and -- and just calculate what a random check would -- would --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- uh, where that would put him --
L:  Oh, I nev- --
R:  -- and he could try something.
L:  Yeah, I never thought of that. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, for pity's sake.
R:  Maybe I'm paranoid [LAUGH].
L:  No, you're right.  You're absolutely right to feel that way.
R:  Uh-uh [LAUGH].
L:  Oh!
R:  If I were a terrorist, God forbid, I could sift it through that random check thing, I believe.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.  That's right.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well --
R:  So, you don't know and then ...
L:  You know, I guess we have made one other small change.  We ha- we fly an American flag off of our porch.
R:  Oh, yeah, that will --
L:  Which --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, which is funny, 'cause that we never did it before, 'cause I'm a veteran, but, uh, [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah, but now we've got the flag out, so ...
R:  Well, I'm glad you didn't get called back.  I guess you're not in reserve, or something?
L:  Well, you know, I'm pretty old.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, well, you got some little bitty children.
L:  Yes, I do.  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm an old mom.  [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No, I was done a -- in ninety two -- no, ninety.  I was done in ninety.  So, they wouldn't call me back.
R:  You were out in?  I'm sorry?
L:  I was -- uh, I was out of the --
R:  You were done in ninety?  Oh --
L:  In ninety.
R:  -- I see.  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's sad.  I feel, um, that September the eleventh made a lot of changes in the country, has something to do with causing this war that I hate so much.
L:  I know.
R:  And, uh --
L:  I agree.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I agree, but you know what?  They're finding that, uh [SIGH], you know, when the war started, I thought that it really didn't have anything to do with terrorism --
R:  Yeah, and me, too.
L:  -- but --
R:  I was very much against it.
L:  Me, too.  Me, too.  [SIGH].
R:  But they are finding something that might relate to it, you say?
L:  I think so.  I thi- I remember reading, um, that there were some things found --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that were suspicious, and now we know [NOISE], you know?  This article was saying, "Now we know that it's true", that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- terrorism was coming out of that country, so ...
R:  Yeah, I certainly need to read up on that.  I'm a very newsy person.  I'm addicted to things line Nightline and that kind of thing.
L:  Right.  Ah.
R:  Dateline and all of those.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I haven't seen that, but September the eleventh just caused a lot of, um, panic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, rightly so.
L:  Right. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.  
R:  But it didn't -- back to the subject, it didn't really do anything for me but upset me [LAUGH].
L:  I -- yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.  Just every little backfire you hear at night, you know, or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- some odd noise here and there and you think, "What the heck is that?"  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's true.
R:  I'd been considering getting a flag to go out front and I just didn't get around to it, but um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm very patriotic, of course.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I just hope it never happens again.  At least it put us -- it put this country on ready to, uh, to know that it could happen.
L:  That's right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're [MN] we're getting a lot better at -- at being able to catch those kind of things now.
R:  It is.  We were very relaxed.  This kind of thing just couldn't happen to us, and then it did.
L:  Right.
R:  So maybe --
L:  Like they got rid of that professor down in Florida.  That --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That was so sur- so strange.  I mean, he had been there for, like, ten years.
R:  Yes, he had.  There are a lot of, um, cha- little changes like that.  I don't know exactly what, um, what his connection was.  He --
L:  Right.
R:  He has a lot of support saying that there was no connection.
L:  I know.
R:  But something's fishy somewhere.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.  But, anyway, eliminating them one by one [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  If no -- you know, if no more would, uh, is good, if indeed he's guilty of anything.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  It didn't change my viewing habits.  Uh, I guess it did.  I've always been a rather news fanatic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that is the one thing that September eleven did for me, it made me get more into CNN and things like that, so I guess it did change me to that degree.
L:  Yeah.  I remember watching back when the first Gulf war was going on, because I was in the military then.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right.
L:  So I could not leave that TV alone and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was so stressed out about it, I would wake up and my teeth were just gritted and my head hurt because I was grinding my tee- teeth all night and --
R:  I'm sure.
L:  -- I was just so upset, you know, by the -- I couldn't turn the news off.
R:  I'm sure you were, especially if you were in it, and I didn't think about it when you first gave me the date that you left the service, but that is about right.
L:  That's right.
R:  So that must of been very nerve racking for you?
L:  It was, and you know what was -- was interesting about that was, uh, my unit was so far away from everything, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the people that I knew were about three hundred miles away.
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  So that was good, you know, that they were so far away and --
R:  Mhm.  You just -- so you thought it was good?
L:  Well, it was good for me that my friends, you know, were so far away.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, that they were not ...
