R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, thanks.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm Jeanette.
L:  I'm Florence.
R:  What was your name?
L:  Florence.
R:  Florence?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Pleased to meet you.
L:  Yeah, same here, Jeanette.
R:  Know what the topic is today?
L:  Mhm.
R:  How have you changed your life after September eleventh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you think?  What'd you do?
L:  I didn't do anything differently.
R:  Differently?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I mean, from whatever I've been used to, I didn't make any major changes.
R:  Yeah, I didn't either --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, I mean, it kinda makes you aware, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That, I mean, since it was the first attack on, you know, American soil since Pearl Harbor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like it kinda makes you think and especially since it was a terroristic act, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- it just kinda brought to light the fact of, um, you know, I mean, 'cause yo- you always kinda know that America does things to people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, America kind of puts itself first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And then, um, you realize that when, you know, somebody attacks us, and like, as horrible as it is and how nobody should die like, and I totally disagree with war or, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- disagree with it -- the attacks, uh, on September eleventh, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I still feel that maybe, uh, America should look at itself and, uh, try to be a little more fair, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I do --
R:  I -- I don't know.
L:  -- kinda -- I kind of think that we should, uh, since like, we meddle into other people's affairs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a little bit too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, most of the time when we meddle, one can't but think that we're doing it for secondary being, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, okay, look at what is going on now, without that, yeah I mean, with Saddam now --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, even though we claim that we're trying to --
R:  Yeah, I know, you hear --
L:  -- you know, co-
R:  -- about Operation, you know, for Iraqi Freedom.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But you know, I think it's more like Operation Get Some Republican -- you know, companies in there, you know, basically?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  That's --
R:  You know, whoever gives the --
L:  -- exactly what it is.
R:  -- most to the Republican party can go in there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and rebuild Iraq.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
L:  Uh-huh, and then it seems that we're doing all that to the detriment of our own people.  Look at how many people are dying, the young ones out there, they have families.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Why spend -- what was the projected budget?  It was something like seventy -- no, it was like -- what is it?  What was it?  Like --
L:  Oh, some crazy --
R:  -- eighty billion dollars --
L:  -- million billion dollars.
R:  -- on war?
L:  Right.  We could --
R:  And then, uh, why don't they use that for education or something?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  That's ridiculous.
L:  And then all that means that, that leaves lot more open.  Somehow, somewhere along the line --
R:  Right.
L:  -- could be more targets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, forget the fact that they say the Iraqi people are happy and all that.  I don't think that's the true picture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we still leaving ourselves more open.  And so when something like -- unfortunate though September -- September eleven was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when something like that happens, one can't but think that, you know, if like we brought this upon ourselves?
R:  Right.
L:  Because sometimes it seems like --
R:  Because I mean look at the things --
L:  -- we should just -- mhm.
R:  You know, you could look at the things right now that are happening?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's not going to stop terrorist attacks.  Look at how we getting prepared, you know?  We don't even know, as we speak now, what will happen.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And if one says to make life changes now, what type of changes are we going to make?
R:  Yeah.  Right. 
L:  You know, what [LAUGH] you know --
R:  And then look at, like -- you just loo- I just hate the -- you know, look at the racism now?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, look against -- yo- you know, all types of -- just, you know, not even people from Iraq, like you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people from India and just anybody, you know, that looks like they could be from that area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And -- and I heard that, like, people are -- like, actually, like American citizens --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are Iraqi, you know, are being questioned --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- now and things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's ridiculous.
L:  It is.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And -- and so we -- you know, one can't but say, why we doing that?  Why?  Why?
R:  Mhm.
L:  We don't need to.  I understand, yeah, war, peace, all that, but that's just [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah and it's such -- it's such an American way of looking at things.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- let's rebuild Iraq as America, basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, in a democracy --
L:  Why?  Why do we have to?
R:  -- when people who have been living there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's totally different.  You can't understand what it's like to live in this -- in a culture --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you can't just walk in and impose your culture on someone else's.
L:  On somebody else.  Exactly.
R:  You know, huh, and think it's going to work because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's superior, you know?
L:  Yeah, not just --
R:  Just ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it's just unfortunate because when it comes to, you know, the nitty gritty of it, it is the poor ordinary people that will suffer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And go for the [inaudible] like September eleventh should happen --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- go, "Oh, no".
R:  But it's because of the big guys.
L:  You know?  Yeah.
R:  The big guys up top that cause, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the innocent people -- you know, I -- I don't care --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what they say about, like, the middle class and everything like that.
L:  I don't.
R:  You know, there's the workers --
L:  I don't see any --
R:  -- and then there's the people in charge.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly, and it's always the top -- you know, sitting on the low and the ones below.
R:  Exactly.  And it's the little --
L:  No matter whichever are the --
R:  -- ones blindly working for them.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I don't know that I've actually changed anything --
L:  No.
R:  -- but it's just brought more ideas to light.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  It --
R:  Things about, you know, what you can trust and, you know, freedoms and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  It did bring things to light and also it makes me think, go for this something actual happen, you know, in the future wars.  It lets us see plainly how we leave ourselves open for targets.
R:  Exactly.
L:  How we, you know, meddle into people's businesses and for in retaliation, we leave ourselves out, you know?
R:  Yep.  That's right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- 
R:  It's just crazy, and you know, and I hate these -- the especially -- especially, you know, and I don't know if it's the media or if it's just people believe just what they hear --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things without doing research, but like, I -- I heard something like eighty per cent of the people thought Saddam Hussein, like, was behind the September eleventh att- att- you know, attacks. 
L:  Well --
R:  And I saw -- I heard people -- people who are going to war saying, "I'm doing this because of September eleventh" and it really --
L:  And so --
R:  -- had nothing to do with each other.
L:  It doesn't.  Exactly.  [LAUGH].
R:  They just think, "Oh, Middle East.  Oh, it's somewhere that's not in the US".
L:  Also --
R:  "They must be ganged up with each other".
L:  How about all -- all -- [several inaudible words] he didn't do it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that's just -- it's just -- it's just a mental thing, psychology thing, to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get the poor military people to be sent off, to be out there.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And unfortunately --
R:  Thinking they're killing for a good reason, when they're killing for oil.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.
R:  You know, they're killing so we can fuel our SUVs for twenty cents less a gallon.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly.  They're not killing for no -- no -- no just cause.  We don't know what is happening, but you know, they could be sent off somewhere, that they believe it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That they doing it for just cause.  God bless them, but I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't approve of it, at all.
R:  No.
L:  I really don't.
R:  Me neither.
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  And -- and it seems like -- like people do, and I wonder why, you know?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But I guess everyone has their -- their right to their own -- their own opinion, but I just wish people's opinions were a little more educated.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, people just say things 'cause they hear it.  Hear somebody --
L:  They hear that.
R:  -- else say it, you know?  [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah, but then you know, that's the -- that's what they want, too, to -- to make us so much like we believe it.  I don't even want to look at the news.  I don't follow the war.
R:  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.
L:  And, you know, I -- once in a while I want to listen, just to have a vague idea, but I'm not seriously into it.
R:  Yeah, but it's -- but it's corporate owned media.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know?
L:  Yes.
R:  The corporations own it and they'll show you, you know, as much as they say it's free media.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Like, you can tell that -- that --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  -- the news is pro war.
L:  Right.
R:  Especially Fox.  Fox is bad.
L:  Mm.  I don't -- in my own eyes, they are all the same.  They are working for the -- one and the same person.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know?  So we don't even have our mind to make our own opinions, they no more.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know?  
R:  And that's bad.
L:  It is.
R:  Like, what can you trust?  What do you know?  You know, when you find out that you've been lied to, like, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Then who do you believe?
L:  I know we can --
R:  You know, what -- what is real any more, you know?
L:  Yes.  I know we can only trust God, that's all.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Really.  Really.  Well, gosh.
R:  Yeah, let's see.  What else?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.  What else?
R:  Yeah.  I think we've covered all those bases.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, I do know that September eleven, I wasn't, you know, personally, um, affected, but I know as a nation we all were affected --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- but once in a while, I just think about those families, you know?  Those people that were, you know, maybe they have family there, they --
R:  Oh, that's horrible.  It's horrible when anyone dies.
L:  It is.  It is.
R:  In murders, and car accidents, anything.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's not a good thing.
L:  It's not.  At all.  At all.
R:  You know, and I didn't know anyone either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think the closest person was, like, my mom's brother had worked with a guy or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but -- but you know --
L:  But that's horrible.  That's really, really horrible.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  Many times I let it go over in my mind.  I mean, those people, thinking okay, they getting all that money to go to work, they'll be back soon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, little, little sad pictures like that.
R:  And that's the thing.  Like, you and I, we talk about how we weren't really affected --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's been how long now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, right after, I'm sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I don't know about you, but I was -- I was a little paranoid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought about things a little more and appreciated things a little more, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just like everything else, that just fades over time and you just go back into your --
L:  It does.
R:  -- old routine, you know?
L:  Yeah, it does, and that's why sometimes I'm like, okay, that's -- being and it's gone, who knows what else?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  You know?  Who knows what else?  Well, we just pray nothing else happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but we got to --
R:  So, but you know, what are they going to do?  Like, take away our freedom?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and our -- you know, just for security?  Like, that's not fair either.
L:  It's not.  It's not.
R:  You know?  So, like -- like you said, we just have to look at how we're meddling with people's stuff.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know, but --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- but who are we, you know?  Who are we to [LAUGH] if only people like you and me were running the show?  [LAUGH].
L:  I tell you, that's right --
