L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  This is Marlene.
R:  Oh, how are you doing, this is, ah, Kager[?] 
L:  Okay.  I live in Minnesota, how about you?
R:  Ah, Texas.
L:  Okay.  So, how ha- has nine eleven affected you?
R:  Ah, it's -- I wouldn't say it has affected me that much it's just, ah, you know, I've been watching the news a lot more lately, the airport -- traveling, it has affected traveling actually is the most part of it.
L:  Right.  I guess living in Broome Minnesota I -- I can hon- I can, um, emphasize with you, it hasn't affected me that much because I don't think, um, I'm -- or where I live is going to be a target for terrorism.
R:  Yeah [several inaudible words] 
L:  Is that the way -- sort of the way you feel too? 
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's, yeah, that's kind of exactly what it is, it's I'm kinda far away from New York sort [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- although I guess I must say I am more aware of things going on.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah and the wor-  
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- and world's level from -- well, for me. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, um, my daughter was flying the other day and I thinking about her.  She was flying to the east coast and I was thinking about her probably more than I usually would have before nine eleven.
R:  Oh, okay, and --
L:  So, but you don't, um -- 
R:  Do you know of any other people that where in the area or people who that might be affected --  
L:  Um, -- 
R:  -- by it?   
L:  I -- a neighbour of ours son worked in the Pentagon and he is -- he was very, very close, um, just a matter of yards or [MN] away from where the plane crashed.  In fact, he knew of -- he knew a lot of the people that were killed.
R:  Oh, that must be hard for him. 
L:  Right.  And so I guess that kind of brings it home it's -- it's, you know, and you -- I didn't know any of the people killed but the fact that I know of someone who knew of someone.  How about you?
R:  Ah, no one in particularly that was hurt by it, just people that were in the area and they saw the plane and they just -- they felt like the ground shaking and the loud bang --
L:  Really?   
R:  -- when it actually occurred.  Like, there were about a -- maybe a couple of blocks down at Fordham University, which is I think maybe about ten or fifteen blocks down from where it is, I think, I'm not sure exactly but, yeah, they felt it and heard it --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- you know.  Everything was stopped for that moment in time --  
L:  Well, you know, I think --
R:  -- for them.
L:  I think even for me I will never forget where I was when I heard that.  I -- I teach in school and someone came to school in they're from another place and they said, "Have you had the radio on, ah, one of the towers was just bombed?"  So, I turned on the TV because I work in the -- the library there and it didn't take long and the second tower, you know, was -- was crashed into.
R:  Just minutes after, yeah.
L:  Right.  So, I guess for me I'll never forget where I was.  I'm old en- also enough to remember when John Kennedy was -- was assassinated, I was in my teenage years an- and that's another -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- day that I'll just never forget.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think some -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of these, um, things have profound -- profound -- they just -- you just never forget them I guess.
R:  It's just a part of history that's gonna be with you, you know --  
L:  Right.   
R:  -- even twenty, thirty years later --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you're gonna remember it because you were living at that time, so --  
L:  Right. 
R:  -- I understand, I understand.
L:  Right.  Um, do you think that we will -- that something like that will happen again?
R:  Ah, well, there's always a possibility but with the added security I just -- it puts a little bit, you know, a little bit -- let -- lets people live that little bit at ease, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- with added security, I guess.  But, I mean, you know, there's so much that security can do, that is how I see it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I personally, um, I think there has been enough safeguards put into affect and -- and, um, I'm not so sure that it will happen again, although I don't think we have to -- to go -- I think we have to have a changed lifestyle but --  
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- but we have to just to be aware of it.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I also think that I can't stop living just because of this.
R:  Oh, no, you've gotta keep going on --
L:  Yeah, otherwise they -- 
R:  -- because life's long --  
L:  Otherwise they would have accomplished their goal is the way I feel.  Um, how about like with the war now do you think that that has -- will ...  
R:  I really don't think that had -- ah, ah, maybe -- ah, I'm not sure if there was any kinda association with it, it's just maybe it was just another type of -- it's just on the agenda and this is what came up next.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's all about -- I think -- personally I'm -- I'm a finance major, I think it was to boost the economy.
L:  The war? [LAUGH] 
R:  The war was.
L:  You know, [LAUGH] you and I are in complete agreement with that.  I -- I just really don't think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that we needed to go to war.
R:  [NOISE] It's just an economic little factor.
L:  Right.
R:  That's -- that's what I [NOISE] you know, that's what I think.  But it's somewhat over now and maybe [NOISE] I don't know, there's probably too long [NOISE] [several inaudible words] so.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, um, I -- I -- I'm glad we didn't go to war after nine eleven because I -- I think that would have been the wrong thing to do.  
R:  Oh, well, yeah it's good we waited a coup- a year or so, a year or half -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to begin to strike [NOISE] and then, you know, just to -- because people [NOISE] needed time to mourn.
L:  Right, and -- and just plain recover, right?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  So -- so, whereabouts in Texas do you live? 
R:  Ah, Austin, Texas.
L:  Austin, okay, all right.  So, you're kinda on the coast then -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then, too, right, or not? 
R:  [NOISE] Ah, Austin is in the middle of Texas, I mean --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I just go to school here, I'm originally from Houston, Texas, which is kinda on the coast.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, when you were living on the coast did you feel an added -- added threat from -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- terrorism?
R:  [NOISE] no, not -- not really just [NOISE] -- I didn't see Houston or Austin being such a big thing like New York [NOISE] -- 
L:  Huh-uh. 
R:  -- that would be targeted by such, you know, terrorists groups and stuff. 
L:  Right. 
R:  [NOISE] it's a thing -- 
L:  Ri -- 
R:  -- that didn't have much of a relevance [NOISE] not relevance, just didn't see much of a danger or -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or threat. 
L:  You didn't think -- well, what about with the oil fields and the refineries and stuff? 
R:  Even that I just -- the main thing I think would be targeted would be nuclear plants but there -- there aren't that many out here, so [NOISE] -- 
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, or much of that.
L:  Okay.  
R:  How about yourself in, you know, in Minnesota? 
L:  Well, we -- I live in rural area so I just, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I -- I just can't see us being targeted for anything, um, you know, like in rural Texas, there's nothing here [LAUGH] trees and farm land, so why would people -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why would the terrorists want to do anything here?
R:  [NOISE] That's -- that's true, we're just too far away. 
L:  Right [LAUGH] besides -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's too darn cold [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They -- they can't handle it up there. 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Have you done any -- many of these before? 
R:  This is the second one today it's -- 
L:  Yeah, me too.  
R:  -- my second one. 
L:  In fact -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I, um, just signed up -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about a couple of hours ago -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was so surprised to get a call already.
R:  Actually, I got a call but I was away from my phone so I missed it then this came [NOISE] like another thirt- -- I've had like three [NOISE] calls within two hours. 
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  But I missed one, so this is my second. 
L:  Okay, good, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- alright.
R:  So hopefully it pays off [NOISE]  
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  Hopefully they get something out of this.
L:  I'm hoping too.  Um -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if it doesn't I guess we'll find out.  I don't know how long the -- the, ah --  
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Do you know what the -- the time --
R:  I'm not sure [NOISE] --  
L:  -- the downtime is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Between getting paid and ...  
R:  [NOISE] and talking?  Ah, I have no idea.  A -- a friend just told me yesterday to sign up and they called me today, so [NOISE] ... 
L:  Okay.  And you have friends that have gotten paid? 
R:  Oh, no, he just signed up the day before and he told me to sign up, so --  
L:  Okay, all right.  
R:  -- I might as well. 
L:  So let's just hope this isn't a scam, ha?
R:  Yes, hopefully [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we'll make some money out of this.  But, um, ah, I -- [NOISE] have you done any travel yourself lately? 
L:  Um, no, we were -- well, actually we were in DC -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in August -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And, um, it -- you know, speaking of nine eleven, it was rather -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, nerve racking because in Alrada[?] DC they would not let any one get out of their seats.
R:  Huh ha.
L:  We had to stay in our seats and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because of the added security and stuff, so.
R:  [NOISE] oh, no rest room breaks [NOISE] or anything --  
L:  Nothing, no, they would not let you go -- well, they -- they announced it before saying that they would now be com-- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going into this, um, secure air space and noone would be allowed to get out of their seats, so if you needed go to the rest room or whatever, you had to do it now.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But as we, um, got off our plane in DC and stuff, we really didn't see any added security or anything but, you know, in the buildings there were, I couldn't go into a building without going through an X-ray machine. And --
R:  Yeah, that makes sense though --
L:  Right.   
R:  -- that's everywhere.
L:  And they had all these concrete barriers in front of the national -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- buildings and stuff and it -- it took away from the beauty of them and it also --
R:  Oh, I could imagine.
L:  It also -- it drove home what terrorism can do I guess and what -- 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- war can do, you know, you -- you just think, wow, it could have been -- it could have been more, it could have been worse and then I think about the people over in Iraq and all these other people that are bombing and -- and what they must be going through because --
R:  They're going through exactly what -- I mean, they're, you know, it is not their fault but it's, like, they're having to suffer for it -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Because of one or two people basically.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Yeah --
