L:  This is Patricia Sanders.
R:  Hi.  This is Dan Ginsberg.  How are you?
L:  I'm -- how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  I, uh, I -- wanted -- say about my -- my life changes, I have not changed my life too much, except um, keeping more, um, tabs with my family.  And, uh, I live on the West Coast so it -- I feel that it didn't really affect me that much, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And I felt sorry for the, uh, families and I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- watched the news a little bit more.
R:  Right.  Definitely.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, it didn't -- it didn't change anything directly in my life other than, you know, it def- definitely it -- I've been paying more attention to world events ever since then, and I mean, you know, it -- it was a very sad day and it made me -- made me, you know, realize some things, but I don't really think that I've been living my life all that differently.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, do you travel?
R:  Uh, yeah, I do.  From time to time.  I'm actu- I'm a college student.  I'm at -- at the University of Wisconsin, so I -- I usually fly home.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm -- I live in Anarbor[?] so I usually fly home during breaks or sometimes drive.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I -- I -- I'm not -- I -- my worry -- worries about travel didn't realy change all that much, I don't think from it.  Um, I mean, I -- I trust the -- you know, the better security measures and everything.  Um, I'm flying still.  [LAUGH].  Statistically, it's still a lot safer than driving, so -- I don't know.  But, you know, it -- those things always cross your mind when you're getting to an airport.
L:  Well, I'm kind of a homebody and I live in Salem, Oregon, you know?
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, um, so uh, I always felt that, gee, you know, I can drive any place that I really want to go.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right, right.  
L:  My -- and my daughter lives in, uh, Phoenix, Arizona, but uh -- and I -- I kept kinda track of her because she does a lot of traveling in her work, but she still had to travel.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So she didn't change that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, she felt, uh, one of the things that happened with her was that she had just bought a new home and so when she went, um [COUGH], when she heard a plane coming over, she says, "You know", she says, "every time I heard a plane, I felt that it wa going to crash into my house".  [LAUGH].  So --
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] as well.  "You'll get over that", you know? 
R:  Right.
L:  But that was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- her first thinking, you know, because, um, uh, the -- her house was the main thing in her life right at that moment.  [LAUGH].  And so she didn't know if there was going to be a terror attack --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in Phoenix or not, but --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I think -- yeah, I mean, those images that were aired over and over and over again on TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after September eleventh, I think like are now like etched into everyone's mind.  I know I was visiting a friend from high school of mine who -- who now goes to college in Chicago and they were just sort of sitting around downtown Chicago talking, and when you look up at those big buildings, you --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- al- almost like instinctively, after September eleventh, you have -- you can -- you can see, like, a plane hitting them.  It's really kind of --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really, like -- not that -- not that I actually think that that would happen, but you can -- 'cause it's just those images are so, like, etched into everyone's mind because we all saw them so much, I think.
L:  Yeah.  I think maybe the media really played a -- a little bit on -- on that, and everything, it was like, okay, um, there's ten people watching, but then there might be ten people that haven't seen it at all and that's [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  They kept playing it over and over again.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I think that once you saw it, you -- I didn't really need to see it again, because I could visualize, you know, things, you know, and how it happened and -- and 'cause it was very, very tragic and -- and so I felt really sorry for the families and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the, um, uh, the people that, um, were --
R:  Right.
R:  The firemen that helped, you know?
L:  Right.
L:  These people?  And I felt really -- felt for them, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  The thing is that, um, one of the thing -- one of the thoughts that ran through my mind, though, was here's these two buildings and to me, they were just buildings in a financial center.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, but I thought, gee, they must really mean something to the people in the East or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever?
R:  Yeah.
L:  An- and that -- they think that that building represents -- that all -- that whole building represents what the American people were like and you --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- would destroy the American people if you ran into those buildings.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And then, of course, I didn't think that, you know, was surprised that they had, uh, you know, did the Pentagon or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But I had to think about, what are those people really feeling like, you know?  I -- I tried to think that, um, and tried to put my feet in those other people's shoes, just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just for a moment to say, why would they do that?  You know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  What really makes them think that they, you know, will destroy the American people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or their spirit or whatever, because those financial buildings, I mean, how many other countries were involved in that? They said over a hundred --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh, a hundred, so I learned from my last talk with someone, said that there was a hundred --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- three countries that were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really involved.  There wasn't just the American people there.
R:  Right.  Right.  And one of the -- yeah.  One of the things I remember thinking is 'cause -- 'cause of the basis for that, it's just the -- the strong hatred of, like, America -- Americanism and American people, and almost just wanting to, like -- they want to just, like, destroy as many as they can.  And I remember one of the things I'm thinking is, um, like, here at college, like, uh, I'm at -- I'm at the University of Wisconsin, which is like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a very big university, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when we go to -- um, like, I just remember right after September eleventh going to college football games, and security was way step -- way -- you know, it's very stepped up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But just thinking about if they really -- it's -- it's just -- it was such a scary thought, because especially really, we're just so -- you know, hated Americans so much that they just wanted to kill as many as possible.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, there's no -- there's no, like, area where there's more people in a small area than at a college football game.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, that when that stadium fills up, you've got eighty thousand people sitting in there, so there was -- I def- I def- I remember the first -- they cancelled the -- our game right after September eleventh and then --
L:  Oh, they did?
R:  -- I remem- yeah.  And then I remember the next one after that, security was very stepped up, but I know everyone was, you know, a little bit anxious going through it, but you know, you go on with your daily life and things got back to normal.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's true.  Uh, we --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  We have a very resil- resilient [LAUGH] culture.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yes, however -- however I say that.  Anyway, that we can bounce back and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's the thing and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But m- um, my travel plans have not changed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and things like that, that people say, well it was -- affected this, this, this and this.
R:  Right. 
L:  And, really, I've gone on with my life and my --
R:  Right.
L:  -- plans and what I should, you know, do?
R:  Yep.
L:  I might think about a little bit, okay, now what if I was cut off with my water and my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- food, so I kinda planned a little bit about that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think that the terrorist is biological things.  Like, I haven't done anything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, or thought anything about, well, if I go, I go, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, it -- you know, a -- a daily thing like food and water, I kind of -- I -- I kind of stepped up that a little bit and said --
R:  Right.
L:  -- okay, I better fill these jugs full of water, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Things like that.  But that --
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I think there's a lot of indirect effects, just like -- like -- sorry, just a sec.  Amy can you get -- oh.  Sorry, my -- my -- I'm on a cellphone and my home phone is ringing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I'm just -- ignore it.  Um, it's just checked it.  I am actually turning twenty one in about seven hours so there's -- everyone's running around.  
L:  Mm.
R:  We're going out for dinner in about fifteen minutes.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well.  Congratulations, then.
R:  Well, thank you.  [LAUGH].
L:  Have a very nice time and -- and um, a birthday party and everything?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's kind of  [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah, I'm trying -- yeah, I -- I think there's a lot of -- I mean, if you more think of it in terms of what September eleventh has affected, in terms of other things, it's just affected so -- you know, so many other things going on today indirectly.  Like, not direct results of it, but -- I mean, even things like, obviously the war with Iraq and that is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- obviously affecting a lot of people's lives.  Um, and that's certainly a -- um, you know, tied in to September eleventh, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but --
L:  I think that has affected me more than September eleventh in a way, because I -- you know, I know people that have gone over there.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- not really personally, but, um you know, like where I work, maybe the guy had to go because he was called up in the National Guards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I felt really kind of sad about that, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, uh, this type of thing, but uh, and as far as, uh,  you know --
R:  And it's also more of a -- September eleventh was more of -- more of a help -- a feeling of helplessness, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, all these people just died, this horrible thing happened, how can we, you know, deal with it?  Whereas, you know, Iraq -- the -- Iraq, you know, it's -- it's a preventative thing, that it's more of an off- off- offensive thing, when we're doing something for a reason.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, it's not -- definitely not as clear cut.  I mean, certainly around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- here, the result -- there's -- there were protests all the time and you know, I'm -- I'm definitely split on it, but I think it -- it's very different feelings and reactions associated to the two because one was just --
