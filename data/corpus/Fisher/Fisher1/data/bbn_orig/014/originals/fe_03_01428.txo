R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Denise.
R:  Hi, Denise.  My name is Patty.
L:  Hi.
R:  Nice to talk to you over the phone [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And where are you calling from?
L:  New Jersey.
R:  New Jersey?  Okay.  I'm in --
L:  How about you?
R:  I'm in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, in respect to geographics, you're very close to New York [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, yes.  It's, uh, the town that I'm in, it's really a suburb of New York City.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's quite close.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L: And, um, so yeah.  I -- I know quite a few people in New York City.  I grew up in New York City.  My -- my parents are still there, a sister and her family and many friends and coworkers in Manhattan.
R:  Right.
L:  So a lot of people that I knew were directly affected by --
R:  Wow, that -- that'd been pretty scary, then?
L:  It -- it was indescribable.
R:  Yeah.  I bet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was unlike anything else I ever experienced and I hope never to have anything like that happen --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- again.  
R:  Um, how has -- I -- I guess we're -- we need to [MN] talk about the -- the question of the phone call, so --
L:  Right, yeah.  Things --
R:  -- have you made any --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different types of changes because of that, or --
L:  Things are different now.  My -- well, my husband was working in Manhattan at the time.  He was working in Lower Manhattan and he will never do that again.
R:  Okay.
L:  So that's a big [LAUGH] change in our life.
R:  Interesting.  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  For fur- fear that it's too much of still of the attraction site of -- of where it's -- the location, that it could happen --
L:  Well, you know, he never really liked commuting into Manhattan to begin with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it took about, um -- it was a long commute, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the public transportation in our town is not great, so he had to drive to the train station and then take one train, and then another train and, um, he -- he felt that it was very, very crowded.  He took the -- he used to take a train to the World Trade Centre Station and, um, he didn't feel comfortable with the fact that there were huge crowds there, and um, and it -- [MN] --
R:  Mm?
L:  He was wondering at the time, you know, was it worth it?
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, he -- he's decided now that it's not worth it.
R:  Right.  I don't blame him.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think, uh, that's a big part of it, too, when you're very near and -- when you're doing that and then something like the September eleventh incident happens, I -- you probably just look at it in a whole different way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and say, "Nope, close to home".
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  Be with family, be closer to home and --
L:  Yeah, and, um,  we haven't flown anywhere since then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also.
R:  Okay.
L:  How about you?  Have you flown anywhere?
R:  No, although, uh, you know, we don't get out much as it is yet.  I have young children still.
L:  Okay.
R:  We don't really travel or anything.
L:  Okay.
R:  All my family is -- is basically here in Ohio.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, you know, us being a little more distant from New York, of course, um, I don't have any direct relations there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, to have affected me as directly as it has with people like yourself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and other people who are more directly related, uh, you know, to -- people were who -- who were involved at that.  Ah, but it sure makes you think a lot.
L:  Do you think you're less likely to travel abroad?
R:  Yes.  Probably.
L:  Yeah.  Me, too.
R:  Ah, or -- or more wary of it and I must --
L:  Yeah, me, too.
R:  -- say, within this past year, whether it was friends or family I've known who have had to travel, uh, the reluctance was very big.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And almost waiting to the last minute, "Well, do we go or not?" type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, yeah, I ah, I would prefer to travel, like -- well, first of all [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would just think it would feel safer or, um, just not travel at all really, right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, knowing that we don't have any big plans anyway to, you know, do something, it's like, "Mm, why even think about it, then?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, as far as, um -- you know, just wondering, yo- you see on TV these different alerts now that they have, the orange, the yellow, you know, how it changes, I don't think anybody ever really knows, I don't -- I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how the government can ever -- obviously, you can't prepare anybody.  You just don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think, you know, ever since that incident, probably more than ever, it- it's always whenever we do something or just regular events in general, I think you appreciate it more and you think about it more, take things on the lighter side, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, it's -- it's a little bit different attitude, I think.
L:  I've also been in contact with some people that I probably would not be in contact with --
R:  Right.  Oh, I bet.
L:  -- if it hadn't of happened.  I got -- I got email from people I went to college with saying, "Are you okay?"
R:  Oh, wow!  That's great.
L:  So, um, I'm more likely to touch base with people and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and you know, keep track of them and let them know what I'm up to.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It brings back more, uh, that -- that -- that human warmth, I suppose, where, wow, you think about somebody and it's like, you know, let's just give a call.  Let's just, you know --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's it.  I've definitely been doing that more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, where in the past, maybe we were just so busy with your -- our everyday life, it's -- you know, for a while there, you just seem to let things go, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just run, run here, there, just do everything, just the fast track is always overcoming, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, but yeah, I -- I would say ever since that incident.  And now with the war, too, it's -- I have a nephew that's, um, over in Iraq right now and he's on our mind constantly.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  And so anything we d- do around here that's family event related, you know, you just start thinking of where he is and why he's there and, uh, it just gets you thinking that, uh, you know, as a whole, where government and the world is concerned, it's, um, it's an interesting, uh, huh, you know, time of our lives right now, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just nev- never know what to, uh, to think and you're always kinda like watching your back sometimes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're definitely more wary of what's going on, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have, uh, young kids?  Any kids?
L:  I have one son.  He's six years old.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I bet he's a big concern of yours, of course?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whatever he does, wherever he goes?  Do you feel like yourself, more than ever, you're keeping tabs on him a little --
L:  I -- I think I've always been cautious about that sort of thing, so I don't think there's anything that I'm doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- differently with him.  I think it's -- it's more like things that I do differently with the whole family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, the fact that we're travelling less.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have, uh, two boys that are in school, ages nine and seven, and then I have a two year old daughter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I know that even in school [NOISE] they, uh, bring it up once in a great while [NOISE] like, the administration of [NOISE] -- we always have some type of plan, you know?
L:  Mhm, like a --
R:  Be assured that we're -- we're trying to take care of everybody as best we could and try --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not to panic, you know, that type of thing? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because when that did happen, on September eleventh, my husband I happened to both be home and very interesting how he felt with it right away was, let's just go get our kids out of school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, just really, like --
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah, and I was more like, "Well, but this -- you know, that's, uh, an incident that's many miles away" and, you know [NOISE], but -- but there's, you know, a difference of opinion and what -- what your ideas are, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no matter what, you worry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's like in one respect, you don't [NOISE] want to panic, but in the other sense --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you can't help but worry about it.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, um, yeah.  It's sad in this world today [NOISE] that things like that are bound to happen and --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- who knows?  It could happen again.
L:  People -- right.  Like schools didn't have, really, an emergency plan before.
R:  Right.  [NOISE].
L:  And now everybody realizes that that's something very important to have.
R:  Right.  Right.   Yeah.
L:  To plan for emergencies that are really unthinkable.
R:  [NOISE] right.  Exactly.  And I think more than ever, too, the way we try to keep [NOISE] in contact with each other as a family [NOISE] with our kids.  I remember last year, I was almost going to get rid of my own personal cell phone, and now [NOISE] it's, "Oh, you know, I think maybe I will hold on to it" [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just never know where I'll be or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who might need to call me [NOISE].  Okay, Abby, hold on.  It's a popsicle tragedy right here.  Okay.
L:  Oh!
R:  Sorry about that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, hold that, Abby.  So [MN] --
L:  I know quite a people -- quite a few people who have made career changes --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- um, since then.  Um, there's, uh, a guy who was a local politician, he was going to run again.  He decided to retire, to spend more time with his family, so there are a lot of people in my area --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- who are doing that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet.  Uh, which is almost scary, too, because it's, uh, you know, you wonder who's going to cover certain spots that nobody wants to cover any more.  [LAUGH].  You know, to take care of certain things, and it's look at the reason why, you know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Like, how do you fi- refill these, uh, these gaps, then?  If uh, everybody's trying to be cautious, it's like, okay, who's gonna take on some of these roles that, you know, were either more life threatening or chancy, risky.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, especially in -- in your area there.  I bet that's -- there's a lot of change constant with that?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow.  And, how is the new mayor doing, with the aftermath of everything?
L:  Well --
R:  I wonder?
L:  -- um, I guess it's going okay.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um --
R:  Here, Abby.
L:  But, um, things are -- it's --
