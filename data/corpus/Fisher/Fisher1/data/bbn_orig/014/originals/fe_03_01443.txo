L:  My name is Susan Whitaker. 
R:  My name is Patricia Sanders.
L:  What changes have you made? [NOISE]
R:  I -- my changes, I have not really changed my life too much.  I have kept in contact more with my, my family, and, um, my family, ah, a couple of people have been stressed out by it, and so I reassured them that things were going to be okay.
L:  I've basically done the same thing, just the keeping in touch with the family more, and, um, that's about it.
R:  I have not made any, y- you know, ah, lifestyle changes.  I think that we talk about it a little bit more, about, well, okay, what is happening, but that's -- um, but that is about it, and then really keep in touch [MN] with the news more.  I think I've done that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even with this war on. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, exactly.  And I, I think I stock up on food a little bit more.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  So I'm more prepared [LAUGH] as far as staying in the house or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But other than that, I'm -- and I'm like you, I keep in touch with the war, and I -- I donated money after nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.  And then I feel sorry for the families that I --  I think -- that I felt sorrowful for, especially the, ah, [LIPSMACK] people that helped with the [MN] um, -- a- after the nine eleven, especially the firemen, I -- you know, and I thought, "Gee, I usually don't do this", [LAUGH] you know, I think that's how I felt.  I felt really, um, really sorry for those families and what was going to happen to them, and, um, really thought, oh, government should get in there and help them too, because it, it was a national -- it was a national disaster.  Not just a New York disaster. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Correct.  And I would totally with that.  Um, --
R:  I'm living on the west coast, and so it was kind of far away from me.  I don't know where you are, but...
L:  I'm in Florida.
R:  In Florida.  Well, you were down the line there. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  On that coast. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And we did send a lot of firemen up there after it happened and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, they were, um, affected by it too, so...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think that my daughter, she lives in Phoenix, and she felt a little, ah, worried, because she does a lot of travelling --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it didn't really affect her travelling, but then at home she felt -- a few days afterwards she felt -- she says, I feel -- she says, I think about it when, when a plane flies over, that it's gonna crash in my house or something [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but she just bought a new house, and that of course was the uppermost thing on her mind right there, that she was, um, you know, I mean, save her house -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right. 
R:  -- 'cause she -- that was her project --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- for right after that, and so she just kind of thought about, um, thought about that, and she was, ah, she was a little scared on that.  But, ah, she's over it now, and she's doing some travelling.  She's gone to the east.  But I, [MN] I don't really care to travel too much, and I thought, well, I don't need to travel, I'm older and I don't need to travel, and so I thought, um, I can go any place that I want to in my car. [LAUGH] That's the way I felt about it.
L:  I understand.  And after nine eleven we were -- I live in Orlando.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we were struck by the silence of no planes --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause I'm right in the flight path for Orlando Airport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it was a little strange, all those quiet nights. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, I never thought about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never thought about that.  We had a lot of, um, ah, planes up in the air, you know, like, taking off from, um -- we don't have a major airport right here, but, um, there's, um, a -- the reserve, air force reserve is out there, and we seem to have [MN] heard a lot of planes taking off, you know, in the morning, and then coming back, and, and that seemed a little strange, that there were more, um, air force planes around.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know.  I think that I was more affected by the war, rather than nine eleven.  I felt -- because I really felt -- um, people close to me went to the war.  But the terrorists, um, I really wasn't that worried about terrorists, even in this -- in, um, I live in Salem, Oregon, and the, ah, the state capitol, someone called, and they took everybody out of the state capitol at one time a couple of days afterwards, you know, like someone cr- -- probably a crank call or something.  But I mean, we were always looking at that.  Are they going to be in my town? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's what we really looked at.
L:  Yeah.  I understand that, and especially, like, in Orlando, they were worried about Disney and things like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the big tourist attractions.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Did they close down Disney --
L:  Ah, no.  I don't --
R:  -- you know, for a few days or anything, or --
L:  I don't believe so.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  But they did keep their eye out.  And they even have a lot of security now.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, just in case.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, what I was concerned that I really -- I even feel this now, that the terrorists in -- in -- how can they really stop them if they want to get in there, and why, why if they had heard about nine -- you know, what was going to happen, why didn't the FBI do something?  I mean, it's, like, "Oh, yeah?", you know.  I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, to me we have so many targets in the United States it would be hard to pinpoint what was going to happen.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, and who ever would have believed that the Pentagon would have been hit?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  That was a shocker.
R:  That's true.  Um, --
L:  And my --
R:  What they thought that, y- you know, was that our first attack for the -- that they had on the -- the twin towers don't really mean that to- much to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They don't -- I didn't -- but they must mean so much different in other cultures, that this is a towering, um, place that, you know, represents the United States, everything about our culture and everything, and finance and -- but they didn't realise that there were so many other different cultures in that building, you know.  Because it didn't just affect New Yorkers, it affected people that were there, ah, from all other countries.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, I think there was like a hundred and three countries involved, or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that was amazing, even to me. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  To realise that, that that many [NOISE] people worked there.
R:  But I've never been to New York, so I really didn't, y- you know, just -- um, but how big those buildings were, that's what really hit, y- you know, and I'm thinking, wow, you know [LAUGH] and how many tourists were there to see that, and y- you know, [NOISE] there was a few other people that I knew that was in New York [NOISE] at that time, and [NOISE] -- is it clicky?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know what that means.
L:  I don't know either.
R:  [LAUGH] This is my first call, so I don't know what hap- you know, I was just surprised today that they even called.
L:  I was surprised also today that they called.  This is my first one also.
R:  Uh-huh.  So I guess we're just supposed to make conversation, and, and keep it going, until --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they ask us to stop.  But I was, um, -- some people that I knew that had travelled to New York, and of course they had, ah, quite a few delays.  Most of them were on business or something like that, but they were not affected.  Um, just by plane delays, that's all.  And -- to come back to, um, to Oregon.  But, um, you know, it really, to me, it's, it's a little far away --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I guess I was more, um, geared to my home, and my home, ah, place, and terrorists around, and of course my daughter who does do travelling in her work.  And that's how it really affected me, um, and of course feeling so -- you know, really bad for everybody that was in there.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's about the sum of it.
L:  I was affected immediately afterwards because my cousin worked in the Pentagon.
R:  Oh, oh, my.
L:  So we were worried about her for a few days, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she turned out to be okay.  She'd transferred out of that office a week ag- before.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Fortunately. 
R:  Oh. [NOISE]  
L:  But a lot of her friends were killed or hurt.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Oh.  [NOISE] Thank you very much.  I got a box, I got some [LAUGH]
