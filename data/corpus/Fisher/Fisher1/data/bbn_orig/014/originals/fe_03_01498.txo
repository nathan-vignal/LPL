L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello? [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Can you hear --
L:  Hello?
R:  Okay?
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  I can hear you fine.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  I'm sorry, I got cut off earlier.
R:  Oh, that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] My name's Leonora.
R:  Oh, hi, Leonora, my name's Pam.
L:  Hi.  Um, we're supposed to be talking about nine eleven and how it chan- -- if we done anything to change ourself?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess.
L:  Uh, yeah, that's what they said to me anyway! [LAUGH]  Oh, have you done this before?
R:  Um, about an hour ago I got a call on the same thing, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you --
L:  Mine was disconnected, so that's why I thought I was getting another one.  But have you done anything different?
R:  Um, I wouldn't really say I have continued on.  You know, I mean in that first week or so afterward --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I live in metropolitan Chicago, about ten miles from O'Hara Airport.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, we -- oh, I was originally from Washington DC, so -- you there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah, I just se- -- it just see- -- like, it goes blank or something.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] But I'm originally from Washington, I'm living in Florida now, and --
R:  Oh, are ya?
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, um, my husband drove a tractor trailer at the time and, um, he was at a warehouse in North Carolina or something and I called him on his cellphone and they didn't know nothing about what was going on and all that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So they were trying to find a radio or TV or something in the warehouse and they finally found something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, now I -- I guess, you know, really, not done anything to change anything, I don't think.  Uh, I went back in November to DC and, uh, it broke my heart when I seen the big guns and all that sitting on the -- at the Pentagon d- and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all that kind of thing, and around the capital and everything.  So, but ... so -- but you haven't done anything?
R:  No.  I'm -- initially, you know, when it first happened --
L:  I think everybody was panicked.
R:  -- I made changes.  I made sure, you know, there was cash in the house and I have a pretty well stacked pantry but, um, you know, I did go out and make su- -- I bought some extra drinking water [LAUGH] in case --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, we -- yeah, we think everybody, you know, kinda got the dried products that you could mix with water, in case something did happen, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everything like that.  And, uh, oh --
R:  Um, but nothing is really -- I don't think I've made any permanent changes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, except that it's always kind of on my mind.
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think it's on mine too because where I live, we're about forty miles from Disney, and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, about thirty five miles from Daytona, inland.  And, um, you know, we hear the practice bombings and all that kinda stuff --
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  -- at the field they -- where they practice with the airplanes and everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, you know, I think that jars you 'cause they only do it like, once a month or s- twice a month maybe, and it just, you know, jar- jars you and you say, "Oh, okay, you know why they're doing it" and everything, but, uh, I think everybody's got it underneath the surface but it's not, you know, up on top.
R:  Right.
L:  As far as w- we're really concerned about it and stuff like that.
R:  No, and I have noticed ever since the war in Iraq started --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're like, I'd remember after September eleventh everybody had their American flags out and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cars had 'em and -- ours -- we had our flag out before then and it's still out now.
L:  Yeah, ours is.
R:  But I notice, you know --
L:  I haven't taken mine down, I got 'em on --
R:  No.
L:  -- windows and cars and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, I noticed there was sort of a -- a drop off.
L:  Yeah.  I think there was too, yeah.
R:  You know, you didn't see many cars and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now since the war started --
L:  [MN]
R: -- I've seen more cars, more people have 'em on their homes again.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, and the yellow ribbons too.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- well, I did that too, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, even my --
L:  Following the --
R:  -- five year old daughter notices, you know, when we're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- driving somewhere, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- all the yellow ribbons on the trees and in poles and whatever.
L:  Yeah.  But, uh, I think, uh, about -- about the only thing really is, uh, keeping closer in touch with relatives.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  Uh, but other than that, uh, [SIGH] you know, it goes on the same I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, everything.  So, uh, is it cold up there?
R:  So [MN] -- I'm sorry?
L:  It cold up there?
R:  Um, actually, the last couple of days have been, although Monday -- was it Monday?  Yeah, Monday we had a record high of, I think it was eighty six degrees.
L:  Oh.
R:  And the previous Monday we'd had three inches of snow, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Gosh, I mean, tha- --
R:  -- And --
L:  -- that's pneumonia weather isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And then today we're rainy, gray and in the fifties, so ...
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  I know some --
R:  What I expect spring to be.
L:  Yeah.  I know some of our friends down here, uh, had started looking in -- you know, after nine eleven had started looking into the, uh, treatments for the anthrax and stuff like that.
R:  Did they?
L:  But I don't, uh, I didn't do that -- go that far.  And I knew a k- few people that, uh, you know, went as far as getting gas masks and things, but ...
R:  Really?
L:  I just, uh, I live in the country, I got alligators for neighbors, you know! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  Yeah.  A bear come and got our trash yesterday morning [LAUGH] and carried it off --
R:  Really?
L:  -- carried it off in the woods [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I figure, you know, they'd -- I think they'd hit cities before they would the outskirts, you know, in the country like I am.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I believe anyway.
R:  Right.  Which -- we really thought Chicago would be a target.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, my husband's a driver too but he drives local.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and where he was working at the time was right across the street from O'Hara Airport, he was doing airfreight.
L:  Oh goodness.
R:  So, you know, it was -- he was pretty tense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  When he walked out the door he saw the airport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then it was very strange --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since we're so close to the airport, that there were no planes for a week or so.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, that was another thing too, is the -- the small air- airc- airports were shut down and things of that sort, you know, it was -- it was eerie I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it was like everybody was just waiting for something to happen instead of, uh, [NOISE] you know, I guess Americans just go on as their business, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and don't really dwell on, uh, I don't -- I don't even lock my doors half the time, I'm [LAUGH] ...
R:  No, well, we do here [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Well, I know, but I mean, I do really, but I mean, I just, uh, I gotta stop and remind myself to, you know, lock my doors when I leave, 'cause, uh, that's the way it's getting nowadays, hmm.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, they had found a lotta the, uh, [LIPSMACK] um, [SIGH] people that were involved in the airplanes, uh, crashes, uh, had gone to, you know, flight school down here --
R:  Right, down with the flight schools in Florida, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so a lotta that stuff was -- our -- our -- w- we were keeping up with down here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I guess because it was, you know, pretty close where they were finding these things and then you sit there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and say, "Well, did that person pass me in the mall?" or, you know, something of that sort, and ...
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, like be driving down a country road and you see somebody with a turban on and you say, "Hm!" [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [inaudible].  But, uh, other than that it wasn't really anything -- we did personally, nothing.
R:  Right.  Well, I know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- there was one guy when they were doing all the investigate -- arrests, that was, you know, from [MN] --
L:  You there?
R:  Yeah, can you hear me now?
L:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Hm.
R:  Um, but --
L:  It must be the recording thing that does that, you know it?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And I know on the other call I had earlier, it said at the end, you know, "Your ten minutes is up --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now you can leave a message if you want", but it didn't say, "Or hang up" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or what you were supposed to do at the end of the call.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause -- well, I had gotten my phone call last night and got disconnected.  We introduced ourselves and then this a- -- this evening earlier I got a call and didn't get anything, other than a busy signal after about a minute, and --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- and then with this one, that's the reason I keep saying, "Are you there?" [inaudible]! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, so ... I guess the -- I guess the computer stuff is getting it kinda --
R:  I guess.  Well --
L:  -- broken in the way --
R:  -- are you on a --
L:  I'm on a --
R:  -- are you on a cellphone?
L:  No, a remote phone.
R:  Or are you --
L:  Just a remote phone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, and it's charged up, so .... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, I'm on a cellphone so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't know if that matters any?
L:  I don't either.  Uh, you know, uh, I do have a cellphone but we can't get the power out -- our power out here is [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?
L:  We're in a dead zone as far as a- antennas go for cellphones.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And all that.  But yeah, I just have it for traveling on the roads, but ...  That's another thing, I don't travel as much -- well, I never did travel much but I just, uh, I'm a homebody.
R:  Right.
L:  My husband done the traveling! [LAUGH]
R:  He does it all for ya, right?
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, I just, uh, I look like a --
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- hoot owl when I get some place when I've traveled some place 'cause I don't shut my eyes, I can't go to sleep in another bed! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  Well, is he still driving?
L:  No.  He -- he passed in June.  [MN]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  Thank you.  And that just, uh, you know, that's why I'm doing this, trying to get me something to keep me busy, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Mentally and talking to people. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just, uh, thought, uh
