R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi.
R:  Hi.  
L:  My --  my name is Amy, I'm from Manhattan, Kansas.
R:  My name is Gerry, I'm from Scotland, South Dakota.
L:  Wow, fantastic.  [LAUGH] How's the weather up there today?
R:  Oh, nice, actually.
L:  Well good, good. [LAUGH] Well, I guess our topic is, um, what changes we have made to our lives after September eleventh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I can honestly say I don't think I've made really many changes at all.
R:  No?
L:  No.  Um, I -- I am what some people would cons- um, consider a religious person, I am a Christian, and so I don't think my spirituality has changed any, or deepened any more since that time.  Um, I've tried to make every effort to still accept different people, because I know that with the attacks, um, um, um, what would you say, Middle Eastern people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- were kinda being targeted from that, and so being very -- I guess I'm being more cautious and trying to not, um, you know, separate them out from everyone else, because I know that there are very -- you know, a lot of Middle Eastern people that have nothing to do with that.
R:  Right.  Not all of them are terrorists.
L:  Right, right.  What do you think you've done differently, or have you done differently?
R:  Well actually, I've --  I've had a lot of changes since then.  Um, right around that time I was a cab driver in Chicago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [MN] you know, when they shut down the airports and everything, and everybody was scared to travel --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I mean, it put a big dent in the taxi industry.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you know, I did what I could for a while, and then one day my cab broke down in front of the Chicago Board of Trade --
L:  Yes.
R:  And I -- you know, I couldn't move it.  I tried to call a tow truck, and I had, you know, these people screaming at me, you know, that were doing security around all those buildings and stuff.
L:  Oh wow, right.
R:  You know, the -- you know, that I had to move the cab, they were gonna tow it, blah blah blah, 'cause -- then one, one -- some kind of officer checked it to make sure there wasn't a bomb in there, just because, you know, it was the Chicago Board of Trade, it was, like, two weeks after nine eleven.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you know, it was just crazy.  I guess aware, because everyone kept thinking, you know, Chicago's the next target, they were gonna hit the Sears Tower or something.
L:  Right, yeah.  Right.
R:  And, ah, -- so, ah, so I decided, you know, the heck with this, and actually moved to a town of like eight hundred people in South Dakota.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And ah, no terrorist threats here. [LAUGH]
L:  No, that's for sure.  That is really for sure.
R:  The worst thing -- the worst somebody might do is hijack a, a crop duster and crash it in a field, you know.
L:  Right, right.  But because of the smaller community everyone knows everyone else -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so everyone is more aware of --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I know --
L:  -- odd things going on.
R:  'Cause I know when we moved here, you know, everyone was like, oh, hi, hi, you know, they were kinda giving us a weird look, you know, making sure we were, you know, not of Arab descent, pretty much.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, one -- someone actually came out and said, well I'm glad you're white --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it was kind of like, well, you know, you do something like that in Chicago and you're gonna have, you know, Jesse Jackson and company in front of your house chanting.
L:  Right, very true.  Very, very true. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I mean, out here, you know, everybody knows everybody, and ah, you know, like, I doubt, you know, you're gonna have one of those terrorist sleeper cells or anything out here.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But I guess it's good.  I mean, I --  I feel safer here than I did in Chicago, and ah, I don't know, I guess, you know, that whole nine eleven thing, it, it -- ah, I guess it played a big role in my life, because if it didn't happen, you know, the travel industry wouldn't have died, and I'd probably still be driving a cab.
L:  Right.  And that is a huge change for you, to move from the huge metropolis of Chicago to a town of eight hundred people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that, that's a very huge life change.
R:  Yeah. You go, you go from not being able to hear an airplane fly over your house to, you know, realizing that your toaster actually makes noise when it's on. 
L:  [LAUGH] That's very true, that's very true.
R:  [LAUGH] Very weird.
L:  I, I thought I made a similar change when I moved from Southern California out to the midwest.  Manhattan is a small town of only about fifty thousand people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thought, "Wow, that's small".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But not quite as -- drastic of a change as you've made.  So...
R:  No.
L:  Um, really like I said, you know, um, [SIGH] you know, possibly a change that occurred in me was, you know, realizing that these things could happen on our soil, outside of our own selves.  I mean, we had the Oklahoma City bombing, but that was from within. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I think it was good because it helped break the -- I think in some ways the arrogance that many people may have had.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thinking that we're invincible, and I think it helped bring a lot of people together as a sense of a community, the whole nation.  And realizing that we have to really support one another and encourage one another, and, you know, reach out of our own selves and not be, you know, closed off to everyone.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because without that sense of community it, it's very difficult, and I think you probably see a lot of that within your own town.
R:  Right.
L:  Because of the sense of community there --
R:  Yeah, 'cause, I mean --
L:  -- there's a stronger unity, and, um [NOISE] you can, you can trust and rely on more people that way.
R:  Right.
L:  So... but like I said, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think my life really has changed much since then, um, I mean, I was on a plane going across the country not but, you know, four weeks after September eleventh, so, um, the flight really didn't bother me, because I guess I figured, you know, if it's my time to go it is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's nothing I can do to change that.  So, um, -- but, you know, it does, it does remind me that, you know, we're not guaranteed tomorrow, [MN] and so I do have to live my life every single day to the best of my abilities, and, um, you know, I guess, I guess I try to keep a better eye on things that are happening around me, you know, if there's any suspicious activity then I want to be aware of it and, you know, not, um, not go around, I guess, um, totally absorbed within myself, so...
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All of the, the -- I mean, I think now that, ah, you know, I -- 'cause I guess a lot of -- a lot of those terrorists that were on the plane, they weren't in the country legally.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, I mean, I think, I think I write my congressman more about, you know, enforcing immigration laws.  I think that plays a big role in it too.
L:  Very true, very true.
R:  You know, and I think, I think a lot of it, I think, as far as the country, like you said, you know, a lot of people are arrogant and they think it can't happen to them, but, you know, three thousand -- over three thousand people are learned that, you know, hey, it can happen to you.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm very -- make the --  the whole country more conscious --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of what's going on.
L:  Right.
R:  Instead of worrying about their car payment and stuff, you know.
L:  Right [LAUGH] right.
R:  Putting their kids in --
L:  Should I buy the boat or should I not, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm out, should I --  should I buy a boat or buy some plastic and duct tape.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which, you know, let me ask you if I can, you know, have you taken those kind of steps for your family, to buy things that you think would be necessary around your home in case there were a terrorist attack around your area?
R:  Not really.  I mean...
L:  Do you feel that's because you're in a small town --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm basically forty miles from nothing.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I would have to drive an hour to go to McDonald's.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I mean, there would be no -- I mean, the only target I think that they would do in --  in South Dakota would be maybe Mount Rushmore.
L:  Yeah.  Which --
R:  You know, but, ah, [NOISE] you know, that would just -- anyone that wants to plash a crane -- crash a plane into a pile of granite, you know, that's their own problem, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They'll probably do more damage to themself than anything else.
R:  Yeah, it's not gonna -- it's not gonna give, you know.  You might chip George Washington's nose -- 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that would be the extent of it.
L:  Right.  And that's, and that's the same for myself.  Um, um, being in a smaller town, [NOISE] I don't feel like there's any immediate danger.  And I've always tried to keep, you know, extra food on hand so that in case, you know, we had a tornado rip through here, that we would have some kind of staples.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, even my canned goods aren't guaranteed to survive a tornado, so, you know, still that's even kind of difficult to try and plan for.  But -- I -- I haven't gone out and bought any plastic or duct tape or anything, um, --
R:  Yeah, well there, there was actually -- I think there was a family in Israel, you know, they were worried about, you know, with us attacking Iraq and everything, they, they wrapped their house in plastic and, ah, they -- they forgot to let air in and they suffocated.
L:  Oh, my. [NOISE]
R:  You know, so I'm --  I'm like, you know, do I want to wrap my house in plastic and suffocate, or, you know, just take my chances with, you know, terrorists bombing the heartland of America.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think I'll take my chances, you know.
L:  And I --  and I think -- well, I think, yeah, in that case, you know, that nothing is guaranteed to us and we really don't know if something like that's gonna happen, and we can go to either extreme and be totally arrogant, or we could come to a state of panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, I think with like, [MN] if they were to drop anthrax, like you said, from a plane -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something like that, I think you would have to literally wrap your whole house in plastic.
R:  Yeah.  And then have oxygen in tanks, and --
L:  Yeah.  And, um, I'm not willing to go to that extreme.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So...
R:  If it's my time to go it's my time to go.
L:  Well right, yeah, exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  You know [MN]
