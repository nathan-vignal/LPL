R:  Hi. I --
L:  Hi, I'm Michele.
R:  Oh, hi!
L:  Hi.
R:  I -- I talk to you now?
L:  I have no idea --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- this is day one of me doing this.
R:  This is day one of me doing this too.
L:  Oh, that's funny, I really wasn't planning on 'em calling me at six [LAUGH] today.  Um, and you and I are supposed to talk for ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  The thing -- the funny thing is, I made a phone call earlier and I ha- -- I spoke to no one about September eleventh.  And I spoke for ten minutes.
L:  You made a phone call earlier?  I don't know what that means.
R:  I don't know either 'cause this is new to me.  Now --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- um, no one was on the other end when I -- I call- -- I used the phone at two o'clock.  Well anyway, we're supposed to talk about September the eleventh, u- um --
L:  [LAUGH] And how would w- --
R:  I -- I did my ten minutes of talking at two o'clock this afternoon, but --
L:  You already did it.  Okay, well --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- would --
R:  But I -- nobody was on the other end!
L:  So who'd [LAUGH] you talk to?
R:  I just -- I didn't know, I just thought you had to talk, I didn't know there was somebody -- supposed to be somebody at the other end!
L:  Did they call you at two?
R:  No, nobody call- -- I used the phone and they told me to put in my, uh, maybe I'm confused how it works.
L:  Maybe I'm confused too but, uh, it was my understanding that there -- there could be one other person such as you, or ten other people.  Obviously, if there's more people we're gonna have to talk less.  And you talk for ten minutes and -- about whatever the subject is.
R:  About the same subject that I --
L:  I --
R:  -- that -- right now it's like, I'm all talked out [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- talking to no one!  I -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] Well, um --
R:  Well, ga- uh, September -- where are you from, first of all?
L:  Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Okay, I'm from Philadelphia, PA.
L:  Well, that's what I saw on the caller ID.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [SIGH] well --
R:  It was -- it was something for us in Philadelphia with September the eleventh because we had to worry about the liberty bell.
L:  Oh I bet.  Yes, we have -- my husband has a cousin that lives there and I heard that.  [NOISE]  All kinds of threats to it or fear of threats.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kinda spooky.
R:  Yes.
L:  Nothing really here other than, you know, just being alarmed.  I haven't tr- -- let's see, I have traveled, I traveled last July, uh, for the first time on an airplane and that was a little -- a little spooky but, you know, once you got over the trepidation of it, that it was probably safer then than a year before that.  Um, there was no problem.  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK] So at least as far as we were concerned.  But, [SIGH] um, well, how d- -- well, we're supposed to stay on the topic so .... [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I -- I -- I know I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I said, I talked to myself for ten minutes [LAUGH] today on this!
L:  That is funny!  So you j- -- that is real funny.  So y- --
R:  I'm gonna have to call the main number and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tomorrow.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, they need to give you double time! [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Really!
L:  When you were talking to yourself, did you answer?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  I just kept talking and whatever came to my mind I just kept talking about September the eleventh, how it influenced me and how, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my mind's tired now! [LAUGH]
L:  You mind what?
R:  My mind's tired now because I --
L:  You --
R:  -- talked to myself for ten minutes! [LAUGH]
L:  That is funny!  That is [LAUGH] -- oh Lord, that is really [LAUGH] funny!  Oh me.  Well --
R:  What -- what is your name again?
L:  [NOISE] Michele.
R:  Michele.  Nancy.
L:  [NOISE] Y- --
R:  Okay, you wanna do some talking then --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and [LAUGH] --
L:  Um, [LAUGH] [NOISE] I don't really know what to say, other than --
R:  Okay.  It -- it -- it did take many lives and everybody was so --
L:  It -- it was --
R:  -- devastated by that.  I -- how I started, I was watching television and all of a sudden I saw the airplane go into the building.
L:  Oh, you -- oh, gosh.
R:  So, we have a -- I thought it happened here in Philadelphia because we have a high rise building called The Twin Towers and here, when they said, "The Twin Towers" --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I thought it was here down in Society Hill.
L:  Oh my Lord.  [NOISE]
R:  A few blocks away from the liberty bell.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my goodness.
R:  So, I -- it was like, I couldn't imagine, oh my God, what happened?
L:  Right.
R:  And then somebody cleared it up and said, "Oh no, it's The Twin Towers in New York".
L:  I was sitting at my desk that day and I do have a little TV by my desk but I don't think I had it on that day.  Then a co worker came to my door and told me and ... and then -- I have instant message on my computer and I -- my husband was home that day and I sent him an instant message and he didn't answer, he was outside.  And then a neighbor drove up and told him and then he comes in and then we're talking, and then the rest of the day we're just glued to the TV.  It was so sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I guess we should be very gratef- um, that sounds kinda crass, but it could've been so many more people.
R:  Yes.  It was very, very sad.
L:  Was that because of the time, where it could've been more people?  Um, someone told me that it could've been up to like, fifty or sixty thousand and I never understood whether that was because it was so early or [NOISE] -- I don't know.  Maybe you --
R:  Oh -- oh, you're saying [MN] --
L:  If they ke- --
R:  -- if it happened early in the morning it could've [MN] -- more people could've been killed?
L:  Well, I have heard that we were lucky that it was only three thousand, usually that building is full [NOISE] of -- I -- I swear I heard sixty thousand people.
R:  That could've been it.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that could've been it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I never even thought of that --
L:  But --
R:  -- that it happened in the morning.
L:  Like, at eight for- -- eighty -- eight forty six, I think.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, that's midday to me, I get up about [NOISE] four fifteen and my work day starts at six thirty, so I was in it by then.  But, I'm sure a lot of people -- well, I mean, I know a lot of people don't get started until eight thirty or nine,  [NOISE] so I'm sure --
R:  Is there a time difference where you are?
L:  I'm on Eastern Standard Time, it's six oh three right now.
R:  Okay, it's seven seven here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so there's an hour difference.
L:  Um, I know when --
R:  Can you put your time in, what time you wanted to talk on this?
L:  Yeah.  Because I was real, uh, the girl that tried to get me to sign up, I was very hesitant and, um, she said, "No, it's real cool, you just put in the time" and I thought, "Okay".  And then I start reading [NOISE] that, um, it's going -- well, I couldn't do it to my office because it's automated and the person that answers the phone would never know that was for me.  So then I thought, "Well --" and I get up at four fifteen, so I go to bed kinda early.  So I said, "Well, six o'clock" and now that I'm making dinner I'm thinking, "Well, six o'clock might not be the best time" but then I start watching TV at seven, [LAUGH] so I wanna be interrupted at seven!  So, I wonder how [LIPSMACK] -- how many times -- so, does your understanding, you and I are gonna get ten dollars for this?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  You only do three phone calls but I'm confused.  Like I said, I gotta call somebody 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I spoke to myself for ten minutes about September the eleventh.
L:  To yourself.  I'm sorry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that was funny.
R:  It is funny! [LAUGH]
L:  It is funny.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, did you answer? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I just --
L:  Joking.
R:  -- kept talking to myself.
L:  That's funny.
R:  Thinking I was talking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to somebody on the other end!
L:  [COUGH] Oh, for goodness sakes!
R:  I didn't know I was supposed to hear somebody.
L:  Well, um, [SIGH] did you get your email?
R:  N- no, I don't have email.
L:  Well how did you sign up for this?
R:  My brother heard it over the radio.  And h- --
L:  In Philadelphia?
R:  Yes.  And he told me to call.
L:  Okay, then.  May I ask you a question?  W- -- oh --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- so you didn't sign up online, you signed up over the phone?
R:  Yes.
L:  Did you give your social security number?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, I didn't either.  And when I called today I kinda got a little snooty old lady and she sa- -- I said, "I don't feel real comfortable doing that".  And she said, "Well, that's fine, you won't be entered in the lottery".  So I said, "Okay, what's the lottery?"  And I think there's a draw, it doesn't have anything to do with the ten dollars.  There's a drawing so often, I don't know how often, and they put your name in for, I think a thousand dollars.
R:  No, I don't -- nobody asked me about their lottery.
L:  I know one thing to ask you, are you familiar with, um, Lauren Manning?
R:  No.
L:  She was -- her husband wrote a book, Greg Manning.  She was -- they both worked in the building, he was running late that day, thank God, she walked in --
R:  Yes, yes, I spoke about --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- her to myself today.
L:  You did, okay.  She, um, she's amazing, absolutely amazing.  I've read their book, which if you have not done so, oh, oh my gosh, is it moving!  Um, it's his email excerpts to his family, friends, everybody that wanted to know how she was doing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In- incredible. [NOISE] Oh, it was absolutely incredible, just absolutely.  And then she was on Oprah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I've seen her three or four times and it's --
R:  She's the one that had the baby too, am I right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sweet little boy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just ready when you are.  Um, [LIPSMACK] -- I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
R:  You --
L:  Are you ready to eat? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, it's a shame it's your dinner hour and [MN].
L:  That's okay.  We're having easy -- easy dinner tonight.
R:  Well, I didn't call you [LAUGH] okay --
L:  No, you didn't! [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, [inaudible] there!
L:  We did this ourselves didn't we! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] anyway, but --
R:  No, no, it -- it's -- I spoke about her today, how, um, she went on public television and spoke about her hardship and I spoke about how I -- I saw the d- -- that there was death --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all around us.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And with so many mothers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fathers, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, losing so many --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- there -- there were so many lives lost.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And it did frighten u- us -- us all.  I talked about the White House --
L:  How far are you from New York?
R:  Uh, about, I'd say two hours.
L:  Two hours, yeah, I bet that was scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really.
R:  It could've happened here.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [COUGH] Excuse me [COUGH].
R:  M- --
L:  That's what I heard, with the liberty bell.
R:  Yes.  And many Philadelphians I know were -- you hear
