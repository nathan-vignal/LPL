R:  My name's Jeffrey White.
L:  I am Ellen Tyros.  Uh, I'm in Durham, North Carolina.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, that sounds good [MN].
R:  You -- you in Durham, North Carolina?
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, um, wha- I didn't exactly understand what they said the topic was, if we had made changes --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the changes ev- ever since the September eleventh.  I'm trying to, uh -- me personally, I'm trying to, uh, get along better with others, uh --
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  -- re- re- regardless of who they are.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, I agree with you.  I -- I have tried to, uh, be, uh, nicer to -- to people and uh, I've tried to see my friends more often --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than I had in the past, uh, to uh be sure that I, uh, [LAUGH] well, was -- [LAUGH].  Everybody had a better memory of me [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah, yeah, and uh, we have to, you know, take into stride and uh, lear- lear- learning that, uh, more of oth- other peoples concerned than our own, uh, uh, sharing more, um, sharing more --
L:  Well, that's true, too.
R:  -- with others, than, uh --
L:  Yes, that's --
R:  -- ourselves.
L:  -- true and, uh, of course I think before nine eleven, I think that not only in myself, but uh, other people were concerned mostly, about what -- what we could get, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What -- what type of things we could get for the house and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a car and -- and things like that, and now I'm not so concerned ab- about, uh, about, uh, material things as I was, um --
R:  Right.
L:  Because you don't know at what hour, as the Bible says, you will be called home, so --
R:  Right.  Right.  And -- and -- and is -- is beginning to make, I think, more people, uh, get more spiritually fed and, uh --
L:  Well, I know I have, uh --
R:  Oh, I definitely have.
L:  I -- I definitely have, uh, um -- I have something on my computer now, the saying of Jesus and I look forward to them each day to see, uh, what uh, the sayings are, and before I -- well, I -- I don't -- I still don't go to church, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm -- I am much more religiously oriented than --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I had been, anyway.
R:  Right.  Right.  And there's -- and -- and that definit- that's a change and that's -- th- that's a change for the best also.
L:  Well, yes, that -- that is one of the changes that I have made.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's true.  And, um, of course, I do look upon, um, what's happening in the rest of the world, though, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, and -- and how they are handing, you know, in Africa and in the Middle East --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the little children and, well, the adults too are without, uh, water.  They're without, uh, any sort of, um, health --
R:  Right.
L:  -- care or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I do --
R:  Well, do you know --
L:  -- think about that now.
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, you -- we -- we -- we have to now, and it seems like the more we look on -- on TV now, we se- we -- it makes us care more about others beside ourselves.
L:  Yes.  Yes, that's true.
R:  Uh, and -- and then it -- like it's as far as food, I just to find myself, like, throwing food away.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and then I think of others --
L:  I know.
R:  -- who don't even have it to eat.
L:  I know.  I know.  This is true.  We -- we've all, uh, been along that, uh, uh, road.  We've, uh, we throw things out, uh, we buy more than we need and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and uh, we don't think -- we don't think in terms of -- of how other people have suffered and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that, uh, that even the war has, uh, changed me in some respects --
R:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- because, um [MN] I wasn't for the war at first, but, uh, I'm hoping that now, um, we'll be able to go in there and -- and help these people and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, maybe get them food and -- and an education and things that they never had before.
R:  Right.
L:  But then, of course, I do worry about people in our country.  There are so many people in our country that --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- that need it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  Th- th- that's my main concern.  I -- I believe in helping others, but we need to help ourselves first.
L:  Yes.  This is true.  I -- I don't think that people realize how many, uh, children go to bed hungry in this country.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that the more you think about it, uh, the more you realize that -- that you need to help -- to help us, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in this country, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- help them, uh, get to school and so forth.
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes.  I -- I have changed, uh, since nine eleven and -- and I hope that, uh, I'll continue to --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- to change more.
R:  I -- I have an -- an -- and I can see that it definitely was for the best.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, uh, I mean, I've -- you know, I mean, I've always been a caring person, but I've --
L:  Yes.
R:  I try to care more --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- than others --
L:  But -- but now it's --
R:  -- than myself.
L:  -- it's really, uh, you -- you've really, uh, been -- been awakened, so to speak, more, uh, even though you did care in the past and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have, uh, cared in the past, too, but um, I just never realized until nine eleven that people could, uh, feel so strongly a- against other people, that they would be willing to sacrifice themselves and other people to -- to take down the United States.
R:  Mhm. Yeah, yeah.
L:  And that -- and we -- we need to maybe show others that we are more caring and we -- and, uh, and we do think of other people.  I know they think that we -- all we care about is oil and [MN] --
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  -- and big houses and everything [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, that isn't true at all because --
R:  No, that's definitely not true.
L:  -- I think the -- I think the average person, uh, does think more, uh, of -- of other people than -- than we're given credit for.
R:  Right.  I -- I definitely believe I agree with that.  I definitely agree with that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, I -- I -- I think, uh, really, al- although we still hearing things in, uh, problems in the school system --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I think that, uh, it's gotten better.
L:  Yes, I think --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- that it has.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I think in -- in Durham, things have gotten better.  Um, I'd been away for a long time and I decided to come back and I'm happy, uh, that, uh, things have gotten better in many ways.  I live in a -- a multi racial community and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm glad that I do, uh, because of what I believe in and I think that the schools have become more multi rational -- racial --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, this is -- this is what we need to do, is to -- is to have a multi racial society now.
R:  Right.  I -- I agree with that.  Because, uh, uh, regardless of how people be thinking, they have to realize, you know, we all serve the same -- same God, we all, uh, we --
L:  This is true.
R:  -- uh, we --
L:  This is -- that's very true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We all -- we all do have the same God and he expects us all to, uh, care for one another.
R:  Right.
L:  And sometimes we don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think that, uh, this has been a wake up call for us, uh, in -- in our country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the -- and of course, I think in the western, um, countries, it's been a wake up call too, because they realize too that, uh, they -- they also can -- can be, uh, hurt with the terrorists.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yes, I do agree with that.  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I know that, um, in some ways, uh, you are very fortunate, though, you live in a -- a large city that has always been --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, more, uh, multi cultural --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than -- than the average, uh, city.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And, um, now, uh, our area has -- has gotten like that, too.  And, um, I think that, uh, we need -- we need to really -- as you said about the schools, uh, see that more children, uh, are able to learn, um --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- are able to learn.  It's not just enough to expect them to go to school.  They need to -- need to be taught about --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- all these things that are --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- happening in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I think --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- they also need to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- need to learn, uh, how to get along --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with one another and not be fighting, uh, between --
