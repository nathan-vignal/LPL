R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm Orville.
R:  My name is Melissa.
L:  What you say?
R:  Melissa.
L:  Melissa?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  I'm from Springfield, Illinois, and I work for the Salvation Army, so you know we've been involved in a lot of training since that terrorist attack.
R:  Okay, yeah, you've probably seen, uh, much larger impact than I have.
L:  Yeah.  In fact, our -- our ministry went out to Ground Zero itself and --
R:  Really?
L:  Right over Christmas time.
R:  Yeah, I -- I, um, I'm from Detroit, Michigan, and I was, uh, actually spent some time there, um, about a month before it happened and it -- [SIGH] it -- it was so surreal, seeing it happen, that it just -- you know, I -- I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think it's changed that much about my day to day life, but it's changed my outlook, uh, on things, and things you take for granted, you know?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Um, it was amazing when I -- when it happened, I -- I pulled out all the pictures I took from my vacation and the World Trade Centre was in every picture, but it never was the focus of it and -- and it kinda made me think about things, you know, and uh --
L:  Yes, it did.
R:  -- how things that you -- you -- you take for granted and you -- you know, it's always there and you -- you just don't even notice it until it's gone and, um --
L:  Yep.  
R:  So, I -- I don't think it's made a huge impact on, you know, my --
L:  Not really --
R:  I don't -- I don't do things --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- different, but --
L:  But it could happen any time, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Chicago, could happen in Detroit, could happen right here in Springfield, Illinois where I live.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we got to be ready.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  I didn't -- haven't run out and bought duck tape and all the other --
L:  No [LAUGH] no.
R:  [LAUGH].  You know, I don't have a --
L:  No.
R:  -- safe room, I don't have this, I don't have that, but I'm more likely to do things now that I -- you know, would put off, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- vacations and trips and, you know, actually I -- I've flown more since September eleventh than I ever did before because it's -- I keep thinking, you know, if you're going to go, you're going to go.  It's -- you know --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- I can't prevent it from happening --
L:  No.
R:  -- so I might as well enjoy everything while I'm here. 
L:  You might as well.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You never know who's goin- you know, you've got to be ready to go, too.
R:  Right.  Right.  You know, I could be on a vacation and something could happen in my home town and being away could, you know, help save people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, there's n- I don't -- I don't know that there's anything --
L:  No.
R:  -- anyone can do to, you know, prevent it, other than being a little more cognizant of what was going on in their surroundings and things like that, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as far as traveling and things like that, I -- I definitely haven't let it stop me.  In fact, I probably do more now because of it.
L:  In fact, my sister went and -- she's an assistant administrator here at the Salvation Army in Springfield --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she had to go to Austin, Texas -- Houston, Texas, the week after it happened, fly out there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [LAUGH] it was kinda of a little bit scary.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  But she made it safe.
R:  Yeah.  My -- my husband was actually mid air on September eleventh while this is going on.
L:  Oh, he -- he was a pilot?
R:  No, he -- he travels a lot for business and he was on his way to Chicago and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he said halfway through the flight, all of a sudden, every -- all the -- the flight attendants just -- they stopped talking and he said it was the strangest flight that he's ever been on.  It was really, really tense and then when they landed, uh, they announced, you know, what had happened and told everyone, "Turn on your cell phone and call your loved ones", you know, it was -- it was very scary to know that my husband's up there flying around, heading towards a major city and every time they'd say, oh, this plane in Chicago looks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, you know, I -- it was like, okay, that could be him, and I -- I wasn't real comfortable with him traveling immediately afterwards, but, you know, it's -- and more people probably died that day in car accidents and any -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since then, than -- than anything else, so it's -- it's preventable, but it's not -- I guess, you know, it's not avoidable.  If you're going to go -- it's -- if it's your time, it's your time.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's your time. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And you have to be ready.
R:  Mhm.  You said that, uh, you've done a lot of training for --
L:  Yeah, with the Salvation Army.  We're -- I -- I work with the disaster --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- canteen here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we've -- we've been to about three meetings so far, on what to do in case of a terrorist attack and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's real -- you know, some of the pictures you see --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- get you thinking.
R:  Oh, yeah.  But it -- a lot of it's more, I don't know, commonsense things.
L:  Yes.
R:  For me, it's not like, you know, you have to go and buy this and take this class and train or this.  It's --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- things everybody should know.  I mean, we all should know CPR and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, those -- those are the sort of things that it's -- that I think we -- we probably, as Americans, got kinda lax and living in our little world, that it's not bad to know those things anyways, and we probably should've known -- had some basic, uh, survival --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of, uh, classes or, you know, learned a little bit more about how to deal with things like this.  But, I don't know if it's made as much of a change as kinda made me think, well, I should of been doing this all along.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, tornados kills as many people sometimes as, uh, a plane crash do.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've -- every easily.  And, I mean, natural disasters and everything else, you just don't --
L:  All types of disasters --
R:  -- ever know where the place is that's going to be safe or not, so even staying at home doesn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doesn't mean you're going to be okay.  You could be duck taped in your little room and, you know, ha- have something else very strange happen to you and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's -- I don't -- I don't think it's preventable for -- you know, the average, every day person. 
L:  Nothing is preventable.  You know?
R:  No.
L:  If it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
R:  Mhm.  And being aware.  I mean, I try -- it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always try to be, but I think so I -- I'm probably a little bit more so about, you know, where my friends are and when people call and tell me they're going here or going there, I try and think about it a little more, rather than just, yeah, call me when you get back, and you know, ignore the fact that people are gone, but I definitely understand why people want to go and travel and -- and still get on with their lives, 'cause you kinda have to.
L:  You go and see -- just go and see the world.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause you don't know where, when, or -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- if that will happen again, or wh- when or where, so --
L:  I kind of -- with the -- the Iraq deal, I kinda look for something, maybe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know what yet, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's always a chance of it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I don't think they've got Saddam yet.
R:  Probably not.  Probably not, but --
L:  He's probably with somebody else, took his billions of dollars and --
R:  Mhm.  See, even if they got him, his legacy unfortunately will live on for a long time 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's not alone in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, hating us and hating --
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  -- our country, unfortunately.
L:  No.  
R:  You give any -- anybody enough money who -- who's not afraid to die for their own cause, and -- and it -- that's -- that's hard to stop.
L:  Yep.
R:  That's practically impossible to stop.  If someone's willing to give their life to take yours, I mean, it's -- it's a real tough thing to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be able to fight that, but you can't worry about it all the time either.
L:  No.  And we got -- you know, and they -- the media puts so -- so much into it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Helps tell the enemy right where our men are, right over TV.
R:  Right.  And -- and --
L:  That -- that's with Iraq.
R:  -- keep watching and you start feeling, you know, like, oh, it's going to -- something's going to happen and -- 'cause they -- they build things up, too, and if you start getting more paranoid and losing, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- losing touch with -- with reality, I guess.  I -- at least with this war, I -- you know, you get engrossed in something and you forget there's the whole other world out there, too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And you can't -- you know, it's -- it's very important to pay attention to what's going on, but not at the expense of stop living your own life.
L:  Yeah, you can't stop living.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You got to take one day at a time.
R:  Definitely, and I'm more now so than -- than ever before, probably --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of this.  
L:  How's the weather up there in Detroit?  Not too --
R:  Oh, cold today, warm yesterday, cold the day before.
L:  Raining?
R:  Actually, no.  We've had some, but -- ho- -- 
L:  It's raining.  It's drizzling here in Springfield.
R:  Uh, so we'll probably get that tomorrow, then.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I know we supposed to be talking about other --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- see, you kinda run -- run out of stuff to say.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I can see how -- yeah, but -- [SIGH].  
L:  Our ten minutes should be about up pretty shortly.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, it looks like it's been just about ten minutes, so --
L:  We got to keep talking.
R:  Yep, I guess.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, have you heard about what they're -- do you know what they're going to be doing with the, uh, the -- the location that the World Trade Centre was on?  Have they --
L:  I hear they're going to build another -- build another one.
R:  Good.
L:  But not that size, though, I don't think.
R:  Uh-huh.  They we- they were massive.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Have you ever -- had you ever been there in person or --
L:  No.
R:  -- seen it?  No?  I -- I just -- when I saw it for the first time, it was -- you know, I -- I couldn't believe it.  I -- I have never seen anything that scale before, you know?
L:  And another thing.  I don- -- I don't think that bombing, that they had in the basement there --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I don't think that done any harm -- done any good for this plane crash that -- I think that might of helped a --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- little bit better.
R:  No, I -- actually, I knew -- I knew a person who, his job when that happened, was to go floor to floor and get everyone out and --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- he had to run up and down those towers twice, or his tower, and he said there -- there's no way they -- they inspected it so thoroughly afterwards, that had there been any damage, they -- they would of found it.
