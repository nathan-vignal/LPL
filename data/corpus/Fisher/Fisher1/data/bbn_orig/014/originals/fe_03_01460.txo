R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  
R:  Hi, my -- my name's Sam.
L:  My name is Lisa.  
R:  Ah, you're from the south?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  [LAUGH].  I can tell.
L:  [LAUGH].  Can you tell? 
R:  Yeah, I can tell.
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, you're not?  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  From Pennsylvania?
R:  Yeah.  Okay, so the topic is what changes have we made?
L:   Right.
R:  I haven't really made any changes.
L:  I haven't either.
R:  It -- you know that day, it was uh, a little hectic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but since that -- no, yeah, it -- it's been a change.  I don't travel anywhere, so I don't have to worry about the airports.
L:  That's me.
R:  And from what I understand, the airports have changed a lot, but per- personally, I haven't.
L:  I haven't either.  If I go anywhere, it's by car.
R:  Yeah, that's what I do, and I haven't gone anywhere in, like, five years.
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I've been somewhere, but it wasn't by plane.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I tried to go, but got stuck in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH].
R:  Because my car broke down.  Luckily, it wasn't that far away, but that was before the September eleventh attack and actually, it was that summer, I think [LAUGH] but, uh, no, there's no -- there's no changes, 'cause like I told my husband, you know, he was worried that day and I was, like, "What are they going to bomb in Philadelphia?"  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, that's what my kids say about, uh, McEwan, Tennessee, because I don't even think you can find it on a map.  [LAUGH].
R:  You know what I told my --
L:  Like, they can't find us.  [LAUGH].
R:  I told my [LAUGH] yeah.  As I told my husband, I said, "I'd love to move to Tennessee", I said, "but it seems really populated, looking at the map", and he said, "Those are just small towns". 
L:  Yes  [LAUGH].
R:  He said, "There ain't that -- as many people as you think".
L:  No.
R:  But, no, it -- we live outside of Philadelphia and from what I understand, they've made changes, you know, to the airports and things like that and I mean, for the longest time, you couldn't get to see the Liberty Bell, but personally, I haven't made any changes.  I mean, I wasn't afraid to go out that day because, I mean, well what are they going to hit that I was going to be at?
L:  Exactly.  I know my kids were, you know, a little more upset by it than I was and I'm like, you know, "Think about it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "What have they got to bomb in Tennessee?"
R:  Well, fortun-
L:  You know, they're gonna -- to me, they're gonna target government and --
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  I said, you know, what have we really got?  And I said the most we got is Nashville or Memphis and I said, we're in between both so we're okay.
R:  And I told my husband, I said, "What are they going to bomb?  The Liberty Bell?"  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  You know?
R:  I said, "What are they gonna hit?"  [LAUGH].
L:  And you can't live your life in constant terror, you know?
R:  No, you can't.  Um --
L:  My theory is, if it's your time to go, you're going.  I don't care where you're at.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's exactly it.  The last time I flew by plane was actually, uh, February twen- twenty ninth or thirty -- uh, by March first.  It was two thousand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, it was -- it was real easy getting to check in and stuff.  I understand it's probably a lot worse now.
L:  That's what I understand.
R:  And -- but personally, not a thing,  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  The strangest thing was I think the day after or two days after, I had to go to Nashville and I had to go right by the airport, and you're talking totally dead.
R:  Right.
L:  And that area's never dead.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It was the easiest trip I'd ever made.  I mean, there wasn't even any army planes and it was -- it was odd.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That was a weird feeling, seeing nothing.
R:  Yeah.  I try to av- avoid the airport area like the plague.
L:  Yeah, I do too, and I was really dreading it, but I had to go.  I didn't have a choice and it was, like, wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  The worst thing is, my husband is retired military.
L:  Mm.
R:  And he hadn't passed the ten year mark yet.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  He didn't pass until just, ah, actually until November this year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And his biggest fear is being called back.
L:  Oh, I can imagine.
R:  But he -- for some reason, they sent it -- um, he's supposed to have ten years, but they sent his things basically telling him he's through with the military, they sent it in November last year, at the nine year mark instead of the ten year mark, so he's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, guard that with your life.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I know my oldest son is twenty, he's like, "Mom, I may be moving to Canada".  [LAUGH].  He said, "Nobody's mad at Canada".
R:  You know what?  My -- both of my boys, they're eight and seven and they have hemophilia and I told them, I said that, you know, in some ways I'm glad they have it because they won't ever be drafted.
L:  Exactly.  It's -- and I told him, he's on medication the rest of his life, I said I don't think they'll draft you.
R:  It --
L:  I said, "If they do, I'll go with you to Canada".  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm like, you know, if you want to fight, I'm -- I support you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But these kids that don't want to go, what's the point of sending them?  They're the ones that's gonna get killed.
R:  Yeah.  Not only that, the -- they're going to get somebody else killed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I mean -- so, there -- there's been no real changes.  The biggest change was trying to explain it to my boys, because at the time my oldest one -- or my youngest one was in kindergarten --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he'd just started, it wasn't even a month that he'd been in kindergarten.  It was only, like, a couple days.
L:  And it's got to be much harder for younger children.  Mine are fifteen and twenty and --
R:  They can understand.
L:  Yeah, they understand more.
R:  Yeah, my -- my children were, like, I picked them up from school that day and I was, like, "Did you guys hear what happened?" and -- and since then, the oldest one has been -- he's eight years old now, and he's like, "Are we at war with somebody?  Why?"  He's got all these questions and that's the hardest change.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.  I know probably a couple of weeks after it happened, my kids were still, you know, paranoid.  And I'm like, you know, "Go do what you normally do" and for the first time I can ever remember, we seen the Northern Lights.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And didn't know what they were.  There was this huge, pink glow, and it just kept growing, and my oldest one's like, "Mom, I'm out of here".  I said, "Well, honey, where you gonna go?"  You know?  It's spreading.  I said, "There is nowhere you can go".
R:  It does -- it does create fear.  I mean, even my seven year old, at the time he was only, like, six or seven, and even he understood enough that it caused him fear.  I mean, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we came home and I said, "Well, we have to go to the store" and he's like, "I don't want to go, you know, they might bomb something or they might hit something with an airplane".  I said, "What are they going to do?  Run an airplane into your school?"  [LAUGH].
L:  I know people at my husband's work that were building bomb shelters and I'm like, "Are you all crazy?"  [LAUGH].  You know?  What good is that gonna do you because if you survive, how long is that bomb shelter gonna to sustain you?
R:  Yeah.  There's that.
L:  Yeah.  I said, you know, "If it's your time to go, when you walk out, you're going", you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, see, my husband at the time had a job where he drove all over the Philadelphia area, into New Jersey and then into Delaware and sometimes down into Maryland --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- down near DC and he refused to go down there to DC.
L:  Well, I don't blame --
R:  But he -- he was -- he called me that day because I was actually the one that told him where to go, 'cause that wa- uh, that was my job.
L:  Right.
R:  And we work for the same company and he called me and he said, "One more plane hits, I'm gonna -- I'm leaving, I'm coming home" and I said, "What are they gonna hit?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said, "It's the Philadelphia area.  What are they gonna do?  Fly something into the -- into the Liberty Bell?"  I said, "They don't want that kind of stuff".
L:  Exactly.  I wouldn't want to -- uh, you know, I wouldn't even visit DC or New York.  Now, I wouldn't do that.
R:  I wouldn't visit them in the first place, so it's not --
L:  I -- well, I wouldn't either.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's not a change.  I mean, I wouldn't visit them in the first place.  [LAUGH].
L:  You get me off a four lane highway and I'm lost.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And I visited DC when I was in high school and it's, like, six or eight lanes there.  [LAUGH].  There's no way.  
R:  My biggest thing was when I was twenty one, I went to Hawaii and I -- my husband, and we came across country, and at that time, it would have been a little scary.
L:  Right.
R:  Wouldn't bother me to go across country now.  
L:  No.  I don't think I would fly, though.  I am still a little paranoid on that part, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't enjoy the flight to begin with, the last one I took, so --
R:  Well, do you know what?  The first time I ever flew, I was twenty one years old and I was, like, oh, this is awesome, and when it started taking off, oh, the speed, and then we got up in the air and I started getting a little scared, but I was sitting next to a guy who -- he was like a business traveler --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and he started talking to me and calming me down, but --
L:  I did -- I don't even -- I don't -- I'm claustrophobic.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, we flew back, me and my son flew from Hawaii straight back, ten hours.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I was just, like, "Phew, get me off this thing.  Let me --" I'm real tall, and let me stretch my legs [LAUGH] and have a cigarette.
R:  You know, that's got to be terrible for people that are claustrophobic now, because of the -- the US marshalls that are some of these flights.
L:  Oh, like --
R:  I mean, 'cause you get -- you start to go a little nuts and the US marshalls start looking at ya.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I didn't go nuts.  I'm, like, I'm breathing.  I'm like, "I just got to get off this".  You know, there's nowhere to walk around.  You can't just really get up and stroll.
R:  No, you can't.
L:  I don't even ride down the road.  I don't care if it's thirty below, my window's cracked.  You know, I'm getting out or I tell my husband, I said, "If we ever go to Hawaii" -- 'cause he didn't get to go that time, I said, "We're cruising". 
R:  You know --
L:  I can get out and get some open air.
R:  I don't think I'd let my kids fly right now.  
L:  No, I don't -- I don't think flying's a great idea.
R:  No, I don't think that's a great idea.  I mean, the only place we go -- the only thing that, uh, we go is my parents life in Pittsburgh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when my stepbrother died, we flew over there, they paid for the flight.
L:  I enjoy a car trip better anyway.  You can see so much more.
R:  Well, it was me alone with three kids and one of them was only four months old.  [LAUGH].
L:  Hey, there's a trick to car trips with kids.  You leave after midnight and they sleep most of the way.  [LAUGH].
R:  But uh, I don't think I would let them fly now.  I don't think I'd go anywhere with them flying.  That's about the only thing that -- that has changed.
L:  Yeah, the flying is really, er, don't think I could do that.
R:  But the -- the other thing is, my oldest one's scared of flying anyway, 'cause when we went over for my stepbrother's funeral, I mean, we encountered -- the whole State of Pennsylvania was in, like, a storm and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the plane kept hitting turbulence, and he -- he's got his hands up in front of his face, "Please don't let the plane fall.  Please don't let the plane fall" [LAUGH] so he's scared of flying anyway.
L:  On our last leg we had to lay over in St Louis before we came to
