R:  Hi, I'm Brandy.
L:  Hi, I'm Tanya.
R:  Hi, Tanya.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay.
R:  So, have you changed anything in your life --
L:  Um --
R:  -- since September eleventh?
L:  Mm, not too much.  Like, I -- I -- actually, I'd one of these calls earlier today and like I told him, um, it -- it was almost kinda like surreal to me, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a -- I'm a stay at home mom of triplets, and -- and so when -- when they -- when th- they weren't that old when it happened, so I kinda tuned it all out, because I didn't want them --
R:  To know what was going on?
L:  T- to know what was going on, so and I don't -- I live in Texas, and I don't know anyone really in New York or anything, so it was kinda like [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I have four kids, and I only have twins, though, so --
L:  Really?  [LAUGH].
R:  My life isn't quite as hard as yours.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, it really hit home for me.
L:  Really?
R:  I was actually, um -- I never watch the news, ever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I happened to have the news on and saw the second han- uh, plane hit live --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that just totally freaked me out, and um, when I was a little kid, my mom always said, you know, "I know exactly what I was doing the day that JFK was shot".
L:  Right.
R:  And like, for me, I knew exactly what I was doing, you know, the -- the day the second plane hit.  
L:  Right.
R:  And I don't know that I've changed anything in my life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'm not flying right now.  I was going to go back to Missouri and see my grandparents --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I am not flying because of the terrorist attacks, because not for myself, I wouldn't be so hesitant for myself, but I'm taking all my kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just -- I don't feel comfortable putting their life in jeopardy.
L:  Right.
R:  In a -- in a tumultuous time like this.
L:  Right.
R:  Now that the war's over, you know, I probably feel a little safer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I don't know.  It still makes me nervous.
L:  Right.  
R:  So --
L:  I know.  It's -- it's -- it's strange.  Like I said, I -- like, because they are so young, they're three now, so they were, you know, a little over a year, so they probably wouldn't -- even if I'd watched it, but you know, like I told the other guy, it was, like, I think it was to keep my mood upbeat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and happy.
R:  Right, for them?
L:  I mean, it -- for them.  I mean, it was more if I watched it, I was going to dwell on it and my attitude was not going to be in the best, you know, frame of mind.
R:  Right.
L:  To be taking care of them when they needed their mom and everything, so we watched a lot of Barney and Teletubbies.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  All the happy, fun stuff that they like anyway [LAUGH] just to keep the other channels off, because like, you never knew when they were going to break in and tell you something you really didn't want to see.  [LAUGH].
R:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I -- I think that's a big issue, too.  I tried it with the war and with the nine eleven, not to let my kids watch too much.
L:  Right.
R:  I have an older daughter, she's, um, she's eight, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she -- she was involved a little bit more.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she knew what was happening and they were talking about it at school and you know, we really had to talk about it on the basis of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, wh- there's a reckoning beyond this life, and those men, uh, that did that have to reckon with that, an- and that made her find more comfort, you know, because --
L:  [NOISE].  Right.
R:  -- she couldn't understand why someone would -- you know, to -- to blow up the buildings was bad, but to take the people on the plane and for them to kill themselves to do this was really traumatic for her.
L:  Right.  And that's --
R:  So --
L:  -- you know, and that's why I try and keep the war off.  I -- I turn it on after they go to bed at night, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're three now, so I -- they -- I don't think they'd still understand, but I do notice them watching TV more often, and you never know what they're picking up and what th- --
R:  Well, you know, and it was so repetitive, too.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  The same images over and over and over again.
L:  Right.
R:  And I don't care if they're one or three or ten, they're gonna --
L:  Right.
R:  -- remember that, or identify with it on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some level and, like you said, pick up on your mood.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  
L:  So --
R:  For me, I had school that night and it was just like it was a waste -- what a waste.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, there was no point in going because we were all so --
L:  Sh- and --
R:  -- wrapped up, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in what was going on and, you know, and it just -- I think, though, it did make me step back and really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think about what was going on, you know?  It's like I've never seen my church so full --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as the Sunday after nine eleven.  It was like, wow!  And I think for a lot of people it was like, okay, what are you doing in your life?  What is the last thing that you said to your loved one that morning?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, 'cause how many mornings do -- does your husband rush off to work and, you know, you had a tiff and you forgot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to say something and I think it really -- I think it -- it brought that to light.
L:  It brought people -- it brought people closer together and -- and -- and it showed -- you know, th- the good stories came back to the forefront of the news, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It wasn't all, you know, the news -- there was so much negativity of what was going on in the world, the news looked hard to find the happy stories.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  It --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know, and I mean, that was almost a good thing out of it at least.  You could see the, you know, those heart warming stories of this --
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  And everything.
R:  And for the first time in a long time, we had some patriotism.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  For a country that was, you know, so down on America because of all of this and that, you know, for the first time in a long time, I really felt like our country pulled together and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- showed some support.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that, had nine eleven not happened and we were in, um, Iraq, I don't think that there would be as much support for the troops.
L:  Right.  I think there'd --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- be a lot more people antiwar and --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, and people have the right to protest, but still, we need to support --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our troops because they're serving our country.
L:  Right, and that -- that -- I mean, I -- I don't necessarily support the fact that we're at war, but while we're at war, I'm going to support the people over there fighting, you know --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- for our country.  I mean --
R:  Definitely.  Well, you know, I don't think our -- our going into it, I was just really didn't want to go to war.
L:  Right.
R:  But as we were there and seeing the liberation of the people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, I was really proud of us, and I had big reservations about going to war, but I felt --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, look, we really did liberate these people.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's -- you know, for so many other wars we've gone in for so many other reasons --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I really -- I felt good about that.
L:  Right.  So --
R:  So, um, yeah.  Nine eleven, I think it definitely changed the way America thinks about a lot of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My girlfriend's baby was born that day, that very day.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So she was in labor.  I told her --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:   -- I go, "Well, I guess at least you had something on TV to watch".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  She goes, "Yes, that's true.  I was" -- she goes, "I was well distracted during my contractions".  [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH].
R:  So --
L:  Didn't have a time to concentrate on everything.  Yeah.
R:  I know, it -- it -- it was a fateful day and I think that because I have young children also, my twins are, um, three and a half --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my baby's eleven months, and I think about all the babies that were born after their -- their parents died, after their fathers died.
L:  Uh-huh.  I know.
R:  And --
L:  That's got to be hard.
R:  Right.  What a legacy that's going to leave --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for them.  You know, how are they going to cope with this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- huge thing? 
L:  I know.  When they old enough to ask why their daddy's not around, you know, and their mom has to tell them what hap- you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  You know, and not only the unborn children, but all the children --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that lost their parents and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for having to cope.  'Cause, you know, it's hard enough to lose a husband or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, a wife, but to lose your -- your mom or dad, that's just -- that's really terrible.
L:  [NOISE].  Right.  Yeah.  Where are you from?
R:  I am from California, Southern California, in a small town called Hyland[?].
L:  Uh-huh.  I -- I --
R:  Kind of by Big Bear.
L:  I have, um, I have relatives that live in Sacramento, Northern California, and I was born in --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I was born in San Bernardino, so --
R:  Oh, so you know right where I'm at?  I'm right down the street from San Bernardino.
L:  Okay.  Well, I was born there, I didn't live there long.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I was an Air Force brat.  So we -- I think we moved to Alaska when I was, like, eight months old.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, you moved to Alaska?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Wow, you've really lived all over the world.
L:  Yeah, I've lived all over, so -- [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, lived in Texas for most of my life now since, like, you know, thirteen, fourteen years now, so I guess --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- if anyone's going to be called ho- any place is going to be called home it's Texas, but --
R:  It's Texas.
L:  But California would probably be the next best thing, since I do have family there, so we go to Sacramento every few years and stuff, and see --
R:  Oh, that's nice.  I used to live up in Tracey which --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is about an hour or two from Sacramento.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- I like Northern California.  It's really nice.
L:  I do, too.  I like -- we had our honeymoon -- we stayed at um, um, Lake -- Lake Tahoe area, between Lake Tahoe and --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- Sacramento, and the Apple Valley area.  My uncle owned a little cabin out there and we stayed there for a week and it was just beautiful, with all the apple trees and --
R:  Oh, how beautiful.
L:  -- everything.  It was so nice and so that's always got a -- a nice warm place in my heart.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know, huh?  It's nice to -- you know, it's places like that, it's really nice to go --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- and visit and it kinda --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- feels like a second home.
L:  Right.
R:  But then it's always nice to go back to your own home.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I tried that.  I tried moving to that place that I really, really liked and then it just wasn't really, really special any more.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  It was, like, you know, I really liked this better when it was a vacation spot.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's what happened when I moved to Tracey.  I missed Southern California --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I'd been here my entire life, lived in the same city most of my life until I was, like, eighteen, and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- went and tried the big world and came running home after a year or so.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't like it out there. 
L:  So --
R:  So, do you just have the triplets?  Like, that's not enough.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- the instant family, one and only time, so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Two girls and a boy, so we got --
R:  Oh, how sweet.
L:  -- everything.  We got everything we'd want and so.   They keep saying, well, maybe we'll -- but I had to have a hysterectomy so we know there's no more kids, but we keep thinking, "Maybe I'll adopt" and then they start acting like normal three year olds, and I say, "No, maybe not".
R:  No.  Three's good.  Three's enough.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Three's good.  [LAUGH].  You know?
R:  No, I find as they get older, it's nicer, because they have each other to play with.
L:  Right, and that's how it is now.
R:  And fight with.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  But, is it -- is it that way when there's three?
L:  Yeah.  They -- they get along and they -- they play a lot.  The girls play a whole bunch together, and then every once in a while, you know, I'll twist their arms to include their brother and they'll include him for a little bit.  The poor boy, he gets picked on so much, but he'll be bigger so- be bigger than them soon enough and then he'll [LAUGH] -- then --
R:  He'll be bossing them around.
L:  -- I don't care, as long as they don't -- yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Then they'll have to look out [LAUGH] so --
R:  Watch out, here comes your brother.
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH].
R:  I found that the first year was the hardest.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  For that first twelve months.
L:  It's getting easier.  It -- it's --
