R:  Hi, this is Michelle and I am in South Carolina.
L:  Hi, um, um, this is Theresa and I live in Florida.
R:  Okay. 
L:  [COUGH] Ah, -- 
R:  So, what changes have you made since the events? 
L:  Since September eleventh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Let's see. [SIGH] Not really too much of a change, um, [NOISE] just, ah, more aware  -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- of, ah, [NOISE] -- of travelling and stuff and, ah, surroundings.  Um, -- let's see I, I haven't taken -- yes, I've taken a plane ride since then.
R:  Okay.  Well, given I'm in government and we travel a lot, our travel completely has been, you know, changed.  We don't get to travel as often.  Our security measures have been upgraded.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We are constantly -- they're constantly sending us stuff like for bioterrorism, what we need to do and personally around my home, just, you know, stocking up on stuff.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Just in case.
L:  Right.
R:  Trying to keep a full tank of gas.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, as far as my daughter is concerned, she's only five, she's not [SIGH] totally aware of what's going on but try to explain to her,  you know, what she needs to do in case she's not with me, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, stuff like that.  Also, um, as far as monies [NOISE] in the bank and stuff like that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I try [NOISE] to monitor to see what's going on so that at least if anything happens -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you put a freeze, you know, I have money [NOISE] otherwise that I can access.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  And, [NOISE] um, you know, with family, trying more to keep in touch with family and go see them.  You know, if I have to drive an extended amount of [NOISE] time to, you know, make sure they're okay -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, how are they coming along.
L:  Yeah, I made that a point, to keep in touch with my friends afterwards.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah -- it, ah -- I got a little boy who's three.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  And, ah, the only thi- -- he's totally unaware. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  The, ah, only thing he's noticed is, ah, the amount of flags afterwards and stuff.  Um, my -- the area where I live at, I live in North Florida -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, ah, he's seen lot of flags and every time we pass by a flag, "There's a flag Momma, there's a flag". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and, also, you know, there's a lot of yellow ribbons that [NOISE] are out now.
L:  Yeah, we got three.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] He's seen those.
R:  And otherwise, um, just, you know, too, talking more with coworkers [NOISE] and, ah, families about, you know, what's going on because, you know, we have family over there too that, um, so far, you know, nothing has happened to them but, you know, you always  pray -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they will [NOISE] return safely.
L:  Right.
R:  I think too, um, I notice a lot more [NOISE] that people talk about God.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, [NOISE] what goes on in the bible.
L:  Yes, yes, yes.
R:  Whereas, [NOISE] you know, there was that push, you know, take prayer out of the schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] You know, take it out of the pledge of allegiance.
L:  Right.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [NOISE] other than that nothing too much, you know, just, like I say, trying to develop closer relationships and, um, you know, visiting folks, [NOISE] going places and stuff.
L:  Yeah, and, ah, keeping in touch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where did we travel to?  Oh, when was it?  I think we travelled to Vermont.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  And, ah, I think it was -- which one was it?  It was -- ah, I think it was towards Christmas time. 
R:  [NOISE] Okay. 
L:  Towards Christmas time we travelled to Vermont and, um, they had their -- at that time they had a, [LIPSMACK] -- I think it was -- they had like selective, um, searches, they had, ah -- when they checked your bags they were pulling people over to the side and, ah, selecting different people to search.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  But some people they didn't search and some people they did but they searched us for some reason.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  But that was -- and they had, ah, the armed guards at the airport and stuff.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  And other than that, um, you see a lot of, um, army personnel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [NOISE] that are about in travelling along the way and she questions, my daughter does [MN], excuse me, you know, "Why -- why -- why we see so much of this Mommy", and, you know, it's like what do you tell them.
L:  Right.
R:  Especially for that age.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know in school they, um, you know, try to tell them bits and pieces of stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they don't really go into the particulars.
L:  Right.  You said she was five?
R:  She's five, she's in preschool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  She loves it.
L:  [LAUGH] I got a while until mine goes.  I think we're gonna to put him in a precare first.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  He's three, I stay home with him.
R:  And, oh, and every night before going to bed now she has to have the TV cut[?] on so she'll watch the news and she comes and she reports what she hears and what she sees.
L:  Oh, yeah? 
R:  Yeah, and she asks, "Why do -- why do man do that mommy"?  I told her I didn't know. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know, there's a lot of that going on too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Sounds very inquisitive. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, a thousand questions from the time she gets up, if I'm home, to the time she goes to bed, why, why, why.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, mine's getting to the stage where everything is mine, mine, mine.
R:  Okay.
L:  "That's mine, that's mine".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "That's mine, that's mine" and I say, "No, that's mine", "No, Momma that's mine", "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can have the vacuum if you want it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's something, something else.
R:  That's it.  The other thing that goes on, now that I'm thinking about it, like the guns, we've seen some, you know, what with the guns, um, that have passed by.  Not to say that they were aiming them at anything but I guess in school they talked about how, you know, airplanes have guns on them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ships and things carry those, she asks, you know, "What -- what -- what are they going to do with those?" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, "Why is it that they have to do that?"  And -- and I guess the -- the hardest thing is just trying to explain in a language that she will understand that none of it is right. 
L:  Right, right.
R:  But it's being done to try to help, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- those people who achieve what she has, you know -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, do what they'd like to do and not be punished because they did it.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And I guess you'll say okay for a little while and then I guess something else, you know, kind of like, um,  -- kind of like, um, well -- well, what do we do, you know, are we goi- -- like when they were talking about on the news to put the tape on the windows and all the water together.
L:  Oh, yeah. Right, right.
R:  "Why is it we gotta do that, we can't go outside".
L:  Right.
R:  We can't do this, we can't do that.  It's like I told her, I say, "Mommy's not gonna do anything of that".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I say, "Because when I see it like, you know, if you're a believer in God and if it's your time to go, this is your time to go".
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  And there's nothing you can do to stop it or to, um, you know, increase your time here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She kind of like, you know, she'll look like okay, I'm satisfied with that answer but now and then she will come back with her little inquisitive mind.
L:  [LAUGH] That's cute. [NOISE]
R:  And something else again.
L:  [LAUGH] Kind of like why is the sky blue.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, joy. [LAUGH]
R:  You have the answer to all the questions in the universe.
L:  We're not there yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Anything else going on in your end as far as your government [MN] or the way they do business or whatever there? 
L:  Oh, wow, I'm not really in -- in to much of that.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well Orlando, as you know, since it happened, well I guess it happens every year but more so this year they've, um, as far as the budget is concerned, they've cut the budget dramatically, they've laid off people, they're even entertaining the notion of --
