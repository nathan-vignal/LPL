R:  Hi, my name's Louise.
L:  Hi.  My name's Ben.
R:  Hi, Ben.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Salt Lake City, Utah.
R:  And I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  You live in Cleveland?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's fun.
R:  Yeah.  I've only been to Salt Lake once --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for -- actually for a job interview, but I've never been -- been there for a vacation.
L:  Oh, really.  Oh, it's a nice place, I guess.  [LAUGH].
R:  Did you grow up -- 
L:  I --
R:  Did you grow up there?
L:  Yeah, I've grown up here.  I've always lived here.  I've never been to Cleveland, Ohio, either,  [LAUGH].
R:  Some time you'll have to come to the Rocker Hall of Fame.
L:  Um, yeah.  I got to check that out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, what -- what job interview were you coming for?
R:  I'm trying to remember.  It was for a company -- um, I work in the managed health care field and I think it was a mental health, um, HMO.  I think.  I can't remember.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think --
L:  Was it at the University of Utah or --
R:  No, uh-huh.  It was -- for some reason, their offices just happened to be in Salt Lake.  I don't even know why.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And this was probably about ten years ago, but --
L:  Oh, I see.  I see.  Yeah.  I -- I'm only eighteen.  I've -- I've lived here my whole life.
R:  Your whole life?  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  It -- it's fun, though. 
R:  How did -- how did you get involved in this testing pro- this, you know --
L:  I -- actually, my dad signed me up.  I'm -- I'm leaving on a -- uh, a mission for my church in a few mon- in a month from now, I'm going to Brazil --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and he just, like, yeah, it's ten dollars every time I do it so I'm, like, yeah, I'm down.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  What part of Brazil you going to?
L:  Sao Anopolis[?].  It's below Sao Paulo.
R:  Uh-huh.  And what will you be doing?
L:  Um, I will -- like, be helping around the communities, teaching my gospel and stuff -- stuff like that.  Mainly just getting to know the people.  I learn Portuguese and everything, and I just --
R:  You did?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm going --
R:  That's a --
L:  -- to.  We learn it in, uh, there's an MTC at the training center.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, they teach you to speak it there, in like discussions, you'll teach and stuff like that.
R:  Because that's a difficult language.
L:  Yeah, it is.  But, um, I'm up for it.  It's a two year mission and so I --
R:  And --
L:  -- I think I'll have it after a few months.  [LAUGH].
R:  What is your church?
L:  It's, um, it's the Mormon Church.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
R:  Uh-huh.  And how long do you think you'll be in Brazil?
L:  I'll be in there for -- I'll be there for two years.
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Uh-huh.  'Cause we all -- in -- any kid is, like, willing and dedicated enough, leaves at age nineteen and comes back at twenty one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they just take two years.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I guess that's one of the changes I kinda made after September eleventh.
R:  Really?  In what --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- way?
L:  Well, like, it -- it's like, uh, I was thinking about doing the ROTC too.
R:  Mhm?
L:  But that just, like, I wa- I wanted to and I thought I'd do it before my mission --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when things came, um, up, most likely if I were to join the ROTC then, I'd would of had to stay here and not be able to serve a mission.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I wanted to serve my mission first and probably join when I get back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or something like that.  So, I'm not waiting, I wanted to get this -- get this taken care of and done.
R:  Mm.  
L:  So, I don't know.  I -- I -- I didn't notice too many changes with me after September eleventh, but, I don't know.
R:  Do -- do -- anything different in the way you think about things or feel about things, or ask?
L:  Um, way I feel about things, like, with the war, September eleventh, I think a lot of people have been overlooking what -- what happened to us first.  Like, I mean, like I mean, I'm not -- I'm not against the war at all, and I mean, I -- I don't think it's right or anything, but I mean, I think it -- it's happening because it -- I -- I think that's the only way the government thought they could take care of the problem.
R:  Of the terrorists?
L:  Yeah, of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the terrorists and all the other stuff.  Like, I mean, I think, like, most Americans are against the war are overlooking is what might happen -- might have happened if they didn't go in and uh, and take care of Saddam and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, I mean September eleventh, I think played a bigger part than what most people look at.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As far as the war goes and stuff, but I mean --
R:  So you think that was a -- you think that was the turning point, or you think it wasn't?
L:  Well, I -- I think -- I think it's a point in which a lot of people overlook.  I think it was -- I mean, with the -- with the government and all that, I think that was a big point for them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In that we don't look about because it happened, like, two years ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so I mean, if we look at that and just say, hey, I mean, this will probably settle it down or stop it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I think that's a good thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm not too -- I don't know a lot about what's going on in the war and what -- what -- what the reasons are and what not, but --
R:  Have you been following it very much?
L:  I -- I've -- I've -- I've read some and find out.  It looks like -- well, more lately, it's just been, like, the stories that have happened over there and how many of the soldiers have died and their stories of the soldiers who died.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, as far as we -- as far as, like, I think the public knows and everyone knows, the political views, I don't think we know even half of it.  I think there's probably more than the reason just to go over and get Saddam.  I think there's more than that, that we just don't know about.
R:  Well, I'm hoping there is.  That's the only thing that keeps me feeling like it's okay to do this, is that --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- um, there is -- there are other things that we don't know about, that make it much dangerous situation than it seemed to be because --
L:  Yeah, the -- the -- like, I -- I -- I'd think, like, I mean, they might have, like, nuclear warheads, I mean, and that might be one of the main reasons they're over there, but they're not going to worry all of us because of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that there could be reasons such as that and everything else, and like, there's other -- probably other acts of terrorism have been -- that they've probably stopped and we just haven't known about.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's the scary part to me, is like, you know, is it really that much worse?  I don't know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I do wonder about that.
L:  Yeah, and I mean, with the government, like all movies lately, you -- you -- are like -- I don't know what the movie was called, um, Bourne Identity or the Recruit and stuff like that?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  All that stuff is just like, wow, this really could be happening and we'd have no idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That kind of thing, and which is, like -- so I mean, I -- we really can't just judge the government, what they're doing.  I mean -- I mean, there's not many people who've -- I mean, dead, compared to Americans as over there.  I mean, it's sad how many people have died, I wonder how many of them were, like, trying to kill American soldiers and what not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so it's just -- it's sad, but it's just like I guess it needed to be done because I mean, I'm sure the -- the president and everyone doesn't want war as much as we do, but it -- that must of been the only way and so I just go with what they decided, and it makes me sad that there's so many people against it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And see these soldiers are coming home, or they're leaving, and they -- I mean, I -- I -- I guarantee at least half of them don't want to and don't support it, but it's just what they need to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so it's kinda sad when they come home to a country that's half of the people are unappreciative of -- for what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're doing over there, even though they might not be in total support of the war.
R:  So you feel like you totally trust our politicians and you think they have our best interests at heart?
L:  I -- I do.  I mean, they -- they -- why would they want to go over there and just kill people and just -- just looking for one man, to stop something?  I know there has to be a reason.  They know that some of our soldiers would be killed and they -- they know the risks they're taking of doing this, and so I mean, if it's worth doing for them, and throwing all this money into it, there must be a -- a really good reason.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I mean, like, they spent so much money on these bombs and everything and all the troops, to feed all that kind of stuff, when they could be -- I mean, getting everyone out of poverty in the US and what some people say about -- I mean, there must be more than just the reason to get Saddam than all that, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That they put so much into it.  So, like, I have a lot of trust in them, and I mean, and it goes through so many different things to get into it, too.  Like -- like the House.  It's a lot of men who decide on it, everyone just says the pres- the president, but it's a lot of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I mean, it can't just be one bad choice by one person.  It may --
R:  You think there's a team of people that have made all the decisions regarding this war?
L:  Yeah.  What led -- led up to it, yeah.  I totally dig that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I mean, September eleventh, I -- I mean, a lot of people I think changed after that, but I mean, if that -- I don't -- if September didn't -- eleventh didn't happen, I don't think this would be happening now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I mean, I -- I don't know.
R:  Do you feel more vulnerable since September eleventh?
L:  Vulnerable in what way?  Like, scared?
R:  Mhm?  Or just that, um, that we took a lot of our freedom for granted and -- and something more horrible than that could happen to Americans?
L:  Mm.  I -- uh, I don't see how it -- I mean, I -- I don't feel that I took my freedom for granted or anything like that, but it just -- I think -- [NOISE].  I don't feel very vulnerable after that.  I -- I -- I just viewed it with, like, a sad moment, but -- but the thing is, like in other countries, I mean, pe- that many people die every day because they starve or something like that.  I mean, over in Iraq, all those children were dying every day from starvation while Saddam was spending all that money on himself and doing those tests and stuff like that --
