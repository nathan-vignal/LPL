L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Donna, I'm in Delaware.
L:  Hi, I'm Tammy, I'm in Washington State.
R:  Okay.  So, we are to talk about how we've changed our life since September eleventh?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh ...
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  If you'd like to start, you're welcome to.
L:  Yeah, I -- for me, I -- I haven't changed my life.  I have lived my life like I w- -- I usually do, you know?  You --
R:  Mhm.
L:  For me it's like, I cannot live my life scared of everything because of what happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't do that.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Um, I can't say that I've changed much either and [SIGH] I think [COUGH] my -- my life is the same basically because, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know , I don't -- I don't -- I'm not involved in a lot of things that -- where terrorists would be.  Like, I don't do a lot of flying and I -- I -- I don't know, maybe that's the reason why?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  It's the same thing here, you know, it's like, I always, you know, in my life I was b- uh, careful and always to pay attention to things when I'm out there.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So I don't think I need to be more, you know, aware --
R:  Cautious.
L:  -- of anything, cautious, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause I -- actually, it would be too much-- I will spend more time doing that than fun things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, just things to do with my kids, I, you know, I think they notice that I'm not that way so they don't -- they're not scared of doing things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so it's -- it's good, you know, on that part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So my kids are not scared to go out there because they're worried that, you know, somebody is gonna attack the United State or anything, they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they are the same.  I haven't changed anything.  It's true, I'm like you, I -- I don't travel that much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't have to worry too much about that.  When it comes to it.
R:  And I'm not sure that [SIGH] --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- well --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I can't even say that I pay a whole lotta attention to any -- I -- I really don't, I -- I can't -- maybe I'm in a lull or something but, um, I've always believed that United States, uh, took a position of, um, pride shall we say, or -- or they just never educated their people into knowing that these things could happen, since nothing ever happened over here on their soil, and, uh, so I guess I just had that cocky confidence.  It was like the United States had a cocky confidence and even after September eleventh I think that th- the thing that it did the most for me was open my eyes up to things that happen around the world, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people deal with every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I don't deal with it here but others and other -- in -- in other countries people deal with this type of stuff every day.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Um --
L:  I -- I am now am American citizen but I -- I was born in Panama.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I wa- -- and I was there with the things with Noriega.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I -- I was careful, you know, over there and th- the, you know, and always watching at things, and I think it does carry over t- -- when I came over here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seventeen years ago, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I -- I'm always careful of what I'm doing, so like -- and -- and now always, you know, and what [inaudible] me some time is that when I was in Panama the news will say like, something's happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we -- my husband is an American, we were over there and we were like, "Where?"
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I -- I was there but we -- I didn't saw anything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I'm wary sometimes when I see the news.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just the things they put out there and -- and I think they make it bigger than what it was.  So --
R:  Yeah, and I -- I -- I don't trust the news too much because I don't trust that they tell us exactly what is happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they only tell us what they want us to know and [MN] news, uh, stations are notorious for wanting to be the first to get the news out there, no matter how, you know, unfounded it is or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  They just wanna be the first to tell you something about it and then they'll worry about cleaning it up later like, "Oh, we said this but we meant this".
L:  Yeah, just --
R:  But as long as they can be the first one to get it out there.
L:  Yes.  Because you can wa- --
R:  But you can't really trust them.
L:  Because you can watch one channel, they say any -- something, and then you watch the next channel and they're talking about the same thing but it's changed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you -- you change one other channel it's totally different, so it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what is it?  It's like where the girl -- one of the POWs that they found, the girl, they said that she w- had been shot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then they said she was not shot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then -- a- and so I told my husband, "So what is it, is she shot or not?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or, you know, I don't know, it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's like you --
R:  You don't know what to believe!  So --
L:  Yeah.  So it's like, geez!
R:  Uh, you know, I'm sorry to say maybe I'm just being, um, I've never been a overly cautious person, I am aware of my surroundings somewhat when I go out like, whether somebody's following me or something.  But, uh, as far as terrorism and how I feel about watching for these things .... I -- I can't say that I watch for them, you know?
L:  [MN]
R:  Um ...
L:  You know it --
R:  I can't say that I do anything different, uh, as --
L:  Yeah, me neither, 'cause I -- I feel like, you know, why -- I'm gonna be start looking at people and, uh, and saying, "Well, you're from there, so I guess --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you may be ..."  I'm like, you know, you don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't know who will be the person that come after you.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that it's -- when it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It doesn't matter.  You know.  So just live your life as it is, uh, as full as you can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right now.  And instead of just watching TV and then kinda, "Okay, today I'm gonna do this because --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- it seems like, you know".  It's like when they have these like, high alerts over the United States, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Over here in Washington they're like, wow, they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you can't go to the station, you know, because they're gonna do -- they may do this.  I'm like, "Come on, I cannot just, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- not [inaudible]" --
R:  And I -- I think that -- that is about the only thing that, you know, unfortunately I hear you say that, I think that's about the only thing that I have changed, is raising a eyebrow at, uh, those that look like they might be from that, uh, um, country, uh, like this -- I hope that's nobody buzzing in my [inaudible].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, uh, but that's about the only thing that it has done, is raise that eyebrow.  And I don't like that, so, uh, because I don't want to prejudge people, because I have friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are from diff- -- that are from different countries and so forth and -- and I've worked with, uh, international students a long time, and, you know, I just -- I just -- just don't think that [SIGH] you should look at everybody just because they're not white, "Oh, well, that must be --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- uh, uh, they're -- they're a suspect" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or just br- -- just because they look like they're from there, oh, they're a suspect.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And --
L:  Yes.
R:  Y- you don't know --
L:  But --
R:  -- you know?  It's too -- it's too broad of a -- it's too broad of a thing to do, so I think basically what we've done is just that, you know, we're just not gonna go thinking that way, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're just gonna continue to live our lives as we've been.
L:  Well, yeah --
R:  Now again, being that I don't do a lot of traveling and things like that, I don't have that type of alert, uh, maybe that some travelers would have.  But as an everyday, average, you know, person, you know, I just treat people the same way I've always treated them --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- unless I see something, unless they come at me with something, then okay, that may raise an eyebrow, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.  I think, for me it's like, if I go places I always, you know, aware of -- of my surroundings and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I see somebody that's acting weird, I don't care what color you are --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah! Exactly!
L:  -- you're acting weird, I'm away from you as far as I can! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I don't care if -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you may look good, um, have a nice suit, but you acting weird to me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm sorry [LAUGH], stay away from me!
R:  Yeah!
L:  You know, it's -- it's like, you know, it's like one of these days I was in town[?] and this guy came to me, w- wear nice suit and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's like, "Can I, uh, talk to you?"  I'm like, "No".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's like, "No, it's I forgot my wallet, I need to return something to [inaudible]" and I'm like, "That's not my fault".
R:  Mhm.
L:  He was like, "Yeah, but, you know, I give you mon- --"  I'm like, "No".  And I felt, you know, it for me was -- I felt bad that he had come to me.  I'm like [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I felt like, degraded that you picked me to try to do your bad stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm like, "I d- -- I don't do that thing".  I'm like, "No, no thank you, no thank you".
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  And he's talking to me, I'm like, "No thank you".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "Well, I'm not gonna do anything".  I'm like, "I don't care".  I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "I'm waiting for my husband".  It was just like, " [inaudible] can you stay away from me?" You know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Geez, I don't --
R:  Yeah.  So I don't know.  Again, what have I changed?  I can't say that I've changed much, but I -- I -- I -- I have to repeat that I -- I'm just an average person, I just get up and go to work every day, and the most that I see of it, uh, is on the news, you know, if they're saying, uh, "You need to watch out for this" or, "We're at high alert now" and the dah dah dah dah dah, I might, uh, take a look and see if I see something out of the ordinary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's when I'm looking for something out of the ordinary, maybe a car somewhere that looks weird or something, I don't know.  But, um, I haven't changed anything, you know, I -- I just haven't, you know?  I -- I'm just more appreciative of life, more appreciative of my family, um, I -- I don't take small things, uh, for granted, you know?  Um, I don't look at tomorrow as being promised to me because anything could happen.  And so, you know, that's the way you have to live otherwise you'll just live in fear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All the time.
L:  That's -- that's the way they're doing --
R:  And, uh, "I wonder if they're gonna do it here?  I wonder if they're gonna blow up this?" or, "I can't go over here because that's probably a target" and -- I just don't think like that, I'm just --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  That -- I -- yeah, for me about this time, that's too much waste of time and to -- trying to worry about where you're gonna go right now.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?  And it's -- it's -- it's sad that these things are happen in this time and the sad is from people are going to the extreme, they're just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, making themselves so worried about everything around, but --
R:  Yeah.
