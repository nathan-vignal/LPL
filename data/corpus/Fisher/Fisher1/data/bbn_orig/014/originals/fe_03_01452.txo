L:  Hi, this is Stephanie. 
R:  Hi, this is Jane.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
L:  I'm in, I'm in Arizona.
R:  Oh, well nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Um, I understand our topic today is September eleventh and changes we have made.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, -- I, um, -- actually, we've made some changes in regards to that.  Um, it really opened our eyes, I think, in America as far as the type of security we have.  We've always had freedom, and now our freedom has been threatened, and I think, you know, there's been a lot of changes across the United States, but on a personal basis I think I've become more aware of who's around me and what they're doing. [LAUGH] Um, I don't know about you, um, I guess I've become a little more suspicious of some people.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, we've probably prepared ourself for some sort of disaster.  I've, you know, kept aside extra water and things like that, um, in case of terrorist attacks.  Um, have you done something similar, or --
L:  You know, we really haven't changed that much, other than, you know, explaining to our kids, you know, that things can happen, you know, explaining more than what we had explained before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, you know, we, we live day by day, we know exactly where we're going to be if we do die, and, you know, it's not a worry for us to do any, you know, preparation as far as, like, water or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.  I guess I'm probably more aware of it because we have, um, [LIPSMACK] the NORAD facility here, we have military bases, ah, the air force academy, and Fort Carson.
L:  Right.
R:  And the NORAD facility, of course, tracks, [MN] via satellite, um, for the northern hemisphere.  And they do a lot of tracking for the military plus, ah, secure communications and that type of thing.  So, I guess it maybe has hit closer to home here [NOISE] because we do have military people and it has affected a lot of, of the families that I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, --
L:  Well, you know it's --
R:  -- just on a personal basis.
L:  -- affected a lot of our families too, but, you know, we know that, you know, this is something that is going to happen.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, and we knew that, you know, in the end times, that these things were going to start happening.  We didn't know exactly what would happen, but we do know that things are going to get worse at times.
R:  Yes, I agree with that, and -- yeah, I mean, it's just awful, what happened to those people on September eleventh, I mean [inaudible] --
L:  Yes, it was.  But you know, it was -- you know, it could happen to anyone.  It could happen in a flat level house or, you know, anything like that -- 
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, it's -- they just happened to target a very --
R:  Well, that's because they're terrorists.  And -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they go where they know it's gonna make the most impact and affect the most people.  And they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- certainly did that.
L:  Yes, they did.
R:  And, um, I don't know how you feel about the war in Iraq at this point, but, um, my personal feeling is I hope that Saddam is gone and his sons as well, and I don't wish that to happen to anyone, but I truly believe he's one of the leaders of the pack.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And was working with Osama bin Laden, and, you know, once you get rid of some of these people, the -- the people in Iraq have been suppressed for years and years and years, and they have a right to freedom just as well as we do.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I hope that they can get it together and have a strong country.
L:  Yes, and --
R:  After all --
L:  -- I'm sure that they'll at least do some improvements.  But you know, as far as myself, I -- you know, I --  I really -- we have not really changed, other than since the gas prices have jumped so high --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lately, we have not really changed anything.
R:  Do you find you're driving less, maybe?
L:  No, not really.  Because --
R:  I don't think we are either, um --
L:  Because, you know, the, the gas prices are from the war, but see the war is from nine eleven --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and, and -- and that should have been taken care of years and years and years ago, but --
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  But, you know, as far as we changing our lives to, you know -- because of nine eleven, [MN] the only -- the only thing that I think that we have really done since nine eleven is to make sure that we have told people that we love and people that, you know, we're very concerned about as far as their life and the way that they're living, we have told them, you know, more directly that, yes, we do love you, we want you to be a better person, you know, these are things that we think might be able, ah, to benefit your life. 
R:  Right.  Make you a stronger person and -- 
L:  Yes, make you a stronger person and --
R:  -- a stronger family.
L:  -- make sure that, you know, the people that we are involved with know that we are supporting them no matter what.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  And that, you know, I think that's the only thing that has really changed in our life since nine eleven, is the fact that we've had to be -- we- we've been forcing ourself to be more verbal as far as our emotions and stuff like that.
R:  And that's made the country stronger as a whole.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I -- I mean I truly believe that too.  And I, and I agree with you, I think we've done the same thing within our family unit and with our friends and so forth.  Um, it's -- but I also, like I say, I have become more aware of my surroundings and things that might be happening, um, with crime and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not to avoid it, but if I can put a stop to it I will. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And not turn the other cheek on that sense, um, -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But, preparing for a disaster.  Like I say we do have a lot of military here, and with the NORAD facility, that's a the prime target.
L:  Right.
R:  But other than that we haven't really changed either, um, as far as things that we've done.  I mean, I'm not afraid to get on an airplane.  Um, you know, if it's gonna be it's gonna be. [MN]
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  It would of happened before, or it could happen after.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and hopefully that won't happen anymore, you know, that, um, [NOISE] hopefully things are changing in Iraq and so forth, and terrorists are realizing that, um, it's not gonna be put up with, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And those that are harboring, harboring the terrorists too, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think things will be happening in Syria more so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If some of them did escape, that's probably where they went, so... but September eleventh was a very sad situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I witnessed it on TV the day it was happening. [MN]
L:  Yes.
R:  Like, I just couldn't believe it, it's like I -- I can't imagine what those people were feeling and thinking, and, um, having to go through that, and then the people that cleaned up the mess and so forth, you know.  It's just a horrible thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, have you done part of this study before?
L:  Yes, we have.  Yes, I have.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you find out about it, or through ...
L:  Um, I --
R:  Do you do mystery shopping?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  I just started getting into that as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, that's how I got connected with it also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you find that it's working well for you to do mystery shopping, or --
L:  Mystery shopping?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I've been -- I'm on, like, my limit as to how many shops I can take. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh, so you're maxed out, you're doing a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, pretty much, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  Um, I feel, you know, the -- I'd like to be able to do more of it, and, um, I'm -- like I say I'm just getting started with it.  So this was one of my first projects that I pulled off the internet --
L:  Yeah, well there's a lot of companies out there.
R:  That are doing it.  Do you do on line computer --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- surveys as well? 
L:  Oh, no, I don't do the on line ones.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I haven't gotten into those.  But the ones that you actually have to go do interviews and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I think that's one reason why I'm not more geared towards, you know, since nine eleven, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've been doing mystery shopping
