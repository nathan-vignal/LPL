R:  Good evening call partner, my name is Tom.
L:  Hi, Tom, my name is Nancy.
R:  Nancy, nice to meet you.
L:  Same here.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Upper Darby Pennsylvania.  Where are you calling from? 
L:  Oh, Philadelphia PA.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So we're right, ah, a couple of hours away from what happened in the New York situation -- 
R:  Yes -- 
L:  -- September the eleventh.
R:  I remember it well.
L:  Yes, so do I [MN]
R:  I guess to stick to the topic, what changes have -- have we ma- have I made would be that, well, I haven't traveled that much other than to see my sons -- son off at the airport a couple of times.  I do work in the law enforcement and security field.  My workload has essentially -- had essentially tripled, but now I am used to -- I'm used to the more work and -- and [MN] -- and I'll be honest, I think I love my family and extended family a lot more now than I did before September eleventh.  I value time now more than I did. [PAUSE]
L:  Well -- well, my end it changed, I think it made everyone's life change, not only mine, and where I think people became more aware of an- -- of who they were, who they are and of other people's feelings and emotion.  I think it brought up u- -- more people together because when that happened there was death all around us, it was such a sorrowful event that many lives were affected.  Ah, I know at Philadelphia  people were frightened because a -- if you recall it was on the news about the Liberty Bell and um, ah, Tesna[?] Street all -- were all the historical places are that we all had to be careful, but yet we had- resume our normal life.
R:  That's true.  The most stressful point for me was about the first couple of hours, because I have a sister and brother in law who I thought worked in that section of New York.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] 
R:  And luckily they [LAUGH] neither of them were working in there that day.  I -- well, actually, my sister was in New York but in a different section at the time, but I did what [SIGH] I -- I did the what's -- called the families and whoever could get -- whoever could get to me first, they had both my cell number and they had my work number and within an hour I found that everybody was all present and accounted for.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah [SIGH].  I -- I even stayed at work a little while longer that day for -- for at least one hou- for at least one selfish reason was that I didn't want to really deal with the traffic going home that day because I -- it was a such a beautiful day and I rode a bike and I ride a bike, but the weirdest part about it was when I went home about -- left for home at about I guess one or two o' clock or so, there was nobody, underline the word nobody on the road on Arch Street. [MN]
L:  Uh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was at work that day, but I -- I take a twelve- I, um, I was in Center City that day, and I had to take Twelfth Street [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't remember it as such, I -- but you continue, it was empty Arch Street? 
R:  Oh, yes, it was empty on Arch Street, it was almost like a Sunday the amount of traffic on Market Street [MN] and through University City, but I just figured because, well, in my line of work, I went through the reaction of Oklahoma City and now I went through the reaction of the World Trade Center disaster and essentially they needed somebody to kind of cover the phones for a while, so I said I'd hang for a couple of hours just because I didn't want to be a biker out amongst all -- all that traffic trying to get to places.
L:  You drove from Center City to Upper Darby? 
R:  Yeah I'm a bicyclist, I -- I -- I'm not a motorcyclist.
L:  Oh.  Well, I know people who are terrified and I think were frightened of what could happen here.  Don't you think so?
R:  I think tha- oh, yes, there were a lot of the frightened people, there was a lot of reaction, there was a lot of over reaction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because of my law enforcement -- my law enforcement background and all, I had to look at it as -- with a kind of gallows humor kind of thing, because it's either that or I go crazy and I didn't really need to go crazy that day I needed to have my wits about me.
L:  Well, when it happened that day, you know the Society Hill Towers, right, on Front Street? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, at first I thought they meant somebody came and said, "Oh, the Towers was hit", so I thought it was the towers on the -- you know, the -- in Society Hill, the Society Hill Towers, so I -- I was very -- oh, I couldn't believe it and then when I heard it was New York, that was even har- more hard, that was more hard to believe because [MN] --  
R:  How --  
L:  That was sabotage -- that was like -- it's just unbelievable.
R:  I'll -- I'll be honest, I -- I guess to give you a point of reference of how old I am, I'm still a fan of Imas[?] in the morning.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I'm a fan of Imas in the morning.
L:  Okay.
R:  I was a fan way back when long ago in a galaxy far, far away in high school.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, oh, all these years later, I remember Warner Wolfe[?] calling in on it and not really believing it at first, but then all of a sudden the word came into our office, "Turn the TV on" and I saw the first one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I swallowed.
L:  It's hard to believe.
R:  And I said -- and I said, mm, because I'm thinking it's only an accident, that nobody is actually doing -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah -- 
R:  This. 
L:  That's what I thought.
R:  Then I saw the second one and I said -- I said something I didn't need to repeat to, ah, to a lady.
L:  It's hard to believe and it's so hard to believe how they're trained to commit suicide, to think nothing of it just to give their lives up just -- that's -- that's so hard to believe.  They kill themselves those two terrorists.
R:  Well, the whole -- the whole crew in -- in all the airplanes and such had essentially killed -- killed themselves --
L:  Oh, that was sad that too with the airplanes and the people, um, on the airplane trying to -- using their cell phones trying to contact their families, trying to say what's going on and -- and apparently they were [inaudible] the White House.
R:  Yeah?  But luckily those people that flight took their best shoot.  There was nothing -- there was nothing to lose I imagine at that point. [MN]
L:  But he got away with it, Bin Laden.
R:  Well, I -- I don't know if you can say he got away with it because of the way now that he has to exist, if he is still existing.
L:  Hiding.
R:  Yeah.  I mean look at it this way, twenty some odd years later they find Abdul Hamas.
L:  Mhm, and that's something --  
R:  And the [several inaudible words] sitting there in Baghdad collecting his revolutionary social security checks.  You know [SIGH] I'll be honest I -- that one Bin Laden is one whose -- I'd prefer to see his head on a stick to -- to be convinced that he's dead.  I don't particularly care whether Saddam Hussein is dead or not, but that one needs to [SIGH] be shown with a head on a stick.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah [LAUGH] to put on and to be -- everyone look at it
