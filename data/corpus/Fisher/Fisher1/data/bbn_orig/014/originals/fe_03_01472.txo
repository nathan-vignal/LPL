L:  Hi.  This is Karen Mirolton[?] of Minnesota.
R:  Hi, my name is Zoya, I'm from Maryland.
L:  Okay.  [PAUSE]  Are we supposed to start talking, do you know?
R:  I- I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's my first call!  [SIGH]
L:  I'd had one earlier today.
R:  O- oh --
L:  But, um, I'm thinking -- I can't remember, I thought that they came on and then they interrupted and said, "Okay, your timing will begin now".  But, okay --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so we can talking [LAUGH] I guess!
R:  [MN]
L:  But, uh, well, I work at a -- a healthcare facility and stuff, so for me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just kind of, um, we -- I don't feel very threatened that they're gonna, uh, any terrorist is gonna come and bomb a hospital or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  So, as far as that goes, I'm not too worried about it.  But, you know, it's -- it's there in the back of my mind and you see it on the news and stuff, and so it's something I think about a lot but, uh, you know, I haven't really changed my life a whole lot.  Um, we have some kids so I tend to, um, be a little bit more careful with them and -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just knowing where they're at and -- and whatnot and so that way, I guess, um, it directly affects me, but ...
R:  Right.  I -- I didn't make any changes to my lifestyle either.  I work at the library, so ...
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.  Another s- pretty safe [LAUGH] work place!
R:  The, uh, um --
L:  It's not like they're gonna get a big kick out of bombing a library or anything, you know!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I'm also worried about my daughter, she's only two but, um, I was actually more worried, um, when there was like, [LIPSMACK] you remember that Washington sniper?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that was bothering me much more than the terrorist attacks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, so --
L:  Yeah, 'cause just that ju- they were regular people, I mean, you know, they just kinda -- I don't even remember how that all ended up, if they just kinda went off the deep end or thought they were picking off people that could harm some- the United States in some way, or whatever?  But that -- that is pretty scary, if you think of people that just kinda anybody -- they could be anybody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but just [NOISE] snap.
R:  Yeah.  You never know when or where it's gonna be.  And that was scary.  Um, I don't think, um, I think about that a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just ... I prefer not to think about it! [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, yeah.  And, you know, at -- at work we have, uh, normally we just have regular badges that we just use to just time keep and that sort of thing, it's just one of those swiping cards, kinda like a credit card I guess.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And, uh, they're just basic, they don't have any words on or anything.  Well, now they're gonna go to having pictures and our names on 'em.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So, it's -- and I -- from my understanding this -- in it's in regards to this terrorist thing, they're cracking down on security and -- I suppose anybody could grab anybody's badge and nobody knows who that person is, if that's their badge --
R:  Oh right.
L:  -- or, you know, just 'cause they have a badge I -- you know, you assume that they're -- they're a worker and stuff, but ...
R:  Right.  That reminds me of how this thing, also, we have, um, our crisis plan updated and we have more training on evacuation and using the, um, exits, emergency exits, and the first aid kits and everything.  I guess that's in response to those terrorist attacks.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, um, and at -- my brother in law works at the airport in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the city of Sierra and he -- they've been -- I think it was in regards to September eleventh, a lot of people have kind of s- slacked off on traveling, and now with this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Iraqi thing, that it just -- people are just, uh, not traveling as much, and they had to cut back a lot.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  He's -- he's switched to a later shift and there's a chance that he might get laid off and, it's pretty bad.
R:  Yeah, I guess it is.  But on the other hand, my husband had to travel I -- in October --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- last year.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he got his tickets real cheap.  And, uh, there were only three people on the plane at that time.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Um --
L:  Did he get to sit in first class then?
R:  Uh --
L:  Or did he --
R:  I don- -- I don't remember, I mean ...
L:  I would think that if, just because you bought -- just because there's rumored first class, y- you'd sit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where you probably got your tickets at, though.
R:  I think he still stayed in the coach.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the economy.
L:  So he's ... well, that's -- I didn't realize that it was that bad, unless he had a really off flight, but usually it's at least half full.
R:  Right.  A- and that flight was to Florida, so I would expect it --
L:  Geez.
R:  -- be at least half [NOISE] full.
L:  Yeah, especially in October, everyone wants to get out of -- get outta -- where are you?  What state are you in?
R:  Uh, Maryland.
L:  Maryland, yeah, we have, uh, relatives that live around there.
R:  Oh.
L:  In Massachusetts kinda -- kinda by you!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not really I guess [LAUGH] but closer to you than us [LAUGH]!
R:  Wow!  Actually, I'm from Russia, I'm only like --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- two and a half years in this country.  Uh, so it's still like --
L:  Oh my.  Did, uh, do you have relatives that still live in Russia?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Now, how does that all affect you?
R:  Well, actually, I've been there last year and I'm -- I'm from St Petersburg and they're having a big celebration, uh, it's, uh, three hundredth, our anniversary of the city.  Um, the city is getting ready for the tourism and they expecting a lot of people there, and they are actually worried about terrorist attacks because all the presidents of, um, most of the countries will be there, and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they actually closing the airports and cutting down on visas, and they only issuing diplomatic visas for like, officials and presidents and stuff like that.  I mean, they are worried more than we do.
L:  Oh my.
R:  Um ...
L:  You don't think of, well, uh, you know, I don't think of a lot of other countries, I'm sure they've got a lot of problems with that sort of thing, but just hearing you say that they've got problems with terrorism, I wouldn't think that Russia would.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, it just doesn't seem like it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as big of a target.
R:  Yeah, but, uh, you see, a lot of country leaders are going to be gathered in one place, so it would be a very --
L:  Right.
R:  -- convenient location.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't know.  My mom actually is coming here during that celebration and she is a little bit worried about flying here, um, hope she's gonna be okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she's kind of nervous, uh --
L:  She's gonna fly to the celebration?
R:  Uh, she's going to fly off, here.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's no- not going to be, um, in St Petersburg during the celebration.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because -- I don't know [MN] ...
L:  I wouldn't wanna, you know, you -- you just kinda put yourself in harm's way sometimes and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you kind of pick and choose what you wanna risk your -- your life on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or whatever, you know.  I mean, any -- any celebration, big celebration, you could have problems with riots or -- or just the -- like that Washington sniper, I mean, just someone wanting to just get a thrill out of, or whatever, whatever their --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- reasons are.  But ... geez.
R:  I try not to think about those issues normally, but n- ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I think a lot of people, uh, don't think about stuff, like, September eleventh, everyone thought that everybody would change their lives and become better people or whatever, everyone was saying, and it just seems like, uh, everybody kinda went back to the way they were, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I guess.
L:  I would like to see more patriotism like, in our schools, to get the pledge of allegiance back in there and, I don't know, it just seems like people have gone way overboard with things and it just kind of, uh, it's kinda ridiculous after a point, and it -- it's just kind of sad that people think they're -- they have some sort of cause and everything, if they're not ... uh, they just -- they just, uh, pick up a cause and run with it almost --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- even though they don't really think about it!  And they get, uh, w- way too far overboard with everything, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, sometimes that happens. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But ... so, I don't know.  In the whole, uh, terrorist, uh, uh, what -- where it's severe and high -- high alert is -- I think we're back to high alert now aren't we?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So that's good.  Because I think we were at severe, wasn't that the next level, orange or something?
R:  Um, I'm not sure! [LAUGH]
L:  But -- [LIPSMACK] but I wonder how they judge that, you know, how they -- how they determine what our threat is at and stuff?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, do you think Saddam had anything to do with the ni- -- September eleventh attack?
R:  Well, it's hard to say, I mean, um, mm, he might be.  We'll never know for sure, I mean --
L:  I know.
R:  -- or what we see on the news might be not the real picture, because I was talking to my relatives and they would, um, uh, they told me that, uh, things they saw on TV was a little bit different from what was shown here, and I guess, I don't know, there might be some censorship on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the government's part.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I wonder what the media is allowed to show and stuff?  And everyone thinks that the media knows everything and I -- I'm sure there must be a lot that's filtered out before it gets to their access, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  But ... [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that was fun, I mean, I'm not usually used to talking on the phone 'cause I'm only in this country for like, a couple of years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't have that mu- many friends to talk with, um
