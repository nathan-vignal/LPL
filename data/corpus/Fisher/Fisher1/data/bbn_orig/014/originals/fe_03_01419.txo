L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, my name's Marsha.
L:  Hi, Marsha, I'm Debbie.
R:  Debbie, hi.  We're supposed to talk about changes in our lives since September eleventh or changes we made.
L:  Yes.
R:  Have you made any?
L:  Um, we have -- I have, um, I've just been a lot more cautious especially, I have three kids.
R:  [MN]
L:  And just a lot more cautious wherever I go.
R:  Uh, you mean cautious in your town?
L:  Yeah, oh everywhere.  I'm -- you know, looking over my shoulder and we live close to an air force base and we hear a lot of planes going over.
R:  Are you in a big city?
L:  No, we're in a rural area but we live, um, right next door to an air force base and all the planes fly over.
R:  And -- and you would be afraid of what?
L:  I don't know, it's just, you know, since that happened, um, it -- it just seems like, um, you know the kids are more aware of it and they're, um, asking me more so, you know, we just lock our doors and, um, you know, we have a plan of where we would go if something would happen.  We don't know what would happen though, you know.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Have you made any changes?
R:  Well, you know, I have a lot of family that live abroad and, um, when September eleventh actually happened, that day and the day after, I got a lot of calls, "What's going on?" because their -- their news wasn't as up to date as ours.  "What's going on, what happened, what do ya know?"  Those kinds of things and, um, "Aren't you afraid?"  And, um, we live in Connecticut, which is pretty close to New York [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, very close.  Right.
R:  And, um, we have a -- a submarine base in the state and we have, uh, nuclear power plants in the state and all those things come to your mind just as you were saying you live near a -- an air force base.  Um, and a lot of the questions that I got from people who live in other countries made me think, should I be doing something different?
L:  Yeah, my husband works at a, um, air separation plant and that would have -- it's highly explosive so that would have been one of their first targets, you know, after the -- after the base when they started going for the middle sized businesses.
R:  I think -- I think shortly after September eleventh I -- I was more apprehensive than I am now.  Since then I've traveled abroad twice --
L:  You have?
R:  Oh yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  You know, I would never do that, that's why it's changed me.  We haven't went on vacation.
R:  Oh, see I keep thinking -- well, we traveled to South America and I can't imagine any terrorist thinking that they're going to get big letters in a newspapers or the eleven o'clock news from blowing up a plane that's going to Brazil, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they're gonna try for a plane that's going to Rome or to London or, uh, you know, if they inter- -- or they're going to blow JFK, um --
L:  Yeah, they're gon- -- you think they'll do something big like the Tow- -- like the Twin Tower.
R:  Exactly.  Like -- like the Twin Towers.  I think -- I think that for a terrorist, no matter where the terrorist is from, to try and pinpoint something that I'm doing I'd have to be awfully unlucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I think I'm in as much danger as -- of that happening as when I cross the street.  And I live in a -- in a suburban area.  I -- I just don't think they're going to blow up my normal stop and shop.
L:  Yeah, I don't know why, but I do.  I feel like --
R:  I think maybe because you have kids and -- and that gives you something more to worry about.  I don't have kids.
L:  Yeah, they're all teenagers and preteens and, you know, they talk about it in school all the time and they have the kids news on and announce it every day and the kids come home -- my mom works at the base so, I guess, you know, she's telling us a little bit and that makes them worry more so it makes me worry more.
R:  Well, kids excited.  I -- I was a -- a high school and college teacher until I retired and kids get excited very easily and there's also that -- that the kid next to me is excited so I should be excited so the next kid gonna be excited.  They all get excited together and it's -- they enjoy that.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, but I think it's -- it's the adult job to calm them down.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm doing but I'm -- I'm not going to take any chances [LAUGH] --
R:  No and I don't -- I'm -- I'm certainly not saying --
L:  -- either or --
R:  -- that anybody should take any chances and there's absolutely no way that you could give me a trip to Egypt.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Not going to happen, I won't go to Israel either.
L:  Right.
R:  Nor -- you know, that kind of a thing.  There's not -- not -- not a way on god's green earth but I would think probably twice about going to some parts of Europe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I don't enjoy going to New York anymore so that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  But I don't -- I don't -- I don't know whether, uh, uh, we've really changed anything that we do.
L:  Yeah, I mean we haven't really changed anything too that we do, it's more the way we think and act, I guess.  You know, we just -- we watch out more.  And I always make sure the doors are locked and so- -- that somebody knows where we are.
R:  But before September eleventh didn't you lock your doors?
L:  No.
R:  You didn't?
L:  No, we  --
R:  Wow, you live in a wonderful area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never not locked my doors [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, there's no crime here or anything.  You know, we're out in the country and, um, we never had to worry about anything.
R:  Ooh.
L:  But, you know, now, you know, if I'm going to the store I -- you know, I guess I do.  I have changed a little bit.  I tell my husband where I'm going, you know, I'm going to this Crocker's[?] or that one.
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  You know, instead of just, "I'm going to the store".
R:  Well, I think that's just good, you know, 'cause, uh, anything could happen and it doesn't have to be anything to do with terrorism.
L:  Yeah, well we always have our cell phones, you know, we always have but, um --
R:  And I turned mine in.
L:  You've turned yours in? [MN]
R:  I turned mine in [LAUGH] I gave it up, I didn't use it.
L:  Yeah, I need mine for the kids, you know.
R:  See, yeah, I think that's the difference in our focuses.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's it right there.
L:  Because of the kids, right.
R:  Oh.  And you're probably younger than I am.
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm in my fifties.
L:  Yeah, I'm in my thirties.
R:  So, there's -- there's a different focus right there.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  Um -- 
L:  And --
R:  I -- I'll tell ya I had a, um -- my -- my first cousin and his son both worked at the World Trade Center.
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  And, uh, that day it was all I could do to keep from calling my aunt to find out what was going on with them.
L:  They weren't -- tell me they weren't there.
R:  Well, I cal- -- I finally -- I got to six o'clock in the afternoon and then I just had to call 'cause nobody called me and I had to know.  Come to find out my cousin had -- his office had move, uh, I think, six months prior to that and was no longer in the World Trade Center --
L:  Good.
R:  -- and his son worked on the eighty fourth floor, don't ask me which Tower I don't know, um, had a day off that day.
L:  Wow, that -- you're family was lucky.
R:  Oh, very lucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very, very lucky.  That kid got himself a new birthday as far as I'm concerned and it's September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Um, but, you know, that's how close it got to us.
L:  Yeah, that's very close.
R:  And I still -- I still don't think that we've done big changes in -- in anything that we do.  
L:  Oh.
R:  There's things that I would never had done -- I don't think even before September eleventh I would have been too infatuated with a trip to, uh, Egypt or Israel, you know, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] world I -- I --
L:  Yeah, well, you know, we're not in a position where we could take those trips right now but --
R:  Well, I -- my premise was if somebody gave it to me I wouldn't take it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's how -- mine too.  If somebody gave it to me I wouldn't take it now.  I probably would have then maybe though.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, see that's -- that's -- we're different again.
L:  I would have gone to Israel then but --
R:  Uh, they're -- they're places I'd love to see but they're not top on my list, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But I don't think that has anything to do with September eleventh.  Um, fascinating, isn't it?  What do your kids say?
L:  What did my kids say?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just -- you know, they mo- -- they're just more -- you know, all the kids at school are exaggerating and everything and, um, combined with the [inaudible], you know, they're thinking well, you know, will [inaudible] come in.
R:  Oh dear.
L:  And, you know, just stuff like that.  They're -- they're not as bad as they were, I mean, after I'd say maybe for six months they were more fearful and everything.  You know, like I called the school recently and I said if there is a level three -- this is the Thursday before spring break -- I said if there's a level three emergency in our county, they're saying on the news not to leave your homes, I said so what would happen if, um, you know, a level three happens during school hours.  And, you know, the principal said, "Well, I don't -- I don't know I'll do what the board says".  So -- so, I called the board and I asked the board the same question and they said, "Well, you know, we don't know".
R:  Oh jeeze.
L:  I said, "Well, have a meeting on that and call me back tomorrow".
R:  Oh, that's awful.
L:  So, I mean, it's -- it makes you think, "Well, if they're not prepared, you know, I've got to be prepared".
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, and then I told the kids, you know, where to go.  I mean, I always know where they're at every minute.
R:  [LAUGH] You think you do [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I do.  They're -- they're not driving yet so --
R:  Oh, then you're lucky, you're very lucky.
L:  Right.  But, you know, it's just like we have a plan to go even farther north up to my mom's -- she has a cabin.  And, uh --
R:  Well, we're you located?
L:  We're, um, in Medway, Ohio.
R:  Oh, you're Midwest, okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's about a half an hour north of Dayton and then about an hour north of here is a lake, you know, my mom has a cabin there so we're just going to meet up there and it's gonna be --
R:  That's a good choice because, like I said, I don't think my stop and shop is going to get blown up and I don't think that in the middle of the Midwest you're going to get blown up either.
L:  Yeah, other than we live about two miles from [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and --
R:  The only thing that concerns me a little bit is there's a lot of crazies out there, uh, and --
L:  Like, um, people that wanna just act that just to get attention?
R:  Exactly.  That -- that concerns me more than --
L:  That does concern me too.
R:  -- than some terrorist.
L:  Yeah, that concerns me too.
R:  I -- I -- I can see some crazy person thinking he's gonna make a big splash by dumping I don't know what in my water supply...
