R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Dave. 
R:  Hi, my name is Nina.
L:  Um, apparently we -- the topic of the day is what changes we've made to our lives since S eleven.
R:  Yes, you want to go first? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, honestly, I don't really do anything all that different    now -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- than I did then.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.  Um, if anything I'm more cautious about, you know, places I go to, if they are Federal buildings or whatever.  But, I mean, I don't often go to Federal buildings so I don't really have to worry about that. [LAUGH]
L:  Actually the -- I'm quite -- it's, er, quite -- quite unlikely I'll ever fly again unless I really have to.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  But it has nothing to do with -- with the fear of, ah, some crazy faith monger crashing me into a building than it has to do with the fact that they have -- made it convoluted and annoyingly difficult to get on to a plane.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, if they catch you with tweezers, they confiscate them and give you a body cavity search.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't need that hassle, I'll drive.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't think it would prevent me from flying, I feel like if anything, um, airplanes are safer since -- since -- since September eleven, um, because security is beeped up everywhere, everywhere you go there's going to be major security, especially in customs, um, 'cause some of my friends who have travelled outside of the United States and come back, it is hard to get back in, I mean they make sure you really don't have anything.  So, if anything I feel safer than, um, I did before September eleven going on planes and stuff.  But I don't travel much but I probably will be in the summer but it doesn't worry me so much.
L:  Yeah, me either.  I'm -- ah, really I'm more worried about the, ah, people in the Federal government using --  using the whole mess as an excuse to, ah, make me less free than I am about the terrorists.
R:  Yeah.  I see, I see. [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon? 
R:  I see, I see what you mean.  Where are you from, you -- where are you from right now? 
L:  I am from Detroit.  Where are you from? 
R:  Dallas Texas.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] So when did you start doing this? 
L:  Today.
R:  Yeah, I did too.  Um, well, what else?  I guess we should still talk about the September eleven thing until it's ten minutes.  But, um, what do you think about finding Osama Bin Laden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do you think he's dead or alive or -- 
L:  Really, like Saddam Hussein, I don't think it matters whether he's alive or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's -- I mean, the organizations that, ah, that he ran, ran with and the power he had are pretty much gone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, maybe he can run around in a cave and, you know, talk on a cell phone once in a while but if he goes outside somebody is going to, ah, make his head disappear.
R:  Right, yeah.  Mhm.  What else after September eleven do you look at, um, do you look at, like, Arabian people or Israeli people differently now after that or are you -- did you not -- do you not really change anything about that? 
L:  Oh, I am more under -- for myself I am just more contemptuous of religion than ever before.
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  You know, if those people hadn't believed that a giant invisible man was going to give them prizes for blowing themselves up after they died or for giving them prizes after they died for blowing themselves up the whole mess wouldn't have happened.
R:  Are you speaking of just those people that were on the planes or are you speaking about, like, the ones that are here in America too that are Muslim and believe, um --
L:  Muslim, Christian, Wiccan, ferrianthropists[?] whatever, you name it.  They're all --  they're all one in the same to me.  How about you?
R:  Um, I don't -- ah, if they're like the ones that are here in America do feel sorry for the Americans that did die in the planes and in the, um, and in the Twin Towers.  I don't think any blame should be given to them even though I know a lot of people probably look down at them ever since this happened.  I mean, I personally don't.  Um, I don't think it's because of them, that stuff like this happened, I think it's just that there's like a few that decided to do it.
L:  Well, it is just a few crazy people but --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I'm a -- I'm sceptical of, like, ah, ah, -- just a second. [NOISE] [MN] You know, I'm just, ah, -- oh, well, my train of thought just jumped the tracks, ah. 
R:  You're sceptical of what?  You were talking about being sceptical about something.
L:  I'm just sceptical of all authority.  I -- I mean it's like I'm --  I'm bashing religion because it's -- because the faith in organized religion leads people to do really ridiculous things but it's just faith in general that --  that bugs me.
R:  So you don't believe in religion then? 
L:  No.
R:  Oh, and you look down at those who have a belief or have a faith in something? 
L:  Um, don't really look down on it because most people want it -- most people want make believe, you know, I just -- and it's n- -- not harmful for most people.  You know, most people don't do crazy things because they are religious.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And again it's not just fr- -- it's not religion that is the bad thing, it's faith.  I mean Chi- look at communist China.  It's a total -- you know, they're, like, -- they're, like, totally anti religion.  If you are religious they'll, you know, they'll beat you up for it in China but --  
R:  [NOISE] But what? 
L:  But they -- but the -- but their government is based on faith.  The reason they -- you know, the reason they don't want you to be religious is because their government is based on faith in the state.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're supposed to -- you are supposed to worship the state there like you worship God so it's still -- that's still faith though.  You are supposed to just give them everything and they are going to take care of you and don't --  don't ask questions.
R:  Did you have -- did you think this way ever since September eleventh or has this always been your mentality on it? 
L:  Oh, I've held those views for quite a while but September eleventh just kind of cemented them for me.
R:  Mhm. I see. Oh, --
L:  What about for you, do you -- are you more or less sceptical of such things since that happened?
R:  Ah, I don't think it's changed.  I'm Christian and I don't think it's changed, um, my views on any of it.  Um, if anything I believe September eleventh happened for a reason, as sad as it is to say it, I think it did happen for a reason.  I think there was a lesson to be learnt from it.  I don't believe that Muslims in general -- I don't think worse of them or anything, I believe -- I actually believe all religions are pretty much all the same.  Um, everybody just likes to call their main God something different but I believe -- 
L:  At least we're [LAUGH] -- at least we are in --  in agreement on that point.
R:  Right.  Um, I believe, like, you know, some person might say God and another person might say Allah but basically everybody is worshi- worshipping one main God, you know, there's only one God in all religions pretty much, even for the Hindus that say there are many gods, they do have one main God and I don't believe that -- 
L:  They do? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who is it?
R:  They have one main God and then they have a bunch of little gods that like are God of this or God of that but they have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --  one main God.  So, I mean, I don't think -- I don't think my views on religion or people who are Muslim or anything like that have changed after September eleventh.  I still -- I --  I believe it happened for a reason.  You know, a lot of people in other countries are saying, you know, [NOISE] it was basically coming to America.  It's like America's fault because they always want to put their nose in everybody else's business.  I mean, I don't agree with that.  I mean, I believe, like, the United States doesn't put their nose in other people's business just to do it.  I think they do it for -- for those people in those other countries so that there is someone telling their officials and their presidents and stuff that they can't do -- they can't treat their --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- citizens the way they do. But ...
L:  Well, we put our nose in anywhere there's a compelling national interest although the -- I think the nineties were an example of when we -- but the things you are you talking about, that, you know, we put our noses in people's business where we interfere, where we -- we're capricious and mean and [MN] and, you know, what we do doesn't always make a lot of sense.  I think a lot of that ha- a lot of that was the nineties because, you know, back in the nineties it --  it was -- you know, we send our troops here, we send our troops there, don't really do a lot other than --  than harass people and kill -- kill random strangers and piss everybody in the world off at us and in the meantime, you know, like we were building all this hatred towards America then and then -- but not doing anything about the terrorist groups, you know.  We -- they bombed the World Trade Centre in ninety three, they tried to -- tried to do something in the -- again in the late nineties, they attacked the coal, they, ah, blew up our emba- embassies in Kenya, killed a couple of hundred people, you know, nothing wa- nothing was ever done about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they just got bolder and bolder.
R:  I don't know, I just thought it would be nice --
