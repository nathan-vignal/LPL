R:  Paul Weir[?].
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, Tamara Starzill[?].
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you doing? [LAUGH]
R:  Just fine! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess we have to talk about what changes we've made, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yes.
L:  Okay, you wanna go first or do you want me to? [NOISE]
R:  Well, one of the changes that, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I live near two new +nuclear plants and, uh --
L:  Oh wow! [NOISE]
R:  And we have five grandchildren and we on the water a lot and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, that's just worries me and I see these small planes still flying in this area.  Uh, even yesterday, the day before yesterday, uh, [inaudible] light came over, you know, just putting along [LAUGH].  I says, "Man!"  But other than that, I mean, well, I think that, uh, they're handling security around the power plants as they should --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- during these times.
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow!  I haven't [LAUGH] been near a power plant recently [LAUGH] we don't -- we don't live near one, but we do fly a lot, or I did for work, when I was working,  and then we had a baby six months ago, so I don't fly as much, but I'd say that since September eleventh my  um, just being h- like, a heightened awareness at the airports --
R:  Oh?
L:  -- and on the airplane.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so, you know, I didn't change my flying pattern, I still flew a lot, but I think it was more of like a heightened awareness.  And there is one flight in particular I remember that, um, you know the space that's like, right in front of the door for the airplane?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, there's kin- -- it's like there's an empty area there and, um, a ... a muslim person wanted to pray there and kneel down right in front of the door --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because that was the only space.  And the flight attendants let him.  And I just remember, you know, just being so aware of that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and being very nervous about it, you know.  So, I -- I guess -- I mean, that's -- that's not really a change I've made in my life but it's a change I've made in my -- my actions, I guess.
R:  Well, you are kinda, uh, weary of, uh, the -- I don't know in -- in the foreign dress kind, uh, the robes and the things, I notice, uh, well, I have, uh, we have +grandchildren that live in Virginia --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we brought 'em down this past spring, well, not this spring break but last year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the spring break, on the -- on the Amtrack.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it was several, uh, i- in the long- longer garbs, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my grandkids, oh, they're eight, eleven and fourteen, you know, and they kept staring at the people and kept staring at the people, you know, and I says, "Well, it's nothing to be, uh, concerned about because they have plenty of security on these things".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, but, uh, I think it's a little bit, uh, blown outta proportion because of the -- they -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they heighten these alerts on, uh, then they lower 'em, then they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- heighten 'em again every time it's a holiday or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they -- well, it's a good time but, i- i- i- I'm not too concerned about it 'cause we're retired and we do still fly a lot because we have kids on the West Coast and in Denver.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, i- just flying do- it doesn't bother me that much but the -- [SIGH] it used to, I mean, right after nine eleven it did.
L:  Right.
R:  Because y- -- uh, you just didn't know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I can't -- but I can't say other than -- other than my awareness of ar- things around me, we haven't made any changes in our lives at, you know, at all.  And I can't -- I don't even know if it really, you know, a lot of people might say that it brought them closer together as family or as friends [LAUGH] --
R:  But --
L:  -- but I don't even know that it did that, um, [LIPSMACK] for us, uh, you know.  I watch the news a little bit more and I'm more aware of current events but  I ha- -- we haven't made any changes, it hasn't scared us into locking ourselves in the house! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [LAUGH] that's, uh, where we -- our children, uh, we've al- -- when we've traveled with 'em we've always been well aware then, you know, uh, uh, keeping up with them, so w- we're not too concerned abouts what's happening around us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because when -- nine, uh, times out of ten you've got w- an eye on one of your  children and --
L:  Right.
R:  And -- so that concerns us very little.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, it's always bit [SIGH] good to be a little bit leary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- of your surroundings, because of -- it's not just a +terrorist, it's, uh, uh, the riffraff now that, uh, if it's unsafe -- and we live in the Charlotte area, and I can't wait each night to see how many people got killed at -- doing that -- shot and all that! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and -- and -- and it's just -- it's just, uh, I don't know, it's just the +unlawfulness of the people and  a- --
L:  Are you in the -- are you in the south?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah?  Whereabouts?  Do mind me a- --
R:  We're in the Charlotte area, Charlotte, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Alabama.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Y- -- and of course, we have all these military bases around here so --
L:  Oh yeah, you're right.
R:  -- w- well, we  we, uh, always, uh, uh, feel secure when you see the military.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I mean, we're surrounded by, uh, at least [SIGH] eight or ten military installations, so, uh, w- w- -- relatively we're safe in -- in -- in this area.  But the only thing, at -- at -- at -- that has bothered me was those, uh, +nuclear power plants that we have close by.
L:  Right.
R:  And we have, uh, we live in a radius of, uh, five miles of one and, uh, twenty miles of the other one, so, uh  uh, I -- we just don't know, I don't wanna think of that [COUGH].  That concerns me.  It's like I said, it was, uh, the planes flying over.  We're supposed to be a no p- fly zone.
L:  Oh, really?  Hm.
R:  Around -- round +nuclear plants.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you is forever see 'em come over.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you just wonder if it's -- is that one of 'em? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Get the grandkids in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, here comes another plane!
L:  [LAUGH]  Are they commercial airlines or military?
R:  Uh, private.
L:  Mm, oh yeah -- yeah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that would be scary.
R:  Well, see, i- it's, uh, uh, we're -- we're close to Charlotte motor speedway.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And all these hotshot, uh, car drivers, e- every one of 'em has a private plane.  A Lear jet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there's so many in the air, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of course, u- uh, I don't think it's too much t- sort of be concerned about, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it makes you wonder.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And we onl- -- every so often they change the flight p- path --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it comes right over our un- our -- our townhouse, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I c- I can s- be sitting in the b- on the patio and here comes -- you can -- [MN] well, at night, because they stack 'em up, you know. [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, about every three minutes.  And you can see lights forever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're slowly coming down, you know, and --
L:  Mhm.  Wow.
R:  -- and you just think, "Well, if I was a terrorist, I could be in one of those things and write Charlotte off the map".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, well, now that -- now you -- that you're saying that, we get helicopters, in fact there was one flying around us last night --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that, um, I mean, just those that you -- you see military, you hear 'em.  And it's funny because you just kinda stop and you look [LAUGH], I mean, I never used to notice things like that before, you know, planes flying in odd places or military helicopters or -- I never paid attention to that, and now I do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I notice -- I notice little things like that, that you just kinda stop and you look and you can't help but think and  [LIPSMACK] so, you know, I always think also, you know, when they were talking about with, um, with like, biological warfare or, you know, just hurting our crops like, poisoning our food source here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the United States and, you know 
R:  And --
L:  It doesn't stop me from eating, obviously, but -- but you can't help it, it's always in the back of my mind.
R:  Well, it would hurt our family tremendously because all of the children are vegetarians --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and their children are vegetarians.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I say, "Well, that's comes outta the ground, you know, and they could come by here and spray something on it" and all that, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, that's -- that's true, I mean, I don't know how they -- there's a big, um, over in -- in town, over in, uh, we live in Birmingham, um, there's a big water source, um, you -- you -- there's always cops sitting out front --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, for security, I'm guessing.  But, you know, every time I drive by that I think that too, like, you know, like if they put things in our water or  [NOISE] you know, I don't know.  But you can't stop living.
R:  No, well --
L:  You can't lock yourself inside.
R:  And -- and
