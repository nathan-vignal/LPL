L:  Hello, my name is Brenda. 
R:  Hi, my name's Ed. 
L:  Hi.  Um, well really the -- nine eleven hasn't really changed any of my plans, um, since that occurred.  I used to live in New York and I've been in Virginia for about six years so, um, it kind of hit home a little bit because since I was living there for all my life and I've been into the World Tr- -- the Twin Towers and I had friends that were working there but, um, fortunately nothing happened to them.  Um, I did go see the -- you know, the -- the building after the disaster occurred and, [LIPSMACK] um, it was, yeah, nerve racking a little bit, you know, to see everything, them cleaning up the --  the mess and, um, seeing everybody there and all the flowers and everything they had left, um, at the site but other than that, um, it really didn't change.  I'm still doing my plans, I'm going, um, to Orlando in June and, um, I'm taking the flight and making arrangements for another trip after that, um, and just went to Florida about, um, a couple of weeks ago so it really hasn't changed a lot. 
R:  [MN] I'm in kind of a similar situation.  I am an ex New Yorker living in Virginia. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  [LAUGH] It's a small world, isn't it. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I've got a lot of relatives in New York.  I have been in this area for about thirty years but I've got a stepmother, a sister, a whole --  a whole large step family and a lot of connections in New York, some of whom are in the financial business. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I was concerned when things were happening, when --  when planes were crashing and all --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- for relatives and, ah, some in laws but everybody turned out to be okay and --  and amazingly enough, even though I'd worked at the Pentagon and knew quite a few people there, I -- as far as I can tell I don't know anybody who was even injured in either of the catastrophes and, of course, I'm deeply grateful for that.  
L:  Right.
R:  We had plans to travel out of the country on I think it's about October eighth or seventh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we had our tickets in hand and then September eleventh came along and we decided that first of all everything was probably a little bit safer after September eleventh. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And, secondly, we weren't going to let the possibility of terrorists wreck what had been a plan for the kids to have a special birthday weekend. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So we went off to the Bahamas and had I guess four days there over the Columbus Day weekend and then, ah, came home and everything was amazingly normal except for airport security which was a bit of a mess, especially around Washington. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And since then [MN] I think we've been -- we've stayed a little bit closer to home but it hasn't been specifically September eleventh, I think it's really been more the effect of [MN] the security problems and the airline problems and the actual travel issues. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, we haven't stayed out of Washington and of course that would be a prime target but we go in by metro, we go in by car, we drive around the White House and show friends the museums.  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But we haven't cut back on any of that activity at all. 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, the, um, -- well, I found that the airport, because I had hadn't flown in a long time, for years, and I took a trip to Miami a couple of weeks ago and it was -- I mean I really couldn't tell whether any -- I -- I couldn't compare, is what I'm trying to say, because since I hadn't taken any, um, trips in years, um, the security, you know, was there and you had to -- you know, I had to take off my shoes and, you know, stuff like that so, you know, sometimes you've got to do things that in order for you to be safe so, you know, it's nothing out of, you know, the norm. 
R:  It's not that I minded so much, it's that I used to -- well, years ago when I travelled a lot I'd fly out of National Airport and I lived out at Alexandria and I was maybe about fifteen minutes away from the airport by car and I would leave for the airport less than an hour before flight time. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I never missed a plane.  And these days, first of all the transportation has gotten so bad and secondly, the -- the airport stuff has gotten so bad that I'd have to leave about two and a half hours before the flight. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  To make sure of getting it and I might end up with an hour on my hands to kill at the airport. 
L:  Yeah, uh-huh. 
R:  But --  but I have to allow for the possibility of a long stay behind some lines. 
L:  Right, that's the thing --
R:  And so it's changed the frequency that I do short trips.  It doesn't stop me from doing, oh, a trip with the family across the country but it stops me from popping up to New York to visit with my sister for just a -- just a day, which I used to do every once in a while where we had family business meetings and I would go up there in the morning and come back, dragged out late at night and I haven't made a trip like that in more than two years. 
L:  Well, I -- I still have family in New York and I usually drive up on the weekends but I haven't really done that in a while and not because of the nine eleven, it's just I hate driving up there, um, the what, seven hours and then driving back.  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So [LAUGH] -- so that's the only deterrent.  Other than that, you know, I would be going all the time but, um, my plans are still the same.  I mean right now, [LIPSMACK] I mean I'm in downtown Norfolk and, um, when it happened they sent us home because we -- I'm in the building where, ah, the World Trade Centre is across the street and the Federal building is like two -- a couple of blocks away and then I'm in where the coastguards are in the building, you know, so they started patrolling the halls and, um, we were more aware of security and that, you know, everyone was watching and every time they -- every -- people here were nervous because every time they would hear something they were like, "Okay, what was that?"  You know, are they bombing, letting something go or what, you know, so it was, um, -- I guess the other people would make you scared.  You know, um, I didn't worry about it much but seeing the other people being worried, you know, kind of like it was contagious.
R:  I live not far from Dulles Airport and it was wonderful when everything was grounded and then shortly afterwards when there were just a few flights flying, because instead of being noisy pretty much until about ten in the evening it was nice and quiet all day long. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You could hear the neighbors cutting their grass a mile away. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  And now it's kind of just the opposite.  It's not that the skies are so busy or so noisy but it's that whenever I see an airplane or hear an airplane I stop to think, "What's that airplane doing, is it supposed to be there, is it one that I recognize?" 
L:  Right, yeah, that's what these -- these people were saying over here.  And, where I live, I live in a no fly zone so, um, that's a good thing but now with the war going on, I heard a couple of planes, I'm like wait a minute, "Was that a plane flying over?  Why are they flying over here?", you know, and you start getting concerned but, you know, it's just that I guess they went a different way and that was it. 
R:  A couple of nights ago I heard probably a military jet, probably flying quite low and definitely making a lot of noise and it's unusual to hear, ah, jet aircraft low right where we are because they don't fly over us on the way into the airport, they're not supposed to. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I went running outside even though it was one or two in the morning because I wanted to see what the heck was making all that racket. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I think in the old days I wouldn't have, I might have looked out the window to see if I spotted anything but I don't think I would have actually opened the door and gone out -- 
L:  Huh-uh. 
R:  -- to see if I could spot it. 
L:  Mhm. Yeah. 
R:  Part of that's because I'm, ah, an airplane nut and I'm -- I'm really interested in airplanes and if it was something exotic I'd like to get a look at it. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But it, never showed up to me. 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's --  it's just -- you gotta keep doing what you're doing and not change because if you do then they've won. 
R:  I agree with that entirely and I'm a pretty stubborn guy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, I don't know, I'm --  I'm still taking my -- I mean, until recent I --  I started taking trips.  I mean before I was, um, -- I was going out with this guy, we broke up, so I thought okay, now is the time, I'm --  I'm free so now I can do whatever I want and just pick up and leave and I don't have to answer to anybody and so now I am taking my trips and going everywhere. 
R:  Yeah. It was hard to explain some of this to the kids that we wanted them to be a little -- 
L:  Yeah, they just don't -- 
R:  -- careful that we aren't going to let it stop us from doing things.  They couldn't -- they had to work a little bit to sort out that -- that fine line that we were trying to tread, and, "Why couldn't we just pop in the airplane and go off to see grandpa?".  "Well, you know, it's a little more trouble than it used to be." 
L:  Yeah. You said, um, when it happened you were going to do a birthday? 
R:  Yeah, we had something lined up for I guess a little less than a month, about four weeks after nine eleven and -- 
L:  It was for the kids? 
R:  Yeah, we took the kids and the airplane was --
