L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good, uh, my name's Aton.
R:  Aton?  I'm Dee.
L:  Yeah.  What's your name?
R:  My name's Dee.
L:  Dee, who you doing?
R:  Good.  I'm from Michigan, where you from?
L:  I am from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh.  So, has September eleven changed you much?
L:  Um, I wouldn't say that much.  I'm mean I guess it'd be -- it'd be hard not to have it, you know, change you at all.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I guess when I -- when I go on a plane, you know, I sort of think a little -- a little differently but --
R:  You still go on planes?
L:  Yeah, I still go on planes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do -- do you not go on planes or ...?
R:  Uh, I traveled when I was younger but I don't think I would take a plane nowadays.
L:  So, you haven't taken one since September eleven?
R:  No, uh-uh.
L:  Just because -- because of that or ...?
R:  Um, yeah, I think if I had to go anywhere I think I -- flying would not be an option for me.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess I'm -- you know, I'm younger so I sort of, you know, um, sort of -- I sort of go by a philosophy that, you know, if something's gonna happen it's gonna happen but, you know, I mean --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean I did -- I did fly a couple of weeks right after September eleven which was -- which was a little scary.
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  Um, yeah, about October first but, you know -- I mean, you know, I sort of just, you know, I mean I take everything into account and, you know, I'm just aware but, for me, you know, it's not gonna stop me from -- from doing something like that.
R:  Yeah, that's a good attitude to have.  I actually did this a few minutes ago with a woman and right at the end of our ten minutes we got cut off.
L:  Really?
R:  And I don't know what happened.  But she works at a Federal Building in, um, uh, Missouri, I think she said, and there was all kind -- a VA hospital, was where she worked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there was all kinds of changes going on there.  She said security was really tight and they had all these drills and [SIGH] emergency call back to get everybody -- you know the doctors and stuff back as fast as they could, you know.  She said they didn't really have very good reaction to that.  You know, it was hard getting a hold of the doctors, having them come back in emergency, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, actually, um -- I go to -- I'm from Philadelphia but I go to school at, uh, University of Maryland which is, you know, about seven miles from DC.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, living that close there's, you know, constantly, you know, alerts and, you know, all kinds of, you know, warnings and stuff like that so --
R:  Oh, that's real close.
L:  Yeah, it's sort of, uh, you sort of get used to it, I guess, but, you know, I mean, there is -- there is -- there are certain days I remember a couple -- a month or two or go, like, I think, on a Friday that, you know, they told -- you know, people we re just talking, "Oh, don't go into DC like there's supposed to be a big attack" or, you know --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like you hear -- you hear stuff like that all the time but like it's hard --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's hard to tell, you know, what's -- you know, what can you do.  I mean --
R:  You can't stay away from work every day [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know, you can't.  I mean if you work -- if you work down there you really, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you really can't stay away from it.  I mean would you -- what about anything else you -- that you've changed since September eleventh or ...?
R:  I think I'm more patriotic, you know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, I -- I -- I don't, you know, I don't know about this war and everything but, uh, they decided they'd do it so I decided to be supportive, that's all.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  And I really wanted to give it to 'em because of everything they put us through.  And I know that's probably the wrong way to think, you know, but I was really glad that Bush decided to do what he did.
L:  Give it to them meaning the Iraqis or ...?
R:  Yeah, you know, Hussein and Osmand and, you know, Osama Bin Laden and I just have a hard time saying their names but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I know there's no -- there's no assurance that they have them or that they got Hussein or whatever but I think they'll -- I think they'll get him eventually, don't you?
L:  Yeah, uh, for Hussein you mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would think so.  I mean he's pretty, you know, crippled right now.  I mean, at least -- even if he's around, uh, it'd be kinda --
R:  Probably got a castle underground just like the one he had above ground.
L:  Yeah.  I think for me being -- you know, I'm only twenty one, September eleventh was sort of like, you know, sort of changed everything because I -- I was used to growing up just, you know, in a time of no wars and, you know, all kinds of peace and prosperity and, you know, for me, I mean I was -- when it happened I was still, you know, only seven miles from DC and, you know, knew plenty of people that -- a few people that had, you know, relatives that died and a few people -- a ton of people that -- I mean everybody at my school that's from the area basically has a parent that works for the Federal Government so everybody I knew was, you know, trying to call their parents and, you know --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- try and figure out where everybody was.  So, for -- for me it's sort of like --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, it's sort of like I look at it before and after because my outlook just on, you know, that -- you know, everything is not always -- you're going to be as peaceful as it was before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just sort of really -- you know, dramatically changed because --
R:  It is a -- it is an eye opener.
L:  Yeah.  I mean up until -- up until that point, you know, I would never -- I wouldn't think twice about, you know, flying for one or, you know -- I mean who would -- nobody would think that people would fly planes into, you know, buildings.  I mean I just --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- who -- who would have ever thought that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, but it just -- it just forces you to look at things differently now and, you know, I think -- I think in addition to being patriotic just to -- to like value, uh, you know, relationships you have with people and --
R:  Did it make you -- didn't it make you realize just how much those people hate us?
L:  What from other countries?
R:  Yeah, the terrorists, the ones that --
L:  Yeah but -- and I -- and I think the thing is like, I mean, for me it seems like that what -- what they hate us for is like, you know, our biggest strength, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like because we're free and that's what we value so much is what the other countries, you know, hate us for so it's like you -- you can hav- -- it's hard to like to have all the freedoms we have and not, you know, be targeted and, you know, it's sort of like -- seems like it's a price sometime for being as free as we are that other people are gonna wanna, you know, do stuff or whatever.
R:  But we welcome 'em to come here and be free with us.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I mean I'm sort of, uh, you know, obviously everything that happened was horrible but at the same time I sort of -- I sort of cringe when there's a lot of, you know, crack downs on civil liberties and, you know, just -- you know, it's like -- it's just a personal thing of how much you're willing to give up to feel safe, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean some people think, um, you know, something is going too far while, you know, others would rather, you know, have that and feel safer, you know, just like -- it's a tough line to cross as far as, you know, what they're doing with, you know, ashcroft and all that.  You know, well, is it really protecting us or is it making people more fearful?  It's -- it's, uh, it's tough, you know, to decide.
R:  Yeah, you know, you watch the polls and stuff on the Internet, it's pretty much split fifty fifty, you know.  The people that support the war and the people that didn't.
L:  Yeah, I mean, at -- at first I don't think I necessarily did but, like, once -- once it starts like you can't help but support it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I don't want, you know, soldiers to die and even though I may have been against, uh, the point of it in the beginning, you know, like I'm -- I'm gonna feel happy like when, you know, they win and, you know, they, uh -- I mean, it would be pointless not to once it's already started 'cause you can't really do anything about it.
R:  Right.  I was reading on the Internet today that the Iraqis are free now and they want us to leave.
L:  Really?
R:  They're -- they're afraid that there's going to be American occupation.  We're going to take over their country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think any Americans wanna live there, do we? [LAUGH]
L:  No, I mean, I don't -- I think, I think what they're saying is that, you know, they need some time to set something up but --
R:  Well, that's what they're already doing, they're already trying to get a little type of, uh, I don't know what you call it, government or whatever in place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For the people.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Look at -- they went and looted, you know, their store- -- that's where they live and they went and destroyed everything.
L:  Yeah, I mean it's, you know, it's -- it's tough to know what, you know, people in that situation are -- are thinking and doing, you know, 'cause --
R:  Yeah, freedom is probably -- it's -- it's a large cookie to, uh --
L:  I mean if you've never had it -- you know, I mean we take it for granted, we've always had it.  So, we don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go around looting everything, you know, every -- every second.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, to go from such a dramatic change, I mean, there's gonna be, you know, a period of, you know, adjustment, you know.  Whether it's looting or --
R:  Yeah, really [LAUGH].
L:  -- or something else, I don't know.  But, um --
R:  Craziness.
L:  I don't know but it's -- I mean as far as September eleven it just seems like -- I don't know it's -- it's -- even though we're, you know, we're so much more aware of it now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like just my personal view is that, you know, things can still happen and, you know, like it's hard to -- to totally -- to prevent everything.  You know, even after we had such a thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I don't know, like, you know, you just gotta be -- you know, you just gotta be there for your own self.  At least, I think, you know, mindful and, you know, I don't think live in fear but, you know, at the same time --
R:  Keep your eyes open.
L:  Yeah.  I mean if people are gonna wanna do stuff then, you know, they're gonna wanna do stuff but --
R:  Yeah, I think I've become more aware of people around me now when I'm out and about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I don't know why and I try not to look at other people, like, "What are they up too?" you know, I try not to be suspicious or anything like that but I do -- I do keep my eyes a lot more open than I used to.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, just like you can't really -- you know, after what happened you can't really, uh, uh, you know, go around just being oblivious.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean if you -- you know --
R:  And after it -- after it first happened that -- my first thought was, you know, I didn't really think much of it because I -- I thought, "Well, this isn't going to affect me" you know, "This is nothing".  And then after the -- couple of days afterwards that had past and I realized how many people had died --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then I was seeing people around me that had relatives and, you know, friends and stuff that lived in the area and then I really saw the devastation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I didn't really see if pers- ...
