R:  Hi, I'm Doreen.
L:  Hi, Doreen, I'm Sheila.  Can you hear me okay?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh good.  I put my headset on this time.  You're my third person tonight.
R:  Oh really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my first because I was -- I just walked in the door so that's cool.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.  I, um, I don't know about the other calls that I've had they always say, you know, that you have time for comment and I've just been cut off so I'm insur- -- I'm not sure that, uh, you know, that's been recorded properly or whatever.  Anyway --
R:  Is it the same topic usually?
L:  It's been the same topic the whole time, yeah.
R:  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess that means no [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Do you?
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  What kind of exercise do you do?  Maybe you can inspire me.
R:  I ride my bike to watch sunsets and I take walks and, um --
L:  Oh, well you must be in a nice, uh, uh, place where the climate is nice.
R:  Florida.
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH] yeah.  You're the second person I've talked to from Florida that I know of.  The -- the first person I talked to, um, uh, told me that he was in Florida so that's interesting.  I didn't ask -- I don't ever ask he volunteered the information.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm -- I'm in Canada.
R:  Oh, so it's --
L:  North -- north of Sue St. Marie.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's -- it's, um, you know, beautiful at some times but right now it's a little bit muddy, uh, there's -- and we still have snow on the ground.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's, uh, not real good but I really -- and it was funny because that they brought this topic up and I'm -- I'm thinking, "Oh boy, I'd better -- I'd better do some" -- so I'm fifty four --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I think, I'd better, you know, like not wait too much longer and get busy.
R:  Well, even if you just walk, um, or go to a place like, um, my dad lives in New York and he goes to, um, uh, a lake and walks around the lake and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just to, uh, to -- gotta get your heart going.
L:  Yeah, but I'm -- I'm in a popular -- well, you know, but then that's another thing I was telling someone.  I said, "You know, um, it's like, um, Madonna there.  She used to do all that cardio and then she just quit doing cardio and she started to do, um, uh, yoga" and -- and, uh, you know, she's still in great shape.  And I -- I said, "Well, you know, all you have to do is look at cats" because a cat really doesn't, you know, move around too fast all that often.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They do a lot of stretching.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, uh, you know, and that would be easy but it's just, uh, I don't know some -- get off my --
R:  It's good to go with a partner.
L:  Well, but, you see, my -- my -- where I live right now it's, um, a population of one.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's hard to find a partner [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well right now if you had -- it takes me -- I -- the next town over is like where there's people but -- and there's only a thousand people there, um, it's twenty miles and it takes me an hour.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  No, usually it's not that long but it's -- in the spring when there -- you've got snow running and pot holes and stuff, so it'll take an hour to get there.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, so, you know, you just -- you know, it's a little bit prohibitive like an hour there and an hour back and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and the time that you would spend and I have, uh, um, inherited, uh, two dogs and I have one of my own so [LAUGH]
R:  Do you walk the dogs?
L:  Yeah, well that -- that's for sure, yeah.  Uh, that's -- that's for sure. Once the -- for a little while I can walk the dogs soon but then it -- there comes a time when there's black flies here.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah and you know what black flies are?  Uh-huh
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And I wasn't born and raised here and it's really, um -- they -- they just -- they love and I -- I get really, um, a bad reaction to them.  So, I have to stay in when they're out and about.
R:  You need a stationary bike [LAUGH].
L:  Well, actually, you know, what I was thinking and I was looking to see maybe if somebody had, um, uh, had bought a, um, uh, treadmill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I -- I just didn't wanna pay that much for, uh --
R:  Does -- uh, we have like used newspapers and stuff, you know, where people sell their used things.
L:  Yeah.  But, again, there I have the same problem with having to go --
R:  To go get it.
L:  -- to find, you know, to find one in the -- in the city and then to be able to go and get it.  So, there's all kinds of challenges but there -- I mean, there's no excuse really.  I -- my son has --
R:  I was just going to say there's all kinds of excuses [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's all kinds of excuses but they're really not good ones.  Uh, the thing is is that my son has -- has, um -- has left.  He's not here now and he left his bowflex here.  So, I could be --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- doing that.  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Oh yeah.  They -- they -- it is cool.  I did use it for a little while at one point.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just really need to get back into it because I, um, the bowflex works on pretty well the same principle as the, um, as yoga in a lot of ways except that, uh -- you know, like --
R:  Because it's passive.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's because it's resistance training really.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  I don't have any equipment, I have a thigh master.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I use that [LAUGH] sometimes and then, um, and then I, um -- let's see what else do I do?  Oh, I have stairs in my home so I'm constantly running up and down the stairs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's -- that helps.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I ride my bike mostly and I watch sunsets so that's pretty cool.
L:  I think so.  That sounds -- that sounds -- well, are you, uh, out in the country more or ...?
R:  I'm by the west coast of, um, on the -- on the coast by the shoreline, by Tampa Bay area.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, so it's -- it's pretty cool and, uh, it's usually nice all the time.  Sometimes it gets blazingly hot and I'm near a little trail that they made here, um, which is, uh, I can get to town on my -- on the trail which is good, it's three miles.  So, if I have errands that are three miles or less I ride the bike.
L:  Ah!
R:  So, if I go to the post office or library or  --
L:  Yeah, where you don't have to carry a lot of things.
R:  Right, if I don't have to go grocery shopping, you know, um, but then -- then, um, then I try to ride my bike there.
L:  Oh, do you work out of home or ...?
R:  I -- I, um, am an independent contractor so I have varied hours, I have a lot of free time.
L:  You're a what?
R:  Independ- uh, I'm a self employed independent contractor.
L:  For?
R:  Uh, I just do like product demonstration and I sell magazines at trade shows and stuff so I do a lot of different things.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  So, I have a lot of free time to do that and plus, um, I save these Marlboro Milds and what I have -- I don't smoke so I have to go out and walk and find them on the street.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, in order to get all the free gifts I have to, uh, I have to get out there and hustle my butt to try to find 'em so ...
L:  Oh, it might -- it's probably getting a little harder now, eh?
R:  Um, well, actually, you would think that people would be like slowing down on smoking, ah, but they're not.  Uh, sometimes I find -- in the matter of just like walking around, I'll find like, um, seven to ten packs like just walking around in a half hour.  I can't -- I can't -- I couldn't even smoke this much, you know, if I wanted to.
L:  You know, it's amazing, why aren't they saving them to -- you know, if they're smoking that much, why aren't they saving them to get those gifts?
R:  I know.  I don't understand it.  
L:  No.
R:  And people save 'em for me.  And I say, um, "Why don't you save 'em yourselves?"  "It's too much trouble" I say, "But, yeah, but you're saving 'em for me so what difference does it make?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Well, needs will be.
R:  I know, at least they save 'em so -- so that's good.  But I -- you know, it's -- it's funny because I'm pretty much health conscious and, um, I have to swear I'm a smoker.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] and people are like, "You don't smoke" and I'm like, "I know, I just like the free stuff".
L:  Yeah, well for sure.  That's, uh, kind of a neat thing to do, I think.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty cool.  Now, that I'm on page saying that I'd swear that I'm a smoker and I'm not [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  I don't know I kinda wonder what their, uh -- if it's just to see  -- but, you know, anybody that -- I would think anybody had that response to this I've only had where it was kinda awkward one time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I think I was called two times before all of the calls that I've had tonight.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've only think I have -- you know, so people who are going to do this kind of thing are really the kind of people who -- you know, I don't know about you but I'm one of those people who, um, if -- if I'm in a bus station or wherever, if somebody's standing I'll start up a conversation.
R:  I'm pretty much like that too.
L:  Yeah.  So, I would think that most of the people that responded to this type of, uh, program, you know, would be that way too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I can't see anybody that doesn't like talking on the phone saying, "Oh yeah, okay, I'll do that".  
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  So, it -- it would --
R:  It's hard to talk about exercise for ten minutes.  It seems like, um, um --
L:  Well, I -- I -- I spent quite a bit of time talking to one -- one young girl that I was talking to was a, uh, jazz teacher.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Jazz dance teacher.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And -- yeah,  I thought so.  And, uh, so, um, and then I was having a conversation, I got cut off and I'm thinking, "Boy, that guy's probably wondering, um, what I -- I was gonna say next".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because he was having trouble with his back and I was telling him about, um, uh, Dr. Wallich[?], Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, and I think I'd just barely got Wallich's name out and we got cut off.
