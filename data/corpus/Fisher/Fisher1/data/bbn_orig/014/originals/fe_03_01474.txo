L:  Octavia Jones.
R:  Hi, this is Jane, I'm in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm sorry, what was your name?  Octavia?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  What part of the country are you in?
L:  Um, I'm in Princess Anne, Maryland.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, I just talked to someone in Arizona today too. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  As part of the study.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, you're fairly close to the September eleventh issues then, weren't you?
L:  Yes, actually.  I had friends that worked in the Pentagon.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sure that -- 
L:  But luckily --
R:  [NOISE] Go ahead.
L:  -- they were on the other side of the building, thank God.
R:  Oh, well that's good. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So you didn't know someone personally who, um, passed away with the September eleventh issue?
L:  No.  No, thank goodness.  I was scared for the longest time because, um, my boss actually goes over to the Pentagon on a regular basis.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she called in sick but, you know, in all the confusion her message got lost and everybody was like, "Oh my goodness, she's at the Pentagon!  Oh my gosh!"
R:  I bet you that's brought you all closer together as a work team, huh?
L:  It really did.  We were, "Oh my goodness!"  Everybody was so scared.  We couldn't [SIGH] it -- it --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- scared us all, it just, "Oh my goodness, she's so nice, she was so close to everyone".  She's retired now, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, she's probably glad she's retired now! [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, [several inaudible words].  So --
R:  Well, being so close to that, have you made any changes, um, to your life or your lifestyle after all of the September eleventh issues?
L:  [MN] I've noticed that personally I'm a lot nicer to everybody I meet.  Uh, 'cause, oh my goodness, I mean, I work on Boeing Air Force base.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which is a military institution.
R:  Right.
L:  A [inaudible] military institution.  So, of course, the base -- there's a heightened security at the base, you have to have ID for everything, you can't bring on guests.  So I stopped even expecting to take guests with me to go shopping on base or anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, but, shoot.
R:  I think as a whole it's brought our country a whole lot closer together.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, i- the patriotism just amazes me.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And -- and we truly should be [SIGH] rallying for our patriotism --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, because our freedom has been threatened --
L:  Definitely has.
R:  -- and, um, I mean, I'm not for war but, you know, I'm all for going into Iraq and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- making sure these guys don't hurt people again.  H- --
L:  Yes, Operation Iraqi Freedom, I support it.  I really do.
R:  Well, I have a, um, I guess I have a difficult time with the people that are protesting war.  I understand, because I am no- -- I don't think anybody's for war.
L:  No.
R:  But, was there any other way to handle these people? [LAUGH]
L:  No, there really wasn't.
R:  Um --
L:  And I know personally people that are over there, I know them personally, and I'm like, "I can't believe you're over there fighting a war, but, oh my goodness!"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I [inaudible].
R:  And -- and I guess that's why I have a hard time with the people that are protesting it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Granted, it's their freedom but it's our -- it's the freedom that we're fighting for.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] You know?  It's your freedom to speak that we are fighting for.
L:  Yes.
R:  And ... um --
L:  The people over in Iraq, they don't have that right now.  They can't say what's on their minds --
R:  No.
L:  -- when they wanna say it.  [several inaudible words] protest --
R:  And they deserve to be just as free as everybody else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I don't think personally we've made too may changes in our lifestyle either, um --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I did, uh, boycott [MN] -- I -- I mean, I didn't actually boycott, I just didn't go to the stations where I knew that they were being supplied by Iraqi oil.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  The gas stations.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I tried to avoid that.  And, um, you know, we did stockpile a few supplies in case of emergency.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, because we're in Colorado Springs we have NORAD here, which is the, um, satellite tracking system --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for the northern hemisphere.  So, um, we could be a likely target, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  If something were to happen.  And we have also the Air Force Academy [NOISE] here --
L:  Yes, [inaudible].
R:  -- in Fort Carson.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So, we've got a lot of military and it has affected a lot of people personally, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Well, yes, it has.
R:  So, um --
L:  I think personally we shouldn't have -- or we should try not to make as many changes to our daily lives.  It's what the terrorists are after, trying to make us scared and fear going out into the streets.  So, I'm trying to not give them what they want.
R:  Well, exactly.  But, y- are you more aware of your surroundings?
L:  Yes, I am.  And, shoot, I've -- I think twice about wonder -- whether I wanna just drive somewhere, if it's going cross country, or if I'm gonna take a plane, I -- I'm kinda cautious on that area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not sure whether I'm actually up to that because I was invited to go to Houston, Texas, um, like three weeks ago and I was like, um, no, I'm not really up on flying right now.
R:  Well -- well, I can understand that.  Um, we -- we flew at Christmas and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it didn't bother me.  I figure, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.  Um --
L:  And you can't do much about it.
R:  No, there's nothing you can do about it because you could be anywhere with anybody [NOISE] doing anything and -- and something could happen, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The terrorists are ... they're evil and they don't care.
L:  They [several inaudible words].
R:  They have no regard for human life.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  You know, look how they put the children in the front line over there.
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible].
R:  And, that's a sick thing! [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] because where I'm stationed at, we're right in the middle of -- of a bunch of military things, I mean, we have Andrews Air Force Base --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- well, that's about fifteen minutes from my house.  That's where they keep Air Force One and the President goes there on a regular basis.
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, and then Bowling Air Force Base, which is in DC, which is where they keep the President's helicopter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, if they wanna make sure he's not going anywhere, they're gonna get those two places that are about fifteen minutes from my house.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  So, you -- have you stockpiled any supplies, like water -- extra water and things like that, just in case?
L:  Well, my family's always been -- they go and buying in bulk, so we had it.  But I think we went out and bought a little bit more since then.  Just to be on the safe side.
R:  Yeah, we did too.  I mean, I'm always made sure there's plenty of food around but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, as far as keeping bottled water, um --
L:  Yeah, we [inaudible].
R:  -- we've never done that because our drinking water is safe here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, we've always just, you know, used our city water.  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I did stockpile some extra water just in case, 'cause that would be a good source too.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Um ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  We bought flashlights and candles.  Uh, I went on a candle shopping spree for some reason, I -- after September eleventh I think subconsciously I was like, "what if something happens?  Candles, flashlights, just be sure".
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So, it's real populated around you then?
L:  Yes.
R:  Where you live?
L:  Yes, I'm about twenty minutes from DC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's everywhere, you can just ... uh, feel it.  I mean -- and every day on the news, I mean, I'm not sure how it is in, um, other parts of the country right now but for the longest time, the past five years that I've been living in Maryland, I'm -- since I'm so close to DC, we hear all about the politics.  It's on the news all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's politics, what bill they just passed, what, you know.  And now it's -- it's even worse, you're -- you hear nothing but politics and what decisions have been made.  It's --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  You're aware of everything that's happening, the media's making sure you're aware of that.
R:  Certainly.  The -- how -- how do you commute to work?  Do you just drive or do you take a --
L:  Um, yeah, drive.
R:  Okay.
L:  Car.  Because I need my little freedom to go on base for can- -- for, um, lunch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because the selection is kinda limited.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, yeah.  But I might start taking the metro to try and help with the little const- conservation of gas and everything. [NOISE]
R:  Well, yes, and, you know ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I- I'm -- I think there are, you know, the -- the oil industry has certainly put a -- a stop to making our cars more efficient and so forth and I think they can be a -- they have the technology to make 'em a lot more efficient.
L:  [MN]
R:  But then it would, um, suppress the oil industry and -- and then what would they do?  You know, you do one thing and it affects the other.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Kinda stuck.
R:  But we try not to drive as much as usual.  And like I say, we did, you know, avoid the stations that we know purchased --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- Iraqi oil, um, on a regular basis --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and in great volumes.  Um, and I do have to say I don't believe that we've driven a lot less than we did before because of the gas prices either, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, other than that we really haven't made any changes.  So ...
L:  Mm.  Well, I've noticed people around where I go to school, they're -- they seem to be scared of -- of the Indian people that are, um, at our school that are going to school.  And I'm like, well, you can't do that, you can't base an entire, you know, belief system on what a few people did.  You can't do it.  And I -- I find myself defending people that I don't even know, like, you know, "She's not part of it, he's not part of it, just --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- leave 'em alone, let 'em go to class.  They're trying to get their education so they can make something of themselves".
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  You know.  And, uh, granted they have a lot of foreign students over here.  How do you know what the reason is that they're coming over here, you know?
L:  Well, yes.
R:  And that was part of the problem too, we were letting everybody and anybody into the country
