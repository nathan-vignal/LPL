R:  Hi, my name is Jeanette.  Who --
L:  Hi, Jeanette.
R:  -- am I talking to?
L:  Hi, Jeanette.  My name is Nancy.
R:  Nancy?  Hi.  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in Connecticut.
R:  Okay, I'm calling from, uh, Brooklyn, Minnesota.  It's a pleasure to discuss this with you.  Would you like to start, or shall I go first?
L:  Oh, why don't you go first?
R:  Okay.  Um, this is my second call with Fisher.  I just had one just a couple of minutes ago and the topic apparently is the same.  We're supposed to discuss any personal, significant changes we have gone through since nine one one.  And, to be honest with you, I don't think our family has really undergone any dramatic changes, other than perhaps being more kind and gracious to friends, families and strangers as a result of -- of the tragedy that happened.  Um, I -- I -- I don't think our travel plans have been curtailed, um, I know we have found ourselves giving more of ourselves, to charities, and volunteering help, uh, more so than -- than before.  Even though we were involved in it quite a bit, uh, before nine one one, but it just seems to take on a -- an added sense of, um, urgency and realism, I think, for us.  But, uh, we haven't really undergone anything else significant.  Have you?
L:  Um, not -- not per se.  Um, we -- we did have some travel plan changes immediately after the fact.  Um, we were scheduled to fly to my husband's, um, family for Christmas, and I just didn't want to travel on Christmas Day.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I was a little bit [LAUGH] --
R:  I don't blame you.
L:  I was a little -- I was a little paranoid and -- and there were some sparks there, because he wasn't quite as paranoid as I was.  [LAUGH].  But, um --
R:  Did you -- did you travel after that, then?
L:  Uh, I have not yet traveled by air. 
R:  Okay.
L:  But just because the opportunity has not -- has not, uh, arisen.  Um, but -- but my --
R:  I haven't, either.
L:  -- husband has traveled quite a bit.
R:  Yeah, mine has, too.  He was -- he was, I think, reluctant for that first flight.  It was always kind of forefront in his mind, what if something happened?  What if?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What if? What if?  But he said as soon as he entered the airport and saw all the security measures that were in place and, um, they -- they could easily spot the marshalls that were flying on the planes with them, he said all the -- the fears just dissipated and he just went about his business as normal and -- and uh, and he has to travel for his job, so he had no choice, really.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But -- 
L:  Yeah, we did not, um -- you know, we haven't -- as a family, we haven't traveled.  We -- we have done, you know, day trips and car trips, but we have not traveled by -- by air, so that has not been a problem.  Um, I -- I have to say that when we were, um, and it -- and I'm not sure if it was nine one one that presented this issue, or the beginning of the war recently, but we were scheduled to go to New York City the weekend that -- the weekend after the war actually started.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that presented some issues for me as well.  [LAUGH].
R:  Was it the -- the security issue?
L:  Well, it -- I just --
R:  Or just -- 
L:  -- was -- I was just --
R:  Unsettled?
L:  Yeah.  I was very unsettled about being there and -- and using the public transportation and originally going into it, I was, and then I found myself, once I was there, saying, well, I -- I just didn't feel the same way.  I thought I was going to be more paranoid when I was in the city, and it just -- it just dissipated as soon as I started to use the subway and -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, bu- --
R:  You know, I think for us, I think that when you think of the sheer number of Americans, you know, that -- that I think that we have safety in numbers.  Um, when you think of that these terrorists acts, if they are going to occur, they're actually going to be very small pockets.
L:  Correct.
R:  I mean, it -- it -- it was a horrible, horrible thing that happened in New York, and -- and my God, we lost, you know, three thousand people, just like that, but when you think of how many people there are in America, it just -- I think the odds of something actually happening to an individual would be staggering.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, and -- and I think, for somehow that -- for some reason, I think that I find that calming, and maybe it's just [LAUGH] maybe I'm just not looking at it like other people do, but I just -- I refuse to give in to the, um, the terrorists, you know, by allowing fear to rule our lives.  If anything, it's just made me just all the more cognizant of -- of how precious life is and live you life to the fullest.
L:  Yes.
R:  Each and every day, but do you have, um, school age children?  Have you noticed any changes in the -- in the schools' safety and security since this happened?
L:  Uh, I have not, uh, and I do have sch- I have three school age children.  I have not noticed any significant -- I mean, immediately following nine eleven, yes, um, you know, they were very security conscious, um, now the only change really in our school -- we -- we're in a little suburban, little ur- you know, very suburban --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- area, so it's not, um, a city or anything, and I think we're very complacent, feeling that we're safe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we have visitor badges that we have to go in and sign in on and we're supposed to wear them throughout the school, which is new.  Other than --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- that, there have been --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no changes.
R:  Well, got the same thing, where they lock all the doors, uh, from the outside.  Apparently you can leave from the inside, but from the outside, all the doors have been locked except for the one main entrance, and you have to go right into the office to register.
L:  Right.
R:  And sign in because before, people would just come in and go out as -- as they pleased, and you know, it could of been anybody.  But, um, I -- I know that they have put -- we -- we -- our children are -- are grown and out of the house now, but I -- I've read that they've got, um -- they were talking about installing metal detectors, but I don't think they went through with that.  But we live out in a -- a farming community and, God knows [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, who's going to do that, but then again, no place is safe any more, it seems.  
L:  I know.  It's just, like I said, it -- it was easy, and I guess that's why I was uncomfortable with New York City.  I would have felt no fear at all, being in my own home town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but feeling like, if I was -- because who -- who's going to want anybody, you know, who's going to want to do anything to the town I'm from?  You know?
R:  And yet, that -- you know, that could be one of the very reasons why they would, for all you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Like I mean, we live, uh, within a twenty five mile radius of a nuclear power plant and they definitely increased the security after nine one one because of fears of attacks on that.  Um, they used to even have tours, where you could go in, and -- and they would happily show you the -- the facility, if you signed up in advance, and all tours that were cancelled, which is a shame for school kids.
L:  Right.
R:  And like out here, I know with the farmers, I read in our -- our local newspaper that, um, the farmers are having to increase security because that's one thing you never think about.  I mean, there's about three hundred acres of farmland and the farmers are usually -- one guy is out in the field and everybody else is at work in town.  Who watches their crops?  You know, and -- and anybody could come in and, um, do bioterrorist acts on their -- on their, uh, feed and on their cattle, you know?  And -- and what a horrible way to -- to harm the US, is to their food supply.
L:  Exactly.  Wow.  See, I hadn't even --
R:  But yet, I don't see --
L:  -- given any thought to that.
R:  I know.  A lot of people haven't, and uh, it kind of alarmed me at first when I read about it in the paper, but what can you do?  I mean, who's going to sit there and watch their farm twenty four hours a day?  [MN].   But you just never know.  That's just it.  You know?  You just -- you just never know, but I guess I just have faith, that, uh, if my time is up, my time is up.  You know?  And -- and uh, all -- all we can do is -- is try to cooperate as much as we can, you know, with, uh, authorities, but [MN] and just pray that nothing happens.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, it -- it's strange.
L:  It, um, it amazed me that my children were not as -- were not affected emotionally, just because it was --
R:  You know, that's why as --
L:  -- close to home and --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, it was almost as if they wanted nothing to do with it.  They didn't want to know anything about it.  It was, like, too much for them to handle.  They could see that mom was having a tough time handling it, and they didn't -- they didn't even want to go there.  It was very -- it was very odd, and they have, you know, um, we have gone to Ground Zero and, you know, they have seen it, but they didn't see it before.  You know?  They don't know the magnitude of it because they're children.  Um --
R:  What are the ages of your children?
L:  Uh, I have ten, eight and seven.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um --
R:  Very impressionable ages.
L:  But my, um, my son drew a picture, um, in the fall.  They had a -- they had a contest -- not a contest, but they were supposed to draw a picture about nine eleven and he did, and -- and um, his was firefighters going into the buildings and so I guess he did get a little bit out of it, when we went to New York over the summer and, you know, he saw Ground Zero and he saw the rest of New York and just about everywhere you turned, there was a tribute to the World Trade Center.
R:  Certainly.
L:  And so I guess he --
