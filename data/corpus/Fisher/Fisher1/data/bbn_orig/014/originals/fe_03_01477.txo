R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm -- my name is Grace.
L:  Grace.  My name is Dave.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you today?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this the first time you've played this game?
R:  Um, I think I had one other call, u- y- j- just one other, like, about a month ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  I had two of 'em yesterday on the same subject.
R:  Oh my gosh, they're all over you!
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, September eleventh, right, that's the topic?
L:  Yeah, and how --
R:  W- --
L:  -- we've changed our lives.
R:  What was your topic yesterday, for twice?
L:  Uh, censorship in s- uh, on books in schools.
R:  Oh wow.  Okay, that was a -- oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, changes after September eleventh.
L:  Yeah, I know, I guess I'm kinda ... different.  I- i- it didn't change my -- we live over on the west coast --
R:  Oh, so do we.
L:  I- --
R:  Where are you?
L:  Oregon.
R:  Oregon?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm in San Diego.
L:  San Diego?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, okay, well, I got some relatives down that way.
R:  Oh!
L:  Um, so I mean, it really didn't, you know, I mean it was sad and everything but it really didn't affect me that much here.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, you know, we live in a small community, we got no skyscrapers --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- nobody's gonna run into 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know.
R:  Oh -- are you near, what, Portland, or ...?
L:  Well, we're about a hundred miles or so south, uh, east of Portland.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  So a smaller area, no?
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  Like you --
L:  Little town of about seven thousand people.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Um, you know, it's -- not much happens around here, speeding tickets is a biggie!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So did anything, I guess -- I mean, um, you know, uh, the way you live your life or anything change, based on it?
L:  No.  Um, really not.  Uh, like I say, I -- I'm retired so, you know, it didn't affect my work or people that I dealt with at work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it didn't change the way I, you know, if I wanted to go somewhere I still went, I didn't worry about, you know, uh, being hijacked or, you know.  I didn't fly anywhere, you know, and I -- I haven't flown anywhere since then.  But --
R:  Did you fly before?
L:  Well, occasionally, but we don't fly, we usually drive.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ... but if I wanted to fly it wouldn't have changed my thinking on it.
R:  Yeah.  No.
L:  Um ...
R:  No, I -- I mean, I just ... I mean, I love to fly, I love to travel, so when nine eleven happened I was ju- I mean, it wasn't -- it was scary i- and I do actually have friends who live in New York, so -- and they were pretty close and actually live, you know, worked in the building --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but they weren't harmed.  Um, but, I mean, I was, uh, not to -- not to be a [MN] capitalist pig but, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the airfares plummeted, you know, and I was like, flying everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I kinda took advantage of --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- of the --
L:  We- --
R:  -- situation a little bit.
L:  Well, that's kinda how I felt, you know.  If -- if I were going to fly somewhere, uh, that would've been a good time to do it.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah!
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  And now being the other good time! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right! [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Wow, nobody wants to go to Asia --"
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and nobody wants to go to Eng- -- Europe!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- Now's the time to go!"
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  I don't know if I wanna go to Asia or not though. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, with the SARS.
L:  That -- that one can get you one way or the other.
R:  Yeah, I mean, th- they're saying it's not as contagious as, you know, once they thought.
L:  Well, I don't know.  I'm sure you've seen some of the news clips where they -- people over there are walking around with face mask on.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Now, if that doesn't tell me that, uh, you know, you don't wanna be walking around there.
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]  Huh huh huh.
L:  So ...
R:  But, I mean, as far as how it changed my life, I guess I just realized that ... I don't know, I -- I got the feeling that, you know, I mean, I -- I felt a lot for the people who were in the World Trade Center and who were young and just starting their lives and, you know, probably didn't have their w- -- their estate plans in place and, you know, left behind mothers and children who probably didn't have, you know.  I don't know, it just made you feel like you'd better get your stuff together because things could happen like that, that are so unexpected.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that and also, you know, it, uh, I think the one thing that I, you know, gave some thought to was the fact that, uh, we're not as invulnerable as we think we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, they can get to us.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I mean, gosh, I mean, I- I- I just remember when I saw it 'cause I -- I just, um, I woke up and I remember walking into the living room and the television was on and I was like, "Is this a movie or something?"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I thought it was a movie, you know?  And I was like, "This is not for real.  Uh, this is --" I was ju- -- I couldn't believe it was for real, for the long- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, for a couple of minutes there.
L:  Yeah.  That was a --
R:  But, yeah, I mean, then I just think, "Gosh, you know, w- what kind of people think of that?  And --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and think that that's okay?"
L:  Yeah.  See, I didn't know anyone.  I don't know, I -- I think I have a cousin that lives somewhere up around New -- New York area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but other than that I don't really know anyone in New York.
R:  Have you been there a couple of times or ...?
L:  I was through there probably thirty five years ago.  Uh, was up there ... in -- well, it'd probably be more than that.  Uh, man, it was a long time ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, it wasn't anything like it is now.  Uh, and like I say, I, you know, I don't know anybody there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But where you -- you knew people that, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- worked in the building and like that.
R:  Mm, worked there --
L:  That puts you a little closer to the situation.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, it's kinda, oh [SIGH]. [LAUGH]  I -- and I lived in New York for a little while and I had, you know, I'd bee- -- I visit, not -- not like, every year but probably every other year.  I went to school out on the east coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, it's -- a- and, you know, last time we went to New York was not last Easter -- well, it was like, two Easters before September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I remember we went up to the World Trade Center at the top, th- the bar at the top, you know.  We were just looking out and, you know, hanging out.  And I'm just like, wow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's gone.
L:  Could've been that day too, just as easy.
R:  Well, actually, when I was in college I was in a subway when the World Trade Center was bombed.  Remember that, the bombing?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I was in the subway below the [LAUGH] World Trade Center when that happened!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, you know, obviously it didn't collapse at that point but it was pretty scary.  I was like, "Was that an earthquake?" you know! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, or not.  It's still scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was in, uh, Taiwan, one year and ... up on the top floor of one of their high rises and, uh, they had an earthquake.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, their building structures are -- they don't have the, uh, restrictions and rules that we do for earthquakes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that's probably the scariest thing I've ever been in.  Um, 'cause those buildings could've collapsed just as easy as a card house.
R:  Wow.  How b- -- how big of an earthquake?
L:  Oh, it was probably a six point something, I -- I can't remember for sure, but it was somewhere right in there.
R:  Wow.
L:  Enough that it shook the -- it shook the building.  I was up on, uh, near the top of the -- next to the top floor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, the, uh, merchandise I was looking at, they had on their, you know, little glass counter shelves, and like that it was just rattling all over the place, falling on the ground and ...
R:  Wow! [LAUGH]
L:  But, it's scary, [SIGH] you know, any of that type of thing that ... and I say this nine one -- nine eleven, uh ... I've never been in that building so -- but, you know, I've seen enough pictures of it on the TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, uh, I know I wouldn't wanna be up there when that when on.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, and then the -- the planes, you know, I mean, United and -- and American, I mean, they're such -- or w- w- was it a Un- American, the other f- -- the other plane or -- or both United?
L:  I can't -- I don't remember if they're ...
R:  I know one was United --
L:  Yeah, one was --
R:  -- 'cause I remem- --
L:  Yeah, one was, yeah.
R:  I mean, I fly United all the time, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that freaked me out.  And then to think, you know, here you are, you know, getting on a plane and then some terrorist gets on, and you just realize how lax our security system is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or was.  I guess they're -- I still think it's -- I don't know, I mean, last year I, uh, part of -- I guess part of the thing that I did was I just decided it was time to start seeing the world right away.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I like, traveled to like, seven countries last year --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just for fun.  And, I was amazed at like, how stringent security is like, in London and in Denmark and, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they're tight and they -- they check you three times before you even get on the plane.
L:  Why not?  Uh, and we didn't!
R:  No!  [LAUGH] Obviously.
L:  Huh.  Well, even, you know, um ... I mean, you know, years this has been going on.  I mean, you could bring anything just about you wanted to, there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, especially carry on, they're just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Whatever you --" you know, "Don't pack this or --" you could bring presents through, wrapped boxes, you could bring --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, all the sharp things you wanted! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, this isn't really good.  Well, I mean, forget about terrorists, what about some psycho person who just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- gets mad at somebody and starts to ha- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, wants to harm them on a plane?
L:  Yeah, that's -- it's scary, you know, and like I say, we're starting to pay a little bit more attention.  I think we've still got a ways to go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, we're getting
