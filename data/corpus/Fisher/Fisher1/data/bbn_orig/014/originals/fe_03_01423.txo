L:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
L:  Um, we really haven't made ma- any changes in our life since the terrorist attack but [LAUGH] I think due to the economy I did lose my job so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that -- you know, the -- our changes have been due to that not to -- you know, directly to the terrorist attack.
R:  I think for me I haven't traveled as much as I would want to because of, um, all the security's kinda skeptical to me and I'm just not sure if it's safe still.
L:  Yeah, we're -- we're mostly car travelers so that, you know, the air -- flying issue never really comes up.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Do you live in a big city?
R:  I live in San Francisco.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We live in a little tiny rural area outside of Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, close to where one of the jets went down [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  That's kinda scary, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I think -- I don't know, I don't think it's very safe out there so- still [LAUGH] sometimes.
L:  Well, I -- see I -- I feel, you know, it's -- I think it's -- I'm more likely to be in a car accident that to, uh, have a terrorist attack, you know, touch me personally.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it depends, you know, like where you live too because I have to cross a bridge every day to go to work and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's just kinda of -- you know, with all the -- with all that's going on in the world you never know.  It's -- it's kinda paranoiding but, oh well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I have some friends that live in -- right in Manhattan and they just go about their life that, you know, they say that yeah, we go by the hole on our way to work but, you know, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess it just becomes part of the scenery.  Maybe they get, um, immune to it.
R:  Yeah.  You have to move on and, you know, still enjoy your life.
L:  Yeah.  But, yeah, I think that -- so the major changes that we've made are due, you know, due to economic conditions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, our travel is, you know, in my automobile has stayed the same.
R:  Yeah.  So -- so you lost your job because of it or ...?
L:  Well, I think that because, um, the economy just took a downturn --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- shortly after and, you know, the board of directors says, "Oh, we have keep our dividends up, let's see how we can, you know, cut costs".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they just, you know, started laying people off and then the industry that I worked in was a lot of -- um, new construction was involved --
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, housing starts went down at the time.  I think they've come back up but they just 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, once they make the cuts that they think, "Oh, we can live this way and make more money". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.  And, I think, also with the job situation, um, a lot of my friends who just finished college, you know, it's very difficult to find a job in the economy right now.  Or --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- just for the past three years or so, you know, it's just been really bad and hard trying to find a new job or a job at all [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it -- uh, that's what everybody says, you know, because I go to the, um, unemployment office and it's like, "Well, you know, the, uh, labor's been down" you know.  All kinds of industries are suffering and probably they'll never, you know, really jump back up for, you know, a couple more years.
R:  Mhm.  So --
L:  We have to keep talking for ten minutes.
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah, one other time and it was easy because it was, like, baseball.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So [LAUGH] -- and I don't know if we get punished because we don't say on topic [LAUGH].
R:  Do they -- do they, um, record us?
L:  I don't know what the purpose of th- -- it is.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Because it's supposed to be the linguistics study so maybe they're checking to see how accents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something, you know, 'cause -- 'cause here I am all the way near Pittsburgh and you're out there.  So, maybe they're --
R:  Yeah.  Hm.
L:  Hm.
R:  I've never done this [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] this is my second one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But --
R:  Hm.
L:  Hm [LAUGH] we've got to keep talking [LAUGH].  Um --
R:  Um --
L:  So, how's the -- [LAUGH]
R:  Um, let me think.
L:  So, do you think that there'll be more terrorism because of like now that the government -- our government's mad at Syria too, you're already -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hear of things going on in the rock and now they're telling Syria to behave themselves.  Do you think that will cause more?
R:  I think there is always the potential these days and you never know if it's going to happen or not.  I even thought like, you know, 'cause of during the war times like something could happen, you know.  But I think they're very smart if they were to, you know, plan something it would be out of the blue, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I can't -- you know, we don't wanna live on like that just got to move on with life and, yeah, you know.  You know, I don't want to live in fear and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, that's how I think that, you know, that I don't get in my car everyday and think, "Oh, I hope I don't have an accident".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I can't, you know, go about days thinking, "Oh, I hope that, you know, they don't drive a car bomb into the Kmart while I'm shopping or --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know -- and it just -- I guess I just don't think about it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, me too.
L:  [NOISE] And it's -- mm, that's kinda sad to think, "Jeeze something so horrendous happened and here we already are, you know ..."  But I guess that's human nature to --
R:  Yeah.  You don't wanna dwel- [MN] dwell on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it's just gonna -- it's not going to make you happy or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mm [LAUGH] It -- they should have topics like cookies [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah, I could talk about that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, for hours [LAUGH] at a time.  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] So, where you're from it's not -- I mean it's just a little suburb?
L:  It's more rural.  There's actually like, two miles away there's dairy farms that have cows --
R:  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and things like that so it's really rural.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's not just, you know, small town it's small town rural. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But there is a, um, branch of the state university system --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- here in the town so that's -- I guess that's why they put it here is to, you know, that's the only kind of, you know, economic help it could give, you know, a hundred ago was to found one of the colleges here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And ther- there are a lot of international people but we -- you know, it's not like they're holding all our mail hostage to see if it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  Do you think, um, because of where you live it wouldn't be, you know, it wouldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be so scary anyways?
L:  Yeah, I think so because it's -- the wh- -- it's like out there is the whole rest of the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even, you know, to just hop in the car and go the half an hour to Pittsburgh, it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's, you know, it's like a trip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe a road trip.
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
R:  I think because, you know, because I live in a city and it's, you know, well known it's just kind of -- it's kind of scary sometimes you never know 'cause, you know, everybody knows where San Francisco is, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  And that it's actually -- it a tourist place, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that all kinds of new and different people are there all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In my town, we know if there's somebody new or different [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With all the college students you just -- everybody kind of gets used to seeing each other.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  That's kinda nice. [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- it's a, as they say, "A fine place to raise a small child" but then when they get to be teenagers they're always on the road to Pittsburgh --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah.
L:  -- 'cause, you know, there's no --
R:  Find something to do.
L:  Yeah, there's nothing to do here so --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, this is a long ten minutes [LAUGH].
R:  Are they usually ten minutes long?
L:  Uh, the last one wasn't.  It was like we couldn't talk enough about baseball [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh.  I hear your --
L:  Go-
R:  -- wind chimes in the background or something.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, that's what it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just a little breezy today.
R:  Is it cold over there?
L:  It -- it was nice yesterday but it -- like the wind kicked up last night and it like blew cold air and now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- even the breeze is nippy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wish it would just --  like it's supposed to be sixty, it should stay that way all of April or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, now it'll be like twenty degrees tonight and --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- the tulips are already blooming --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and they're probably get killed.
R:  Oh no! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] if it's, you know, a hard enough frost.
R:  Mhm. [MN] Okay. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we can't hang up until they tell us to or we wouldn't be compensated [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and we want that, huh?
L:  I know [LAUGH] if I wanted to call stra- -- talk to strangers for free I'd just dial random numbers [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, basically, what happened is that we called at the same time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's why --
L:  Well, yeah, they -- 'cause I guess if someone calls up they immediately call who- -- and whoever picks up, you know, their phone dialers start working and whoever picks up the pho-
