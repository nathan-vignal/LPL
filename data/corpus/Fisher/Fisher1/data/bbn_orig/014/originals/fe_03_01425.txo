L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doing good, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer too.
R:  Oh my gosh! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And where do you live?
L:  I live in Colorado.
R:  And I live in Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  The windy city.
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, I think I've had this topic before but I'm not really sure.  I think I had a September eleventh topic before, have you?
L:  No, uh-uh, actually this is only my second call so --
R:  Oh, is it?  Yeah, it's only my second too but I think -- I think the last time when I -- way back when they first started doing this, that was my topic, September eleven.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, what changes have you made?
L:  Um, well, I have, um, spent more time with my family and let my family know how much I appreciate them.
R:  Oh yeah, that's -- I think that's -- same with me I -- when September eleventh happened I had -- my son wasn't even a year old yet and it was like, "Wow!"  You know, you step back and you think, "Gosh, things change".  It was amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I reme- -- even air travel for me changed.  I -- I haven't been on a plane since.
L:  Oh really?
R:  No.  I --
L:  See I don't think I would be afraid to fly, um --
R:  Well, my husband works for United Airlines too so  [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh wow!
R:  -- and I haven't been on a plane since [LAUGH] which has been weird.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  And you haven't been afraid to fly?
L:  Um, no, I haven't flown since then -- I haven't had the opportunity to but I'm hoping this summer --
R:  Yeah, well that's us too.
L:  -- um, to go on vacation and I -- I think I'll fly so --
R:  Yeah, that's us too.  I think we're going to go on vacation this year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, yeah, it -- it -- it opens your eyes and I tell you when, uh, it happened I freaked out.  I was one of those people that had like massive anxieties.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They put me on medication for it and --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- it was -- it was freaky time.  It took me two years to get up.  I went from -- I probably drop- -- lost twenty five pounds.
L:  Wow.
R:  From September eleventh until I got help in November.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I was down like twenty five pounds and aff- -- that's how it affected me --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- 'cause I was just freaked out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't know.  You know, it's like everybody else but I was freaking out more because I had a son, I was home by myself that night --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My husband worked nights then.  And so it freaked me out.
L:  Yeah.
R:   So -- but, um, I don't think I've changed anything dra- dra- dramatically besides my air travel.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know and besides, you know, being closer to my family when they -- when they raised the orange I did the whole bottled water thing and I did the -- the masking tape -- did you do that?
L:  No, I didn't, no.
R:  I did.  That's how freaked I was.   I was like, okay, I'll get all the stuff just in case anything happens I have it in my home.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I, you know, filled water bottles and threw 'em in my refrigerator downstairs so --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I filled up some water bottles but, um, we usually try to keep a lot of water bottles, um, because we have a water purifier and so instead of turning it on all the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we just fill up a bunch of water bottles and I just filled up a couple of extra and --
R:  Oh cool.
L:  -- stuck 'em in my spare, uh, bathroom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, just -- you know, but not -- nothing that would be like life changing if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something happened, you know.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  But --
R:  And that was all I did.  I don't think anything -- I didn't do anything out of the ordinary after that.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah.  No, I, uh, I'm a single mom and -- how old is your baby?
R:  He's gonna be three this year.
L:  Oh wow.  Mine -- mine just is going to be turning two on the first.
R:  Oh, so you were pregnant when it happened, were you?
L:  No, I just had him.
R:  Oh, you just had him.
L:  Um, yeah, he was like, um, three or four months [NOISE] old.
R:  Oh god.  So, how did you handle it?
L:  Um --
R:  Were you like freaking out?
L:  I listened -- no, I really didn't freak out, um, I just started praying [NOISE] and, uh, asking God to just take control and -- and, you know, to protect everybody.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I just I prayed a lot and I just -- you know, there's nothing I could do really and I listened to the radio, I don't have  a TV so, um, I just listened to the radio a lot. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I was at work -- well, it was right before work my dad called me and told me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I listened to the radio and I -- on the way to work I listened to the radio and then when we go there, uh, people were crying and I was like, "Oh, don't cry!"  [LAUGH] It was like, um, I hadn't cried and, you know, I just -- I felt bad for everybody but, um --
R:  You didn't worry about it.  Well, you will -- I don't know if you live in a big town in Colorado, you see I live in Chicago.  I live where the Sears Tower is, I live where the John Hancock is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And everybody kept on saying a plane is coming into Chicago now!  
L:  Wow.
R:  And so, I mean, I could see the top of all that stop and I was like -- lit -- you could -- I could literally see him so I'm not that far away from downtown.  So, for me, it was more 'cause of where I lived that I freaked out more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I don't know if --
L:  Yeah, and that's understandable.
R:  --  if it wouldn't have been -- yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that's why it was more for me because that's what everybody worries about, those big buildings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and Chicago's one of the -- one of -- is a large city --.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  You see, we don't have -- we have one skyscraper here and it's not even that tall [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.  'Cause I'm in -- I'm in Fort Collins so -- but thirty minutes away from me, um, there's, uh, a air force base --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um, we're just like totally surrounded by military [LAUGH] so, you know --
R:  So, you shouldn't have to worry about it --
L:  -- right down to -- no, uh-uh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And right down the street the army reserve is --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- it's right down the street.  I mean not even a half a mile from my house --
R:  Wow.
L:  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, it's right [LAUGH] --
R:  Do you have any family in the military?
L:  Um, I used to.  My --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- cousin's just got out of -- out of the, um, navy like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- two years --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- a year or two years before nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I co- -- I have a lot of family in the military over the years but at this current time, no, I don't --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't think unless distant cousins or something but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, everybody's pretty much older or, um, the -- my cousins, um, they're just not, you know, expect for the one cousin that was in the military, he was the only one out of this generation that did something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I have a lot of fire fighters and a lot of police officers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in my family, so --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't have anybody I know in the military.  Nobody, um, you know, nobody in my family.  I -- I just live in a family of all girls and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- none of us went into the military [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Now, was your husband affected?  I mean, was he grounded, was he -- 
R:  Oh, my husband has -- my husband's, um, let's see he -- he just got a huge -- well, they, you know, they went bankrupt United --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so he just got a -- we went from -- we bought this brand new home last year, you know, figured we'd be able to afford it and then he had a twenty percent pay cut.  And it was like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, five hundred dollars every pay period is a huge difference that what you were making before [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and that's like that all of a sudden you don't any money for, uh, for living.  You got all your bills to pay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, boom, it's all gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, that's how it was for us.  But, otherwise -- I mean, after that no.  After everything, no, he -- and he actually worked at World Headquarters, which is like where they're based and he, um -- and they had bomb threats for the first, like, three days afterwards.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And he had to direct traffic and evacuate buildings because that was what the big thing was is that people were calling and having bomb threats.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  It's -- it's amazing.  It just -- we -- we never thought that anything like this could happen --
R:  Too safe.
L:  -- and now, you know, that's everybody's fear.  It's something that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- will happen.  But, too, the longer that it -- we go --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, without an attack, the -- I -- I notice the guard is going down in people and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and ther- they think, "Oh, it's not going to happen again, it's not gonna ..." but yet it could very well happen again --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  My husband's thing was -- uh, we were -- we -- we let it happen once, it'll never happen again.  That's how he thinks of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Well --
R:  Do I believe it or not?  I don't know, we'll see.
L:  Yeah.  And we -- we can't stop everything but, you know, as long as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have -- unless we're with God and -- and, you know, we let him protect us, I think that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, bad things are gonna happen but we'll be able to handle it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we'll be able to deal with it.
R:  We're more prepared.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's how -- I mean, that's how my husband -- you know, he's always like, you know, they're not going to do it again.  Somebody's like, "What happens if it happens again?"  They're not going to do it again [NOISE] , they did it once, they let us -- they led us -- you know, they slipped through our guard, our guard was down.  They're telling -- this is not going to happen again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm hoping that that's right.  My husband's a little bit more, um, optimistic I guess you can say, versus me where I'm not so optimistic.  I always think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pessimist thoughts [NOISE] so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just hope --
L:  Well, I hope nothing every happens 'cause my son, you know, my son is my life and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I just -- I would die if anything ever happened to him --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know and -- 
R:  Oh, I hear ya.
L:  Or if something happened to me because who'd take care of my son, you know, and I'm so protective of him as is and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's the only thing that I fear, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's more that something happening to either one of us --
R:  Right, and then nobody else to take care, I understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I totally [LAUGH] -- I mean my son's with me every day 'cause I work in a daycare center.  
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So, my son comes -- yeah, my son comes to school with me and he was -- like I said, he was a baby when it happened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I couldn't even, like, let him go, I just hol-
