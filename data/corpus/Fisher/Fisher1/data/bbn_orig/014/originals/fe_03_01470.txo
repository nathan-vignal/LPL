R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Dawn.
L:  Hi, Dawn, I'm [NOISE] Gail from Georgia.
R:  Hi, I'm in Minnesota.
L:  Okay.
R:  How -- wh-- have you [NOISE] changed anything since those te- uh, terrorists attacks?
L:  I wouldn't say I changed any physical things in my life.  A lot of 'em have been emotional and mental changes.
R:  Little things?
L:  Um --
R:  Like, spending more time with your family or something?
L:  Um, well, I did a lot of that anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- I think a lot of it was like, changing negative behavior and thoughts.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because, um, you know, like most people, after that, anybody who was not brown or, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lighter shade of white --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or anything in the -- in the middle, was a terrorist.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know?  It was like, you know, the guy that I'd been buying gas from for three years now, all of a sudden, yeah, here is my money, he's supporting this terrorist guy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know?
R:  Well --
L:  G- going to pick up dry cleaning from people who were probably East Indians, you know, yeah, give my money to Larry, he's probably a terrorist.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, a lot of that I had to sit down and, you know, think about this mindset.  It was like, okay, I really need to change that because everybody you meet on the street were not the same people flying those planes.
R:  Right.  Well, the -- the problem that I had, I found out that I had, was that one of the guys who was actually the -- one of the terrorists, um, was from Florida and lived not far from my mom and dad, who live in Florida, and [NOISE] went t- -- the guy went to the same place my -- my mom got her hair cut.  And, it was just like, oh my gosh, it could be the person  in your neighborhood!
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was -- it wa- it took me a couple of months to go, "You know what, you -- you can't -- you can't live like that".  So  but I don't think I -- I've changed anything physically, I mean, not too much, I mean, we didn't go buy gas masks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we didn't do that.  We  we were -- we've just done little things like spend more time, quality time, with family and  and just do the little things and not -- try not to stress out about all the big stuff! [LAUGH]  But --
L:  I know.  Um, [LIPSMACK] one of the things I -- I did was like, people that you used to just think about, you know, that you hadn't talked to or seen in a long time.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, but you would just give 'em a passing thought, "I wonder how such and such from high school is?  Or such and such from co- --", you know.
R:  Oh yeah.  Did you end up calling anybody?
L:  Yeah, I started, you know, to, um, contact those people.  Because --
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah, because you just never know, you know, when you'll be thinking about somebody and, [NOISE] you know, what if they were in that building?  You know --
R:  Oh, did you end up knowing anybody in New York?
L:  Um, yeah, well I have some family members in New York that work close by but [NOISE] nobody in that building.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- his friend used to work in that building --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but he's not there anymore, so 
R:  Really, that's eerie, isn't it?
L:  So that was good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, I have some other family members [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whose lives have not really fared well.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know, um, [NOISE] one is battling substance abuse and the other two are incarcerated, and, you know, it was crazy because I was thinking, "Wow, I'm sure glad they're deadbeats because had they --
R:  [NOISE]  Had they -- had they been --
L:  -- been working they might have died in this building".
R:  Oh, that's -- that's sad either way, though --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's scary.
L:  Y- y- yeah, it is. [NOISE]
R:  Wow!
L:  [MN] [NOISE] And --
R:  But, yeah, we haven't -- we haven't seemed to change too much [NOISE].  We  I mean, we didn't -- we didn't cut back on the amount we flew or anything.  [NOISE] So  'cause my husband works for the airlines, so we didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we didn't cut back on, you know, flying or -- too much.  [NOISE]  Although I was nervous the first time that --
L:  Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask you, was there any apprehension at all?
R:  Yeah, i- i- but I was flying with my children. [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  So you really couldn't go -- you know what I mean?  You couldn't wig out!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, you -- you don't wanna -- you don't wanna put that on them either.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- and we talked to -- we talked to my, you know, especially [NOISE] my oldest child and, you know, was asking him how -- how he felt about everything and he was -- he said he was pretty not nervous about everything that was going on.  [NOISE]  So 
L:  How old is he?
R:  He's ten.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you know, pretty -- pretty verbal and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, we didn't talk about it too much with the seven year old, only because of the fact that  I mean, you know, he was asking, "Why?"
L:  And, you know, what do you --
R:  How do you explain that?
L:  Yeah.  You know, "They really don't like us so they just did this", I mean --
R:  Yeah.  I said they were bad people who made a -- bad decisions and bad things happened and, you know, I mean o- other than that h- what are you supposed to say? [NOISE]  So  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And I think, um, something else I was, um, just b- remembering now, was how angry I was to see them over there laughing and dancing and celebrating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When, you know, we have never, you know, if we've ever done anything as far as killing people, we have never, over here, laughed and danced and had parties in the street.
R:  I know.  I mean, that's just [NOISE] -- that was -- that was [NOISE] so sad because you know that it probably wasn't everybody over there doing that, yet that's what they chose to show.  And it couldn't have been everybody doing that.  I mean, I -- it's like the people over here protesting the war.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's not everybody over here that feels that way, yet that's what they chose to show.
L:  But that's what they show.  And that's another thing, I think I started scrutinizing the media more after that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, because you go, "You know what, you're -- you're egging us on".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and there's no --
L:  Basically.
R:  -- there is no need for that.  So, [NOISE] I -- I did find that I stopped watching a lot of TV, especially the news.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Um, just because of the fact that  gosh, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That [MN] --
R:  I -- I know there's bad things and I don't need to live them twenty four --
L:  Seven, yeah.
R:  -- seven.  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you're reflecting on 'em enough as it is.  So, yeah --
R:  Yeah.  They -- they impact your -- your life enough as it is.  So 
L:  Yeah.  We pretty much stayed on the cartoon --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- channel and Nickelodeon for quite some time --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah!
L:  -- after that, and even now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, so what about the, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nation, you know, terrorist level alert like, orange, blue, green, do they mean anything to you?
R:  I fou- I found it stressful.  Well, [SIGH] only because of the fact that sometimes we were traveling and so, you know, you -- you -- you felt more apprehensive, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [SIGH], I mean, when they like, when they raised it was times like, "Well, why?  Why are they raising it?  Why aren't they telling us why they're raising it?  What --" you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And I just -- sometimes you got too much information and then other times it just seemed like not enough.
L:  Yeah.  Some- th- that's what I felt too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I felt like after that, you know, we needed to be more guarded and all these secrets were coming out on TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  [NOISE]  But as far as, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and looking from a non traveler's standpoint like myself, they -- those alerts, those codes and levels don't mean anything to me.  I mean, what's --
R:  Like, what do you kno- --
L:  What's an orange?  What's a red?  What does that --
R:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, translate into in terms of a --
R:  And why does yellow and orange look so similar in color? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know what I mean?  What does that translate into lives lost, um, catastrophic event, you know, what's an orange, a bombing of a caf?
R:  Like, what are -- what are you hearing that I'm not?
L:  Or, you know, what -- what's a blue, you know, a bombing of a -- a school?  What, I mean, what is that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  How are we spo- I mean, this is all new to us, you know, how are we supposed to take that?  You know, I mean, we're not from a country where every day is September eleventh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're not from, you know, Israel where this happens daily, or, you know, Egypt or some of the countries in Africa.
R:  Or -- or -- yeah.  Well, I'm -- what -- what I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- worried about when it first happened was that my children's school was in a lock down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was -- it was weird.  It was just like, you know, they usually have kids out checking the bus patrol and -- and doing all that, and none of the kids were doing that, it was all the teachers.  It was just  it was like, wow, this is a very serious matter yet I'm not sure how it affects me or -- or -- or what to think by it.
L:  Yeah, that -- that was unfortunate because the kids will su- -- they suffer for that and they'll be suffering the consequences of this for a long time to come, you know?
R:  Yeah, that was --
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I think that was one the bad things about it too.
R:  Well, I think any -- any child, no matter their age right now, is gonna remember what they were doing or where they were, kinda like the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- John F. Kennedy of -- of the previous generation.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And that [MN] --
R:  They can remember where they were and what they were doing.
L:  You know, I save, uh, the newspaper clippings for them and -- but, you know, beyond the same, you know, we're just reinforcing the discussion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my four year old had in his pre K. about the bad men flying the plane into the building.  Um, you know, we haven't really touched on it much because, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I tell him, "Well, they don't like us" and I'm still trying to figure out why they don't!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah!  And --
L:  You know, is it because we have more?  I mean, do y- -- is it like an ideology, you know, you say you hate western --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- influences but here you are, you're riding around in your caravan of Yukons[?], okay!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a GMC car.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's a western car.  So you own all these western things, you know, Saddam Hussein likes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, Frank Sinatra.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Can you get any more American than Frank Sinatra?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah!  And you have the watch and you got the Levi jeans and  what -- what more do you want, you know?
L:  You know, get -- y- you know, you wanna blow us off the planet because we're arrogant and --
R:  [LAUGH] Right!  But you want our stuff!
L:  And, you know, I think before September eleven --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that didn't really bother me nuts, but now I'm just like, tired of people hating us.
R:  W- --
L:  You know?  I'm getting to the point now where I'm like, fine, let's just pull our troops outta everywhere, let 'em fight their own battles, give us our money back, fend for yourself.  I've had it.
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm done, thank you very much.  [NOISE]  I'm finished
