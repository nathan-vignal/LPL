L:  Anna.
R:  My name's Mary.  Okay, you wanna start talking. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, oh okay.  I [inaudible] or something [LAUGH].  Uh, I guess, I don't know.  What's it about, September eleven?
R:  Yes, September eleven.
L:  Oh goodness, uh, what's changed after September eleven.  Mm, let me think.  Uh, it's rather started to be more scary, don't you agree?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, goodness.
R:  Between that and the war coming on.
L:  Uh, yes, it didn't help, definitely.  And it's actually after the war it's even scarier.  That something like this can happen again.
R:  I know my, uh, daughter in law she just, uh, she got deployed today.  She has to -- she had to leave the -- to go overseas.  And that kind of scares you too because she's got two small kids at home.  So ...
L:  [NOISE] Oh goodness.  Are you afraid to flying after September eleven?
R:  What?
L:  Are you -- like are you afraid to flying after September eleven?
R:  Do I sleep all right?  Yes.  I don't have any trouble sleeping.  I'm just, uh, I have a boy who's handicapped, I'm so afraid that, you know, they're gonna -- they're gonna start attacking the schools and things like that.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what about flying, like taking the planes?
R:  Well, we took a plane -- we went to Hawaii last year.  We wasn't afraid of that.
L:  No, not nothing, huh?
R:  No, not -- no, it was all right that -- I mean that's the first time and only time I've been on a plane so ...
L:  Uh, since then I didn't even take a plane once.  I don't know it's just scary.
R:  I -- I was always afraid of going on a plane, yes.  But, I mean, it could -- it could attack anybody.  I mean it could be a -- it could be, uh, you know, you could be just driving down the road and stop for a red light.  You could get -- you could get, you know --
L:  That's true.  Yeah, that's true.  But before that happened, before the -- it happened just I never thought that it might happen, something like this actually for what [inaudible] and just, you know, you know, just didn't cross my mind that it is possible.
R:  I know, it's just like a -- you know, like, uh, a lot of things that -- you know, I'm afraid the hospitals are going to be attacked or people that can't defend themselves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, senior citizens or, you know, homes and stuff like that.  They gonna -- I'm afraid they're going to attack somebody -- it's so they could attack anybody.  You know, he could go to a small town, a big town or anything.
L:  That's true, that's true.  Uh, I don't know, what else should we talk about? [LAUGH]
R:   Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, we- -- uh, [MN] do you work anywhere?  Has it affected your job or anything?
L:  Um, actually, no.  I'm -- I -- I'm looking for a job.  I finish at college, uh -- that's also, you know, I had -- I had -- it happened right at the beginning of the semester and oh, it was the hardest semester I ever had.  The hardest semester.
R:  It just se- -- it just seems unreal, doesn't it?
L:  Yes.  It's jus -- [several inaudible words] like people who fallen out of the buildings, it like debris --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I just couldn't believe it.
R:  Well, in actual fact there --
L:  Actually, I could've seen buildings burning from the place where I -- I -- I live.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, you live in New York then.
L:  Uh, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  I could've seen and -- if you will look up you will see that half of the sky is blue and the other half completely smoked, you know.  It's scary.
R:  Yes, it's a -- it's a shame that, you know, kids got hurt.  It's a -- now, that's -- that's what's so bad about, you know, just -- you know, small kids.  They're -- they're innocent.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know that's the bad thing about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was like, you know, the Oklahoma bombing that was a -- that was a tragedy too.
L:  Yes.  But it's [inaudible], it's scary.
R:  Yes, I know it.  I mean, uh, just -- like here in Tennessee, I'm -- I'm in Tennessee and, uh, they had, uh, a hijacking of that Greyhound bus.  It -- it could happen to anybody.  It just -- it's so unreal.  It's --
L:  It's destiny, I guess.
R:  It's -- it's such a shame that something had to -- people just can't, you know, get along and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I do agree with you [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you know, just like a -- you know, uh, what was it, years ago when they had that, um, uh, you know, they had that cult and that -- what was that fo- -- was in Africa or something like, a jinx town cult.  That -- that was a shame too.
L:  I don't -- what is it?  What was that?
R:  That cult, you know -- oh, I can't think what it was called now.  It was a -- uh, in a way where he, uh, he killed all the people -- I mean he didn't kill them all but he gave them all a cyanide poisoning and they all died.  That was a -- I can't think where that was at now.  That was years ago.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  You know, it's just -- it's just a shame though people -- I don't know.
L:  That's when somebody makes the poison into the public, this one?
R:  Yeah, well no he --
L:  That's what you mean?
R:  He gave them all Koolade and they all drank the Koolade. 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they all died.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they had cyanide poisoning.
L:  Oh.
R:  It just the -- the cult leader he, uh, he told them they would all go to heaven, you know, be all saved.
L:  Oh, thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's --
L:  Yeah.  Oh my god.  But, I guess, it's like a destiny, you can't -- I mean you can't predict what's going to happen, you know.
R:  No, you can't.  I mean it could happen -- you know, you can't even predict what -- what's gonna -- if it happens to ya.  Anything can happen.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's scary.
R:  I know just like --
L:  Very scary.
R:  -- just like the snipers over there when, uh, down in -- in Washington where they -- you know, just killing people just like that.
L:  Oh yes.
R:  That -- that was scary too 'cause these people had nothing -- they -- they was not doing anything wrong.
L:  And they the kids too, don't forget the kids who will shoot at anybody.  Kids --
R:  I know it.
L:  -- women and like why?
R:  Yeah, just like the schools.  It's this chain where people have to -- you wonder why -- why they do that.
L:  Jealousy.
R:  I don't know if it's jealousy or what it is [SIGH].
L:  I think it's a jealousy.  I think it's a lot of to do with the jealousy.  You know just like, uh, they can't get over it.  You know, that somebody can live a normal life.
R:  I don't know what, uh -- I mean, they sure -- they sure can't do it for power because they're not -- they're not getting any -- they're not going to be any better off.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Mm, goodness. [NOISE]
R:  Are you afraid to go on buses or anything like that?
L:  Am I afraid to go where?
R:  On buses -- buses, trains or anything.
L:  No, buses and trains, no.  I -- no.  Nothing like this.  I -- I -- I'm not -- for some reason I'm not.  Even though it can -- actually a lot of crash can happen and stuff like this but, no, not buses, not trains.  What about you?
R:  I -- We -- we wanna take an Amtrak train sometime, uh, we wanna go up to the state of Washington.  We thought we'd take a train that way the Amtrak train.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  It's not -- it doesn't feel like it -- I don't know when I take the train it doesn't cross my mind that something could happened.
R:  Right, it could though.
L:  Where every time in an airport I'm keep thinking about it.
R:  Wow, they're trying to do the best security they can now at airports.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, but it could still happen they could -- they could still, uh, you know, terrorists on the plane.
L:  Yeah.  I remember the time happened when there, I think it was a woman, servicewoman, she was in the army and she actually could take her gun inside the plane and they did not stop her.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Do you remember it, it was in the news, it was big thing.  I think it was in J.F.K. or it was such a big thing that how come -- it -- it was after September eleven.
R:  Wow, when we fly we couldn't take razor blades, you know, for a shaver or anything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When we went to Hawaii.  We couldn't take anything like that.  We couldn't take anything -- uh, anything sharp, a razor blade or, you know, for a -- like a disposable shaver --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we couldn't take any of that stuff along.
L:  Yeah, but she actually blowed the [inaudible] and she did not realize, just put it in her bag, her hand held bag and then she realize it only after she -- she went -- she came to the destination, wherever she was going to and they made such a big propaganda around it.  How could -- it's not like a something -- it's not like a needle or something like this, it's the whole gun and nobody stopped her, nobody checked her.
R:  Well, you know, it's just like the said -- I mean, just since the terrorists hit, I mean they could still do, uh, like a nuclear wars or stuff like that or poi- -- you know, an anthrax and all that kind of stuff they had.  You know, that's -- that's what worries you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you don't have any protection.
L:  That's true.  And you wouldn't even see it and feel it.
R:  Yeah, I know.  Just like that or if you [inaudible] or anything like that.
L:  That's right, after -- after -- I remember that scared a lot of people like getting sick and I remember opening the mail and thinking all the time, "Oh, what -- what can it be there?" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everything that look not like a regular bill I was, like, hesitant to open.
R:  I know 'cause you can't really tell if there's anything on there -- in there all, I mean, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it could, uh, uh, mixed in the paper.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  I remember my mom actually --
R:  Or if you touch that --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  If you touch that then you could -- you could be infected.
L:  That's right, yes.  That's right, or inhale or something like this.
R:  Yeah, or you could inhale.  I mean, it's -- well, I mean, that -- that could happen, uh, you know, it could be -- it could be pretty bad though.  It --
L:  Oh, I agree.
