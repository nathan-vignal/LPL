L:  Hello, my name is Brandy Dintilli.  I'm from Memphis.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  Good.  I'm, uh, Karen Moralt from Aus- uh, from Minnesota.  I'm in Byron, but I'm from Rochester area, kinda.  I don't know if you know about that, so --
L:  Yes, I am.  Um --
R:  Um --
L:  -- how are you doing today?
R:  Not too bad.
L:  Um, well, how has it changed your life, or has it even changed your life?
R:  Well, we've got five kids, so I'd have to say that, uh, we tend to be a little bit more careful about where we let them go and stuff, but I mean --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  
R:  -- the world's been going, that we've been doing that already, and uh, but otherwise, you know, I -- for working and stuff, I -- I work at the male clinic which is uh, a health facility thing --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  
R:  So -- so there we -- we have, uh, more precautions and we're even getting these, um, we normally just have badges that -- that just are for zipping in and out of the building and stuff and --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- for time cards and stuff, but now we, um, they're going to have pictures and our names on them, and that's because of September eleventh and stuff, so --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  Well, I have to agree with you.  I have two children --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and um, yes, ma'am, I tend to watch them closer.  When we go out places and my family members, I -- I you know, catch myself over and over again telling them, you know, "I love you.  Be careful".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Such and such.  My mother in law just got back from New York as a matter of fact, last month, in March.  She went up to New York.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she said up there that the people's attitudes were a lot different than what they were down here.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because, uh, you know, September eleventh --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- happened up there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, she said that they're a lot different, that they're more alert up there.  There's a lot of security up there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know, not that something couldn't happen, you know, where you are, where I am --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But she says --
R:  Have you -- have you done traveling much, in the airports and stuff?
L:  No, ma'am.  I --
R:  Oh.
L:  I do not fly.  I cannot stand to fly.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Everybody tells me, you know, if you get in the airplane, you'll love it.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know, you'll absolutely love it, but I just -- even before September eleventh, I just could not catch myself getting on an airplane.  It's just always scared me half to death.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even with my family members', you know, airplanes.  It just -- ooh.  Even after September eleventh, it's gotten worse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Well, we have, uh, my brother in law works for one of the air -- airports and um --
L:  Yes, ma'am?
R:  -- he's a mechanic so I mean, he doesn't go flying or anything, but it's just kind of, uh, interesting to hear from him, how it affects him and -- and his work and stuff.  And I think that -- um, I think it's related to that, but -- yeah.  But they had, uh, the -- the work -- they've been cutting back a lot of their workers.
L:  Yes, ma'am.  My mother works for the navy.  She works on the navy base station in -- well, it's in Millington[?], Tennessee, but we live in Memphis, it's about ten minutes away from where we live.  
R:  Okay.
L:  She works out there on the navy base.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And it really scares -- you know, that kinda scares her from now and the -- you know, from time to time it scares her because they have really, really high security out there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, ma'am, and she said, uh, they have bear caves up where, um, you have to go through em, and --
R:  Okay?
L:  -- and it's -- it's closed.  It used to be open to the public, where people could go in there and look at the different stuff on the base --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but now they can't.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, it -- they've changed a lot.
R:  Well, if you want to go visit, I mean, do they restrict you?
L:  They won't let you on.
R:  Really?
L:  No, ma'am, they won't.  Unless you have -- you've got to have a decal on your car, saying that you work for the naval base.
R:  Mhm?
L:  You have to have a decal and you have to have a badge.
R:  Jeeze.
L:  And I mean, even if you have that, they still search you.
R:  Really?
L:  I mean, they still search you.  Yes, ma'am.
R:  Now, if you -- if she came and -- and escorted you in, is that okay, or -- or not even that way?
L:  Not even that way.
R:  Wow.
L:  They won't even let you -- see, like I can't go on there.  Me and my husband, my kids, we can't go there and visit her at work, take our children up there, you know, to have lunch with her on the base?  We can't even do that.
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  They -- even where my husband works, um, he works at some of the major refineries in Memphis.
R:  Okay?
L:  You know, the gas refineries and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where gas is stored and --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- they have really high security over there, too.  He's like, "Lord, one bomb and I'm blown away".  [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  It -- it really scares him out there too, but --
R:  Is that a very big town, where he works?  Does he work in Memphis, or does --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  Oh, Memphis is really big.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I didn't know if he worked there or in your little town --
L:  Well, he works -- he works in Millington.  Do you know where Memphis is?
R:  [NOISE].  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever --
R:  Right.
L:  Do you, um, do you know what Millington is?  
R:  Um, it sounds familiar, but I can't picture --
L:  It's -- it's about ten minutes from Memphis.  It takes about ten minutes to get there.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's -- Millington is bigger than it used to be, but it's -- it's not that big.
R:  Okay.  
L:  It's not as big as Memphis.
R:  Because, like, you know Rochester, Minnesota, it's big, but I -- we just -- me and coworkers are, like, we just can't figure that that would be a bomb target for -- if someone, a terrorist, wanted to attack somewhere, they'd --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  Yeah.
R:  -- he'd probably pick somewhere [LAUGH] a little bit bigger.
L:  They would probably pick Memphis before they would Rochester [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- but Memphis really isn't that big of a threat?
L:  It's not.  No, ma'am.  It's not --
R:  Or --
L:  -- that big, but --
R:  -- not really well known.  I mean, like New York, New York, I mean, everybody, yeah, they've heard of that and all that, but --
L:  Yes, ma'am, they --
R:  -- it's just --
L:  I mean, look at New York?  They've got the last batch of labor, the EV[?].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Eiffel Tower, the um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, what's it called, Josh?
R:  What's that?  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, the Eiffel Tower.  I mean the Empire State building.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Where did I get the Eiffel Tower from?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  The what?  The Eiffel Tower?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, geeze.
L:  I don't think that's in New York.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I don't think so.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But we -- no, they were just talking about it on Oprah just a few minutes ago, the Eiffel [LAUGH] Tower.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's where you got it from. 
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  Oh, geeze.  
L:  But, uh --
R:  So, I haven't --
L:  So, the only thing we really have to worry about in Memphis is the Pyramid or our big bridge or you know, some of our refineries out here.  That's all we really have to worry about.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well you know, and me working at a health facility, I mean, they're not going to bomb a -- a hospital or anything, you wouldn't think?
L:  No, you wouldn't think.
R:  'Cause I mean, they could use the -- the hospitals and stuff too and it just --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  I don't know, you -- you kind of -- I feel really detached from it all, so I don't feel like it really threatens me, but it makes you a little more aware of stuff, but I mean, what are you going to do about it, really?
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  So --
L:  There's nothing you can really do about it.
R:  Yeah.  Are you a stay at home mom?
L:  Yes, ma'am.  I stay at home.
R:  Okay.  So you don't --
L:  I'm gonna --
R:  You don't have to worry about where you work either.  I mean, it's not like --
L:  No, ma'am.
R:  -- you go to a -- anywhere else that would be --
L:  Or on business.
R:  -- a -- a big draw, so that's -- that kind of helps.
L:  I'm insisting[?] on trying to go to college, though, so --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  I want to go to college and, you know, do all that.
R:  Oh, you haven't started yet?
L:  No, ma'am.  I haven't started college yet.  I'm gonna wait a few more years till my baby's got bigger.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Then I was gonna go, so --
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Um, one of them is twenty three months and one of them is seven months.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, they're little.
L:  They are little.  My seven month old is twice the size of my twenty three month old.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] oh, my.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Isn't that funny?  I --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  It is.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, gosh.
L:  It is weird.  It's really weird.
R:  Our oldest is seven years old, and so --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- we've got seven, six, five, three and -- and one.  Roughly.  In ages.  So, they've -- they're in the school system and stuff and I -- with the school too, they're saying -- they're -- they're cracking down on -- you know, you sign in, you have to wear little badges that --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- says "visitor" on it and --
L:  See --
R:  -- I think that's all, you know, tightened more.
L:  They -- they haven't started that here.  My brother goes to Mill- Millington High School and, um, they haven't started that here.  They don't have to have any kind of badges, any kind of IDs, nothing like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  They haven't started that here, so I don't know if they will or not, but --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Where I used to go to school, we didn't have to have it.
R:  I know.  Yeah.  Times sure have changed, you know?
L:  It -- it sure does.  I mean, it -- I look at the way things used to be when I was a little girl, and now that I'm bigger and I see my brother in school, it's like totally different.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Totally different.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost scary to have kids any more, but you know, well the world goes on and --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- and everybody adjusts and what not, so -- but, you know, it's one of those things, I'm glad they had that, I don't know, it just kind of -- I -- I'm -- I'm glad that people are a little bit more aware of things that -- that could happen.  But --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- you know, I didn't want it to happen in -- in such a big way, but it just -- people just kind of, uh, out of sight, out of mind, you know?  They -- they put the whole problems aside, if -- if they don't directly affect them, and even after September eleventh, a lot of people just kinda went back to their ways and --
L:  Yes, ma'am.  For --
R:  -- and didn't -- they didn't have patriotic sense of anything.  It just kind of --
L:  For -- I think maybe for a few weeks, they were kinda, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- real scared and then after that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was just, like, back to normal, you know?  
R:  Right.  Yeah, that whole --
L:  Back to --
R:  -- thing about history repeating itself, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really true, because people just kind of --
L:  It is.
R:  -- forget what happened and --
L:  No, ma'am.
R:  I don't know.  Hopefully, it doesn't happen again anywhere, but --
L:  I think it was, uh, a wakeup call.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  It really was.
R:  And it's too bad, I don't know if you heard about some policemen that, uh, they were, uh, bombarded by rioters because they had flags --
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  -- bandanas on their head?
L:  I heard about that, yes, ma'am.
R:  That's just -- that's just sad, you know?  It's like, okay, it is America, people and, uh [LAUGH] if they want to have a flag, then so be it --
