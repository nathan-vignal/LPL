R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm -- I'm Kevin.  Who's this?
R:  Kevin?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi, this is Lynette.
L:  Oh, where you from?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  California?  Sunny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sunny California?
L:  Uh, well it should be but right now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's kinda raining! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we're supposed to be getting that too now, too so ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh.  So I guess the subject what, is how our lives changed, since nine one one?
L:  Yeah, I guess that's what we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Hm.  Mm.
R:  -- did your life change at all?
L:  To tell you the truth, not really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, and everyone's saying about the fear of terrorism and stuff but I -- I don't really think it changed anything at all. [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] mine hasn't either.  I really don't travel so that there, uh, didn't affect me, but, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, like, when we go into a, like a huge mall or something, I -- it's in the back of my mind but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't really actually -- don't do anything because of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so ...  It still scares me! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yes, of course.
R:  But ... other than that ...
L:  Mm.  I -- I went to -- I went, um, I went to Europe over the summer and -- so there was a lotta plane trips and stuff but, I don't know, I never just -- I never gave a second thought [LAUGH] about it!
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It didn't bother you getting on the plane?
L:  N- not at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause -- 'cause you'd think if -- if they're gonna do some terrorism again that -- that they're not gonna u- do the same thing, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, and you had no -- I mean, how were the airports and stuff, were they very tight secured?
L:  Um, the only thing different, I guess, was before you go in the plane --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they'd -- they'd like, really like, search everything that you carry on --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- and stuff.  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  They search your bags and stuff, but I guess that was the only difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh.  Like I say, I don't -- i- well, I don't travel at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never been on a plane.  I don't think at this point I would ever [LAUGH] get on a plane!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, but, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and it's still in -- it's always in the back of my mind.  But we live in such a little place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, uh, I don't think they're gonna aim for us! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They're gonna go for the big places.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- unfortunately T.M.I. is like, only twenty minutes up the road from us, though.
L:  W- what is it?
R:  T.M.I. Three Mile I- -- Three Mile Island, the nuclear plant.
L:  Oh.  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's not too far from us, so ...
L:  Uh.
R:  So, yeah, that, um --
L:  Yeah, that could be a little bit scary! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, of course, um, we're in a, um, airplane path.
L:  Ah.
R:  So every time the airplanes go over, the kids get a little scared  But, [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  -- especially if they're flying low! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, wasn't there a plane that crashed there on nine eleven?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Was it -- was that close bys or ...?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, no, n- that was in Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, was it?  Oh, okay.
R:  Now, I would say that's like an hour, hour and a half away.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  So ... but, uh, [COUGH] I don't know, I just -- I don't think I would travel now. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, [LAUGH] yeah.  So you think it did affect your life?
R:  Yeah, I -- a little bit it did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A little bit.  I'm more cautious and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] but -- no, would you travel again?
L:  Um, y- yeah, actually! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm hoping to go to Hawaii this summer. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh wow! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Yeah, it sorta didn't curb you at all did it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, not at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, are you --
L:  I --
R:  -- married?
L:  Uh, no, I'm a -- I'm a student.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where do you go?
L:  Um, San Jose State.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I see.  So, did they do anything in your school about the war?  I mean, like, some of the colleges around here have cancelled classes a couple of times just so they could all get together and discuss the war.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, nothing li- -- nothing like that here, just lots of protestors. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you one of 'em?
L:  So -- uh, no.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, okay.  But, um, well, I see where they lower our security, our, um, alert.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's not the red [MN] -- it's not orange now, it's the one below it.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  So, maybe they -- they think maybe --
L:  I -- I -- wasn't it red for the past few weeks, or ...?
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Hm.
R:  Just, um, yesterday they lowered it.
L:  Oh, I see.  Hm.
R:  So, maybe they think he's gone, but then we have those other jerks! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh --
L:  Syria.
R:  Ye- oh, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  They need to be taken care of! [LAUGH]  But, um --
L:  [MN].
R:  Yeah, I just, uh ... everyth- I -- I don't know, I just -- it's not the same any more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You always think it's gonna happen some place else.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  But, [SIGH] so ... hm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  Now, now, is this your first call?
L:  Uh, I sort +of had one on the other day --
R:  About ...?
L:  -- about -- about, um, censorship.
R:  Oh yeah, same here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Same here.  I talked to somebody from Georgia.
L:  Georgia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh.  With their accent and everything? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh!  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]  Typical[?].
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um ... [SIGH] um, I don't know what else -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ten minutes is --
L:  Yeah, I ta- --
R:  Huh?
L:  I -- I talked -- I was -- I talked to some grandmother from Colorado.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  And she -- and she just kept going on about her kids and her grandchildren! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  But I thought that was nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  But -- so you travel then, what, just for fun or ...?
L:  Yes, for a vacation I guess.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  N- not for your job or anything?
L:  Uh, no.
R:  No?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Uh, now when you --
L:  Jus- --
R:  -- when you travel, do people seem scared or anything?
L:  Um, actually, I -- I ch- -- I don't -- I don't think so.
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess you'd think that the people that were actually scared wouldn't be on the plane [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the first place.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be me! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right!
R:  Oh.  But I mean, do they do anything different on the plane than they normally did?
L:  Um, uh, let me think.  Uh ... other -- other than more security checks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- before en- entering the plane --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and before like -- like, right when you go in the airport --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, that's the only thing that's really changed, I guess.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, there -- there's no like, air marshalls or anything, no.
R:  Right.  I didn't know if they had anybody on the -- on the, uh, plane or not.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't think they're doing that in most --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- most airlines.  Hm.
R:  Huh.
L:  It'd be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Make you feel safer, huh?
L:  Yeah, a little more security.
R:  Yeah.  Now, I just see -- I just saw ... [MN] on one of the news like, twenty twenties or something like that, that they were gonna make a bullet proof, um, cockpit door --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- for the pilots.
L:  Yeah.  You --
R:  For --
L:  -- you'd -- you'd think they'd -- that'd be like, a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like a given that they should have [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah!
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you know us Americans, we learn the hard way. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Mm.
R:  Oh.  But --
L:  [MN] Th- there's no problem unless something goes wrong [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Then that's when -- and that's when you fix it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  "Hm, now what do we do?" [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, I -- [SIGH] it's still scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Do you watch a lot about the war or ...?
L:  Yeah.  In the first couple of weeks I've been watching.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I- I've been glued to the TV just watching [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everything.  But now it's just getting -- it's like, the same old thing, nothing new.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're saying it's dying down, so hopefully everybody'll be coming home soon.
L:  Mhm.  Actually, I haven't been keeping up in the past couple of days, so, like, what's going on now?
R:  I honestly haven't been either.  I just haven't, I don't know, I guess I just don't --
L:  Y- --
R:  It's not that I'm not interested in it, it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- i- it's not getting old but, I like to think of something more ... happier! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Take a break from it, I guess you wanna say.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That makes sense.
R:  So ... but, um, hm.
L:  Hm.
R:  Now, do you have any big malls or anything out there in California?
L:  Um, well, I'm in -- around like, San Francisco Bay area.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH]
L:  So, there isn't --
R:  So you got the -- you -- you got the bridge there, right?
L:  Yeah.  It's, uh, all the -- other than all the
