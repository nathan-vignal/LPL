R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is John, I live in Boston.
R:  My name is Cindy, I'm in Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, well very nice to speak with you.
R:  Same to you.
L:  Well, how did things change after September eleven for you?
R:  I started watching the news and keeping up with the world events a little bit more than I did before.  I had always kinda felt if it didn't happen around here then it didn't affect me.
L:  Wow.  Well, the, um, some of the planes that -- that hit the World Trade Center left from here and I had a friend on there so that, um -- and I was in the military at the time.  So, uh, things changed quite a bit for me with, uh, reporting for duty --
R:  I would imagine so.
L:  -- and, um, also I gave blood that day immediately and it seemed like it wasn't needed but I went anyways, you know.
R:  Yeah, just a feeling of having something to do to help.  We, uh, had blood drives here with my son's junior high and my aunt is a nurse at the local hospital and she went up there.  She said it was pretty tremendous to look at and with my kids and -- and teaching them about patriotic American duties and freedoms and things like that -- because they had a lot of questions about why these people did what they did.  And the only thing I could answer to them was I don't know 'cause I really didn't understand it myself.
L:  Right, see I don't have kids.  I'm single, not married and, um, don't have any children so I didn't have those questions to answer.  I think the questions I had were all internal and just trying to sort it out for myself.
R:  Yes.
L:  Now, have things continue -- continued to change for you since then?  Have -- have anything -- have you been traveling as much?
R:  Well, I don't travel that much anyway and I don't fly.  I'm scared to fly in the first place.  I've never flown on a plane before.
L:  Never?
R:  Never.
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  I'm thirty one years old, I have never been on an airplane [LAUGH] and we don't have trains in this area.  I have rode on a bus but it's been several years since I have.  And the last trip that we took out of state was probably seven or eight years ago so the travel's really not affected.  But, I think, after that happening, if I were to fly on a plane I'd be scared to death.  Not just, you know, for the fear of flying but who's going to jack the plane and fly it into another building?
L:  Yeah, it's just crazy.
R:  See I was flying about, um, for total time in the air, I was spending about a week per year in the air.
L:  Wow!  In the amount of time so I -- I thought of it like that and after September eleventh and I said to myself, "There's -- there's no way I want to travel that much" because I figured before September eleventh my number would be up eventually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just out of the -- just the amount of flying I was doing.  And so I do just about everything I can not to have to travel now.
R:  I -- I totally understand why.  That just -- it puts a thought in everyone's head, I think, that it --it -- one it was unexpected and two, they were right here in the United States.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people get up, do their normal morning routine, get on an airplane and the next thing you know it's being hijacked and being flown into a plane where thousands of people are killed.  I mean, that's -- that's just unbelievable.  And I couldn't understand what would possess someone to do that but I try to keep up more with everything that's going on now.  Try to learn more and be aware of things around me and thank god for my children, you know.
L:  No- now do you live anywhere Oklahoma City?  Because of the events that happened there.
R:  I'm about seventy five miles south of Oklahoma City.
L:  And -- and how did that -- did that affect you as much, more that the September eleven?
R:  I think it did because it was closer to home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it wasn't -- it wasn't a terrorist type -- I mean it was, obviously, but not like you would expect from another country.  I think it shocked me more so with that because he was American.  He was like your every day citizen, you know, in appearance.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, in my area there are that many from overseas like from Pakistan or Iraq or Iran or anything like that.  There's not that many here.
L:  Right.
R:  The majority of people are white, African American or Latin American.
L:  [COUGH].
R:  So, to see someone like that -- and after the seventh -- Sept- ah, September eleventh attack --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one man in our area, I know he's from Pakistan put on his, I don't know what they call those outfits.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Solid black with a black turban on his head toting a sign, you know, "Praise Allah and congratulations on the attack".  I was like, "Oh my god, are you crazy?" you know.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  "You're in Oklahoma, the Rednecks, my friend, you know, you should not do that".
L:  [LAUGH] it's very dangerous.
R:  Yes.  But the police picked him up for whatever charge -- I don't know I didn't follow up with it but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just makes you feel like here in your country where you have the freedom to do all these wonderful freedoms that you have, it doesn't seem like you have any freedom whatsoever.
L:  Mm [NOISE].
R:  And that's frightening.
L:  It is.
R:  That's really frightening.
L:  On- -- one of the things is I -- I did a lot of world travel before September eleventh and, um, when I had a vacation, um, since then I -- I said, "I'm not going anywhere but to see the United States.  I wanna see some place here that I haven't seen".
R:  Right.
L:  And I went out to, um, out to the, um, the Midwest and drove through Minnesota and South Dakota and took a couple of weeks out there and, uh, you know, I was looking at Oklahoma too, just saying, "I wanna see some -- a lot of nothing".
R:  And Oklahoma's the place to go [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] South Dakota was too.  I was amazed, you know, it took me all day to drive across the state.
R:  It's so flat here.
L:  And it's --
R:  But --
L:  And are you pretty far out in the country?
R:  No.  I actually -- I live next to Fortsome[?] Military Base.
L:  Oh yeah, wild.  So, you do have a military connection of -- of some sort then?
R:  Right.  And when they buckled down after September eleventh they totally closed --
L:  Yeah, you couldn't get on the base.
R:  Right.  
L:  Right.
R:  Which, on one level having kids and being involved in soccer that's where our soccer games were held was on their polo field.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, our city people were scrambling around trying to find some place to put eight thousand people for soccer games and that was, for my kids, that they -- you know, they couldn't understand about a terrorist attack but they knew their soccer had been disputed and, you know, "Oh my gosh we're right here next to this military base and it's an artillery base at that" and when they start doing their exercises with, uh, the Enola S system that they have --
L:  Yes, mhm.
R:  -- it sounds like World War Three around here.
L:  Sure, sure [LAUGH].  Well, obviously you're near a range, you can hear some of the hundred and five millimeters and things like that going off?
R:  I've actually had pictures fall off my wall from the vibrations.
L:  Wow!
R:  It's that close.
L:  Now, are you -- are you married to someone in the military?
R:  No.  My stepdad was military and I have a brother in law that's military and we have several friends, of course, being next to a military base but, no, he's, uh, into plumbing, which pays better than the military around here, so ...
L:  It sure does, it sure does [LAUGH].  So, how -- how do you think the, uh, world is going to be for your kids now and is your outlook -- your future outlook for your children, does it feel different?
R:  Well, my son has decided he's going into the military.
L:  And does that scare you?
R:  On one level it does because he is my son.  But, on the other level, I'm proud --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that he wants to stand up and fight for his country the way so many others have done.  And I asked him, "Well, what if we go to another war at that point and you have to go and you have fight and something happens to you, are you prepared for that?"  And he said, "Mom, when I sign that dotted line I'm prepared for everything".  And he's fourteen years old so I -- you know, if that's what he wants to do then I can support him for that.  And, I think, from my kids if they learn as they go I think they'll be okay.  I mean we can't control the whole entire wor-
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what everyone's doing and the best we can do is just hope and pray that everything'll be okay for them.  I mean it -- when you look at --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- our parents, how different it was for them with Vietnam and everything going on compared with their parents having Korean war and World War One and World War Two and -- you know, it's just getting more and more intense as each generation comes along.
