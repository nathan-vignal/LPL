R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Linda Smothers.
L:  Um, I'm Ginger Mumford.
R:  Oh, hello, Ginger.
L:  Hi.
R:  Do you exercise?
L:  I do.
R:  What all do you do?
L:  Um, I usually just walk, uh, on my treadmill for, uh, anywhere from one to three miles a day, about five days a week.  And you?
R:  Um, I walk but, um, I don't know if I walk five miles [LAUGH].  Probably at work I do but they always say you can't count work as well.
L:  Yeah, that's right, yeah.
R:  But maybe a mile a day.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I do stair steppers.  I have a stair stepper machine with a twister on front.
L:  Oh!  That's --
R:  And, uh, I guess that's all the exercise I do.  Besides exercising my mouth [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't do -- but I'm a waitress so I -- I do a lot of walking at work but --
R:  That's why I said -- I'm a nurse but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they always say you can't count what you do at work.  But I wouldn't know why, would you?
L:  No, I don't understand that either.  I mean -- but if you're, you know, stopping and starting, I guess, and that what -- you're not getting your heart rate up and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so ...  Um --
R:  Where do you live at?
L:  Um, we live in Oregon.
R:  And I'm in Illinois.
L:  Ah, right.  What part of Illinois?
R:  Mm, round the -- the Carbondale area.
L:  All right.  All right.
R:  I guess we're supposed to keep talking about exercising?
L:  I am assuming and this is my first time I've done this so -- how about you?
R:  Okay, me too.
L:  Oh.
R:  They kept calling me but I -- my -- didn't have -- I forgot my pin number so I got my pin number redone.  Um, my blood pressure is pretty good but my cholesterol's high but exercising doesn't have nothing to do with that, does it?
L:  No.
R:  That's what the -- so, uh, what else?  What else.
L:  Yeah.  Well, blood pressure -- I have the high blood pressure and exercise plays a big part of that.
R:  Does it really?
L:  Yeah, um, you know --  
R:  It brings it up or down?
L:  It brings mine down because it -- when -- if I exercise every day for, you know, just like thirty minutes a day or something and go in there and get checked once a week --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my blood pressure is a whole lot better.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Um, yeah, I don't -- I don't have a problem with my cholesterol.
R:  Do you mall walk or just -- oh, you walk on your, uh --
L:  I have a treadmill.
R:  -- treadmill.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, just because I live out in the country and I live on a road that's not very safe for me to walk on, so I --
R:  I live -- I live in the country too and there's dogs and stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah, so I just hop on my treadmill.
R:  But I have a long lane.  I go up and down that.
L:  You have a what?
R:  A long lane.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I walk up and down that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, not this is like -- this is out in the middle of the highway, I mean, I -- I just -- I started walking with my dog for a while and, uh, it just -- there's too many cars and stuff --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and there was no place for us to walk except for in the ditch and that was really getting difficult so ...
R:  Yeah.  Now, have you ever tired the mall walking?
L:  The malls?  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we live like an hour from a mall --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so it's not, you know, profitable.
R:  Well, your treadmill's the best thing then.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and I like it.  I can go up hills if I want to or if I just don't have enough energy I can walk a straight line or whatever and it -- it does me pretty good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think I need to exercise a little bit more but, yeah.  So, this I -- you know, I totally forgot I signed up for this and this is, I think, my second phone call tonight.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  To start with -- the first one I just hung up on so that was like, "Who's calling me?" and I realized what I had done so I -- [LAUGH]
R:  Now, once I called then they called you or what?
L:  Um, I guess, maybe that's possibly what it is, I'm not sure.  They just -- you know, they said they do it -- I don't know if it's every night or -- or, uh -- or, uh, every -- every couple of nights or whatever.
R:  Whenever somebody call ya, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know -- that first -- that first one took me kinda by surprise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Now, on your weight.  Does your walking keep your weight down?
L:  Uh, no, I'm average.  I haven't -- I actually have gained probably twenty pounds in the last year and a half.  Um, I don't -- I don't walk as much as I used to.  I don't do as much physical activity as I used to so it's, uh, not helping mu- much.  I've just talked to by husband about we need to get back into some exercise because he's gaining weight and I'm gaining weight and -- and we're not doing as much as we should be doing I think.  I don't smoke, I haven't smoked for twenty years so I'm kinda like don't have an excuse but I do like to -- to have a glass of wine or two when -- at night time and I think that's hindering my weight loss [LAUGH].
R:  I think the wine is good for ya.  
L:  Ye- well.
R:  It helps me sleep.
L:  It does too me but, I think, it also hinders the -- the metabolism or whatever they say that does --
R:  It's good for your blood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, one -- red wine is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't drink too much of the red wine.
R:  Oh, you don't.
L:  I wake up with a thirst [LAUGH] so ... Yeah.  But, um, we're still -- I'm still looking for other ways to help lose weight or to make myself feel better and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- get all the stress jobs.  Are you -- now, do you work at all out of the home?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you're a nurse, that's right.
R:  I was -- I just went back to work, uh, about a month ago.  I took off last May and stayed home for a while.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I lost weight but when I work I gain weight 'cause we eat all the time.
L:  Yeah.  And what did you say your first name was?
R:  Linda.
L:  Linda, okay.  All right.  How's the weather out there?
R:  Raining.  I just got home, I always work nights and I just got home and its pouring down.  I drove slow. 
L:  Yeah, are you --
R:  And the roads are flooded.
L:  Are you, uh, um, RN or a LPN or ...?
R:  Yeah, LPN.
L:  LPN, my sister --
R:  But it's, uh, warm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, rain --
R:  I hope it stays warm.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's not too bad out here either.  Nice enough to go walking and, you know, stay -- stay comfortable. 
R:  Yeah, this is the first time I did it.  I don't know how we could have talked ten minutes on exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless we was a therapist or something [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I'm guessing -- you know, I'd -- it kind of would have nice to have some kind of, uh, a paper to look at -- you know, figure out what kind of questions to ask on -- on what --
R:  They said it was on exercising but we talked what we did for exercising then what?
L:  Yeah, I just -- you know, for ten minutes I guess it's -- I don't know what else -- you know if we had a piece of paper that we could ask, you know, what you do, what you don't like doing, do you -- do you --
R:  Oh, I hate -- I hate sit ups.
L:  Yeah, me t- me too, crunchies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I need 'em 'cause that's where my -- my belly -- I need to exercise my belly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  The only thing big on me is my belly but that's probably part of being fifty two years old too.
L:  Yeah, I'm forty -- I'm forty five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it just kinda like hangs there this --
R:  I know.
L:  Everything else starts hanging along with it though too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah, oh yeah, you're skin.
L:  Yeah.  You're just gonna have to start exercising a little more and using some weights or something I'm assuming so ...
R:  I -- I think sit ups is good for your stomach.  What else would be?
L:  Oh, just crunchies and eating some good fruits and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I don't know.  Just -- just continual keeping yourself motivated and stuff , I suppose.  Yeah.  Well.
R:  They said they'd tell us when our ten minutes -- as I [inaudible] on here let me look.  I got a timer on mine.
L:  Oh, do ya?  All right, I don't know if it's been ten minutes or not yet.
R:  If -- if I can see it.  Let me get in the light.
L:  Oh, it must be pretty late over there, huh?
R:  Nine minutes.  We've got just a little bit longer.
L:  Little more, all right.  Well, what -- what else --
R:  Seems like longer than ten minutes, doesn't it?
L:  Let's see, let's see, do any jogging?  Do you jump -- oh yeah, I know, a trampoline, a little mini trampoline.  Do you use that a lot?
R:  Well, we have big ones.  We bought the grandkids last summer for everybody's birthday -- I got four grandkids.
L:  All right.
R:  But they're at two different houses so we bought the Jump King for both of them.  And when I'm there I have to get on 'em with them.
L:  Oh, you know, I did that with my grandson too.  And it is such a blast.
R:  I know it.
L:  Yeah, my legs were just shaking.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean I was on there for maybe ten minutes and I -- I was having such a good time but my legs were just shaking I could hardly stand up.
R:  Oh, I know, I know it.
L:  But, uh, yeah.  Some [inaudible]
R:  Gets you out of breath too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  The kids -- the kids need to do -- to do that kind of exercises, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to keep them going too so they don't end up like us.  All morbid and --
R:  Now, I have the machine that has that twister on fro- -- it's a stair stepper and then it has the twister on front.
L:  Uh-huh.  I don't think I've ever seen that.
R:  So, isn't the twister good for your stomach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was thinking it was.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I need to do that more, I guess.
L:  I don't think I've even that one.  What's that called?
R:  Um, Stepeze[?] or something.  It was at Kay's[?].  Are you familiar with Kay's?
L:  Kay's, is that a department store?
R:  No, it's a big case merchandise.
L:  Okay, no I don't think so.  We don't seem to have --
R:  Uh, we have those and, uh, in front -- it's not very big, because you can put it in the closet.  It's just little stair steppers in front and back and then you switch to the front and it has the round thing that you do the swirlies and then it has little bar bells going up the handlebars --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- different weights.
L:  So, you can do a little different -- modification.
R:  Yeah, so maybe if I did the front thing, the swiveling that might help my belly.
L:  Uh-huh.  Are you a smoker too?
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll -- that'll do some damage too so --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- that makes you not wanna do things.  I smoked for twenty years and --
R:  How long had ya quit?
L:  I haven't had a cigarette since nineteen eighty nine.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So, yeah.  It's a big difference, it's -- you know, you can taste foods and you feel better and stuff but --
R:  Save money.
L:  And save money.  Well, you spend it on other things.  You know, it -- you know, I found out -- I started saving money for like the first three weeks I quit smoking and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I found other things to spend it on [LAUGH] you know, so it just kinda goes somewhere else.
R:  Yeah, no matter what you're always gonna spend that money.
L:  Yeah, so -- yeah.
R:  So's it cold in Oregon?
L:  It's, um, it's kinda wet.  It's, um, about forty -- between forty and fifty five here.  Not bad.  It doesn't get really, really cold like back in -- I'm from Minnesota originally and it's really cold back there.  Uh, or it was when I lived there twenty years ago --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, uh, it's not, uh, anything like Minnesota weather anymore.
