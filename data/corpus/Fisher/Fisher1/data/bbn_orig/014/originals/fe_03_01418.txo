R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, my name is Art.
R:  I'm Anne. 
L:  Hi Anne.
R:  Hello, I'm sorry, I have a little cold so -- 
L:  Okay.  And we're supposed to talk about nine one one and how we have changed our -- is that correct? 
R:  Yep. 
L:  Okay.  Um, do you want to start?  Do you want me to start? 
R:  You can go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, um, I guess, ah, how is nine one one -- how have I changed my life since nine one one?  Well, actually I guess I haven't really changed it a whole heck of a lot.  Um, the only thing I have done is I've -- I've, ah, been a little bit more, you know, aware of my surroundings.  Um, I have put some water aside just in case, ah, anything were to happen although, um, I don't know why I do that, I guess I do that more for my wife than I do it for myself.  But, ah, how about yourself, have you done anything like that, put water aside or food aside or -- 
R:  Um, no, I really haven't done much of anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I remember I was a senior in high school -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the day it happened and I'd just -- I had been volunteering at the elementary and I remember coming back to the high school and learning about it all and seeing how a completely different world the elementary school was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they're just -- you don't find out about any of that stuff and -- 
L:  No.  Did -- 
R:  -- and we just talked about it in classes a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And talked about, you know, po- potential, um, other targets, other potential targets but I have never really changed anything about my life.
L:  No, I don't think I have either, isn't that interesting. [LAUGH] Ah, and I don't -- and I, ah, -- you know why, I -- I have the feeling that if I changed my life significantly then they've won. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I kind of think that the whole reason for nine one one was to try to -- to change our system, you know, to try to change -- to try to change the way Americans live their lives and I guess our most important thing is what our freedom, right?  Our ability to sit here and talk on the phone and watch the television, discuss things and move freely about the country and all that and if I changed my life a lot then I guess I would have -- I would have given into them and they would have won, huh.  Do you agree with that? 
R:  Yeah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think maybe if I'd known somebody personally that had been in one of those two places that would have also had an effect.
L:  Yeah, I think you're right.
R:  But, I mean, I -- I knew people that knew people but it didn't really have such a close to home effect on me.
L:  Right.  Now you think if you would have actually known someone, you think your life -- you would have changed your life at all? 
R:  I -- not long term.
L:  No, I don't think so either. I, ah, -- I mean, I still go about my life -- I do have to admit though I -- I -- am, um, -- I'm more aware.  I mean, I -- I -- I'm more aware of my surroun- -- oh, yeah, one change, I do carry a cell phone with me all the time [LAUGH] and I have programmed in my, ah, my wife's telephone number and my daughter's cell phone number and I've asked her of course to, ah, you know, to -- to always keep their cell phones on, just in -- if God forbid anything were to happen again I could get in touch with them, I guess, because, um, I think that would be important if anything were to ever happen, I -- I would like to be able to -- I, you know, the accounts of the people being able to call their loved ones, uh, I thought was kind of comforting, I guess, to a certain extent, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I don't know, I won't --  I guess I just won't -- I don't want to believe that they can -- they can win, they can beat me I guess is what it amounts to and if I give in then I will -- I mean, like, remember all that stuff just recently with the, ah, you know, putting the, ah, plastic up around your house and all that kind of [LAUGH] -- I thought that was kind of silly, didn't you?
R:  I didn't even hear about that.  I try not to watch the news.
L:  Oh, there you go. Wh- -- Where are you from?
R:  Um, Michigan.
L:  Oh, you're in Mich-, see I'm on the east coast, I'm near, um, -- are you familiar at all with -- I'm near, I'm in Trenton, near Trenton New Jersey.
R:  I've heard of Trenton.
L:  Okay, so, like, right after the, [MN] um, you know, the thing that happened with the, ah, -- with nine one one was the anthrax scare.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Well, guess what, we have a major, um, postal, um, distribution, I guess is what they call it here, well those letters came out of that --  that postal, um, distribution plant, I guess for want of a better word.  So there was that little scare too that, ah, I do have to -- yeah, I do remember now.  My wife does handle mail at her place of business and at that time she was near Princeton.  They have since moved and, ah, she did -- I went out and bought her plastic gloves and she did wear, ah, you know, a face mask and all that kind of stuff just in case something wa- -- was to happen.  But even at that, knowing that it was right in the area, you know, they -- they actually arrested some people in this area, um, um, concerning the anthrax and I don't know, I just figured yeah, I'm not gonna worry about it, you know, um, I'm gonna go about and live my normal life and, ah, that's the way it is.  I'm just trying to think what else I've, ah, -- what else I've done.  Other than the cell phone, put some water away, other than that, that's about it.  I -- I'm not gonna let 'em beat me, right?
R:  Yeah, I haven't just -- I mean I've had thoughts about things but I haven't, like, actually changed anything about the way I've lived, like, I know a couple of months before that happened I'd been on a trip to New York city and I'd been in the Twin Towers and I was just -- 
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And it had me thinking, you know, what if I'd been there at the time or even in the city, just had me thinking about the scare and how worried my Mom would have been.
L:  Mhm.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  I -- I -- I have a friend who's, ah, involved in the financial industry, okay, and he did know some people who, um, were lost in nine one one and  --  and he goes into New York fairly regularly and he actually went to, um, you know, ground zero and, um, I don't know, I guess it was important for him. I mean -- I -- I wouldn't do that.  Ah, I just -- I didn't have any -- any need to see that, I guess is what it amounts -- 
R:  No personal connections, no exposure.
L:  No, ah, you know, and I don't think even if I had a personal connection that I would have gone up there.  That -- that's not my personal style and I do have to tell you this, my son in law is a police officer in a town a little north of me about, ah, twenty miles called South Brunswick and, ah, he did go up there, um, after it was over and I -- I got to tell you, he is -- he's a pretty tough critter, he is an ex marine and he's a, ah, a cop, as I told you, and --  and he went up there to help and start to dig and I saw him, like, the next day, ah, he had come back the next day from --  from working, he had been up all night and I never saw him so, ah, affected by anything in my life and -- and  this guy was a, you know, he was a cop in Trenton which is a pretty tough town, you know, he's seen a lot of stuff, you know, and, ah, the one thing that I do remember that was actually kind of strange about the whole thing was that he picked up some things, ah, and one of the things that he had picked up, he reached down and picked up some paper that obviously was in the towers that got burnt and he put it into, um, a ziplock and he opened that thing up inside the house.  Man, I never smelled anything like that in my life.  It was just -- it was just such an -- the smell just, um, overpowered the entire house and it was just -- just that smell and it was a burning smell, you know, you know what I mean? 
R:  Yes.
L:  A burnt something or other, it was absolutely amazing.  But I don't know, um, and I guess as we move further and further away from it, I mean it's been what, it's, ah, almost a year and a half now, right, that I guess it has less effect on us, um, you know, and what --  what we're gonna do about it but, ah, -- 
R:  It seems like the scare's sort of out there more though with the war just starting and all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's -- I have heard people that are worried, you know, they have heard that Iraq has bombs that could reach the west coast and such.
L:  Iraq has arms that can reach that far? 
R:  Somebody does, I don't know.  Somebody over there has -- 
L:  North Korea does, they think might, but that's -- I don't think, I don't know, who knows what Iraq's got. [LAUGH] But, ah, I have no idea but, ah, -- and you're quite a bit younger than I am, right, you're about -- are you -- 
R:  Yeah. I'm nineteen.
L:  Nineteen.  I'm a little older than that.  I have a daughter almost twice your age.  I'm -- I'm fifty -- almost fifty eight so, [MN] and I have to admit it --  it was quite a week.  I -- I work out of my home and, ah, I have my own business and I -- I was able to watch the whole thing and I -- I was affected by it, I mean emotionally, but how -- I guess from that aspect that's if -- if there's one way that I have been affected -- I have been affected emotionally.
