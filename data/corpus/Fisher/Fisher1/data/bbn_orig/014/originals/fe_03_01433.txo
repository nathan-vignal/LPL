L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. Um, um, my name is Kathy.
L:  Hi.  My name's Pat.  How you doing?
R:  Uh, all right.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  Uh, I've never done this before, so I guess we're just supposed --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- to start talking about [LAUGH] September eleven?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, okay.  Have you done this before?
R:  I've done it one time.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, all right.  Well, I'll give it a shot.  Um, well, since September eleventh, um, I've been depressed and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've been, um, more, uh, involved with my family, uh, because it makes you realize, you know, just how you can't take things for granted, and that any moment, things can be pulled away from you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and uh, I've been, uh, I guess car- I guess I've been more -- making things more of a home, like uh, making sure to converse with them more.  I've also been hugging everybody more. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, I -- you just took it for granted that they were there, you know?  And -- like, the towers.  They were just always there.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I knew I'd go visit them at some time, but you know, well, you know, you keep putting it off, you know?  Um, but now, I realize, hey, you know, you can't take these things for granted, so, uh, that's how it's ba- basically been -- changed me.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, it -- it's changed me, too.  I mean, um, I plan to be more aware of my surroundings and I don't go out as much as I, um, as I used to.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  You know, 'cause you never can tell when something might happen, with the suicide bombers and all this going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I don't -- I don't go out as much as I used to, and I'm -- I -- and I just tend to be more, um, aware, even in -- inside the house, I used to leave the door open, unlocked --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- but I don't do that any more.
L:  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.
R:  And I'm always checking, making sure it's locked and, you know, looking out the window, looking at people.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  No, that's true, because I went to my doctor the other day and there was this suspicious character, kind of -- you know, Arabic or whatever looking, and he was just pacing up and down in the parking lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I double checked to make sure my car was locked, and then I went inside and I informed the doctor's office, the people at the reception.  I said, "You know, there's somebody walking up and down the parking lot here", I said, "He's looking very suspicious like he's waiting for something".  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they ran to the window and they checked it out and they called other offices and they found [LAUGH] out that it was somebody's husband, waiting --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- for her, for her tests to be over.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] oh, dear.
L:  But, be -- normally, I wouldn't of looked at that twice.  I would've assumed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that right away, that oh, he must be waiting for his wife [MN] or whoever, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now, I'm right away, like, wait a minute.  He -- he's a little, you know, like -- like the way tho- those people look, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  See?  Isn't that -- that something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's true.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I've done that, too, 'cause of, like, we have a convenience store down the street that's, uh, uh, ran by people that wear the -- the turbans?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Middle Eastern people --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and I never did pay them any mind and they -- you know, they're so nice, but ever since that happened, you know, I have it in the back of my mind, myself now, are -- are they -- are they connected to, you know, uh --
L:  Al Qaida?  
R:  Yeah, Al Qaida or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or wha- how do they feel about it, you know, the war on Iraq?  You know, you -- it -- it just -- it makes you pay attention, and you don't mean to be, um, uh, how can I say it --
L:  Prejudiced?
R:  Prejudiced.  Thank you.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You don't mean to be prejudiced against anyone, at least, I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, but it just makes you, you know, pay attention, but you're careful not to mistreat anyone, though.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But, uh, it's just -- I -- I mean, I guess it just changed your whole way of thinking.
L:  It does.  It does.  We -- in fact, down the block here, we have a gas station that was closed down for about five months because they found -- and the guy who ran the gas station, he was, uh, uh, a -- a dark kind of -- I don't know, wha- what is that -- I don't know, like Iraqi.  Wha- what you see the Iraqis look like.  He's like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I went there anyway, because I figured, well you know, that I can't be prejudiced against all these people, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they closed down the gas station 'cause they found out that that gas station was supplying money to Al Qaida.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  Now, it -- it's been opened up after the five months, but I haven't gone back yet because now I'm like, wow, they were supplying the people who we're fighting against and now, sh- you know, I'm not rushing to go back to that station, you know?  [MN] because now I feel, I feel that they -- that gas station did wrong.  I mean, I guess they were -- they were, uh, found not guilty or they paid their fines or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but still, they -- th- they were found that they did something wrong like that, and when you have these young people dying over there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And being held prisoner and everything now, of course you're going to, you know, feel negative towards those type of people.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- it really does make you -- it change your whole way of thinking, things that you wouldn't of, uh, paid any attention before, you know, you just -- you know, you just figure that they -- they were Americans or -- or in this country.  I mean, we have such a vast mixture of people --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, in this country, that you just didn't -- you -- pay it no attention, but now, it's just totally, um, uh, different.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It -- it's really made you -- I think it's made us probably also look at our lives in general and say, okay now, do -- do -- is our life going in the right direction that we've always wanted it to be?  Because, you know, any minute since now, you -- it's made more -- uh, you realize more that it can be taken away from you, so am I going the right way?  Is there something I want to change here?  Do I want to reach more out to other people?  Um, you know?  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Should your life be made more worthwhile now since -- I -- I think, like, I was taking it for granted.  This is life.  Hey, everything is, you know, the way it should be, and then when everything got turned upside down, I -- it -- it kind of mixed things up, and I'm saying, now wait a minute, is this the order I want to put them back in it again?  Right?   You know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  Mm.  Um, I don't know, I -- I've just -- I've al- you know what I found myself doing, too, which is [LAUGH] I don't know, I -- I -- I must've really been affected by this, just been pulling out the -- all the albums, you know, from -- from like when my children were babies, you know, and just looking through that.  Oh, look at -- you know, just like appreciating everything more.
R:  Yeah, and I -- and I know I've -- I've taken, uh, uh, trips and, uh, and having encouraged my family members, you know, to come on up here and see me, you never know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what's going to happen.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So you tend to want to, you know, be in touch with every -- everyone and see them and try to be nice to them and, you know, yeah -- yeah, it has -- it has definitely, um, uh, changed it because you don't know from one minute what's going to happen, 'cause we -- we never experienced anything like that.
L:  Mm.  Oh, no.
R:  I mean, that was -- that was something that we -- we never expected to happen to us.
L:  I know --
R:  To be attacked on our own land.
L:  No, we were -- we took it for granted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They -- they can't come here, you know?
R:  No.
L:  And then it turns out that they were training at our own flight schools --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Florida.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  'Cause we're just so nice, and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My two kids are teenagers and when they see things on TV or whatever that's related to this, they go -- they go, "Nobody else should be allowed in this country", they said that we're letting in too many people.  We're too nice.  You know?  "We let these people in and look what they do!  They use our stuff and then turn it around against us", you know?  And I don't know how to answer that because that's what happened.
R:  I know, yeah, I think it's a complex sit- situation because the government has so much to do with that, in that they're setting up these programs and things and dealing with the, uh, heads of state, um, of the other countries, and that's why it's -- some of those people get into this country very easily.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  Because our government has so many backhanded programs and things set up with -- with those people, uh, and some of them get better -- better treatment than the people that's born here.
L:  I know.  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- uh, it's all politics, all politically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- connected and what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what works out best for, uh, I don't know, these people, uh, in the higher ups, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the government.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it -- it's, uh, I used to work down there, by the World Trade Centre.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, uh, you know, and I was -- I was just -- used -- my dad used to work in one of the towers and we went -- we went and dined on, uh, at Windows on the World.  I mean, well, I shouldn't say "dined", we had appetizers, 'cause that's all we could afford.  [LAUGH].  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's an expensive place, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So the two of us went up there and -- and, you know, we -- we ate up there and I remember taking my kids up there, you know, to see the view from up there, and -- but we never went much because, oh, we can always go again, you know?  And then after this happened and things settled down, I -- I made my husband take me down here and to just see that gaping hole where I used to remember seeing the two towers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just, like, I just couldn't believe it, and then you -- you pick up conversation along the [inaudible] street, people talking about it and every -- everybody is just, you know, talking about people they knew who died, people they knew who -- who just made it out.  The lady who lives across the street from me, um, she was down there when it happened and sh- she --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- was affected and she had to walk -- she had to -- in fact, her mother worked -- I used to -- I used to work at the Federal Reserve --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her mother -- her mother was working across the street from there, and um, 'cause I don't know what's acro- across the street from there now, and her mother, she -- her mother is in a wheelchair, so she had to go -- she was -- she was supposed to be working at the towers, but she hadn't gotten there yet, and then the whole thing happened, with the coming down, so she walked over to get her mom and her mom is in a wheelchair, so she had to -- she got her mom out of that building and they had to walk uptown until they could finally get to a working subway, and then they had to finally make their way back to, uh -- where did the mother live?  I think the mother is -- yeah, the mother is in Brooklyn.  She had to get her to Brooklyn and then she had to get herself home to her area, you know, because she has a husband and a son.  And she said that it was ju- she said they hid when this -- when then -- when the buildings were, um, coming down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her and a bunch of friends, they -- well, co workers, they hid under one of those, um  --
