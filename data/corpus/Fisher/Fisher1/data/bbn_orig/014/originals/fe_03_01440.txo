R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Scooter, I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Hi, how are you doing, my name's Fred, I am in Tampo, Florida.
R:  Oh, well, we're on the same coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, what kind of changes have you made since, ah, September eleven?
L:  Well, um, I -- to be honest, ah, it's more a mental than a, like, material.  I don't -- I haven't prepared in any way or cha- really changed my lifestyle much except I just think more about, ah, ah, you know, I think more about it.  I haven't really done anything, like, material, like, y- -- what about you? 
R:  Well, that day, I went out, I filled up all my gas cans, I refilled all my propane tanks and I started collecting jugs of water.  I would rinse out like the -- the gallon milk cartons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I must have about fifty of those in the basement.  I have always had duct tape and, ah, and plastic here for -- for a variety of reasons but, ah, it -- it changed my way of thinking quite a bit.  I haven't been into New York City.  I am forty five miles west of Manhattan as the crow flies and I haven't been in New York since, ah, and if I do go I wouldn't take, ah, a bridge or a tunnel, I would take one of the ferries across.
L:  Yeah, I can imagine if I lived up there it would be totally different and, ah, -- and, I mean, I don't want to be naive but being, you know, where I was, ah, -- 
R:  Were you in Florida when it happened? 
L:  Yeah, and I know there was the whole Florida, you know,  connection --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with terrorists and stuff, so, I mean, it was kind of close to home in that respect but not, like, you know, maybe you could probably even have seen smoke and all of that, ah, -- 
R:  No, I wasn't that close but I'll --  I'll tell you it --  it always struck me that to the rest of the country, um, in many ways this was a -- a TV show.  I mean it wasn't, um, -- it wasn't down the street, it wasn't -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- necessarily people that you knew.  I mean, whole neighborhoods in --  in Jersey here were affected, you know, from, ah, two families, um, to some areas fifty families -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were affected by it and, ah, it -- yeah, it changed a lot, I mean it changed the way I think about things, it changes the way I, ah, [COUGH] -- pardon me -- the way I do things, um, and, ah,  it -- it -- I -- I've always been like a mom's apple pie American kind of guy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think I am even more rabid as relates to what we did in Afghanistan and what we are doing in Iraq than I would have been beforehand in terms of supporting it. 
L:  Right.
R:  Supporting the whole effort and what not.  Um, yeah, I even got the -- the potassium iodate pills that you are supposed to take if they go after a nuke.
L:  Right, well, you know, when I was talking about mental, I -- everything that you said that you went out and did [MN]-- I feel stupid to say it but I've been thinking about doing it ever since, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I did my research about that too.  I was gonna buy some of that because we have, ah, nuclear facilities close by.
R:  That wouldn't be a bad idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That really wouldn't be a bad idea simply because look, even if there's just, ah, an accident without any al-Qaeda or terrorist, ah, participation, um, those things are handy.  I know that in Jersey, especially central Jersey where my girlfriend lives down by the shore, they handed out these pills to all the postal workers.
L:  Really, hm.
R:  Yeah, they've all got it.  Listen, I was trying to get Sipro[?] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- back in -- back that fall but my feeling always had been that it was domestic, I didn't think that it had anything to do with -- with overseas and I think that that's what they finally concluded, that it was somebody, you know, like, a [several inaudible words] debate type -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- who, ah, was responsible for, ah, for that type of thing.  What about your neighbors, what kind of, um, preparations or changes have you seen them make? 
L:  You know, I -- I haven't seen anything, although the one thing I have noticed, ah, is just increased security.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I know -- there's al- -- it has been ever like since that happened there has been like a palpable sense -- well, actually now I think within a month of it happening, um, you know, it might have not been within a month, but -- 'cause all the -- after, when they started mailing the, ah, you know, the anthrax letters and all that, some time when that was happening I went to the store and I saw a guy in a van had New York licence plates and there was actually a big pick up truck and he was of middle eastern descent and he was asking directions -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, in town and I remember being really spooked by that and -- and, um, ah, once again it's just a mental thing.  I noticed that, ah, ever since then I have just noticed and still it's kind of like a palpable sense of, like, more vigilance. 
R:  Oh, sure, Yeah, you -- you -- 
L:  You notice things. [NOISE]
R:  You're looking over your shoulder. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's not unusual, ah, -- an unusual thing to feel at all or to start to do.  I mean, um, sure you look at everybody with, um, a jaundiced eye. 
L:  Yeah, ha.
R:  You know, I know I do that, you know, and when I see, um, for example, for a while I was working, ah, -- I'm retired and -- and so I like pick up a job here, pick up a job there just to -- to keep out of trouble and off the Internet. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And I was working at a -- a lube shop because I like to work on cars, although my background is in television, and there was a guy came in, Arab guy, white van --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- packed full of stuff, packed full of boxes --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and I'm looking at him too --
L:  Yeah, ha.
R:  -- you know.  I mean, I went up to him and I said, "So -- so Abdul, where's the anthrax". 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  And he gave kind of, like, a nervous laugh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, so yeah, all those things, they all, ah, play into it, they all affect it and I think if, um, -- if there's any kind of changes people have made it's -- it's an awareness of their surroundings -- 
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- and perceptions of people. 
L:  I'm sorry to interrupt but I thought of something that I really, ha -- this -- this sounds so, um, petty but it's something that -- it's a behaviour that I've changed since then and, um, it actually was that, um, I was growing my beard out last year and I noticed that I got a lot of -- because I have dark hair -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and I'm dark complexioned and, ah, I noticed that, like, you walk into the supermarket and everybody's head turns, you know -- 
R:  Sure. 
L:  -- because I have like a bushy black beard.
R:  Yep. 
L:  And it really made me uncomfortable because I sensed it like everywhere I went.
R:  What -- what is your ethnic background?
L:  Um, I'm from Puerto Rico so I have tall, dark, you know -- I'm easily mistaken.
R:  Right, so you have like an olive to dark skin complexion. 
L:  Right.
R:  Sure. 
L:  And, ah, it made me really uncomfortable.  I go to the library a lot and I just got sick of, you know, literally all the  heads turn, you know, and you can just sense kind of like --
R:  You see, I didn't have to deal with that at all because I'm blonde and blue.  
L:  Yeah, ah.
R:  They pretty much left me alone because there haven't been many swedes that have come over here -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and blown shit up. 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but, yeah, that -- I know, um, I know this one Pakistani guy who because of his accent was being looked at, you know, [MN] in terms of, you know, when he was out and stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at that time the Pakistanis were like our friends, I mean they were helping us -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- get into Afghanistan and stuff.  Um, yeah, I can -- I can see that as --  as being something that would be a real --  real change that you would have to make. 
L:  Yeah, it [inaudible] 
R:  I know that -- that many Arabs here have changed their, um, -- in -- in -- in the first few months they changed their -- their patterns of shopping and things like that and there were volunteers that would go with them, like when the women had to go to the supermarket or the kids -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had after school or whatever because there was some, ah, um, retribution that was looking to be exacted on these people that, ah, volunteers who were completely non arabic looking would go with them --
L:  Mhm. I --
R:  -- just to help keep them safe and stuff. 
L:  I heard about stuff like that on TV and, by the way, I did want to, ah, comment on what you said and -- about it being for most of America sort of like a TV show.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I -- you know, unfortunately I have to kind of agree with that.  I mean, it's not that it wasn't horrible but -- 
R:  It wasn't you. 
L:  Yeah, I mean it [NOISE] -- yeah, it's -- [NOISE] 
R:  I mean if they start striking again and they hit Demoines, then they hit Butte, then they hit Portland, then they hit, ah, Alkimino[?] and then they hit El Paso, that's when it's going to bring it home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the rest of the country.  But in terms of -- of anything else, they played it over and over again. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's like instant replay of a football game.  It just, was a TV show.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was just a television show.  I mean, I wasn't surprised when it happened, I had the TV on when the first plane struck and I called my girlfriend and I said, "It's started" --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- and I just remember having a real calm, like I wasn't panicky, I wasn't, um, freaked out, I wasn't saying, "Oh, my God", I just -- okay, it's begun. 
L:  Right, I -- yeah.
R:  You know, it -- it was just -- I startled myself five minutes later how calm I was compared to what was going on. 
L:  There -- I -- I -- through the whole time I -- I always felt sort of -- I also felt that kind of calm, it happened sort of thing because, you know, it's just one of those things like -- like, [MN] you said happened.  I'm sure you've been thinking about it for years, you know, that you've been under that -- that kind of threat.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  But, ah, I -- I felt through all of that, sort of like a sense of unreality too, like, because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of all the continuous coverage, like ... ah, you're absolutely right about it, you know, being kind of like a TV show because there was that sense of -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I hate to say it, it makes me sound just kind of callous, you know, but -- but yeah, it was -- it was just so strange.
R:  That doesn't make you callous at all.  It -- it -- it -- it was surreal. 
L:  Yeah, yeah it was.
R:  I mean it was just surrea-
