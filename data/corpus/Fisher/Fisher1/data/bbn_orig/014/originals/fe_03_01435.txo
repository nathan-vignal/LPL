R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi, my name is Raymond, how are you doing? 
R:  I'm fine thanks, my name is Florence. 
L:  Hi, Florence. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, September eleven. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And, um, -- well, I -- I don't think I made that much life changes, you know.  But, um, I don't know, I haven't really made any considerable -- considerable life changes, how about you? 
L:  Well, um, I'm originally from New York City, I was born there. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And I recently, ah, recently went back in the year two thousand. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Ah, because my grandmother was not feeling that well. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And the year two thousand and one also. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I stood on top of the World Trade Centre four months before the attack. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  And I got a lot of pictures and everything. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But, ah, I -- it touched me because, of course, it was my home town. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, ah -- and I am a veteran of the United States Navy. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So I have lived in foreign country, Japan and I have visited Thailand and Hong Kong and, ah, Kenya, Africa. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, um, I have been in other countries. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Philippines, ah, so I -- I did get a taste of how other people think of Americans. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And they do have a small point but not all Americans are -- are, um, are what -- what they -- you know, what they are saying they are. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I find that a lot of people are self centered and all they care about is themselves.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Um, and they are -- 
R:  Americans or generally?
L:  Americans. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Are -- are -- are -- are taking their freedoms for granted and stuff. 
R:  True. 
L:  So, ah, in a way -- I'm not a very political person.  But in a way -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- the -- and I'm not -- I'm not -- by no means am I condoning the terrorist attacks, I think they're a bunch of cowards but they do have a point as far as how America treats, ah, third world countries and this and that, although we do -- we do a lot for the world.  I mean, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a lot of non profit organizations like Feed the Children and stuff like that but as far as I'm concerned, um, I didn't make any real changes in my life. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I've always been a very friendly person. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, ah, -- and I've always been a very vigilant person, I always watch around me.  You know, born and raised in New York city you watch your back when you're walking down the street. 
R:  True, yeah. 
L:  You're very aware of your surroundings.  So, ah, as far as changes go I haven't made any drastic changes, I've always been vigilant, I've always been willing to help somebody that needs help. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But at the same time I've always been suspicious because there are people out there that scam, that do take advantage of the honest --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- good samaritans. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Ah, ... so, but as far as change, no, I'm not -- I have not -- I haven't made any drastic changes in my life. 
R:  I haven't either --
L:  No.
R:  -- so, um, I do think about what happened, you know.  I'm not from this area but I used to visit New York. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And since that incident I haven't been yet again even though I've always -- you know, I -- I have a feeling, like, I would like to go visit, I'd like to go see New York again. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] it was a nasty thing, it was, you know, like you say, a cowardly act and my -- my -- my heart goes to everybody in general, especially people who are really, really closely touched. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, --   
L:  I feel worse -- I feel real bad for the Iraqi people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --  ah, as a country.  They -- they have been under that guy for the last twenty, twenty five years, whatever, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was nothing but a blood thirsty, ah, greedy, ah, terrorist, him and his two sons and, ah, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they don't need to be in a position of power in a country like that.  Now, unfortunately there's a few other countries like that and -- 
R:  There are many countries like that.  In Africa too. 
L:  Yes, in Africa I know.
R:  Many, there are.
L:  I know.  Ah, and we tried to do our best in Somalia and we got, ah, pooped on, you know --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and all these people that say peace, peace, peace --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- they're, you know -- it's like this --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you can't turn the other cheek like for so many times before you're -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you're walked all over on so you have to stand your ground and you have to fight for what's right and that's just the way it is.  It's the law of the jungle, the strong survive. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And if you allow yourself to be weak and trampled on, then their just gonna trample on you more and more and more. 
R:  More and more, exactly. 
L:  That's right, so all these guys that are shouting peace, peace, peace, you know, [MN] they need to wake up and smell the coffee -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we're -- we're not over there strictly for the oil.  I mean that is a big part of it but it --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- but the major part, what sold the war to us is the terrorists and, you know, Saddam was a terrorist, ah, you know.  I think Syria needs to be next and, ah, --
R:  Yeah, people are saying that.  But -- but then have we forgotten Bin Laden? 
L:  Have we what? 
R:  Forgotten Bin Laden. 
L:  No, we're still in Afghanistan. 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And we're still looking for him but he's not gonna be in Afghanistan. 
R:  No. 
L:  He's gonna be in one of these other Arabian, ah, Islamic, ah,  states. 
R:  Uh-huh, and he -- he will go to a little small place. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And by the time we realise who is behind it, God forbid, that he will have caused even more havoc. 
L:  Well, he is working on it even as we speak. 
R:  I'm sure, I am sure of that, yes. 
L:  So far as far as life changes go I think we all need to be more aware of our surroundings.
R:  Yes.
L:  We all need to take -- to stand our ground and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to stand up for what's right.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  If we see something that's not right, too many times, and I have seen this, being born and bred in New York city, too many times people look the other way -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they pay -- and they pay no attention to them, they mind their own business but guess what --
R:  It comes around, it comes back.
L:  You know, that's not right. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You've gotta stand up for what's right. 
R:  And I think [inaudible] and I think that a little bit more that we need to trust God more, we need to pray, you know. Wh- -- 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Yeah, we need to really trust God and pray more. 
L:  But unfortunately, now that you mention God --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- the other -- Saddam and Bin Laden, they are fighting for God too so --
R:  Uh-uh, they -- they have a twisted mind. 
L:  They're -- they're evil. 
R:  They are evil. 
L:  But -- but they are claiming that they're -- they're doing God's work. 
R:  No, no, we know -- you know that and I know that --
L:  That's right.  
R:  -- they just using that as excuses.
L:  That's right.  
R:  'Cause I -- I -- I mean, I -- I think they are really crazy, they are out of their minds, period. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  And that's possible because people can't be so fana- fanatic in their belief that they have a twisted mind through and through. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But in his own case he becomes so bad that he even has the minds of the follower, you know, along with him. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, I know some people are against him, you know, from his own country. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  But people are -- some people are with him too. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  You know, some people are with him. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  So, how could he be that crazy that he will get people on his side?
L:  Because those people are crazy too. 
R:  Ahah, you see. 
L:  I know -- I know dogs that are smarter than some of those people, you know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And --  and I'm not saying, "Oh, you know, Islam", I'm just saying people in general. 
R:  People in general, yeah. 
L:  Yeah, you turn on the TV and look at Jerry Springer and there are nothing but Americans on Jerry Springer. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're -- they're as stupid and ignorant as -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of these Islamic and other third world country people. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you got a lot of smart geniuses in these third world countries, too, so -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- the human animal goes from way below just above monkey and dog to --  to almost God like as far as intelligence goes --
R:  Go ahead, yeah. 
L:  -- and talent and unfortunately that's just the nature of the human animal.
R:  Human, yeah.
L:  And we gotta deal with it and, ah, -- unfortunately the United States being the world power that it is, is also the police of the world. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  We have to make the rules and set them and there's going to be -- 
R:  Yeah, but I don't know, I don't believe -- I mean, I don't agree to that wholeheartedly, because, yeah, the United States is there, it's trying to bring peace to all the -- but I can't but feel in my mind that there's more selfishness in it than there is, you know, security -- 
L:  Of course. 
R:  --  reason, or whatever.  And that -- that -- that upsets me kind of because I look at it, like, there are some African countries, where, you know, something similar going inside Saddam's country's going there to.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  "But is America wise enough to help?  No."  Why they are not because -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- there is not much to gain from that. 
L:  Ah, exactly. 
R:  And on -- on that point I can't budge, you know. 
L:  Exactly.
R:  I give them less marks here, you know.
L:  Yeah, you've got a point and --  and --  and that's exactly what I --  I tried to say earlier --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- about politics.  I hate politics.  You have -- you have Unicef -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have, ah, all these, ah, ah, non profit organizations -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are either backed by a church or something [NOISE] --
R:  Hello?  Ahah.
L:  -- and they are doing God's work and they don't -- and they don't see -- they don't -- they're not seeking any profit from it --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- they're doing God's work because that's their calling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's -- that's not the job of the United States government.  The United States government unfortunately is a money making, ah, -- and most governments are money making --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- businesses --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if they don't make money then there's no interest in whatever -- 
R:  In whatever, yeah.
L:  -- but like you said, I mean how long has Bangladesh been poor?
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  How long -- how long has India been poor?
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And, ah, and a lot of countries in --  in Africa --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, --
