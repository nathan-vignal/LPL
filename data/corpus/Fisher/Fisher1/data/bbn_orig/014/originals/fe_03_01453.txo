R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Nancy.
R:  Hi, I'm Laurel.
L:  Hi, how are you?  
R:  Good.
L:  Um, so now we just try talking, or --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  I'm actually on a bus to New York right now.
L:  Oh, you're kidding me?  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, God.  [LAUGH].  I mean, is it a bad time for you?
R:  No, no, it's fine.
L:  Oh, good.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But you're actually on the bus?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's so funny.
R:  [LAUGH].  And --
L:  I'm making -- I'm cutting strawberries for my daughter for her -- for her dinner.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  Um, so I guess, have you -- you've probably had to make more changes than myself since September eleven?
R:  Um, yeah.  I -- like, I live, like, uh, ten minutes from the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And my --
L:  Where abouts?
R:  Um, Tenafly[?].
L:  Oh, I work in Fort Lee.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's cool.  [LAUGH].
L:  My name's Nancy.
R:  Uh, yes.  [LAUGH].  I'm -- I'm Laurel.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know if you heard me before?
L:  Yeah, it's okay.  
R:  Um, so --
L:  Were you in New York when it happened?
R:  No, but my sister was.
L:  Yeah?
R:  'Cause she goes to NYU.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I was pretty affected by it, I guess.  You know [inaudible] walk, like, bridge and stuff?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I --
L:  Like, scared?
R:  -- I mean, I guess I'm scared.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH].  
L:  That was great, because I was at school.  I -- ca- I work in a preschool, so I was in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Fort Lee and, um, I had just had a baby and the baby was with me and my husband called and he was, like, get home right now 'cause, you know, he thinks, Fort Lee, he thinks I'm, like, you know, at the bridge, which I'm close, but not that close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he said, "Get home right now.  I don't know what's happening", and um, you know, meanwhile, I'm the director of a school and I have a hundred and ten kids in my care, you know?  It was just very stressful because what do you do?  Do you, you know, take your newborn baby and run?  Because I wasn't even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposed to be there in the first place, I was on maternity leave, um, but we had parents that -- a couple parents who, you know, were there and I had a couple, um, of my staff who -- whose husbands worked nearby and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was just very scary.  Um, you know, as far as, like, making any changes, I mean, as far as -- as myself personally, I haven't really done much.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, I guess -- I guess this last time, you know, with everything, with the war and everything, I mean, when I went food shopping I, you know, got maybe like a can of soup that I would never have bought before, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not really.  If something's going to happen, it's going to happen, and you know, what are you going to do?  But as far as school goes, I have kids that aren't mine, so we had to -- we got water and we got --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, foo- like, we got food and stuff like that, because they're little.
R:  Right.
L:  So, what do you do in the city?
R:  What?
L:  What do you do in the city?
R:  Oh, I don't go into the city, re-
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, I -- I got a --
L:  Oh, you're just -- I figured you worked there?
R:  Oh, no.  I -- I'm no- I go to school in Boston.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, like, you're -- you live in Tenafly and you're in, like what, university?
R:  Yeah.  I go to Boston University.
L:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
R:  Um [LAUGH].  Yeah, I don't --
L:  What are you going to school for?
R:  Um, speech and language pathology.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, wow.  My -- my daughter, um, has speech therapy.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  She just left, actually.  Yes.  
R:  [LAUGH].  I used to do it [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess it's how I got interested in it.
L:  She just got the -- she just got the tubes put in her ears.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And she's talking so much more now, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what a difference.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, what, are you just home for -- for the holidays, like, spring break?
R:  Um, no.  Yeah, well, [inaudible] this weekend --
L:  Wow.
R:  And oh, all of the schools in Boston have off -- one day for teachers' day.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So, it's a long weekend.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, how did you get involved in this, if you're not really home?  It's everywhere?
R:  Um, yeah.  They, um -- we have, like, a quickie job office thing, where like, you know, they have all these, like, jobs and things that actually -- like, if you want to do, like, one time, quick jobs or whatever?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they have [several inaudible words] studies of other things, so they had this study posted.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I called the day they signed me up for it.
L:  That's so wild that you live in -- like, you got -- you signed up in Boston, then, right?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That's so funny.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And that you live, like, right near where I work.  Cool. 
R:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you live in Jersey or --
L:  Yeah, I live in Montville.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's, um, kinda -- you know where Villabrook Mall is?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's out there, off the eighty.  So, I have -- it's like, about thirty -- not even thirty miles from -- from, uh, that's what the George Washington Bridge kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  That's so --
L:  So, how much longer do you have in school?
R:  Um, just until, like, May twelfth, like about.
L:  Yeah, but are you -- like, what year are you?
R:  Oh, I'm a freshman.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  So, you like it?
R:  Yeah, I really like it.  It's good.
L:  Boston's really cool.  It's a cool city.
R:  Yeah.  It's a --
L:  What was it like in Boston after September eleventh?
R:  Oh, I was -- I was still in high school.
L:  Oh, you weren't there yet?
R:  Yeah.  But, um --
L:  Has anything been weird with, like -- like, I know here, when you go over the George Washington Bridge or -- I mean, not the George Washington Bridge, when you go to, um, like Billington Tunnel, I went to see a play the other day and the -- you know, the armed guards are there in their camouflage and do you see any of that in Boston?
R:  Um, not real- like, not too much.  Um, I don't know.  It's, um, like --
L:  I'm sorry, what did you just say?  She -- she's humming.
R:  Sorry, is my phone -- is my phone breaking up?  'Cause --
L:  No, she's humming and I can't hear [LAUGH] you.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Um, not there's not -- I don't know, there's not too much, or like, it's not -- like, there's a lot more security in New York than there is, like, in Boston.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- 
L:  Has your family -- did your family, like, freak out and everything?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I called -- 'cause my mom couldn't, like, get in touch with, um, my sister on the day that it happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I call- me and my sister --
L:  How far is NY -- is NYU from the Trade Center?  See, I don't even know.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's pretty far, but my sister lives at a dorm that was, like, a few blocks from the Trade Center, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- her dorm was evacuated and everything.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's scary.
R:  I -- I usually -- it's been a while, so I don't know if -- I don't know, I feel it's so -- um, I know at the time, like, my mom's best friend from high school died in the Trade Center -- he was a bro- some kind of a stockbroker or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I guess, um, I -- I guess I have to say I took less things for granted and stuff like that, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know if I [LAUGH] just like, I don't think about it all the time.  You know, you --
L:  I think mostly everything, like, changed us.  You know, like um, like society just changed in general.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like my husband won't fly and it's --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  It's just annoying to me.  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, if something's going to happen, it's going to happen, you know?
R:  Right.  
L:  But, like, he didn't like to fly in the first place, so I think this is just like his crutch at this point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, so last, uh, last May we wound up -- it was our five year wedding anniversary, we were supposed to go to Las Vegas, so instead of going to Las Vegas, we drove to Myrtle Beach, so I'm like -- oh, I hate --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- being in the car.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And it's like, we have a baby.  I mean, come on!  [LAUGH].  Like, nothing's going to happen.  
R:  Yeah.  A few, uh -- oh, in February, there was, like, a scare [inaudible] that, um, that there was going to -- there was going to be some sort of biological --
L:  Yeah, this February, it was like February fourteenth or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's when I went food shopping and I got, like, a couple other things, but no big deal.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Me and my friends were all supposed to go to New York for the weekend --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my friends from school, and the two of them got really scared and the night before, they're like, "We're not going to go", and I was, like, you can't live your life like that, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  I know.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, like, people are buying, like, duck tape and pap- like, the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the -- the insulation.  I'm like, you really think that a roll of duck tape is going to help you?  I'm, like, come on!
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, meanwhile, everyone else is dead and you're going to be cooped up in your house and, um, die of --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- starvation eventually, or suffocation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, ridiculous.  Um, I have -- one of my -- one of my best friends growing up, her brother was killed.  He worked, um, uh, he -- he called -- he was able to call his wife and tell her -- tell her that he was okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they never -- they -- you know, eventually they -- I think he was one of, like, the last four bodies that they found.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But that was really tough because, um, she's since moved to, um, South Carolina and I don't talk to her as much and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, it was just a very, very awful thing.  I mean, she -- she wouldn't even fly to get here.  She had to drive to get here and, um, just the whole process, and I think we've gotten closer as a result because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we just talk more now and -- and it's just -- you know, it makes you -- like you said, you know, it takes things for -- you know, as grant- for granted like you did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, like, you know, it kinda renews some of your friendships a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  That's sad.
L:  But, um, it is --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- sad.  But luckily -- it -- it's funny 'cause I -- I work in Fort Lee, the majority of my family is, are -- are, um, here from, like, Japan and Korea because of the Fort Lee area, they're here on business and they work in the city and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- only one parent was in the building and, um, he was able to get out, so it was --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- it was unbelievable, because we have two schools and we have probably about a hundred and seventy families and only --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one -- one parent was, uh, was in the building, and he wasn't even hurt.  So, it was --
R:  Wow.
L:  It was incredible.  Very lucky.
R:  Yeah.  There are a lot of, like, cases like -- uh, like my one friend, his -- his mom works on the top floor, but she --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- was, like, happened to, like, not go to work that day.
L:  Not be there th- yeah, that's crazy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My brother in law was actually at the ferry, um, on his way over --
