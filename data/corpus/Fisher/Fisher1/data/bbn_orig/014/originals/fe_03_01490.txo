R:  Hi, this is Jen.
L:  Hi, I'm a Jennifer too.
R:  Oh, well, hello.
L:  Hi, how are you? 
R:  Good, how are you? 
L:  Good, thank you.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm in Minnesota [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, I'm in am- oh [LAUGH] -- I forget where I was.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Not really [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] well [LAUGH] yeah, I know what you mean, the upper mid west can be a little dull, but.
R:  Well, I actually -- I was in Chicago, I grew up in Chicago, but now I'm in Southern Illinois at college.
L:  You grew up right in the city? 
R:  Ah, right outside of it about --
L:  Cool --
R:  -- twenty miles.
L:  Cool, neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I grew up in Minneapolis, so I'm sure --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we're somewhat similar [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] Possibly, I've never been.
L:  [LAUGH] This is my first one of these phone calls [LAUGH]  
R:  Me too, I don't know what I'm doing.
L:  [LAUGH] I know it's so weird I just signed up today.  My --  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- mum told me about it and I said, "Okay" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about September eleventh.
R:  September eleventh -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what did we do different after it?
L:  Yeah.  That's a hard one -- 
R:  I cried [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, I, ah, did too.  I -- I remember that morning, I was -- I had just gotten laid off actually, ah, --  
R:  Oh, no --  
L:  -- a week or two earlier, so I was sleeping at the time and, um, because I figured I'd be -- would treat it like a vacation for a couple of weeks at least [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]  
L:  And, ah, it was eight thirty central time and -- and the phone rang and normally I would just ignore the phone but for some reason I answered it and it was my husband watching, you know, TV from work and he said, "You've got to turn on the TV and see this," and it was like, "Oh, hon, I'm tired." [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's like, "No, seriously, turn on the TV."  So, I kinda, you know, blink and stumble out to the living room and just sat there for the rest of the day just numb.
R:  Yeah.  I'd actually just, ah, just started dating my current boyfriend about --  
L:  Mhm --  
R:  -- three days before that happened and we, um, -- we'd gone camping I think the night before and I was, you know, skipping class, being lazy --  
R:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, just laying in my dorm room, I still lived at the dorms at the time and I -- for some reason, like, my roommate came home and she's like, "Jen, like, did you hear what happened?"  I'm, like, "No, what are you talking about?"  She's like, "Oh, my God, you didn't hear about, you know, what happened?"
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I'm like, "No."  All clas- [NOISE] were cancelled and -- just everybody went and had like this vigil -- oh, gees, yeah, it was really -- it was really sad [NOISE] everybody, um, on campus was really affected by it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is strange because it's so far away, but ...  
L:  I think everybody a-- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everybody across the nation -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was affected.
R:  [NOISE] Well, definitely [NOISE] how --  
L:  You know as they didn't -- 
R:  -- could they not be? 
L:  It totally didn't feel like them in New York, it felt like us, Americans.
R:  Yeah, I called my mum and she was crying too, so ... 
L:  It was interesting, my very best friend's, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thirtieth birthday was that day.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Oh, no.
L:  And so that's how we spent his birthday, ah, evening was -- was [LAUGH] sitting in front of the TV ag- again, you know?  I went --  
R:  Yeah --  
L:  -- from sitting in front of the TV here at home to [LAUGH] going over to his place. 
R:  Yeah [SIGH] 
L:  Um, ... 
R:  Yeah, that's not the best birthday.
L:  No, and I stopped on -- at Target on the way because, um, I wanted to get him a -- well, you know, just like a gift card at Target on top of the present I'd gotten him, because he's -- he's a big Target fan -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- so, I -- you know, I -- it was not even real, it was like I was having some horrible dream, which I know so many people have said but it did it felt exactly like a dream when I walked into Target and the everyone is just kinda walking around like zombies, but you have to get --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- but it was like you have to get your daily stuff done, you have to buy toilet paper and --  
R:  Yeah --  
L:  -- you have to, you know, pick up [SIGH] lunch meat or whatever, but --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it just was so wrong -- it felt so wrong to be doing that.
R:  Yeah, it was -- gees, [NOISE] I don't really think I did anything, ah, too exceptionally different like after, you know, the shock wore off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know I was a lot more, um, [MN] I was a lot more somber about things.  I was a lot -- like, I took things more seriously, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As -- like things that affected the nation, like, I've never been one to be interested at all in politics, or --  
L:  Mhm --  
R:  -- in ju- anything like that and I'd catch myself now still, like, between that and the war and how it -- everyone is trying to correlate it and everything.   
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, um, I'm a lot more involved now.  I pay attention, I watch things, I watch the president speak -- 
L:  Mhm --  
R:  -- and everything.  I guess it kind of sparked me to get more interested in -- in what's going on politically in the nation.
L:  I'd say I agree.  I was never really one to watch the seat of the nation addresses and things like that but now, um, if -- if I know that something like that is going to be on I -- I make a special point to watch it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I -- I just never [several inaudible words] whatever, boring [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  He's not going to say anything that's -- that's gonna matter anyway [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's all either, you know, lies or generalities [LAUGH]
R:  Ye- definitely.
L:  But it makes -- it makes a difference now.  I know the one thing that really changed for me in the -- in the weeks thereafter was I found so many things to be so frivolous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I'd listen to the music that I love, you know, on the radio and it would come on and I'd just -- instead of -- of like singing in the car [LAUGH] like I'd normally would I'd be like -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- "This is the stupidest song about the stupidest topic [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't give -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a rat's arse. --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "--  you know, your girlfriend dumped you." -- [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]  
L:  -- [LAUGH] and I was just -- it -- I was so -- I was actually -- I got kinda crabby about things that just seemed --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- inconsequential --  
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  -- that people made a big deal about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like, even people at work, you know, somebody would complain because they gotta paper cut [LAUGH] and --  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'd just feel like, oh -- you know, I wouldn't say anything but I just feel like "Keep it to yourself there is so much worse going on."
R:  Oh, yeah [MN]  
L:  [MN] so, at least, you know, that kinda crabbiness and irritability -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, faded away with -- with like this other shock.  I think that's the best way to put it, once --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the shock fades.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it was very strange for me because I just started a new relationship --  
R:  Mhm --  
R:  And now it's been, like, what, a year and seven months -- 
L:  Mhm --  
R:  Since then, and, like, when you first get into a brand new relationship, you know, you're kinda trying to see -- kinda figure out who that person is --  
L:  Yeah --  
R:  -- and see if you guys have similar [MN] I guess views on topics and gees, we didn't talk about anything else for a couple of days just [MN] I was real depressed and sad and everything and --  
L:  Mhm --  
R:  -- he was a big comfort.
L:  That's a really good way to cut through the superficialities of meeting somebody and get right to what matters.
R:  Yeah, when you think about, you know, I met him at a b- at a bar [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] ya [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] it's not quite as romantic, but.
L:  [LAUGH] but when you spend those first few days talking about something that -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- affects you so deeply.
R:  Definitely.
L:  I think maybe that's, ah, you know, a -- a silver lining to a tragedy is that you probably got to know this -- this person that you, you know, wanted to get to know better, you probably got to know him much better than you would have otherwise --  
R:  Definitely --  
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  And it --
L:  -- at -- at a much deeper level. 
R:  Yeah, it helps you to be able to talk about other things that are very important issues as well, you feel more able to speak about them.
L:  Yeah, whereas otherwise it would be like, "So, what's your favorite color?" [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, like,  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  What movies -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- do you like?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it like -- for controversial things too, like when you know somebody's kinda view point on something like that you can kind of figure out like -- or assume rather what oth- what their other view points would be about certain issues and --
L:  Mhm, extrapolate --
R:  -- sometimes you're wrong -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- sometimes you are not, but --  
L:  Yeah --  
R:  -- it's, um -- 
L:  But you can kinda guess.
R:  It kinda us a little closer for when we brought up other issues of -- I don't know, I guess controversial issues.
L:  That's really cool.
R:  Yeah, it was -- it was I guess the big break through, but it was definitely tragic.  I didn't go out and buy an American flag for the front porch or anything, but ...  
L:  I didn't either and yet I totally -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- understood those who did [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, I did too, but then again I'm in college, I can't afford to go and buy anything [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] so -- and I know you want me to get some crayons out -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I'll do that. [LAUGH]
L:  I've lived it, it gets better, don't worry. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I don't know, English major, I'm going nowhere. [LAUGH] 
L:  Communications. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With a psych minor? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well at least communications that's a field that is, I don't know, going somewhere. 
L:  Oh, sort of. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know, poetry, I'm gonna, what, get like a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- fifteen dollars and call it a year. 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, you'd be surprised -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're writing skills translate to a lot of -- you know, a lot of industries. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right now I'm [LAUGH] I mean -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I was laid off for almost a year, I was managing a customer service department for a nation wide restaurant chain and, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we decided to build -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this central customer service department and so I, you know, had this really cool job [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- downtown and all of a sudden the economy just hanged and restaurants -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- started loosing money before anybody else and so I was -- I was gone.  It took me a -- a we- a week over a year to find another job and I couldn't find another customer service management job.  So, I'm temping, I'm still temping to this -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to this day --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, I'm putting my degree to good use [LAUGH] I mean,  -- 
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- you know, a secretary. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well, you know, at least you have a job, I'm -- I don't have one [MN]  
L:  Oh.
R:  This is my work, this mystery shopping I'm really going for. 
L:  Oh, cool. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  My mum is a survey attic she's always sending me this stuff, she's a, you know, stay at home wife kinda person and --
R:  Yeah, mine too. [MN]  
L:  Yeah, and she's -- I mean she spends her whole day on this, um -- this -- she calls it RMC, it's refunds makes cents and all they do is like trade information about where you can get huge rebates on products -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, you know, big like ten dollar off coupons at Amazon and [LAUGH] you know -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, God.
L:  -- studies that you can take, you know, where you get the five bucks for this and twenty bucks for that [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She just cracks me up, she's constantly sending me like, "If you act now, you can get fifty cents off a bottle of shampoo," [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, g- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, gees. 
L:  It's -- it's better than her --
