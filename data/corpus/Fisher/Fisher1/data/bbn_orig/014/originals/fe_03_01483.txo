R:  Hi, my name is Eugene. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Dan.
R:  Hey, Dan, how you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing pretty good, where you calling from?
L:  I'm, uh, I'm in Madison, Wisconsin.
R:  Madison, Wisconsin?  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  How many times have you done this?
L:  This is -- well, this is my third but the second one was like, ten minutes ago --
R:  Are y- --
L:  -- and it was the same topic!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's what I did, um, yesterday, this is actually my fourth one.
L:  Huh.
R:  Uh, and I wasn't -- I -- I was like, uh, aware that you can do it four times or just three times.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  But I called, um, I called the one eight hundred number and let them know that I've done it three times and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- they said that I will have to call, uh, well, they actually email -- I'm on the phone, please, come on now -- um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that -- that she had emailed the director and let her know, or let him know, that I've done it already three times.
L:  Oh.
R:  So you might wanna do that also.
L:  Yeah, I think I will if I get another one 'cause this is the third.  And, I think, didn't -- I got an email like, a week ago, that they redid the --
R:  They redid the system.
L:  -- the system or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I'm -- well, I'm hoping that it didn't forget the ca- -- the call I did before.  Maybe that's the problem, is that it forgot the calls that we did before they redid it or something?
R:  Well, when I called -- come one guy- come on [NOISE] I'm on the phone, I'm trying -- I can't hear.  [NOISE]  Because you're talking too loud.  [NOISE]  Um, again, yeah, when I called and let them know that I had already three times --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she said that the computer only had one.  But every time I got finished with a call, I would leave my -- my code -- like it said, "Do you wanna leave a message?" or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  I will leave my code and that in the -- in the -- in the mailbox, so maybe you wanna do that also?
L:  Huh.  Yeah --
R:  Okay then.
L:  -- well, I'll try to email them.  But anyway [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay, the topic ...
L:  Yeah, so you're in Atlanta -- you're in Atlanta --
R:  Yeah, I'm in Atlanta.
L:  -- you said?  My, uh, my sister goes to -- goes to college in Atlanta.
R:  George State or George Tech?
L:  Ah, Emery actually.
R:  Emery, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's a fabulous university and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you said college, I was like, okay, George State, but you said University --
L:  Yeah, right, right.
R:  -- that's a difference.
L:  Yeah, and I'm at -- I'm at Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, actually I'm taking a correspondent classes so [LAUGH] I feel a little bit shot out the way [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh no! [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that's okay.  I'm at work and I guess I go to school the same time and -- and it works -- it works for me.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
R:  So, the topic.  How -- how about -- do you wanna start first?
L:  It's September eleventh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what was it?  How -- how -- I think it was how we live our lives differently now?
R:  Um, yeah, differently, if anything.
L:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't really think -- I don't really live my -- I don't think I live my life any differently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I maybe appreciate some things more and w- and maybe worry a coup- -- about a couple of things more, but I don't think I really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- live my life any differently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's the same day to day thing that it was before the terrorist attacks I think.
R:  Okay.
L:  Anything different for you?
R:  Actually, no, um, I mean, uh, since I don't have [inaudible] to no bomb shelter --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't have access to -- you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.
R:  Any kinda underground facilities --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- or whatever have you be or, you know, I can't even stockpile, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- goods and all this that and the other! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  So basically, you know, everything -- you know, it -- it didn't -- it didn't shock me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, uh, I mean, I was not shocked that something like that would happen.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ...
L:  I think, yeah, the magnitude of it surprised me but the --
R:  The magnitude, yes, it was devas- it was a devastating blow.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but as far as it happening --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that -- that didn't shock me.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if something came about, you know, with this the new war --
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  -- that we're having now, you know.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Um, because like, there were, you know, our -- the way our system is set up, you know, we set up as, you know, um, people ask, you know, "[MN] you have the right to come and go as you please" but now that, you know, the -- the terrorist attack and all this that and the other, we've had to put more security on our, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- our -- our -- our airlines and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, for the ones who's already been here, do you see what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  Who've been programmed, you know, to, um, deliver whatever muslim factor, whatever --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- religion they believe in, you know, we have these people, these terrorists, they're just -- they're staying right here in the US.
L:  Right.
R:  And who's to say they won't, you know what I'm saying --
L:  Right.
R:  Do something while they're over here?
L:  Who's to say they haven't -- they haven't had something planned for years already?
R:  Okay.  And they planned this for years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so this is not something that happened spontaneously.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I do believe that the, um, the president, um, had forewarned, uh, they had, um, messages --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that were left and they was forewarned about the destruction, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that was gonna happen but they just disregarded it or just didn't have the time to, um, invest into it, you know what I'm saying?  You know, looking into it more thoroughly.  Um --
L:  Right.  Oh, I agree, I think -- I think, not -- not to say --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that that s- could've prevented --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, t- looking back on it, that things could've been done differently b- for him.
R:  There's some -- some protective measures could've been taken.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, you know, uh, is -- is nothing -- s- you know, n- nothing could change the fact that it happened, um --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and I do bec- -- I -- I'm glad that we are in the United -- it's not the land of the free --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- per se.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  But the fact that we do have freedom of speech --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that we're not gonna be [LAUGH] hopefully --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we won't be put to the stake for having this conversation! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right, right!  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L: Yeah.
R:  But, um, I -- I -- I do believe that, you know, i- i- if ... there's no such thing as -- you know, war has just been going on since day one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we've been fighting since the caves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So there's nothing gonna be changed about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, if we can -- you know, in some kinda way this is just -- i- I bet this is an unrealistic expectation, but we could all try to get along!  You know what I'm saying?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You live your life, I'll live --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my life.  You know?  As long as the two don't course[?] out one another, you know, have a good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Excuse me? [NOISE]  It's not my own [inaudible] here.  Yeah, just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, just insist on interrupting me.  No you don't!  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I'm at work and I have like, forty six children.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah, forty six adult children.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um -- yes you are.  [LAUGH]  So it's sorta -- I'm gonna -- trying to have a conversation with you and also keep a ear --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on what's going on.  You know what I'm saying?  So I sorta --
L:  Yeah, that's no trouble.
R:  -- multi task oriented, you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, multi tasking, good! [LAUGH]
R:  Hold on a minute -- yes?  [NOISE]  Um, actually no, 'cause I only have about a couple of inches and I don't know who they're actually for.  I'm sorry, man, these are alrea- -- here.  She doesn't get hers, so ... [SIGH].  That can tide you over tonight.  [NOISE]  No, I haven't any more [inaudible].  [NOISE]  Okay.  Sorry about that.
L:  That's all right.  [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]  Well, the next time they'll come asking for Naya[?].  No, don't thank me, don't ask me for Naya.  [PAUSE]  That's not my problem.  [NOISE]  Sh -- okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Sorry about that.  Anyway ...
L:  That's okay, that's okay.
R:  Um, so that's my take on it.  I don't know, I -- I -- I -- I haven't changed my routine.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I was a little c- -- I was little scared there, you know, when it first happened, you know, I was sorta re- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause reading a lotta stuff and, yeah, we had rumors that, you know, we were supposed to be the next target and all this and the other stuff.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm like, okay, [LAUGH] you know!
L:  [MN]
R:  Because we don't have any kind of emergency, you know, well, we do have emergency fall out shelters and all this, that and the other.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, that sorta scary there because your whole lifestyle, your whole routine, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would be changed and stuff.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  We don't have like, you know, they're used to wars and stuff, they're used to a back up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- plans and all this and the other.  We don't have that luxu- -- well, we don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have that experience, rather.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, that's sorta scary right there.  And I wish the people that's, you know, our leaders and our g- you know, over p- you know, our leaders and -- and all of a sudden, "Oh, we'll take that then, 'cause that [inaudible] racist" 'cause we don't have that kinda experience.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, to be, um, to be thrust like that.  I wish they'd keep their nose outta other people's business though.  [LAUGH]  Uh, I mean I really do!
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I'm thinking, "Let these other people" you know what I'm saying? Uh, "Fight their own battles".
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  It's not --
L:  I agree.  I'm -- I -- yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  In terms of Iraq you're saying?  And --
R:  Yes, in terms --
L:  Yeah.
R:  In terms of all of these people.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, 'cause, um, hey, you jeopardizing our livelihood.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they got their --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's good -- it's -- it's like everyone -- like, pr- pretty much everyone's against the war around here.  There's protests like, every day and everything.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And, I mean, of course --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- now that it's started dr- it's -- it's not that -- a- all you can do is just hope that it turns out the best, and, you know, so far I think it's -- it's going pretty much as well as it could.
R:  Yeah, as well as -- and hopefully as short as it could.
L:  And it -- and, you know, that's all you -- that's all you c- -- right, and all -- all you can hope for is that it's -- it goes -- it doesn't take too long and it -- and it goes well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, but I don't support the decision --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have done it.
R:  No, I don't support --
L:  But once the -- once the decision was made --
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's made.
L:  -- you know, you must hope for the best.
R:  Yeah, you know, it's made, you know, and I -- I'm not trying to -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  That's not my argument, I'm not even trying to, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not even trying to dispute it or whatever, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, they have a back up plan, they can go to a fall out shelter.
L:  Right.
R:  They can go up -- deep up under the ground --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and not have to worry about the nuclear effects or whatever have you be or the, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- adverse reactions to -- to whatever these --
L:  Right.
R:  -- chemicals and all this good stuff.  But for, you know, people like me [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know what I'm saying, the quote unquote sorta, you know, normal people or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know the low, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you know, just ... I would like to have a voice saying that, you know, "A. --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] Let me live my life for just as free as I possibly can be without the need of having to look over my shoulder and wear a mask about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who's to say that SARS, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That SARS thing that's over in there China.  Who's to say that's not a biological welfare?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who's not to say that's not -- that's not -- that -- that didn't happen because somebody -- these little scien- mad scientists concocted something?
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  'Cause I still have my, uh, [LIPSMACK] my little doubts about HIV and all that good stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  Well, who's to say that's not a -- a -- a -- a -- something that happened as chemical welfare -- warf- wa- welfare, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Who's to say?  I don't know.
L:  Never know, yeah.
R:  You never know.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, all of a sudden these new diseases coming out and they just put these new names on there and stuff like that and, man, it's scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So
