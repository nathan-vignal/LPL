L:  Hi, my name is Betty.
R:  Hi, Betty.  I'm Mary.  Where you calling from?
L:  Uh, Arkansas.
R:  Arkansas?  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm up in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  We're a long way apart.
R:  Yeah, we sure are.  [LAUGH].
L:  How's the weather?
R:  Uh, a little grey and rainy and it's, uh, about forty degrees with threatening snow.
L:  Oh.  Mm.
R:  You know?  And you probably have sunny and warm and muggy?
L:  No.  Well, we don't have sunny and then it's in the sixties, so -- but it's so -- it's just really a nice --
R:  It's decent.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I like this temperature, about sixty five degrees, so --
R:  Oh.  Before we got on topic, which I'm sure we have to do --
L:  I'm sure.
R:  -- how did you find out about Fisher?
L:  Uh, on the internet.
R:  On the internet?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.  Whereabouts on the internet?
L:  Oh, the --
R:  Forums, or --
L:  On a forum, yeah.
R:  Which forum was it?
L:  The big, big forums, the big, big savings.
R:  Oh.  Oh, okay.  I found out at, uh, Lila's Lounge. Ah.  So, anyway --
L:  Um, uh, I don't know very many of the forums, but the --
R:  No.
L:  I got one call when it first started and I didn't think I'd --
R:  Then nothing?
L:  I didn't think I'd get any more, then I got an email yesterday, that I would be getting some more, so --
R:  Ah.  Okay.  Well, it said what changes since, uh, since September eleventh.  
L:  Right.
R:  September eleventh was, say, uh, a day that will go down in infamy.
L:  Yes, it will.
R:  And it was a very scary and unhappy day.  
L:  Yes
R:  Ah, so, what changes have you made, uh, if any, since uh, that occurrence has happened?
L:  Um, I -- well, I really can't say I've made that many.  Uh, I guess I've been more aware, when I'm in a large crowd, than I used to be.  I mean, not that I panic or anything.  I just -- I -- I tend to just be more observant than I used to be.  Other than that, I don't think I've really done very much.
R:  Mm.  See, uh, over here, uh, about the uh, main thing that we have done is spent more time, uh, learning about negative, uh, cultures that have bad values and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- stuff like that, 'cause I teach my kids and, uh, teaching them how to avoid getting involved with people like that, not getting sucked up in this, uh, globalism garbage that they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- are trying to teach in school and that there is right and there is wrong and, um, you know, that those kind of things that they do is definitely wrong and -- and wrong deeds have consequences.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  And -- you know, and when they do wrong things, they should pay the price of the consequences.  You shouldn't just sit back and let it happen.  My husband, um, also because he flies a lot for his job, he uh, you know, changes he made is he had to go and sit and airports two and three hours earlier.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I'm sure of that, but --
R:  He, uh --
L:  -- sometimes I think it's probably worth it, though?
R:  Oh, well, because he flies for his job, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatnot and he -- you know, doesn't mind the security because he'd rather see, you know, the inconvenience as opposed to letting, uh, evil people do evil deeds on innocent people --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so that takes -- takes time to sort things out.
L:  Oh, that's very true.  I mean, I don't -- I've never flown, but if I did --
R:  You've never flown?
L:  I've never flown.  I -- I was --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- not been scared -- I've always been scared of flying, but -- so I'm sure that this has made an even greater impact on me, if I had to fly, and I would not -- I would not mind the extra security and waiting extra because, you know, I just feel like our security was getting to lax to start with.
R:  A -- yeah.  It -- as I say, we -- we get very comfortable, assuming, uh, we call it up here in Minnesota nice.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  We -- you know, we open doors for each other and we leave our back doors open. Uh, it's trusting, and we have a lot of people with rotten values, um, discovering there's a lot more of them than we realized you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, oh, yeah.
R:  And so we have to wind up changing what we do, which is sad.  
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  You know?
L:  It's really sad.  I mean, you know, we -- like I said, my husband's retired and we travel quite a bit, but we always drive, but if we're in a -- in a larger or -- like a big city or something, you know as I said before, I found myself more aware of people and in watching sort of what's going on, that I used to be so trusting and so it has took some of the trust that -- well, I -- I guess I'm just not as trusting as I used to.  I always wanted to think the best of everybody, but you know, you can't do that now.
R:  Uh, sad, but very true.
L:  And I try not to -- I try not to judge people, but you know, but still I'm more alert.
R:  You got to use discernment.  You got to --
L:  I think --
R:  -- be thinking.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It -- it takes a -- it takes a while.  I don't know if -- if the nation will ever get back as comfortable as they was at one time.
R:  You know, I don't know if we will or not, especially if we continue to allow, uh, foreigners unchecked through our doors, with lax policies.
L:  Don't fly.
R:  And I'm -- I'm not -- a proponent of that.  You know, I'm sorry if you are, but ah --
L:  No, but I can't understand why we're so lax.  Why do they -- they say, well, we knew there were so many, many, many here, that their visas had expired.  Now, why?  Why did that -- they not keep up with it more?
R:  Why do we have all these illegal aliens coming to our --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I'm very aware, when I look at various folks were known to have nationalities in criminal behaviors, of terrorism and stuff like that, you -- you think twice, when you're looking, you know, at people, because there's so many of them. 
L:  Well, I know that.  And that -- you know, I just really feel like that, uh, there's really a breakdown in the visas and the passports and checking and the security --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- that allows so many people into our country illegally.
R:  Right, and then with --
L:  Because we have a -- we have a humongous amount of people that supposedly is -- that's their job to do.
R:  Yeah, and um, when we have, uh -- that that's their job, but they don't really totally do it.
L:  No, I --
R:  Which is really sad.
L:  I don't know.  My daughter and her husband went to Mexico, to [inaudible] this is before the nine one one issue, um, and they came back, he -- he went over to dive, and he had his diving knives, which he didn't even think about, it was in his gear, then later she said, "Well, they didn't even open it", you know?  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, it's just stuff like that.  They were so lax.  At Customs.
R:  Yeah, well, they should be making changes, uh --
L:  Mhm.  They really should.
R:  -- you know, to check for stuff going through, you know, airplanes, buses, any place where you could have people doing, you know -- 
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- wicked, evil things.
L:  Well, this is just, you know, one incident.  Heaven knows how many more that's being going on.  But I just -- it -- like I say, it really upsets me to the point that we're just -- so much of our tax money is going to pay for all of this, and I don't think -- don't think, like, they're on top of it like it should be.
R:  No.  I -- I vote with you there. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's, uh -- yeah, there -- there should be some -- also some changes that we do along that line, about rounding up the people who are here illegally and getting them out of here.  I don't care if they've been sitting here for a year and a half.  It's -- they're illegal, still against the law.
L:  Oh, that's right.  Uh --
R:  My tax paying dollars and yours should not be used to do that kind of stuff.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  You know, to fund them and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah.  [SIGH].  And we should probably, you know, spend more of our time and efforts tracking, you know, the whereabouts of people who have known connections to terrorism, you know, because I want to be safe, I don't know about you?  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, I want to be safe.  Like I say, our -- our children are grown, but they fly a lot and, you know, like I say, they think nothing about going to [SIGH], like you know, not Rio and Paris and [inaudible] talking like that, but like I say, Cantoon[?] or [inaudible] or -- and it just scares me, every time they go out the country.  I say, "Hold on to your passport" and they say, "Mom, I know what I'm doing".  Oh, you got to bring your kit, so I don't know, maybe I'm just very cautious where they're concerned.
R:  Yeah.  Well, caution -- cautious is something that we've all been since nine eleven.
L:  Yeah, all this --
R:  Yeah, I mean, that was a very rude awakening.
L:  I was watching TV -- I was watching and noticed when it happened that morning.  I thought just of them.  
R:  You were where?
L:  I was watching the news that morning.  I was watching our regular news when they interrupted with --
R:  Oh.
L:  For that, and I couldn't believe it.  Oh, my goodness, and they were -- you know, they were showing the first one when the other one hit and I thought, "Oh", first thing I -- you know, the first thing, I thought it was an accident, the second one I thought, "Aha, it's too [inaudible]" that hit was, oh -- I don't think I'll ever forget that sights that morning.  And everything that followed, you know, the days, the people still hoping that a lot of the people would be alive.
R:  Yeah.  That was one thing that it's done, is also a lot more praying for different people and presidents and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so people have got to make decisions and choices that affect you and me.  We've done a lot more of that, uh, both uh, personally and off at church.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Since that has happened so, especially, uh, praying for you know, all those poor folks who lost family members and stuff.  We -- you know, been more conscious of that, so that's one thing that we've done differently --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since that's happened.
L:  I really believe in the power of prayer.
R:  Amen.
L:  I believe that, you know, there's no one that can do as much for us as the Lord can do and --
R:  That's right.  That's the only one who can change hurts.  
L:  That's true.  I mean, like I'm -- like, I've heard people say that God didn't answer my prayer and someone said, "Sometimes he answers it with a no instead of a yes".
R:  That's right.
L:  He always hears, and 'cause a lot of people want an answer the way they want it answered, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That's not a heavenly  bellhop.
L:  Uh-huh.  No.  And like I say, I'm sure the -- well, if it changed one person's life for the better.  I'm not saying it'd be worth, but actually saying thankfully it did.  
R:  Yeah.  I imagine it's a --
