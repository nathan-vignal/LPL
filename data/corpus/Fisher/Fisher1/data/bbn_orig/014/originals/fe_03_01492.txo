L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Debbie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how are you?
R:  Fine.  Um, my name's Melissa.
L:  Hi, Melissa.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, we're supposed to discuss September eleventh.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh boy! [LAUGH]  Okay.  So, what, um, changes have you made?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I made a very drastic change, actually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I had moved away from my hometown --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the majority of my family, you know, were still living here.  And although I had been thinking about this, um, the events of September eleventh really accelerated my plans.  I left a job that I'd had [NOISE] for twenty years --
R:  Oh my.
L:  -- and moved back home.  So I could be closer to my family.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was a big change.
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  How about you?
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I -- not as big as yours! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not a -- not a big as change --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as yours, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I got closer to family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I thought more about, you know, the people you love, your neighbors, things like that.  Um, you know, to stop and think about every day [LAUGH] because you never know.
L:  Well, I think that's equally as impor- uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as important or, uh, as what I did.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  Because you know, it's not really the big things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in life, it is the small things and [NOISE], um, I think like you I [NOISE] gave more thought to just [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- people that knew that I loved 'em but I --
R:  You didn't --
L:  -- maybe hadn't told 'em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or [NOISE] hadn't spent as much time with them as I now have, or an- and now do, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's big wake up call. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh boy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  I think this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- country was, um, given a big wake up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- call and, uh, um, hope.
L:  Do you have young children?
R:  Yeah, I have -- I have three. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I have a ten year old and then I have two under two.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  So ... it wa- --
L:  Were you at home when ...
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that happened?
R:  Yeah, actually my son was, um, only four months old and we were at home and --
L:  What part of the country do you live in?
R:  Um, I live in Indiana. [NOISE]
L:  You do?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I live in Illinois now.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  But, um, at -- on September eleventh, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was living in Louisville.
R:  Oh yeah? [NOISE]
L:  Uh, well, working in Louisville --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and actually I lived in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well ...
L:  That's way down south in Indiana.
R:  Yep, that's close enough. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty close. [SIGH] No, I, uh, [NOISE] I think people are just, you know, needed to slow down too, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and -- and take a look, you know, at -- I mean, of course it's bad when something that bad has to happen.
L:  Right.
R:  To stop us, you know, and ...
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, where were you at when it happened?
L:  I was at work.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And, um, I worked in sales and -- actually, um, inside sales, uh, I worked for a company that sold graphic art supplies.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, it was actually a customer that alerted us to what was going on that morning and, um, uh, I just really made the decision that day, it was like, "What am I doing here?
R:  Mhm.
L:  My family is, you know, six hours away from me".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, it was a great job, I had great benefits, the pay was excellent.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, none of that --
R:  It's not everything.
L:  -- matters --
R:  Right.
L:  --you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I wasn't where I wanted to be and I wasn't doing what I wanted to do and, like you said, it was a wake up call, it's like, life's too short, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody is really -- you know, we think -- we get caught up in everyday, you know, boredom and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, routines and -- and I think that's changed a lot of people's outlook on life.
L:  I do too.
R:  That you only have one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and let's do it right the first time.
L:  And I think it also, um, for me personally it gave me some perspective on the things that I complained about all the time.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]  Oh yeah.
L:  Um, I think one of the most impactful things about that event [SIGH] was the number of children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who now were left with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one parent, where there had been two, you know.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  That was heart wrenching.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] What -- sorry about my daughter!
L:  Oh, no problem.
R:  What bothered me was, [NOISE] I mean, that was, you know, [NOISE] one big thing, but, you know, of course the show's afterwards, you got to hear all the [NOISE] -- and, you know, it's hard to listen to it but it was part of it and I think the country gave -- we should've gave 'em that right to hear, like the phone calls, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that were made.  And -- and it was just so heart wrenching to hear the panic in those people's voices.
L:  Oh!
R:  And to hear [NOISE] -- to be the other person on the other line, what, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] what did they [NOISE] --
L:  I can't imagine.
R:  -- feel? [NOISE]
L:  I can't imagine.
R:  Shh.  [NOISE]  [several inaudible words] I'm so sorry.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no problem, hon. [NOISE]
R:  But that -- that's really, you know, they have -- plus the firemen and all the people that [NOISE] -- I mean, those people [LAUGH] you can only say they're heroes but [NOISE] they have to, [NOISE] you know, they really are, they're [NOISE] -- they have --
L:  Yeah, definitely.  And, you know, this is something that, um, I think the people in all of New York, uh, [MN] I think for their entire lives.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  They're just forever changed.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Well, I think the whole world is but --
R:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, but you're right, the people that went in those buildings or had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family that ... you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- went in the buildings.  And [SIGH] I just can't -- I can't imagine it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- and it -- it's something stupid that did, I kinda put myself in their place, you know, to -- to -- to try to feel what they were feeling [NOISE] just because I thought, you know, as a country we -- we owed them that, you know?
L:  That's right.
R:  And those poor women, I don't know if you saw the women that were on TV that were most -- the ones that were pregnant, you know?
L:  Oh yes.
R:  I don't know if you saw those -- the group of women [NOISE] that were pregnant when it happened and --
L:  I -- I think I did see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them on a program.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  Can't imagine.
R:  And then they -- and all those children looked just like their daddies, when they were born.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or they're, you know, it was just, mm, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] it was something.
L:  Bitter sweet, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  For everyone that was involved. [NOISE]
R:  Very. [NOISE]
L:  Um ... [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm glad that you, um, you made changes that made you happy and -- and, um --
L:  It's been a tough year, um --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [MN] It was March of last year when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- finally got back here, got everything kind of semi organized --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- it's been a hard year.  I mean, it's been a lot of adjustments --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- but I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would do it again, I -- I -- I do believe in my heart that it was the right thing for me to do.  And I think I would've done it anyway but, you know, I -- I had a plan, you see.
R:  Right.
L:  I had this -- this plan, and -- and I was, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually, this moved it up about three years.
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [NOISE]
L:  So there were --
R:  Now, do you have children or ...?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, unfortunately.  But --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, that made it easier in a lot of ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... but [SIGH] at the same time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had done the same type of work for twenty years, was very close to my co workers, I mean, you know, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I love and care about them too.
R:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]  But --
L:  But, um, I just knew that, uh, I wasn't supposed to be there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anymore.  So --
R:  So would you suggest people follow their hearts or their minds?
L:  Boy, that's a tough one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I'm sure that I'm considerably older than you, and, uh, I'll be fifty this year.
R:  Oh, I'm thirty, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, I knew with the young- younger children.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've done both.
R:  [NOISE]  And which one made you happier?
L:  Following my heart.
R:  Hey girl! [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Definitely, definitely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, I think, you know, we go through processes in our life --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and events like that --
R:  [NOISE] Uh.
L:  -- well, you just reevaluate everything.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  I know of something else that -- that, um, I think had an impact on me personally about that day, was I found myself thinking about my parents a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- parents had lived through Pearl Harbor, had lost friends at Pearl Harbor.  And I mean, that was very different.  It wasn't on -- on American soil.
R:  Right.
L:  But it was still an event in their lives that I don't think I ever understood.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Until September eleventh happened.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  And -- and especially, you know, when you said I was the younger generation, which I am, [NOISE] this generation's never experienced anything that bad, [NOISE] you know?
L:  No.
R:  And I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- not trying to be rude to my age group [LAUGH] but I think we have been spoiled, you know.  And I think we haven't seen the heartbreak [NOISE] and [COUGH] excuse me, and you know, things like Vietnam that my father went through.  We've --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we haven't experienced that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And [NOISE] I think this really -- I think it woke my generation up big time.
L:  I think it did too.
R:  You know, because [NOISE] life isn't fun and it's [NOISE] -- I mean, it should be fun but it's not all games.
L:  That's right.
R:  [NOISE] And they're -- I think a lot of kids my -- my kids! I'm not a kid anymore but --
L:  Well, I understand what you're saying though.
R:  But, [NOISE] I think my generation didn't look at [NOISE] things the way the other generation did.
L:  Probably not.
R:  And I think that's [inaudible].
L:  Oh, I
