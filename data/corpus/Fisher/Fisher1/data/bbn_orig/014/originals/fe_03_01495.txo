L:  Hi!
R:  Hi!
L:  My name is Emily.
R:  My name is Tammy.
L:  I'm in, uh, Pennsylvania.
R:  And I'm in West Virginia! [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  Very nice.
R:  Um, let's see, what things have I done th- th- that's changed?  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, we had plans to fly to Florida and I won't get on an airplane now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I won't travel.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I understand that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had, uh, plans to travel to Italy, where my husband is from, in March of two thousand one, and we actually did go because, uh, we went but I was very paranoid! [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I'm --
L:  But, I felt safer on an international flight, for whatever reason.  I -- I don't know why.  I'd say the main thing that we changed was the awareness and our daily life is very different.  Like, things that mattered before don't matter anymore.  What we find -- we were already involved in our church but we went to church a lot the next two weeks, because we had no idea what else to do [LIPSMACK] and we actually called to give blood and just couldn't find how to get there and do it because they -- you had to make an appointment and everything, it was amazing.
R:  I -- I -- I think it's changed everybody's lives.  I mean, nothing will ever be the same as it was, ever.
L:  Right.
R:  And the -- the -- the -- the sense of security that we had, you know, this is America, nothing happens here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, that's kinda all gone now.
L:  Definitely for us it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I have a five -- five year old, soon to be six year old -- who at the time was four.  And, we had the TV on constantly for the first four days, and he hadn't been asking anything, we hadn't been telling him anything, and I guess the one thing we did tell him was that, uh, there was a really bad accident, and that's why we were going to church, because a lot of people were involved, but we didn't give him details.  And, by the fourth day he started -- he was a mess, he -- he just -- everything upset him and I started to realize that even though he's not watching the television, he's absorbing it and we turned it off from then on and -- and really had too much -- too much all at once.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it -- it robbed me of the security for my child, which I really enjoyed having that security.
R:  Yeah, it's even scarier for children.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, it -- or parents who have small children.
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I -- m- my youngest if fourteen and I can't imagine having little ones. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  But even for a teenager, I think it would be even scarier --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- because they understand a lot more.
R:  Well, actually, [LAUGH] my -- my daughter, she just kinda says, "Okay, can you tell me what happens?" you know, she -- she -- she didn't even pay attention to it really.
L:  So that's good.
R:  Which is sad.  Which is sad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She lives in a cave!
L:  Great.
R:  Well, I -- I, um, I don't know, I [MN] the whole thing has just affected -- affected me personally --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I used to live in a cave and now I watch the news at least once a day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, if I don't my husband tells me, you know, what -- what he's read or what he's heard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I think I've taken dramatic steps that otherwise I probably wouldn't have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, we've began -- we've began, uh, a program of storing food in case there's an emergency.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, I actually ordered a radiation, uh, it's potassium iodide.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's -- it's what the military gives, um, or -- or people in the vicinity of nuclear plants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in case there is something like that.
L:  We actually had, um, because we live within a certain -- within ten miles of a -- of a nuclear plant --
R:  Now see, that -- that would scare me.  That right there would scare the j- beebees outta me!
L:  That was very scary.
R:  I would just be gone!
L:  They actually didn't, uh, it was scary after it happened because there was a lot of planes circling the power plant, and of course the fir- [MN] -- now when I see a plane in the sky, that's the most thing probably -- it scares me.  It never used to scare me before, and now I see a plane and I think, "Why is it there?"  And, "It looks awful low". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  But we had, um, fighter jets around the plant for, [LIPSMACK] I think, the first week, if not a little bit longer.  And that was very scary.
R:  I -- I think what scares me the most as far as fear, is that, um, I -- my husband and I have done some really heavy duty researching in the -- into September eleventh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I -- I -- I -- I don't buy everything that's -- that's -- that's being written.  I just don't buy it.  There's too many oddities and I honestly think that our government has had a hand in it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really do.  I mean, there -- there's -- there's too many things -- that's -- that's what scares me.  I mean, you know, if foreigners came here and did it because they hate us or whatever, that's scary enough.
L:  Right.
R:  But to think that our government could have -- could have some kind of a cover up, I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me, just different things like, uh, out of all the different airports that all these planes came from, they cannot provide one picture of any of these terrorists in any of the airports with all those security cameras?
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  I mean, that -- that doesn't make any sense to me.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and, you know, they wanted an independent investigation, uh, of -- of what was going on and [MN] I -- I just -- I -- I don't know, you know, it never did come about.  I just -- I just don't understand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, tha- --
L:  I think one thing that upset me a lot was the community that the whole nation was on September twelfth went away really quickly, and I just keep praying that I'll never forget how I felt on September eleventh because I'm a friendly person but it seems out in public, you know, other people aren't, and that first two weeks, you know, we were all saying hi to everybody and "How are you?" and meant it.  And that, I think by Christmas, was gone, and that was really sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it shouldn't take a tragedy like that to have people act that way, but I think it should've been that way anyway.
R:  I agree, I agree.  I -- I, uh, my brother doesn't live even ten miles from me and, you know, we -- we might talk twice a year and it's, you know, and since that happened, I, you know, I make frequent calls, I -- I see how he's doing, I go up and see him.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Um, I don't know, I think -- I think it kind of changes your perspective on what's important.
L:  It really did, it really did.  I thought I knew what was important, but, um, I -- I had it half wrong, I would say.  And now it -- the only thing that is important, what I make my priority, is how will this affect the family, and, is this good for the family?  And --
R:  And it -- and -- and with younger children too, it makes you wonder just what kind of future do they have?
L:  It very much makes me wonder that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We're adults, you know, w- we've spent most of our lives, at least half of it already.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- but they have their whole lives ahead of them and if it's this bad now, I mean, what are we gonna do for them to make it better?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, th- -- you -- you know what I'm saying?  Our children should have the freedoms that we had, they shouldn't have to go out and -- and -- and worry about playing -- playing in the yard and, you know, worrying about, you know, if some g- -- if somebody's gonna hit the nuclear plant.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] That -- that's just -- it's outrageous.
L:  And that's another thing that came up a lot after September eleventh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- with more security in certain places and how people were saying that infringes on our rights, and I just don't see it that way.  I feel safe knowing that there's going to be security checks and i- if you're not [SIGH] -- I -- I don't understand if you're not willing to go through a little bit -- you know, you can't have freedom and everything you want.  I- i- it's -- it's just impossible to have it all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we n- -- if we need -- I don't consider it giving up my rights, you know, I -- I really don't.  We went to the circus last night and had metal detectors, and I was thankful.  And I -- I -- it didn't take much longer, it took probably five extra minutes than it would if they didn't have them, and it just made me feel safe and I w- -- [SIGH] I -- I don't understand the people who feel that it's infringing on their rights because I don't see it that way, I really don't.
R:  I -- I -- I have to agree with that, I -- I do.  Um, well, I g- -- I should say I agree with that to a point.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there -- there are certain things that they're trying to put into the Security Act, uh, since September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I even forget the name of it now, my husband knows, but, um, you know, i- where they're trying to make, uh, certain vaccines mandatory --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  -- and the vaccines could actually be more dan- -- they c- -- I mean, especially for small children.
L:  Yes, that is very scary.  That is very scary.
R:  The -- the -- these -- these -- [LIPSMACK] these mandatory vaccines that they could impose on us, um, sh- -- a- and not only that but this, um, [LIPSMACK] um, the -- the security level, I read the other day that if it goes to high, that -- well, basically, um, you can't leave your home.  If your children are in school, they will be escorted to an undisclosed location and you cannot go pick up your children.
L:  But we -- I thought we were on high t- -- a week ago?
R:  The -- the one above that, the one -- the highest one.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, okay.
R:  The highest one.  If -- if it goes to that, you are not allowed to leave your home and you cannot go to the school and pick up your children.  That makes me mad.  I wrote I don't know how many letters because, I mean, yes, it's affecting everybody's lives but, you know, some of it's just pure craziness.
L:  And, we can't be away from our children [LAUGH] --
R:  No, well, you might -- you might wanna check it --
L:  -- in a situation like that.
R:  -- because it's all over the internet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you go and read about it, it's in the newspapers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, several small town schools have called into like, radio stations and sent copies of the -- of what the school has sent them.  Um -- 
L:  The school has said something to that extent.  They've sent home -- if there is ever an emergency, which we always figured this came from the power plant, since we live ten miles from the power plant we have things like that, and it said, "If there is an emergency your child will be going to this location and, uh, you are not to come to the school to pick them up, you can meet them at that location" or, you know, something like that, and I just felt powerless as a mother.
R:  Yeah.  You mi- -- you might wanna read it real close because a lot of 'em are saying that, um, y- you're not allowed to pick 'em up and that they're not gonna disclose the location until, you know, the -- the level of threat has -- has dropped again.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, you know, that -- that to me is -- is -- that to me is an infringement of my rights.
L:  Yes.
R:  Using a metal detector, no, that does not bother me because I'd rather have a sense of security that's for real than to have a false sense
