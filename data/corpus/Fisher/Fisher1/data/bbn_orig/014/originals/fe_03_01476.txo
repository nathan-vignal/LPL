R:  Cassie. 
L:  Hi, this is Kyanne.  I'm in Service, Arizona. [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  What --
R:  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sorry, this is always so weird at first.
L:  I know, it sure is. [LAUGH]
R:  How many times have you done -- have you been on this?
L:  Only once before.
R:  Oh, okay, me too, so I don't feel so alone.
L:  Are, are you in Lila's group?  Is that how you --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Are you in Lila's group?  Is that how you found out about this?
R:  You know what, no, I was just perusing the internet, and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and I just kinda -- I, I was looking for, you know, a way to, you know take surveys and make money and stuff like that.  And --
L:  Oh, cool.  I do a lot of mystery shopping and stuff like that, so I'm in a lot of --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and merchandising and things like that, so that I can take my son.  So I'm on all kinds of --
R:  What's mystery shopping?
L:  Huh?
R:  What's mystery shopping? 
L:  Oh, you're just a regular customer and you fill out a survey, when you go to a place you fill out a survey when you leave about their customer service and whatnot, and they pay you for it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Real basic stuff.  But anyway, we're supposed to talk about September eleventh or they're not gonna pay us. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes.  Yeah [LAUGH] we won't get any credit if we don't stop.  Okay.  So, to start off about Sever- September eleventh.  Well, I was -- I was affected, I was affected definitely by it because my uncle was in the World Trade Center --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- when it happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, well, obviously he didn't make it, and it kinda [SIGH] really messed up, you know, like, my whole family and stuff like that.  It was --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- so devastating.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I didn't hear from, ah, -- I didn't hear about it until I was -- I was actually at school, and I was sitting at homeroom, all of a sudden I hear something about the World Trade Center and two planes or whatever, and, ah, and, ah, at first I thought, um, well, you know, that's terrible, then I found out like a couple of days later that my uncle was in it.  So...
L:  Wow.
R:  From then -- from that point on, I guess, like how September eleventh -- how I've changed or whatever is I have definitely become more religious, and, um, I've been going more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to church and stuff, I'm Lutheran, under the Christian, and, ah, en going to church more, I've been praying more --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I've been donating a lot of -- a lot more money to, ah, to like charities that support nine eleven and stuff like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the people that fight for us, especially with the war that's going on now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just have a totally new outlook on life, you know.
L:  Wow.  So, does that affect your view on the war?
R:  Um, how so?
L:  Um, does it make you, um, more gungho for the war, that what's going on?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or make you less, I mean, does it, you know, does -- do you still -- were you ever pro military or, or whatever, or has --
R:  Well, the thing is --
L:  -- it changed that at all?
R:  The thing is, I'm a hippy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm, I'm such a pacifist that it's like, all my friends, they're into the whole, you know, you know, fighting -- not fighting thing, but supporting the troops and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  I was, I --  I was, I was a pacifist up until, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- God, a couple of weeks ago when I started hearing about what the Iraq -- the Iraqis were doing to our troops, going against the Geneva law, torturing them and stuff like that.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, um, false surrendering and stuff like that.
L:  Yep.
R:  And that really kinda pissed me off.  
L:  I bet.
R:  -- and so -- yeah.  And so --
L:  I hear you.
R:  -- then now --
L:  I --
R:  I'm sorry? 
L:  I hear you.  My husband's in the military.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  So --
R:  Oh, what branch?
L:  Army.
R:  Army? 
L:  Yeah.  So, when all this stuff happened I knew that shit was gonna hit the fan.  And I had just started a babysitting, um, business in my home so that I could be at home with my son.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he was only five months old at the time, and, um, we saw it on the TV.  And we were up and watching TV, and I was like, "Oh my God, that did not just happen." And the next thing you know the second airplane hit, and I was like, "Holy Jesus, we're in a lot of shit.  Something bad is hap-", you know, it just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- felt like a doomsday.  I was like, "Oh my God, what's gonna happen next, what's gonna happen next?", you know?  And then I'm right next to a military post, so we would hear, like, choppers go over, and I'd be like, "Hit the damn deck, something's gonna blow us up." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it sounds funny now, but at the time I really was scared, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] I bet.
L:  I was like, "Holy shit, it's my house next", you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh man.
L:  So, you know, I was, like, --
R:  I don't mean to laugh.
L:  -- scared to de- no, I mean, it is, it's kinda funny looking back on it, because I'm like, "You retard, you know." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But at the time, you know, at the time you're really scared, and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you're embarrassed that you're scared, but yet you really are.  You're like, "Oh my God, how do I even deal with this?"  And then you know that if there's any repercussions whatsoever, you know, as soon as they started pointing towards Iraq and they started pointing towards, you know, these different coun- ah, countries being responsible for it, that hits right home to me, 'cause my husband's gonna be shipped out.  I'm like, "Holy crap, holy crap, please don't take my husband away," you know.  "We got a [NOISE] brand new baby at home, don't take him away from his daddy".  But yet in the same breath, you know, he needs to go [NOISE] and do his job.  That's what he's in the military for, not to do a eight to five.  But --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- to be available to go and take care of things should it hit the fan, you know, which I totally understand and I have to get over it as a military wife, and support him a hundred and ten per cent on whatever happens.  And I totally -- I'm not one of them, "Oh, my husband has to go".  I mean, yeah, it sucks and I probably would cry, but I'm not gonna sit and wallow in it forever, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because [NOISE] being a military wife you, you know it could happen at any times, so get over it.  These girls that cry for months on end, what'd you think?  "He was gonna work eight to five forever? Come on, you know."
R:  I know. 
L:  It's just part of the deal.
R:  But you know, sometimes love is just so overpowering --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that when you lose somebody that you love so much, it's not so much that, you know, it's a shock that it happens as it is that it actually happened.  
L:  Right.  No, I understand that too.  So --
R:  But --
L:  -- it's so weird how it affected everyone.  In one way or another it affected every -- I didn't know anyone in the Trade Center, noone, I didn't know anyone, I didn't know anyone who knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm way out here in Arizona.  We don't really know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that many people in New York or in places like that, but I'll tell you, when I saw those women's group with -- the group of women that got together that have all had babies since September eleventh, and those babies that will never see their daddies, and I boohooed for those mommies [LAUGH] forever, you know.  They didn't even want to go on with life, you know, because they're at one of the most wonderful times in their -- your entire life, you know, and now they don't get to --
R:  That would make me cry.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  I saw that on TV and I was like, "I just can't watch it anymore.  I just can't." [NOISE] It was --
R:  How's your husband doing?
L:  He still is sitting in my living room right now.  I can --
R:  How?
L:  I cannot explain to you how blessed we are.  I mean, we thank God every day that he is still here.
R:  How did he not get shipped out?
L:  I -- by the grace of God only.  He's an instructor here at Fort Wachuka, and he teaches the boys what they need to know to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which sucks for them, but it's great for me, [LAUGH] you know, I've still got my old man.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So...
R:  Well you've really gotta, you know, count your blessings and stuff like that, because it's just that it's so hard to lose somebody that you love so much, and if you don't have to lose 'em, count your blessings.  Plus too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's [MN] sorry, I'm a bit tired.  Plus too it's always good to know that you got, um, ah, your husband next to you and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know that if I ever lost my fiance I, I'd just -- especially in something like this, I'd just be -- I'd be horrified.
L:  Yep.  I can only imagine what some of these, um, families have already gone through.
R:  Oh.  Like that one guy on the news, where he was fighting, he was, um, in the military, um, he was a marine and he was fighting, and his brother got gunned down in Las Vegas -- that's actually where I am right now, I'm on vacation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the marine had to come home because his brother got gunned down in Las Vegas.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, I mean, maybe that has no relevancy, but I mean, it's kind of, you know, ironic that, that it would happen to his brother and stuff like that, and that he was spared when he was the one going and fighting.  But in a way again it's a blessing he gets to come home and be with his family.
L:  Right.
