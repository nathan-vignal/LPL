R:  Hi.  My name is Elisha.  Who is this?
L:  Hello, Elisha.  This is Andy.
R:  Hi, Andy.  Nice to -- nice to talk with you today.
L:  Nice talking to you.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  We have --
L:  This is my first call, so --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, these are pretty exciting.  I've -- I've done a couple, so you just talk for ten minutes and then it's just -- they just stop.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, our topic is how our lives have changed since September eleventh.  So, well, where you on September eleventh?
L:  Um, I was, um uh, initially, uh, about uh, two minutes from my office when the uh -- when I got the news and uh, uh then -- then watched it on TV.  Uh, at the office.
R:  Mm?
L:  And uh -- uh -- so --
R:  Yeah?
L:  That was a -- that -- that def- definitely a, uh, a sad difficult day.  Uh.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it was -- mine was about the same.  I was at the -- I was at work and uh, I -- early start time, so we were all together when the thing began and so we were all sitting around the TV all day long.  Pretty much.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That was about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, has anything changed in your life?  I'm trying to think of anything, uh, in mine has particularly, but um --
L:  Well, probably my attitude toward, uh, uh, toward America and our country has probably been, uh, strengthened and -- and uh, um, certainly um, have given a lot more, uh uh thought at least, and -- and uh appreciation.
R:  Mhm.  You know, that's interesting.  I -- I had forgotten about that, but that -- that first initial wave of patriotism was really exciting I thought.  It was sort of lovely to see people flying the flag again and -- and talking about how much they love the -- their country again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was really lovely.
L:  Like, I -- I have uh, I have kids.  They're in the twenty to twenty five --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- range and -- and it was a -- it was a really, um, um, uh, really exciting to see them be brought into a patriotic situation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they -- they had not really experienced that before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Certainly not one of -- of being, um, um, of -- of looking at their -- their lives and their -- their -- the things that they had and, uh, uh, wondering if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they were going to continue the same way, so uh, I think it's -- it was good.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it's funny, I -- I'm -- I'm twenty nine, so I'm in that range, but I grew up partially in Europe and so, you know, all the ex patriot kind of have this feeling like, you know, America's this great country that we come from.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I kind of had that anyway, coming into this, but it was su- it -- it's always very odd when you come back to the States and nobody's sort of, you know, wandering around wearing the flag tee shirts and stuff and happy to proclaim themselves Americans. You forget about how --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- how quickly people forget, you know?
L:  Yeah, it is.  We -- we -- we uh, um, uh, we take things for granted very easily and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that's -- it's -- it's -- it's normal, I guess, and so when things like that happen, um, I'm -- I'm very, very much one that -- that looks at -- at difficult situations and tries to find opportunities, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, yeah, in -- in them and so you know, obviously it -- it was a horrible situation, but it happened and so um, the challenge is to, um, to -- to take what's left and -- and -- and build on it and -- and um, and find uh, find things that are positive out of it, and I think there many, many positive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things that, uh, uh, that were, uh results of it.  So --
R:  Mm.  Well, you know, you were talking about not taking things for granted, and I think that's one of the re- ways that my life's really changed, was that I -- I ah, have a tendency to keep up with people that I love a little bit more carefully than I did before September eleventh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Especially, um, I -- I -- thinking about, um, my two very best friends from college and I have -- have talked a lot more and seen a lot more of each other since the attacks, I think, than we would have normally.  We just make that little extra effort, you know, just to make sure we keep in touch.
L:  Sure.  It reminds --
R:  Which is a --
L:  -- us of our -- of our vulnerability and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and -- and --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- and frailty as human beings and -- and uh, so that's um, that's been a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, what about some negative things?  Have you, uh, have you put off any travel or uh, um, put off, uh, going overseas at all since you -- since the attacks or anything of that nature?
L:  Not -- not -- as a -- as a result of the attacks.  I -- I did -- it did impact some -- some business trips immediately following, but --
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  -- it -- one -- one of them we just -- we drove.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  One of my guys, we got in the suburban and -- and drove and that was, uh, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- that -- that was good, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, uh, we have -- just recently, the last few weeks been impacted by the -- the SARS things.  It was -- it was -- headed to China a couple of weeks ago and -- and decided to hold off on that trip for a little while.
R:  Yeah.  It's probably not too bad of an idea.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  So, uh --
R:  Well, yeah.  It's interesting.  It's so interesting now, thinking back wh- to pre September eleventh, how it's very small things that have shifted, but there is a definite mindset shift, I think, at the same time as well.  I'm --
L:  Well, I -- yeah, I -- I think that -- that uh, we went through, uh, you know, eight years of -- of really very difficult times in the administration, and in our ability to respect and -- and -- and really, um, feel like we had good leadership.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and uh, then this came along and -- and uh, we've seen, I think, a -- a very, um, honest, forthright, uh, approach to the problems, in a -- in a very direct and -- and uh, certainly decisive approach --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and uh, uh, I think the -- the -- um -- uh, it -- a -- a feeling that whereas you may not agree with -- with everything, uh, or might not, that -- that our leaders do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at least there's a -- a level of integrity and -- and -- and a, um, uh, and a follow through that's -- that's you know, professional an- and seems --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be -- and seems to be what it -- what it appears to be, and you -- you take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- folks like Rumsfeld and -- and uh, um, you know, he's entertaining, uh, at the same time he's -- he's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's direct. You -- you feel like you can trust him and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you feel like, uh, uh, you know, it's a pretty good team that's, uh, um, uh, that's working for us and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that, so -- 
R:  Very much.  Well, yeah, and even you know, the team that's over uh, in Iraq as well, you know, you just really get the -- the sense of their, uh, they've got the goal in mind this time and they're going to get it done, you know?  Whereas before, I think the first Gulf War, you know, we -- we -- we stopped a little short of where we needed to go, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And this could have --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- all been -- this could have all been over with perhaps, if we had gone a --
L:  It -- it --
R:  -- little further?
L:  -- it could have been, yeah, and I think that's one of the lessons, uh, that's one of the lessons that -- that uh, you know, probably um, is being, uh, looked at and saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't want to make that mistake again.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we -- we -- we did let a lot of people down who -- who felt that they could count on us then, and now we're suffering, uh, the consequence of -- of it being a little more difficult to get their trust and -- and uh, and support.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, because they're not sure.  Um, but uh, um, yeah.  I -- I, ah, and besides that, we get to watch our -- our money, um, you know, exploding and -- and you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] doing all kinds of things.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, you know -- you know, you sa- you said, you know, you -- a lot of, ah, business trips and things were, uh, put off and -- and right around September eleventh, but what about your business itself?  Did it suffer from the consequences of the attacks?
L:  Um, it --
R:  Have you felt that it -- that it -- that effect at all?
L:  We -- we -- we have not, um, uh, I'm in, uh, a -- actually a technology business --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- but we're in a service bureau, basically process a lot of health care claims --
R:  Ah.  Mhm?
L:  And -- and uh, um, uh, our -- our business is actually been -- been growing -- growing pretty nicely, but I wouldn't say that we're necessarily typical of the business.  We --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, of the industry or -- or uh, we just happen to be at a point in -- in the -- the growth of our company when things started to click.
R:  Mm.
L:  And how about yourself?
R:  Well, I actually, yeah -- well, it -- pretty much my primary job didn't.  I -- I'm a -- a radio producer, but I -- I -- that didn't really slack off that much, people still needed their radio, thankfully, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, I'm also -- one of my hobbies is acting and a lot of the theatres that I work for have felt a very stiff drop off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in, uh, ticket sales because of -- especially because of the war, but right after September eleventh, there was a huge downturn --
L:  True.
R:  -- in ticket sales.  People just didn't want to leave their houses, which is completely understandable.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, no, it really affected it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I had involvement in -- in -- in some retail, um, uh, businesses and they were -- they were hit --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they were hit -- hit really hard.  
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, um, so, um you know, there -- there -- but I think the other side is that we were probably due for a recession anyway and, uh, or going into one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, um, actually --
R:  Good correction.
L:  Yeah.  I'm actually, uh, uh, I mean, if this is the worst that we see, um, it -- it's not been very difficult compared to what we saw --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the early eighties and -- and --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, speaking of which, how long do you think these effects are going to last?  I mean, what -- what's your opinion of -- of, uh, how this recession and -- and a lot of the things which came directly out of September eleventh, how long do you think they're gonna last?
L:  Um, I -- I am not certain that --
