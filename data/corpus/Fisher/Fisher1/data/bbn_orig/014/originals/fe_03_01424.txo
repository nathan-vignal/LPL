R:  Hello, my name is Brandy Gentilly, I'm from Memphis, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?  My name is Linda Davis and I'm from St. Angelo, Texas.
R:  Oh, that's far away [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, are you doing the same stuff that I'm doing?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, um, this survey deal with the University of Pen, yeah.
R:  Yes, yes ma'am.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so what -- what changes have you made?
L:  I haven't made any, I -- I -- I don't think.  I -- I mean, I think it's made me more aware and I watch probably I -- I have my eyes open more than I used to.
R:  Yes, ma'am.  Well, I have to admit I have changed a few things.  I -- I try to tell my family members I love 'em before they, you know, go off some far place or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get on an airplane or, you know, I try to, you know, tell 'em that I love 'em more but there's really not much you can change.
L:  No, I -- I don't --
R:  Not really.
L:  I -- and I live in a -- I guess part of the reason that I haven't changed too awfully much is, um, uh, about the worst situation that we might have is we do have an air base here in -- in St. Angelo, um, but it's where they do a lot of training so --
R:  Well, that's -- that's what we have out here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have a air base out here.
L:  So, it's -- and -- and it's not, um, it really doesn't, uh, seem like it doesn't affect us.  We don't have a major airport, I don't think the terrorists are really gonna to pinpoint St. Angelo [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, yes, ma'am, I've --
L:  -- for anything too much.
R:  -- I've never heard of St. Angelo [LAUGH] I really haven't.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure you're heard of Memphis, Tennessee though.
L:  Oh, yes [LAUGH].  
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  And Memphis has got a little more to, uh, at risk, I think --
R:  Yes, ma'am, we have the pyramid --
L:  -- than we do.
R:  -- and that big bridge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we have the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Memphis Internat- -- we have all that [LAUGH].
L:  You have all kinds of things that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that they might go after but --
R:  Yes, ma'am [LAUGH].
L:  -- sitting way down here in west Texas I don't think there's too awful much that they're gonna be heading for.
R:  No, ma'am.
L:  But, uh -- so, I -- you know, other than, like you say, when someone travels or -- or anything like that then, uh, um, I -- I may think a little more about it but I do kinda keep my eyes open because --
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- I figured we're part of that area that those snipers or those, um, people might hide out until they do, you know, something major.  So, I -- I kinda keep an eye on people around me, I think, more.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  I -- I pay a little more attention to that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you have to do that anyway --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- nowdays. [NOISE]
L:  Most definitely, most definitely.
R:  Yes, ma'am.  It's -- it's a mess out there.
L:  Yeah, it is but, you know, as -- um, the United States is a strong country.
R:  Oh yes, ma'am.
L:  We've kinda gone through a lot of, um, um, a lot of things without having to worry about our own homeland.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  So, it's only logical that we, um, you know, that we need to be woke up.  
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  We need to -- to be aware that -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it can happen to us too.  Um, you know, we don't know when someone might, uh, invade us and come and take, um, um, you know, take lives --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- as we have done and as we have seen done overseas.  So, um, you know, we have to --
R:  People in America don't realize how lucky they are --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- to live in America.
L:  That's exactly right.  You know, what -- they've talked about how fat the people are getting and things like that.
R:  [MN] yes, ma'am [LAUGH].
L:  Why?  Because we are -- we are -- are really secure in our little niche of the world, I think it is.
R:  [LAUGH] yes.  Yes, ma'am.
L:  And, um, you know, it's -- it -- I -- as far as I can see that's what I think September eleventh did for us is this -- it gave us all a real wake up call.
R:  It did.  It really did.  
L:  Yep.
R:  It woke a lot of people up.
L:  Yes.  And, uh --
R:  Because people thought, you know, ain't nothing gonna happen in America, you know, we're too secure but --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- look what happened, you know.  
L:  That's right.
R:  It proved that things can happen over here too.
L:  That's absolutely right.
R:  I mean we have more security than, you know, China or Iraq or -- you know, but that doesn't mean that, um, nothing's gonna happen in America.
L:  No, it did.  You know, they [inaudible] -- they proved to us that, um, that we weren't secure enough.  You know, we've always opened our borders to other people --
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- um, look at how many have come through Ellis Island, you know, and not just Ellis Island.  I -- they've come through Houston and everywhere else.  My ances- ancestors came over, you know --
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- but it's -- it's -- we have -- have opened our arms, so to speak, to some of this. Now, then we have to be aware that it can happen.  That -- that just because someone comes to this country doesn't mean they're all coming for the good.
R:  That's right because there is bad here.
L:  Sure.
R:  There is bad.
L:  There's lots of it.  And there's -- there's lots of bad all over the world it's --
R:  And people bring things from overseas over here --
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  -- just like, what is it, sours[?] spoors[?].
L:  SARS?
R:  The -- the disease --
L:  The SARS, yes --
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  Just like that.  It came from China.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now it's in California --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's all --
L:  It's --
R:  -- to the west of us [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  It's -- it's -- it is a problem and it is something that we, you know, we all have to face.  I thi- -- I think that we all -- all need to be woke up.  We all need to be aware of what's, you know, happening around us, what, um, what is potential, uh, to happen around us.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Um, and I think -- I -- I think for the most part the peop- -- the people of the United States are prepared for that.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Um, you know, you can't do anything without losing lives, unfortunately.
R:  That's right.
L:  You -- you know, in these kind of situations.  They're usually dire enough that, um, you're going to lose some life and -- 
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- just like we did on September eleventh and that's a -- that's the price that we all have to pay for, you know, for freedom.
R:  Yes, ma'am.  What upsets me the most is, um, September eleventh, it happened what, two year ago?
L:  Mhm.  Going on two years.
R:  I wonder if like, uh, for instance, if someone close to me had died in there -- you know, in September eleventh I wonder if -- I wouldn't want to see it on TV all the time.  And I wouldn't wanna go through every single day seeing something about it on TV and all the tee shirts you have out there and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the ribbons, I just wonder if that makes people that lost loved ones in September eleventh, I just wonder if it affects them in any way, if it brings 'em down, if it helps raise their spirits, do they know that they're helping other people?  
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  See I wonder those things.
L:  That is -- that's -- that's a very good question.  I -- I feel like if I had lost someone in September eleventh incident that I would have felt like they didn't die in vain.  That, um, you know, that they -- they're like did serve a purpose, um 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- you know, I -- I feel like that -- that -- that's the way I look at those -- I look at every one of those people as a hero.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  They died in -- protecting my freedom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, or died, um, because of -- we are a free people.
R:  I've always wondered, you know, am I gonna live tomorrow and am I gonna live to see my children start to school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Different things like that but, like, September eleventh them people had no idea --
L:  No, they --
R:  -- that they were going to go in that building.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, you know, had no idea and just think though, I mean, if that had of been like twelve o'clock in the afternoon --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just think how many people would have been there.  
L:  Yeah,
R:  Because, you know, that wasn't even half the people that worked in them buildings.
L:  That's right, yeah.  I don't know I -- I -- I guess maybe that's one more thing that has caused me -- it's not the only thing but I feel like September eleventh is one more of those things that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taught me, um, how to, um, appreciate every day.  And to, um, to not live worrying about what will happen tomorrow, to live for today.
R:  That's right.
L:  Uh, I've done that more as I -- as I age, I think, mat- -- part of that come with maturity, but, um, um, you know, I don't -- I know that -- that things do happen in this world and that there are things beyond our control and God is the only one that knows what day I'm gonna die [LAUGH], you know, so I --
R:  That's right.
L:  That's kinda the way I look at it is is I'm gonna put that in his hands and hope that he takes me when it's time, you know.
R:  That's right.
L:  And that he does it in a painless way.  Um, other than that I don't -- I don't tend to think about, um, you know, me driving out on the highway or -- and get hit by a car or any of those things.  There are ways I'd prefer not to go but I don't ...
