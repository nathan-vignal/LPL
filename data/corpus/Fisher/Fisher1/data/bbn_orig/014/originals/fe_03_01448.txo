R:  Hi, my name is Brandy Gentilly, I'm from Memphis, how are you?
L:  Hi, my name is Ashwan Reddy, I'm from Austin, Texas.
R:  Well, how are you doing today?
L:  I'm doing good, how are you? 
R:  I'm fine.  What changes have you made since September eleventh, or have you made any?
L:  Um, I don't really feel like I've made too much -- too many changes, actually.  Ah, the only thing I feel, ah, I feel that when I go to the airport that, ah, I've probably been a little bit more cautious than normal, but other than that, nothing, really.  What about yourself?
R:  No, sir, I really haven't.  I've -- I mean, I just, you know, try to tell, you know, if I have people travelling, you know, out of town, I, you know, I tend to be more aware of where they're going, you know, when they'll be back, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, such and such stuff.  But no, not much, I haven't really changed.
L:  Yeah, I don't think I have either.  I think I've -- now with the situation in Iraq and everything, that, ah, and it might be escalating and there might be more reason to change, and more reason to change your behaviour now just because I think people might be a little bit more incensed with the situation than they were beforehand.
R:  Yes, sir.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never liked to fly. [LAUGH] Never. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Never?  I love to fly, so...
R:  I don't know if I'll -- I don't know if I'll ever fly.
L:  Mm.
R:  It just scares me.  Even before September eleventh, I -- I've never like to fly, I was scared it was gonna -- the plane was gonna crash or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's always really terrified me.
L:  Yeah.  I guess one change I have made is I've been a little bit more cautious in my life with regards to, I guess what I say and stuff in public, 'cause I'm -- I'm of -- I'm Ind- -- I'm of Indian descent, like my parents were from India --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I look -- I would look, you know, upon appearance just like any person from that whole Arab region.
R:  Yes, sir.
L:  So, um, there are times, you know, when I'm at airports that I might not say something that I would say, like maybe state my opinion on, ah, the war or something like that, just as a fear of, you know, what repercussions might occur, based on who's listening and things like that.
R:  I know.  People -- I think September eleventh was more of a wake up call than anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To wake America up.  [LIPSMACK] I really do. 
L:  Yeah, it really was.  Yeah, I feel America kind of lives in its own little bubble most of the time.
R:  People don't realise how lucky they are to live in America.
L:  Exactly.
R:  They really don't.
L:  'Cause in the rest of the world, you know, you have so many countries that are close to each other, whereas in America you have Canada in the north and Mexico in the south, and then miles and miles of ocean on either side.
R:  Yes, sir.
L:  So there's not really much contact, you know, with outside cultures, other than immigrants that move here from other countries, and basically after they have their first or second generation their children are pretty much assimilated to American culture anyway, so...
R:  [SIGH] I know, it's just -- it's unbelievable ... the different things that are happening in America today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You look at the war, you look at September eleventh for an example, you look at how many lives are being taken every day, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just so much stuff.
L:  Mm.  
R:  But [SIGH] --
L:  Do you feel that --
R:  -- how long has it been since September eleventh?  About two years?
L:  Since September eleventh?
R:  Yes, sir.  Has it been about two years?
L:  Yeah, about a year and half.
R:  Year and a half, okay.  That's right.  I don't know why I was thinking it was two years, but it was a year in September, and then this year it'll be two years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Have you heard of what they're gonna do with New York, on the plaza over there?  Are they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- are they gonna be building a memorial or anything like that?
R:  Um, I think so.  Um, they're, they're, um, looking at different models of what they're gonna build, and they're trying to decide.  I think that they have come to a conclusion to do, um, like, the twin towers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But have them like a swirl, you see what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's what they're gonna do, but I'm not real sure.  I've seen so many different designs of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] My mother in law just got back from up there.
L:  Oh.
R:  She went to New York.  But she got back the day the war -- the war started, I think it was the fifteenth, she got -- no, when did she get back?  Ah, Wednesday.  It was Wednesday --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that the war started.
L:  Mm.
R:  She got back that day.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It was scary, I didn't want to go to the airport. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  I didn't even want to go to the airport.
L:  Did she say anything about the -- like, the attitude of the New Yorkers or anything like that, given the war and everything that's going on there?
R:  She said, um, that it was a lot different up there than it was down here.  People up there are more of aware of what goes on --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- than they are down here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know, September eleventh happened in New York, you know.  Well not just in New York but Pennsylvania, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But most of it was in New York.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, they said that they have a lot of opinions on things that have happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, where we don't think -- I mean, Memphis and Austin Texas, you know, that's a little ways apart, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't feel that something would happen here as quick as it would happen in New York.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But see, we don't know, you know.  In Memphis you got the Pyramid, you've got the humun- that huge bridge downtown, you've got --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the naval base, the big naval base in Millington, you know, we just have a lot of stuff down here, but [SIGH] you just never know what's gonna happen and when it's gonna happen.
L:  Yeah, you don't.
R:  Just like September eleventh.  Nobody knew, you know, that that day was gonna come.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just think though, what if, what if it hadda happened, like, say eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, noon, instead of eight thirty in the morning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, just think how many more people would have been in them two buildings -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- than they were that morning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's just the way I look at it.
L:  Yeah.  Like I -- I'm a student, actually, at the University of Texas here, and they've beefed up security around here immensely because of it.  Because, ah, one of George Bush's daughters actually attends school here, and then, ah, we are probably a stone's throw away from the capitol.  You can see the buildings from all our dorms and from campus and everything, and like, we're the nation's -- one of the nation's largest universities, so they think that -- they were saying that we probably were a very likely target for any future terrorist attacks, so there's a lot of security now, like you can't even drive through campus anymore and things like that.  It's kinda scary, you know, at times.
R:  Really?
L:  Mm.
R:  Isn't that where George Bush is from, Texas?
L:  Yeah, he's from Texas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know at first, when he first got elected I didn't really care too much for him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But now, you know, I see that he's a strong man and, you know, he stands up for what he believes in, and he's gonna try to take care of America.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not let nobody run over us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause at first, you know, I was, like, oh lord, you know, we got another Bush, he's gonna play the same role his dad did. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it jut kinda scared me at first.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now I see, you know, that he's gonna stand up for America, [LIPSMACK] and that's what he's doing.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But I really think that he thought that the war was gonna be over with before, you know, now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was thinking, you know, I thought that he thought that it was gonna be like over with in a week or two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I don't think that he was -- I don't believe that he thought it was gonna last as long as it has.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know, have they, have they confirmed the -- are they still talking about going into Syria?  I heard that the other day.
R:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure, I'm really not.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  I know -- 
L:  I don't know, I think if they -- if they did that, that that would just piss off even more people, and, you know, might make the situation against us worse so...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then after he does that, you know, where do you stop?  Do you keep going to every, every nation that you believe harbors terrorists, 'cause then, you know, there's -- you can go all over the world and do that, and we'd be on a endless crusade, you know.  All over the place.  But...
R:  I know.  Um, my mother works on the naval base --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it scares me half to death, her working out there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it scares me half to death.  'Cause, you know, I wonder, well are they gonna get bombed, or are they gonna do this, because if they go to the high -- you know, we're on high alert right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If they go to severe, then she can't work.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're not gonna let them work on the base.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It just scares me, her working out there. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] But is it -- You said you were in Memphis, right?
R:  Yes, sir, I'm in Memphis Tennessee.
L:  There's a naval base in Memphis?  Or --
R:  It's in -- well, it's in Millington.  Not -- I mean, it's -- it's in Millington, but it's about ten minutes away from where I live.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, sir.  It's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not very far from where I live. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We have lots of major terrorist places out here, that --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know, I believe that if they're gonna do something they would hit them places.
L:  Yeah.  That's the scary part, is you can see -- you can look around basically almost any, you know, larger city in America and find plenty of targets, and you just don't know, you know, which one is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're gonna choose, just 'cause, you know, the probability of you picking the right one is very slim, given the large amount of targets and stuff that there are.
R:  Yes, sir.  I'm just gonna start --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, going to college here in a few months.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes, sir.  Um, I just finished high school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I graduate May the nineteenth, so... 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you looking forward to that?
R:  Yes, sir, I really am.
