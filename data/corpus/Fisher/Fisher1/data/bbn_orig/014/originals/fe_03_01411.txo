R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Kim.
L:  Oh, my name is Hannah.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.  Um, you know, I suppose we should take about the topic at hand but I'm just curious, how did you find out about this?
R:  How did I find out about this? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I go onto the freebie boards and stuff on the Internet.
L:  Oh cool.  So, actually, why don't you go first.  What changed have you made in your life since nine eleven?
R:  Oh, since nine eleven there's been so many changes it's not funny. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, not only because of that but, I mean, tragedies in my family also.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  Um, but as far as changes, I'm more aware of things that are around me.
L:  Yeah, yeah, you're more --
R:  More cautious about what I touch in stores and everything else and --
L:  So, you're more hyper aware?
R:  Oh yes. [LAUGH]  
L:  Wow.
R:  And this is the first time I've ever done this so --
L:  Yeah, it's the first time I've ever done this as well.
R:  -- bear with me.  I don't even know what -- exactly what I'm supposed to be doing.
L:  Well, I think -- I think we're just supposed to be talking, basically.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I don't -- you know, I think that the topic gives us something to talk about but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think it's more because they're --
R:  I'm a little bit -- longways away from New York so it's -- you know, it wasn't as at home as it was for people in New York for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I'm down in the south so -- but watching it on TV was extremely real. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, whereabouts in the south are you actually?
R:  In Texas.
L:  In Texas?  Oh cool.
R:  Mhm.  And you?
L:  I'm actually in Seattle. [LAUGH]
R:  In Seattle?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you're way up there on the other side. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  [LAUGH] Is it still cold up there?
L:  It -- it's a little cold but, um, it's getting warmer.  Actually it's -- compared to New Hampshire where I grew up it's, uh, you know, pretty temperate around here.
R:  And what kind of changes have you made?
L:  Um, I actually -- you know, there's been some changes in my life that have happened since then.  I remember the -- night before nine eleven I was housesitting at a friend's house.  Um, it was kinda of a p- -- it was kinda of a peculiar night for me.  It was a very, very strange sort of -- there was something in the air that night.  I can't put my finger on what it was but I was in this -- I was in this beautiful house and I was housesitting with some cats and -- and, you know, I had some strange kinda nightmarish dreams and then when I work up in the morning -- it was like seven o'clock in the morning I woke up and -- and the phone was ringing so I picked it up and somebody on the other line said, "You have to get out of bed and go to New York right now.  We need you in New York".  And I -- I was, you know, completely asleep and I said, "What -- what do you mean?  Wha- -- what are you talking about?"  And they said, "It's a -- have you turned the news on".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "You know, you should turn the news on".  And I -- and I said, "Oh, I haven't done that yet".  And they said, well, you know, "Get on the news and call me back".  And I said -- I said, "I don't have your number".  And they said, "Is this Carey?" and I said, "No, it's not it's Hannah".  And they said, "Where's Carey?"  And I said, "Carey's actually not home, she's actually overseas right now".  And they said, "Oh, I'm sorry, we thought that -- I thought that you were Carey and you should turn on the news because something's happened".  My friend, Carey, actually works for M.S.N.B.C. so that was the reason why --
R:  I was fixing to ask was she in the service or ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and so I actually turned on the television and found out what was happening and it was -- it kinda played into some of the dreams I had that night, which was kinda odd.  But I was housesitting and since then I -- you know, it obviously had a very strong -- it had a strong impact on me what happened and I thought a lot about it but one of the things that sort of struck me about it was the fact that, you know, there was definitely an enormous amount of anger that was generated from the experience.  But there was also an enormous amount of analysis that --
R:  Right, there is --
L:  -- the country did too.  And we --
R:  There is a lot of fear here too because we're like one of the fifth largest ports. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  And that was very nerve wracking every time -- and we live by the naval base so every time an airplane or a jet or something would go by it was -- there was so much air traffic. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so it -- it was kind of -- it was, um, it was interesting to see that there was -- it -- there was several different responses to what happened.  Not just anger, but several different things that occurred and came out of nine eleven.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, and I -- you know, I -- since then I've changed my life -- my life has changed, um, a little bit, you know, I -- I started to see somebody and we've really hit it off and we've sort of moved in together so that's different than things were at around nine eleven. [SIGH] And, uh, what else has happened?  There's been some tragedies in my family as well.  Although they've been through -- I've been a little bit far removed from them because I live on the other side of the country and I'm not -- it's not that I don't love my family but I'm not necessarily as closely tied to them as other people are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- tied to their families.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, anyway -- oh, I interrupted you.
R:  Well, since nine eleven, let's see last October, Texas was hit by a bunch of tornadoes.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  We were one of the lucky few that -- our house is not totally destroyed but made unlivable.
L:  Wow.
R:  Our ceilings caved in, we had an electric fire which made our house to where we didn't have any electricity at all and it's just been a hectic couple of years. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You want it out.  I'm sorry, my daughter.
L:  That's all right.
R:  [LAUGH] You have any children?
L:  Oh, I don't actually have any children currently.  Planning on children but don't have any right now.
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm actually thirty six.
R:  Thirty six?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm thirty two.
L:  Uh, so --
R:  And so, um, your friend, Carey, they work for M.S.N.B.C.?
L:  Yep.
R:  Did they cover any of the stories or ...?
L:  Uh, she -- to my recollection she didn't, you know, she did write an article but it wasn't -- it wasn't directly related to what nine ele- -- it was more like the aftermath of nine eleven.  But, um, I don't know actually -- I don't know the answer to that because I was so overwhelmed and I was actually also working on a site that was covering the news and so I was caught up in my own world.  Um, she has done some stories about the current crisis and the current war with Iraq.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh --
R:  Don't get me started.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing, you know, how everyone's in sync, you know, and even states that generally disagree, tend to agree.  You know, it's kinda interesting to see --
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, don't get me started on that subject.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think they wanna hear. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know -- I mean I'd be curious.  I -- actually my boyfriend started a political discussion list, um, which has got -- you know, it started off because there were members of my family and my extended family who, um, just disagree rather, you know, passionately on a political level, that had -- we had this email chain going around to the family and I see these -- I've been seeing these for years and I usually don't have time to read them because they're just overwhelming.  Um, and they're twenty pages each so I just -- I don't have time, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, and so I did respond to something one of my -- my uncle said and, uh, he responded by, you know, kinda sending a flame mail back at me and saying something, you know, being angry at me.  And I didn't say anything -- I said something very nonchalant and not particularly political so I was kinda surprised that he had that response but, in any case, my boyfriend responded to him and then that started a big email thread back and forth and then he -- he started this political discussion list and then he included some of our friends and some of his extended family.  And it's turned into this very large thing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right.  Our family's kinda split on it also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have,  um, retired, uh, drill sergeants and stuff in my family --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so --
L:  Wow.
R:  Vietnam vets, my grandfather and so -- my grandmother's got a different outlook on it than my mother, which was a hippie, so she's like loving and peace, no war and --
L:  Wow, that's -- yeah, that's quite -- yeah, there's [inaudible] advocates on one side of the family and, uh, very strong, very, very right wing republican viewpoint on the other.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And so it's kinda interesting to see people -- and that -- that's something I can say, "That's something new since nine eleven" that's happening.
R:  Right.
L:  It started --
R:  And as far as nine eleven it seems like neighbors are more neighbors.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Everybody's bonded a little bit closer.
L:  Yeah, there's definitely this awareness that's come out of that and -- and more of a sense of community.  And maybe even more of a sense of world community than there used to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  My -- I believe so.
L:  Yeah.  And even -- even if the US is doing things that upset foreign countries, uh, there does seem to be a little more of a -- less of an isolationist, uh, attitude that Americans have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or have had in the past. [SIGH] But, anyway, um --
R:  And this is supposed to last for ten minutes, right?
L:  I think it is actually.  Um, but if you wanna join the political discussion list you're welcome to. [LAUGH] Just to let you know.
R:  Okay, well how -- how would I do that?
L:  Uh, you'd have to email, uh, my boyfriend and his name is C.J. Collier.  That would be C. J. C.O.L.L.I.E.R at pobox dot com.
R:  Pobox dot com?
L:  Yep.
