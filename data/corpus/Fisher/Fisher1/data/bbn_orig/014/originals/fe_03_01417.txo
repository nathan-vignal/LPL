R:  Hi, I'm Evelyn.
L:  Hi, I'm Ryan.  How are you today?
R:  Good and you?
L:  Not bad.  So, uh, first of all I guess where were you when you first heard about the terrorist attacks?
R:  I was sleeping.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My sister came down and woke me up saying that a plane had just flew into a building.
L:  And what was your first reaction to that?
R:  Like, "Whoa, what the hell is the pilot thinking?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I though it was an accident myself.  I had really no idea what was going on.  I was sitting in my first period class, I was a senior at the time and the principal came over the loudspeaker and said, "Well, you know, we've been attacked".  And the whole class kind of just silent, we had really no idea -- and we watched the TV the rest of the day.  Uh, I haven't really made any changes though.  I'm not sure why.  For a while I was kind of scared.  I didn't really know what else was gonna happen, if they had anything else planned.
R:  I just sat glued to the TV all day long watching everything unfold on there.  I haven't made any changes either.  I'm still going to live my life the same way.
L:  Yeah, I figure unless it hits closer to home I don't really know what I can do.  I haven't bought duck tape or anything.
R:  No, I won't buy duck tape [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sure if that would work anyway, taping it up to the doors.  I don't really know.
R:  I think if it's a chemical bomb, tape and plastic aren't going to do crap.
L:  I think it'll probably seep in any little crack it can get into and that's it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, exactly because you have your -- your heater system and that -- that goes outside anyway.
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].
R:  We're supposed to talk for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's see, uh -- and I don't like how they would always play the buildings falling over and over and over.  I kinda -- it was really disturbing to me to watch that.
R:  I think -- I think it kind of desensitized everybody after a while.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.  Like the first time -- I think I saw it live actually when it was actually happening I saw it and that was, Wow!  That really got me.
R:  Yeah, I was sitting here with my sister and my uncle watching, trying to figure out what was going on.  Who did what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then all of a sudden they started talking about the Pentagon and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and talking about now the buildings are falling and the other plane going down in Pennsylvania.
L:  On it's way to the White House [LAUGH].  Wow, it was -- it was bad.
R:  I just thought they could -- if they already went to Ohio, they got as far as Ohio they could have easily have hit the Sears Tower.
L:  Mhm.  I thought that would actually have been a good target and I was afraid that they were heading that way.
R:  Well, I'm right near there so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Um, well, we can only have two minutes silence.
R:  Oh, that's what it said.
L:  According to the instructions [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's see where I can go with this.  I was surprised it was so well planned though on like such a large scale, especially when the other things started happening all on the same day.  It was -- I don't know it was very intimidating.  Kind of put us in a bad position as a country.
R:  Well, exactly, seeing as how we're supposed to have such great security.
L:  Mhm and then they slip into an airport which is supposed to have the hig- -- some of the highest security measures in the entire country as far as getting stuff onto the plane.
R:  Exactly [COUGH].
L:  It was -- well, it was like plastic -- it was hidden in plastic or something.  It was so thick that it didn't even go through the metal detectors and they didn't set it off.
R:  What was?
L:  Their weapons.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that was surprising even.  Then I read the article in Newsweek.  They did some really good coverage on it, I don't know if you read those articles.
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Uh, they us- -- went pretty in depth and they had the families and then there were a couple of survivors too that they got interviews from and that was pretty touching.  This one guy was way up top and he managed to get down and people helped him along the way and they died.  And, you know, it was just -- it was a touching article too.
R:  They had some stuff like that in People where there was a handicapped woman and two guys just carried her down ninety flights of stairs.
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  And there was another guy, Gus, they were saying he had, um, he had just had an -- uh, surgery done on his -- I can't think of what it's called, probably the back of your leg area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by your ankle so he couldn't really do anything so when he was -- I don't know if he was actually in the building or just around the building -- when he would start to run his stitches were breaking open and he was bleeding.
L:  Ouch.
R:  And so he -- he made it into a store where they helped him there.
L:  Then again, I think, this whole thing really shows the strength of people to bond together to -- it really impressed me how everyone just came together and it didn't matter what race you were, your orientation or anything like that.  We all just united --
R:  Exactly.   
L:  -- against it.
R:  Yeah, there was some racism then towards Islamic people -- 
L:  Oh yeah, that did --
R:  Middle Eastern then --
L:  -- trigger a really bad one.
R:  -- then it started hitting really bad where they were bombing over here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Mosques.
L:  But, I guess -- I guess it's something that we have some urge to do something, I don't know.  Oh, okay let's see.
R:  Are we only allowed to talk about nine eleven [LAUGH]?  Have you fl- -- um, travelled since then?
L:  Yes, I went down to Atlanta over Independence Day and that was really tight security.  I had to get there about four hours earlier than I normally would have.  But the flight itself was smooth.
R:  So, that was almost Independence -- okay, so that Fourth of July after the attacks?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, my mom had travelled two weeks after.
L:  Okay, that would have been -- I don't know if I would have done that myself [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, she had already made plans and her -- her flight.  I think it was two week, yeah, at the beginning of Sept- -- at the beginning of October then and she went out of the country, she went to Cancun and she said, "Not really -- it wasn't that bad".
L:  Mm.
R:  The only thing was having to get there so damn early.
L:  Right.
R:  That was the only problem.  Other than that she said it was like normal.
L:  So, no extensive searches or anything?
R:  No, but, I think -- now that I think about it I think they're going back to how security used to be in the airports where you couldn't go past a certain point.
L:  Yeah, they did that on the one I flew out of.
R:  Oh 'cause when -- let me see, my grandmother flew to Vegas -- this would have had to have been in ninety two, ninety one, we were not allowed past the metal detectors.
L:  Right.  And my mom, for example, couldn't come greet me either.  She had to wait outside the gate.  So, I guess, that's a pretty smart move as far as ticket holders only.  Although it was the ticket holders that had the weapons in the first place.  
R:  Well, exactly.  They got the tickets --
L:  And that was the scary part.
R:  They learned to fly from the US.
L:  Yep, I read about that after a couple of weeks and that was --
R:  Oh, we taught Osama Bin Laden everything he knows [LAUGH].
L:  -- oh my gosh!  Pretty much [LAUGH] and wow!
R:  We helped them out. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ten minutes, ten minutes, right?
L:  Yes, ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Talking for at least eight. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know I should get a little though [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I think we're doing pretty well so far.
R:  [NOISE] We talked about that already.
L:  Okay, let's see, uh, did your -- I don't know if you were in high school or college when this happened, um --
R:  I was neither [LAUGH].
L:  Neither?  Okay, so you're a little older than me but, uh, did your workplace do anything special, any commemorations?
R:  I wasn't working at the time either.
L:  Okay.  Anything in your community?
R:  No, not that I'm aware of.
L:  Mm, okay.
R:  I didn't take a part in anything like that, how -- how about you?
L:  Yeah, my school did a thing because I was a senior and we all wore buttons and in a way I thought it was kinda just jumping on the bandwagon and that kind of got on my nerves after a while.  Just the patriotism thing.  It was never big until this happened --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then all of a sudden everyone's jumping on this patriotism bandwagon.  And it kinda got irritating, I guess, after a while.
R:  Wow.  The only thing I really saw with anything mem- -- commemorating was the Real World, Chicago.
L:  That's right near you then -- 
R:  Yeah, they were here --
L:  -- just an hour or two.
R:  -- they were -- they were here when Sept- -- when September eleventh happened.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, they showed it on -- on MTV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's all I really saw with that.  Other than that I didn't see nothing else except for the flags at half staff.
L:  Right and that's -- I -- that's a pretty good tribute right there, just everyone doing that.
R:  Exactly.  So, did you hear -- did you read anything about the black box from the Pennsylvania flight?
L:  No, I didn't get a chance to do that, did you?
R:  Yeah, People magazine had a whole thing where they give the, you know, exactly what happened, just about because they talked to the loved ones.  Because they -- those were the only ones who were really allowed to hear it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so ...
