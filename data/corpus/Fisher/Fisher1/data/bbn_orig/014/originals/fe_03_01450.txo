R:  Hi, my name is Jeanette and I'm from Minnesota.  Who am I talking to?
L:  Hi.  My name is Linda and I'm from Denver.
R:  Oh, hi, Linda.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH].
R:  Have you done any of these calls before?  
L:  Just one.
R:  Okay.  This is my third call.  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  I was so surprised, they're just coming one right after the other.
L:  Oh, today?
R:  And it's re- yeah.  I just signed up --
L:  Oh.  
R:  -- yesterday and I got three calls today.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, this is just interesting.  Um, I guess we're supposed to discuss, uh, any personal changes that we've gone through since nine one one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Would you like to start, or would you like me to?
L:  Um, sure.  You can.  [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Um, I think basically we haven't really made very many changes at all.  Um, I -- I was telling the other callers that my husband was reluctant at first to fly because he does have to travel for his job.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where he wasn't really looking forward to it, but once he actually stepped foot in the airport and saw all the security measures that were in place and saw the armed personnel that were there and the marshalls that were on board, it -- it just kinda left him and he felt very safe and -- and very protected, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just put himself at ease and just continued on as normal.  Um, I -- I -- I really can't think of anything that we have done differently, other than perhaps -- I think we've been more caring and sharing with our time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- with friends and families and even strangers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As a result of nine one one, but making personal changes, I -- I don't think it's really impacted us enough to -- to change negatively.  Maybe for the better positively, but -- how about you?
L:  Um, I think a lot along the same lines as you.  [LAUGH].  My husband works for the airlines, so um, we uh -- you know, we were trying to encourage people to fly --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- so that -- 'cause he works for United and, you know, they're in a world of hurt right now and [LAUGH] um, but, uh, I think, um, another -- I mean, we did fly right after.  Um, and it was an eerie feeling in the airports, you know, when they were, you know, not very full and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, I can imagine.
L:  Um, but let's see.  Uh, what have we done that's different?  Um --
R:  How about your -- do you have children in school?
L:  Uh, they're -- one in preschool and one that's two.
R:  Okay.  So that you haven't, uh -- how do you --
L:  We didn't have to explain it to them.
R:  They're too young, I suppose, for have been affected by that, yeah.  I was -- I was curious as to how other people were handling the stress that their children might have gone through.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my children are -- are grown and on their own.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I think a lot of it might depend upon where in the country a person lives and how personally they were affected by the -- by the tragedy.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I -- I think everybody is carrying the burden of what happened in their heart --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't personally know anyone personally that -- that perished or was hurt in -- in what happened.
L:  Right.
R:  And here in the -- the farmland in Minnesota, we seem almost kind of removed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And yet it -- it really is still there in -- in the background because I was telling another caller that, um, we're in the twenty five mile zone of a nuclear power plant --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we know that they've increased the security there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they've discontinued, uh, tours, and they have, um -- they had National Guard -- Guardsmen there, and now they have local police that have been assigned --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- twenty four hours a day to it.  But you think out in the country, nobody's going to bother you or nothing's going to happen.
L:  Right.
R:  But in our local paper, I was reading how farmers are supposed to be vigilant and on the watch for terrorists who --
L:  Oh, because of the --
R:  -- might -- yeah, bio terrorists.  You know, I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they could come in and -- and poison crops or -- or harm the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the cattle that -- and nobody would know until it goes to market.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and they wouldn't even be tested for, you know, so many things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it just -- I mean, it boggles the mind that -- I don't know, I guess the way I feel is, if your time is up, your time is up.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  You just have to live your life to the fullest and not --
L:  I think we -- we think very similarly.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, I --
L:  Because --
R:  What else can you do?
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly.  If I -- you know, I got to the point where I could not watch it on TV and I was, you know, angry that everything was just [SIGH] um, you know, mourning, mourning, mourning, you know?  It just -- uh, you know, the sadness and you know, and I kind of agreed with Mayor Giuliani that you need to get back to your life, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you need to, you know, um -- but it just seemed like it was just -- I mean, it was a huge tragedy, I'm not trying to discount that, but, um at the same time, uh, you know, out here in Denver, half an hour away from Columbine when that happened and we were here, um, you know, it -- it -- it's the same thing.  I -- you don't think anything's going to happen out here, and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that happened and so, I don't know.  Um [SIGH].
R:  It just seems like one thing after another and -- and maybe some people are just saying enough.  You know, they just don't even want to think about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- or maybe we're just de- so optimistic, we keep thinking that things are always going to be better for us.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It -- it's just so strange to know that this is even going on and I know life will never be the same again --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for our generation, and -- and for those, you know, li- like your kids growing up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think they'll ever have that innocence like I had when I was growing up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's a shame, that that --
L:  I think o- actually, one thing, I mean just, you know, working for the -- hi- him -- my husband working for the airlines, I think we've become way more conservative in our spending.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, be- since Sept- September eleventh because, um, his industry was affected so dramatically, um, I mean it -- you could, you know, save all the money in the world and still [LAUGH] the world could end.
R:  Oh, absolutely, it --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's had a tremendous impact all the way across the world, I think.
L:  Yeah, I think that it --
R:  Um --
L:  -- just, uh, people aren't as materialistic and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it actually brought people back into church because I noticed right after, you know, churches that would have half full parking lots on Sundays suddenly, you know, there's hardly any parking and people are parking on the street and, you know, I think that, um, it brought people back to -- some people back to religion.
R:  Yes.  I -- I -- that's a good, valid point, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I hadn't even thought of that, but I think you're right.  Um, and -- and I think that that goes hand in hand with, like, the patriotism we're all experiencing.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so many people wouldn't have even thought about flying the flag, and yet everywhere you look, you see a flag now.
L:  Right.
R:  We've got a neighbor [LAUGH] down the road who painted a great big flag on their garage.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and he's got a light shining on it twenty fours a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it was -- even made the newspaper, which [LAUGH] goes to show you what a small place we live out here.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I -- I could imagine how this has really affected the airline industry.  I, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know that, uh, we've got lots of frequent flier miles and it's going to be difficult to even try to get a flight where I could go out with my husband, 'cause they're all -- they're cutting back so many flights and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  And especially --
R:  -- packing them in like sardines.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and then people like employees, you know, say, "How can they not be making money when we can't even get on a flight", you know, they're [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  All the flights seem full to us [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then we also, you know, we also think that, uh, they're using September eleven as a -- as an excuse to make a lot of changes and we don't always agree with that, but um, you know, they'll say everything was because of September eleventh when we know some things were just for management.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, sure, and that's a shame, you know, that when they start using a tragedy --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- as an excuse.  
L:  Exactly.  And, uh, this particular airline is, uh, pretty um -- pretty -- anyway, we know that that's what they're doing.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how did you hear about this study originally?
R:  Um, I belong to an online, um, refund group.  It's called RMC.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's -- it's Refund Makes Sense dot com.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And uh, we've got a Minnesota Good Deal Alert Group who, uh, sent out a notice about this just yesterday.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I went and signed up for it an- and um, yeah, I thought it was really fun and easy to do and I thought, yeah, it'll probably be a month or two before I get a call from them [LAUGH], and I was -- 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- just shocked when they called today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, this has been extremely interesting and informative and I think it's a wonderful project to take part in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, I'm a Mystery Shopper.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  An- and I uh heard about it through one of the companies that I work for, so um, I did my first call about a month ago --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I have -- yeah, I haven't been paid for it, but um -- and actually, I thought the study was over, so I -- I was very surprised to get this call today.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  I -- I just -- like I said, I just signed up yesterday and then --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- got an email this morning and then the phone started ringing this afternoon.  I thought, "Well, this is fun".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, I've sent it out, a referral to all my friends and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, just trying to get people to sign up and do it because they said this is the easiest way to make ten dollars.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, certainly is interesting.
L:  Well, my first topic was bioterrorism.
R:  Oh. 
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  Well, this is -- this is really --
L:  I think I like September eleventh a little better.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I mean, this is really quite, um, interesting topics, you know, that everybody does have an opinion about, that's for sure.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  I just wish I knew more of what to say as far as changes that we've made.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I do know that we have contributed more to --
