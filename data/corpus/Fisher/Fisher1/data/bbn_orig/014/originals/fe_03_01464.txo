R:  Hi, my name is Jeanette and I'm from Minnesota.  Who am I speaking to?
L:  Hi, Jeanette.  I'm Francine.  I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, well, this is the first time I've talked to someone from New York who might have actually experienced the attacks.  Um, would you like to start, or shall I?
L:  Sure, I can start.  I'm about five hours outside of New York City.  Um, I did know, um, a couple people who did work in, um, the Trade Center.  Fortunately, they were safe and sound.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  But the day of nine eleven was probably the scariest day of my life.  I just felt so many emotions, and I have an eleven year old son and my first response was to go and get him from school.  Of course, that's -- we weren't allowed to do that.  The school was in lock down, but I just wanted all my family near me and it was just so sad and -- and so scary because I didn't really -- I felt like there could be something more coming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And since it -- I was -- I am in New York and I just thought maybe we were next -- a next target.  So it was very frightening.
R:  Well, I can --
L:  And some of the changes that I made, well, I haven't flown since nine eleven.  Um --
R:  Did you normally fly a lot before or --
L:  Well, we always took a family va- a family vacation, once a year.  Um, so that's -- you know, that's been a change that we've made.  Although, my husband has flown for business, so he's past it, but I'm not. [LAUGH].  Um, uh, other changes were things like, um, just making sure that the people that I love know that I love them.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, more often than -- than I would, you know, was doing in the past, I guess.  How about you?  What kind of changes?  
R:  Well, I -- I don't think, uh, that we've made any significant changes, um, in our life, other than the fact that we were deeply and terribly affected by -- by what happened, as -- as the whole nation and the whole world was, and our hearts went out to everyone who was involved in that horrible thing.  We don't personally know anybody who was lost or hurt, but it was -- it was scary just watching it unfold on TV.  We were out of town, as a matter of fact --
R:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- helping my mother in law who had had a, uh, a heart attack and she was in the hospital and we found out that she needed, um, skilled nursing home care, so we were scrambling around trying to find an opening for her at a nursing home --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- and interviewing doctors and nurses and trying to deal with what we were going to do with her apartment and everything else.  Um, because she couldn't go back to her apartment.  They -- they just -- she was, uh, incapacitated to the point where she needed skilled care.  So, I was just extremely, extremely difficult time for us at that point, but once we got back home and were able to -- to deal with it more, I think that, um, we have found ourselves closer as a family and -- and we're more caring and kinder to strangers.  I know we've contributed more money, uh, to charities and we always have been in the past, but it's even been more significant for us.  Um, in fact, when we got our Federal tax rebate check back, of six hundred dollars, we donated that immediately to the Red Cross to -- to help the, um, nine one one victims and survivors.
L:  Wow.
R:  And uh, as far as flying, um, I haven't been on a plane since, simply because I haven't had an opportunity to go along with my husband, but um, he was really wary about that first trip --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- right afterward, but he said as soon as he stepped foot in the airport and saw the security measures that were in place and the, um, the armed personnel that were stationed around there and, uh, the sky marshalls that were flying the flights, he said that all just went away and -- and he knew things were going to be okay and he just, you know, went back to it like normal.  Um, I think that's the main thing, is that a lot of the people I know feel that we are not going to be able to do anything, because we don't know if anything specifically is going to harm us, so you just think, we're going to be okay and we have to live our life to the fullest and the best we can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and we really haven't altered our -- our uh, lifestyle or habits or made any significant changes, other than we're aware of the dangers, we know it exists, and if it happens, it happens and, you know, God bless us all.  We're all in this together.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just -- I know that when it was closer to when it actually happened, things just raced through my mind about, um, having everything in order.  Um, I didn't worry so much about having, um, survival supplies around the house --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I worried about things, um, like when my husband and I weren't together and [COUGH] you know, for whatever reason, if he was -- even a -- a short trip within the state or -- of course, on a longer trip that he would have to fly, we just made things -- made sure things were in -- more in order and that things --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- were, you know, right there, that uh, you wouldn't have to go searching for them if -- if, God forbid, you needed something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think one of the harder things, I have an eleven year old, and it was -- was pretty hard, um, helping him understand what was going on and to calm him.  Uh, I think that the school that he goes to did a real good job.  They kind of kept the kids away from the television as much as they could.  Well, during school it wasn't, you know, an issue, um, but they made sure that the teachers addressed issues as the kids wanted to talk about them, but didn't make it a topic that had to be talked about.
R:  That's good.  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I know some other people whose children were in school and they had the -- the kids watching this on TV over and over and over and I think that it really traumatized some of these youngsters.  I -- and I -- I really fear for how they're going to be dealing with this as they get older.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Because that's going to be embedded in their minds, whether you know, they -- they outwardly talk about it or not, and it -- it is just such a frightening thing for a child.  It's bad enough for adults to deal with it, but I just -- I can't imagine how upsetting that can be for children.  My own girls are -- are grown and out of the house now, we're empty nesters, but I find it interesting about your point about the survival, um, things.  My husband even just recently asked if we should get a generator for the house.
L:  Mm.
R:  In case we ever have electrical, um, power outage.
L:  Right.
R:  And I said, you know, I said if -- if we don't have [LAUGH] electricity, I said, I think having a generator would probably be the last of our worries, to be honest with you.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I said because you're not going even to -- be able to have the gas to -- to run the generator, because electricity won't be there to -- to pump gas, you know, at the gas station and I certainly am not going to put in an underground gasoline storage --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know, tank for it.  And he said, "Yeah, kinda good point".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  It can snowball, if you let it.  Certainly could.
R:  Oh, I know.  I kno- and I -- and I know there are people like that out there.  I know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- people who have actually stocked up over a year's worth of food.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ah, you know, a year or two and some people -- I mean, they've taken this to the +nth  degree.  Uh [LAUGH] you know, like even with a -- with a --
L:  With the duct tape and the plastic?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I know a few people like that, too.  My sister in law and brother in law were just absolutely -- just over -- so overly cautious in my opinion, um, and they wouldn't even let their children out of their sight for, cor, weeks and -- well, probably months after nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then with the war -- war in Iraq, you know, they kind of had the same kind of thing.  With the --
R:  And see, that -- that I think is just sad because then you're going to be passing on that fear to your kids.
L:  Exact-
R:  And then you're just a -- a hostage in your own -- in your own body, you know, and that -- that is just not good.  But I think everybody has to decide for themselves what they have to do to feel that level of comfort that we had before nine one one.  'Cause, God knows, that this world is not the same since then.  
L:  Well, it really isn't the same, and to -- to tell you the truth, I still haven't gotten that level of comfort back.  There's still something in the back of my head that just keeps reminding me and reminding me that we're all so vulnerable, and that anybody on the street could be the bad guy.
R:  Absolutely.  And that's -- that's the thing.  You -- you don't know and the only thing we have is this strength in numbers, because there are so many of us, and really relatively few of them.
L:  Yes.
R:  And we are a very strong nation and optimistic people and all we can do is hope and pray for the best.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, uh, like, I brought up with some of my other callers that I would hear -- we live out in a -- a rural farming community, but we're within twenty five miles of a nuclear power plant.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they have beefed up security there and they've stopped the tours and, you know, you can't get anywhere near the perimeter of it, and I said, and then I noticed in a -- in our local, um, newspaper that, um, the FDA is asking farmers to be vigilant on their farms, for any possible terrorist activities.
L:  Wow.  Mm.
R:  Now, how many people think that -- like, someone is going to come and approach a three hundred acre, where the farmers out in his field somewhere, or in the barn, and everybody else is in town --
L:  And sabotage it in some way?
R:  Exactly, but that could happen.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  You know, what a -- what a perfect opportunity to, um, you know, poison crops and -- and inject --
L:  The food supply.
R:  -- animals.  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  But we can't think of those things, because it'll just drive you insane and nuts, and that's what they want to do.  They want to scare you.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  They -- they're certainly playing on the psychological part of it.
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess --
L:  Like --
R:  -- all -- all I can do is -- is I -- I know that I've been in more contact with my friends and family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- through the internet.  I -- I try to keep a positive attitude and I send jokes like crazy.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] because I always think laughter is always the best medicine, and just --
