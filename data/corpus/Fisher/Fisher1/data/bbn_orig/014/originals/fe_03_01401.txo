R:  Hi, my name is Louise.
L:  Hi, my name is Charlie.
R:  Charlie?
L:  Yeah, Charlie.
R:  Okay, hi, Charlie, how are you this evening?
L:  Fine.  Where are you?
R:  Good.  Actually it's eleven thirty and I'm in Brooklyn, New York.  How about yourself?
L:  Oh, it's, uh, eight thirty, I'm in Tempe, Arizona. 
R:  Oh, a little bit different than eleven thirty at night.
L:  Wow.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Is that the time you put down?
R:  No, actually I think I put up to eleven but it's okay I happen to be up this evening.
L:  Okay.  So, do you exercise?
R:  Unfortunately, no.  Not as regularly as probably I should have.  Um, meaning I do a little bit of yoga during the week, as much as I can.  How about yourself?
L:  Yeah, uh, six days a week.
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wha- -- and what kind of exercise is that?
L:  Uh, three days a week I run --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and three days a week I lift weights.
R:  Oh, in a gym or in your house?
L:  Yeah at the university gym.
R:  Oh how wonderful.  Which means that you're young.
L:  Um, I'm fifty three years old.
R:  Wow!  Is it --
L:  I'm a graduate student at ASU.
R:  Oh, wonderful.  Is -- is it something new for you or have you always been athletically kind of been inclined.
L:  Um, I've been running -- yeah, I've pretty much always been.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been running for, jeeze, over ten years now.
R:  See and just --
L:  And, uh, weights, off and on but since I've been going to school here we've got this wonderful, wonderful  gym.
R:  See that's it, I guess, if you have the opportunity and it's there in front of you --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- then you do it.  And that's something that -- truthfully there's a cable program on -- on -- on our new cable system and it's a yoga program and I -- I just --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- started and at least it's something and, yes, I have done a little gym, you know, workouts but that was a while ago and --
L:  I saw a thing on the news the other night where they were saying that, you know, usually the standard used to be twenty minutes a day.
R:  And now?
L:  One hour.
R:  Wow.  Oh, I --
L:  It said Americans just aren't cutting it.
R:  Oh, they -- and  -- and you would think just the opposite.  People are much more aware that exercise is good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and look who's talking [LAUGH] because I just said I don't do as much as I should.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't quite -- I do an hour on the weights but I can't -- I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- run for an hour.  I run for about forty five minutes.
R:  Oh.  And that's one thing, I guess, everybody should do is kind of running, either, you know, indoor or outdoor.  We've -- we've gone from eighty degree weather today to forty degree weather tomorrow so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Here, this is the perfect place to exercise.  The weather is just fantastic.
R:  I see.  And, I guess, the reason -- I have no health problems so there's no excuses --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's just the -- you just -- I guess, I just don't do thi- -- as much as I should.
L:  The one thing I notice is that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at this university, you know, it's fifty thousand students here and, uh, some many students are health conscious that --
R:  I see.
L:  -- you get good vibes when you go to the gy-.  It's a recreation center.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  And it just surrounded by people that are just health conscious.
R:  And I guess  -- and it's hoping -- and accessible times too probably from early morning --
L:  Oh, it's open from six o'clock in the morning till eleven at night.
R:  I see, yeah.  Yeah, isn't that something?
L:  And, uh, so I make it a part of my, uh, curriculum.  I mean -- I mean it's just as important --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- as my studies.
R:  Say good for you.
L:  So, I -- I go.  I just love it.
R:  Say -- and I have to bend[?] when it comes to that and with all this new stuff around, you know, I -- I really should but --
L:  Well, yoga is great.
R:  Well, I try.  It's not as easy as --
L:  But what you need to do is some cardi- -- something to get the heart rate pumping.
R:  That's it, that's it, that's it.  And at least you --
L:  That's the most important muscle in the body.
R:  Mhm.  That's it.  That's what they say.
L:  You know, that's why I do it.  I don't -- I don't run very fast --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or very far but I just get that heart --
R:  You're not supposed to, right?  Like you say, you're just supposed to just kinda get it going kinda of thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm real slow.
R:  Good.
L:  But, uh, I do it.  Keep my heart pumping.
R:  Good, good.
L:  And so --
R:  And -- and even, you know, when you get older that's what you have to do.  It's --
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm forty two.
L:  Are you overweight?
R:  Um, about -- um, probably about five, ten pounds overweight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know --
L:  That's not too bad.
R:  No.  No, no, no, no.  And I try to watch that it and -- and it does have something to do with the exercise --
L:  Do you watch your diet?
R:  Yeah, I watch what I eat, yes.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  Yes, yes, yes, yes, definitely.
L:  Yeah, it's so easy to get out of hand.  The older you get the harder it's too lose weight.
R:  Sure, sure, you just get, you know -- yeah, when you have the forty hours, forty five hours -- I work retail so it's kinda like, you know, nonstop days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- but, as you said, I do try to do it several times a week.  And family as well.  I do have a thirteen year old overweight child which is something.
L:  Mhm, that's hard.
R:  And that's something that I -- I'm -- I'm very lax but it's getting better with her.  Meaning that she does watch much more than she has --
L:  Yeah.
R:  her whole -- her whole generation is -- is not what it should be.  And, as I said, they should be much more aware of health nutrition.  But, at the same time, they've got fast foods and -- and, you know --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  -- that kind of -- right, sure.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  It's all around them and --
L:  It's real hard on kids.
R:  -- that's it and that's what happens.
L:  It's so hard.
R:  Truly, truly. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if they get a good early start then it just gets easier and part of the daily routine which it should be.  You say an hour but I -- I -- I hope that one day it'll be twenty minutes even, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before bed or early in the morning.
L:  I think -- yeah.
R:  And there's that time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- it happens.
L:  Yeah, I hate to see the kids that are in that kind of shape.
R:  See that's what it is.  And -- and if they --
L:  Because with boys it's so hard.  And it's gonna be harder the older they get.
R:  That -- yeah.
L:  And they miss out on so many things in life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they have -- well, pick on people and stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's true too.  Absolutely.  She's -- she's not tremendously overweight but it's enough that it's a concern to mine and as -- as they say with health and, you know, and that kind of thing, you know, diabetes, heart, you know, all those things that make it harder [LAUGH] because you're -- you're genes and what have you too.  So, exercise has to play a part of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh -- what else can we say about exercising and nutrition, you know.
L:  Well, I think the two go together just hand in hand, you know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Diet and exercise.
R:  Absolutely, absolutely. 
L:  And to me the three most important things [LAUGH] are diet, exercise and piece of mind.
R:  Isn't that something I would say and -- and, as you said, you've been doing it for a long time now?  Even as a kid too.
L:  Yeah, the -- the running.  The weights off and on.  I -- I mean I used to lift weights when I was a kid and then I didn't for -- for a long, long time.  And then I got back into a little bit.
R:  But do you do the bodybuilding as well or ...?
L:  No, I don't -- no, my body doesn't seem to be changing much.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  It's been pretty much the form I developed as an adolescent stayed the same but I just do it because it feels good.  It's a good complement to running --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to do the weightlifting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't go for power and a lot of --
R:  Oh, okay and -- and treadmill part of your routine too or --
L:  No, 'cause I run.
R:  Ah.
L:  And I ride a bicycle every day.
R:  Ah, that too.  So, where do you work out --
L:  That's my transportation.
R:  Where -- oh you just do it as your transportation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- save getting in a car or what have you you do take the bike?
L:  I don't even have a car.
R:  Isn't that something.  You've got the weather down there for it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, it's great.
R:  That's something.  But I hear a Bostonian accent?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm from Boston.
R:  Yay [LAUGH].
L:  That's right and I've been out for two years.
R:  Ah, oh.
L:  It's beautiful out here.
R:  Isn't that something. I've never been out.
L:  I decided to go back to get my Masters Degree so --
R:  Wow.
L:  But, um, I was gonna say, uh, the diet and the exercise and, uh, um -- oh, with the -- oh yeah, comp- -- what I've rea- read a lot about is that weight bearing exercise --
R:  Meaning what, what are you -- what -- I don't unders-
L:  You really -- like -- like lifting weights --
R:  Weights.  Right, okay.
L:  -- it strengthens your bones.
R:  Which would make sense for women who have osteoporosis and --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Yeah, surely.
L:  When you start having problems with you knees and stuff to the contrary you think it's gonna, uh, hurt your more, it actually strengthens you.  And, I think, running is kind of a weight bearing exercise.
R:  It was like --
L:  You get the full weight of your body in every step.
R:  Ha.  We're just talking about -- well, I -- I just saw a deal in one of the local papers that happened to say, "Six weeks for like twenty nine dollars" and I said to my husband, "Boy, that's really inexpensive there" and he said, "Yeah" he happens to know people that work out on a gym so they were talking about -- he -- we were talking about a, um, a trainer and I said, "It is easier if somebody gives you that" you know, I wouldn't mind working out with a trainer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though, yes, you can do it yourself and people are friendly --
L:  It'd be nice.  I --
R:  -- you know, trying to teach you the ways to -- you know, or how to use machines and that kind of thing but --
L:  Yeah, it's incentive.  I see some of the people have private trainings at the gym I go to.
R:  Mhm, I see, right.
L:  Uh, and they have -- they have classes now and then or you can get like one training session as a student but, uh, the price is great.  I -- we -- I play like twenty five dollars for a semester.
R:  Oh wow!
L:  You know and it's, uh --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- ultra modern recreation center.
R:  Do they have a thing called spinning in -- in -- where you are?
L:  What is that?
R:  Spinning is -- is where it's a stationery bicycle and you kinda go as fast as you can kind of thing and it's like this new, I guess, um, with music or kinda like motivation more.
L:  I haven't seen that.
R:  But it's stationary.  And there was somewhere --
L:  We have a lot of stationary equipment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Bicycles and like skis and --
R:  Skis?  That's a new one.
L:  Well, I don't know if they call 'em skis.  They're -- they're -- there's like --
R:  But getting your feet --
L:  -- big long steps that move up and down.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I know which one you mean, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
L:  Looks like skiing.
R:  But -- and my friends have tried that one.  That's a very odd exercise [LAUGH].
L:  Well, one I like a lot is the rowing machines.  We just got some new rowing machines and they're wonderful.
R:  Yeah, which means that you're working every part of your body at that point and from --
L:  Yeah, that's what it says it's a full body exercise.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.
L:  And, uh, they have little computers on 'em that tell you how many calories you burn.
R:  I see.
L:  All our equipment is so modern now.  We've got a --
R:  I was just gonna say more computerized, yeah.
