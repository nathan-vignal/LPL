R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Joy.
L:  Hello, Joy, this is Barbara.
R:  Well, hi, Barbara.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They called me yesterday but nobody said, "Hello", so it's not the sa -- say hello to someone!
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And this is my first time to do this.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  Have you done it before?  [MN]
L:  Yeah, just yesterday was my first day.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well then, you kinda know what you're doing.
L:  Okay, well, um, what we do is, um, talk about, um, um, nine eleven.
R:  Right.
L:  And if, uh, that has affected our life or what we've done since nine eleven.
R:  [SIGH] God, how could it not affect our lives?
L:  Correct.  Um, it was --
R:  Or at least, that's how I feel, I don't know.
L:  Yes, it was -- it was, uh, a tragedy and an awaking- -- awakening for us, um, and our freedoms.
R:  And like, everything we took for granted.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or at least I think most people --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- take for granted everything we've got here.  My daughter's nineteen, but she just doesn't seem to get the concept of what the freedom is.  She can sit here and she just says, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't like the president, on and on and on".  But I said, "Do you not understand, because you live here, you can say that?"
L:  Correct.
R:  And -- and you can go to other countries and you can't say that.  Or you can say it, but you may die for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK]  Not every- --
L:  Uh, let's see, uh, effectiveness for, um, my immediate family, my cousin was actually flying into New York.
R:  Uh, oh.
L:  Um, with her daughter to see, uh, my uncle and aunt in New York, and he was there at the airport to pick her up.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, they were affected in a way that they literally packed their bags and left New York for a while.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, luckily, um, we didn't know anyone immediately in any of the -- the buildings, but, um, being that our cousins --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lived there, we know some of the people that, uh, one of 'em were friends.  So it -- it affected them even worse.  If you could think of your own home town or where you live --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and one of the buildings being -- or two buildings being, um, destroyed in that manner, um, it --
R:  Well, of c- -- I mean, of course, I -- I think people in New York had to have to felt it stronger than I did --
L:  And then the -- then the --
R:  -- because I'm so far away.
L:  Right.  And then the people that actually, uh, went to the buildings to save people and then their families were injured and they lost a lotta lives, so, um, it affected a lotta people in New York and then it -- it really made its way here because some of our firemen and policemen went and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- offered their services.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think it affected the whole United States, and um -- and in my job place, because we were, um, actually, uh, accepting shipments from other countries, it sorta put us at a standstill and a lotta restrictions were put on to the containers coming in, and it hurt the economy here, um, for a few months.  And, uh, literally, um, I was asked to go part time with my job, which then affected me.  So, um, it has affected ... um, our lives here, even though we don't live in New York.  How about you?
R:  Well I -- I think [MN] well, I think it just affected all of us.  Although no, it's not that seriously, I actually own a cleaning service --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so you wouldn't think that would be affective, however, because the cleaning -- getting your house cleaned or whatever, it's kind of a luxury I guess, uh, several customers, you know, would call in and cancel.  So I had to let two of my employees go.
L:  Right, see.
R:  Because there just wasn't enough work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, i- you know, in a roundabout way it did affect me.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  In the -- the first two months following it because everybody, you know, got a little nervous, "What's gonna happen?  Will I still have a job?" and so of course they were -- you know, house cleaning is your first thing to go.
L:  Oh yeah, luxuries.
R:  So ...
L:  And -- and I was selling, um, antique furniture and actually, um, uh, furniture from Asia and different parts of the world, so, [NOISE] um, even though -- that was just like a luxury par- um, piece too, so, [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, it did, uh, hurt our economy. [NOISE] Um, and then we are a travel city 'cause we're right on the ocean and -- and so it hurt, uh, even our travel people and hotels, so, yes, it wa- -- it affected us, um, [LIPSMACK] here and, um, of course, um, [LIPSMACK] everyone, uh, moves on and then, um, actually, uh, we just traveled out of the country, uh, recently, and luckily we went to a -- a place that like Americans.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, we wouldn't have gone otherwise.  So, it affects your travel plans too.
R:  Well, I- I'm sure, uh, obviously Greyhound's, uh, ticket sales went up greatly last year, after, you know, after the airline -- after everything happened, because people didn't wanna fly anymore.
L:  Correct.
R:  I don't like to fly but, see, I've never flown, and I didn't wanna fly before this happened, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in that aspect it didn't affect me because I never wanted to fly anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]  But, y- you know, and in truly -- it's for the rest of your life.  I mean, this is kinda like -- and of course I was too young to remember when Kennedy got shot, I was only a year old, but my -- I can remember my -- my mother saying, "I'll always remember where I was when Kennedy was shot".  Well, I'll always remember exactly what I was doing when I heard a plane had flown into the towers, and I'll never forget it.
L:  Yeah, I was at work.
R:  Yeah, I was at work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And someone -- and I didn't have a radio or a TV in my office.
L:  Yeah!  Somebody go- -- yeah, mhm.
R:  Neither one.  Somebody called me and said --
L:  Yeah, they called us --
R:  -- "Oh my God, are you watching this?"
L:  -- "You won't believe, yeah, what happened".
R:  And -- and it just so happened the radio in my car had blown up the day before.  I couldn't even go out to my car and listen, so I just shut the office down and went home.  Because I -- I just couldn't believe it was going on.  I said, "No, you must be wrong".  But, unfortunately she wasn't.
L:  And I think it woke up, uh, uh, the government.
R:  Well, hopefully.
L:  And, uh --
R:  But I -- I -- I don't know, I see it as something that they wanna -- I mean, this is like -- [LIPSMACK] I don't know.   I don't know anything else so traumatic.  But I don't think it's something we'll ever forget.  Hopefully, we don't ever forget.  I think we -- that maybe too many Americans were taking too much for granted.  And so now we appreciate a little more what we've got.
L:  I believe so.  I believe that that's exactly, uh, um, it hit home and then i- i- it, uh, it did make, uh, people realize, um, the simpler things and that, um, family, uh, meant a lot more, um ... [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I remember one of the stories that, uh, one of the girls, um, had been in a building before, that had been hit.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Or wasn't she one of the ones that, um, um, part of the building collapsed?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they rebuilt it, and then she went back to work in the -- in the same building.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  And then she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, she was here again, in this building and she said, well, you know, her livelihood has changed definitely.  So ...
R:  I think for a lotta people it just changed your whole outlook on life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I don't know, I mean, I don't mean dramatically, I just don't do a whole lotta things different but I -- I think a little more before I say or do something. [SIGH]
L:  I know it has affected the, uh, um, airlines.  As I said, uh, um, we were told not to take, you know, like even -- my husband was told that -- he smokes and he couldn't take his lighter, so he had to dispose of his lighter.  Um, and he was like, "Well why?  I'm not gonna --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you know, light somebody!" [LAUGH]
R:  But they don't know that!  Yeah.
L:  But they don't know that.  So I said, "Just do it.  I mean, what -- what are you arguing about?  You can buy matches" you know.
R:  And of cour- -- like I said, I've never flown but I -- I -- and I mean, of course watching the news and hearing from friends that do, I know that things are dramatically changed, that you've gotta get there two hours early and you've gotta go through all this check through and --
L:  Yes, you can't put --
R:  -- you can't park at the drop off place.
L:  Mhm, correct, mhm.
R:  And you can't do this, and I'm like, boy!
L:  [LIPSMACK] And they check in the -- you know, you're a suspect, I guess.  Um, I feel it's a s- -- a safety feature, though, um, for us all.
R:  [MN] And -- and I kinda feel like, I don't know, maybe not to this extreme, but I kinda feel like, [MN] should've been doing this all along.  Maybe we should've been a little more careful about checking people that got onto planes.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, because how did they come over here and -- with their visas, and when we're, uh, letting immigrants in, and I know we're all immigrants in one time or another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but weren't we, you know, they used to go through almost like if you were sick, you were quarantined, and -- and we don't do that anymore.
R:  Right.  You can just come over here.
L:  Yeah, you can get in a boat and come over.
R:  And, uh, you can just [MN] right.  And -- and I don't wanna say, "Oh, well we can't let people in anymore".
L:  No.
R:  But it -- to me it's almost -- it's almost to that point.  Because, [MN] I don't know, there -- there's just a lotta people I think, or I know there were several people that have actually come over from other countries, get their college degrees here, learn everything they can learn, and go back to their country to use it against us.
L:  Correct.
R:  Well ... so that doesn't seem like a great idea.
L:  So we -- I'd -- I -- I hope we've all learned something to, um, this tragedy and -- and I know they're rebuilding, which is positive and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think they're gonna do like, some kind of a memorial.  And, um, I know the out -- the, uh, you never want a terrorist to come over and, uh, um, hurt your country, but, uh
