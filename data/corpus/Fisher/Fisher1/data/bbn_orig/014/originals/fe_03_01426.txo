L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jim.
R:  Hi, my name is Tania.
L:  Hi, Tania, how you doing?
R:  [NOISE] I'm doing just fine, and you?
L:  Oh, I'm doing great, thanks.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, I didn't hear the whole topic, was it, uh, how has life been affected after September eleven?
R:  Yeah, how -- how -- I think it was how -- how that your life has changed since September eleventh. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh, do you want me to go first?
R:  Sure, that's fine.
L:  Um, you know, I talking to a friend about this the other day and it -- some of the changes are subtle --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, um, I really didn't think I was affected but, um, I noticed that when a plane goes by overhead --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- I get like this unsettled feeling in my stomach, like, "Is it going to get to its destination and is everything okay with it?"
R:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
L:  And, uh, when I'm driving through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, I -- I do get a sense of, you know, "I hope I get through the tunnel without any problems".  So, while it's -- I don't think it's on the surface, I think it's in the back of my mind --
R:  Right [NOISE].
L:  -- that -- that are certain things are going on --
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I do -- I am kind of aware of them.  And, uh, but as far as, um, I don't -- I haven't stopped going into Manhattan --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I haven't stopped traveling and I -- I wouldn't stop traveling.  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm gonna try and do everything that I've done on a regular --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- basis --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, not be fearful of these things.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But, um, -- and -- and I've -- I've been very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- blessed in that, thank god nobody in my family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was in the World Trade Center at the time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had some neighbors that were in the building but, thank god, they go out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I've been very fortunate in that respect.
R:  That is lucky, especially you being in New York.  I'm here in Texas so [NOISE] we're a little bit further --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- away and, you know, [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I have some friends who live in -- in New York but a different part of the state [NOISE] and everything so that, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it was like I -- I didn't know anybody there so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, almost to me -- I mean, you saw on the news forever but it was almost more like a dream, you know [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think if I knew somebody first hand [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that had been involved in it it would have been a whole different situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it, so --
L:  Um, did -- did you watch a lot of the news coverage?
R:  [NOISE] I watched a little bit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have -- I have three year old triplets though --
L:  Oh my goodness! [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so, so when they were there -- you know, they were really young at that point and I didn't want that kind of stuff on the TV.
L:  Right, right.
R:  'Cause, I mean, they wouldn't have understood it.  They probably wouldn't have even understood what was being seen [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's like I needed to keep myself cheery for them.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I -- we watched a lot of Barney at that time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And everything and I think that's another reason why it wasn't -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it wasn't as realistic to me because I did try and tune out of everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because of family life and things going on and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I --
L:  I know what you mean about it being so realist too.  'Cause I mean when I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I woke up and my mom had mentioned to me that a plane had gone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the first building --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, uh, I probably -- I thought it was probably just a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, an airplane that got misguided or something.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I put on the TV and then they actually showed the coverage live of the second one -- second plane --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it -- it just looked like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of these movies you had seen in the past --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- of one of these, um, tragedy movies happening.  It was so hard to comprehend --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, actually, uh, before the second plane hit, my brother works in, uh, Borough of Manhattan Community College --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is about five blocks away and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- um, he was telling me that he was watching people jump out of the first building and I kept telling him, "Stop looking, this is going to affect you, stop looking!"
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, he finally left the building and he started to, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- walk away from the building --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- his building that is, when the second tower fell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he -- then he had to start running because of the cloud of smoke was behind him, so, um, I think it has --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- affected him deeply.  I wish he would --
R:  I bet it has.
L:  Yeah, I wish he'd open up with it.  He doesn't open up to me.  I wish he would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get, you know, deal with it.  But, um, it's -- it's hard to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live here and not bump into someone who --
R:  Has been affected by it, I'm sure and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, it -- it really has been something.
R:  You know, that's right.  I think that was my way of dealing with it, like I said, I used the kids as an excuse to not watch it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and not pay attention to it, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] -- but it was -- you know, it's like -- so, my life -- I can't say my life has changed that much, I mean, I'm still family oriented, you know, and [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we travel as much as we -- we used to and everything like that and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's because, like I said, I -- I think I tuned a lot of it out [NOISE], you know.
L:  Right.
R:  For their sake and mine so -- and it was --
L:  If -- if you had an opportunity to travel to New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would you -- would you be hesitant?
R:  Oh, I would love to.
L:  Oh, okay.  You --
R:  I would love to.  I was a -- I was a air force brat and that's the thing I -- I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- married a -- I married a deep down Texan who barely has every been out of the state.
L:  Oh my goodness!
R:  So, [LAUGH] I was like trying to get him to [LAUGH] travel, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it just because he's used to Texas and he loves Texas and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but it's like if -- if I had a chance to go back to places like that and everything I would love to in a heart beat.
L:  Right, right.  Wow, so you wouldn't be afraid to --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- to get on an airplane at this time.
R:  No, and that's what we keep talking about, taking a trip 'cause we would like to take the kids to, like, Disneyland or Disney World or some park --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even just to California to see some of my relatives out there.
L:  Right.
R:  And we'll, like, take a plane and my husband at first said, "Well, we would need to take two planes 'cause if something happened at least we'd be split up" --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- and I said -- I said, "No".  I said, "David, you know, if -- if anything I'd rather fly together 'cause if something happens at least we all die together".
L:  Yeah, that's -- [LAUGH]
R:  I said, "I'd rather, you know, I'd rather perish with you --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- and know we're all together than -- than one of us have to go on living without the other person because we were --" you know.
L:  Yeah, that would be so hard.  Yeah.
R:  I said, "I'd rather travel together" [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't think -- I don't think anything's going to happen but --
L:  Right, right.  Mhm.
R:  -- if it would [NOISE] I'd rather do it together [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  I hear what you're saying, yeah.  Um, yeah I -- like I said, I don- -- I -- thank god I haven't been affected to the point where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I'm afraid to go into the city or do any traveling or --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- or get on an airplane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I do have some friends here who, uh, try to avoid going into Manhattan if they don't have to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and it -- that just bothers me, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- then they've won.  The terrorist's have won --
R:  That's right. [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And, uh -- but, um, uh, where -- where are you in Texas?  I have some friends in Galveston.
R:  Where in the, um, Dallas Fort Worth area.
L:  Oh okay, that's, uh, not too far.  I think that when I was down there -- I drove down there from New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a couple of times.  Dallas was like -- like three hundred and fifty miles.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I remember seeing the sign.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you like it down there?
R:  Yeah, I do.  We just moved -- we lived in Austin for a long time [NOISE] and  just moved to Dallas for my husband's job and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I'm still not used it [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that much but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but yeah I like it.  It's -- it's real nice.  We live on -- in a small town outside Dallas, not actually downtown Dallas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it's nice and everything it's not like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- traffic or everything every time you turn around, so --
L:  So, it's more of a suburb?
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's so nice and everything.
L:  Oh well, that's good.  But -- well, you have your hands full there, huh, three?
R:  Yes, that's right [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my goodness.  Oh.
R:  They keep me busy but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they're worth every minute on it.
L:  Oh, I'm sure they are, yeah.  Well, that's -- that's -- you have the hardest job on earth of being a mother.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you.
L:  Uh, yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  I -- I -- this is the first time I've actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- participated in this study.
R:  I -- I've had one call like about a month ago but then they hadn't called me back in a while so -- then I heard that they were going back through and getting recalls so --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- it's a pretty neat little thing just talking to somebody for ten minutes, you know, and --
L:  Yeah, it really.
R:  -- meet- meeting other people and not having to pay long distance for it [LAUGH].
L:  Ye- -- right, right.
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  I know, it really is good.  Yeah, uh, this is the first time I got called.  Actually I -- I had like an automated system on my phone that was ready to hang up on me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I pressed the button and the next thing I knew I was answering questions about what kind of phone I was using --
R:  [LAUGH] You're like, "Okay".
L:  -- and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know where this is going" I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause I didn't hear the front of the message and then, uh, the next thing I knew you were there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that was pretty funny but, uh --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah, but, uh, yeah I, um, I -- I've watched so much coverage of the -- of the war, probably way too much but I just kept, you know, you- -- they have the, um, I don't know if you know about it -- it's called the Presidential Prayer, it's like, uh, a site on the web and you can, like, adopt a soldier and pray for him.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And I was doing that so I guess I was watching the news to make sure that maybe I would see this soldier or whatnot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and know that he was okay,  you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, I've watched so much of it and, uh, I just kept waiting for the Iraqis to surrender.  I just kept praying --
R:  I know.
L:  -- they -- they need to lay down their arms --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because otherwise they're gonna die and we don't --
R:  [NOISE] I know.
L:  -- want them to die either, you know.
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, so I spent so much time, probably way too much time watching that but--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we live in such a complicated world now.
R:  We sure do.  It's hard.  It's like I -- sometimes I worry about what my kids are going to grow up into, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- and it's like, "Oh, I hope this gets settled out before they get --"
L:  Yea-
R:  -- old enough to really understand, you know.
L:  Right.  It --
R:  And it's like I watch it at night when they go to -- after they've gone to bed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- during the day again it's, like, I flip channels when I see stuff coming on 'cause --
L:  Right.
R:  -- now they are older and they do pay attention to TV and I see them watching it more, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm like going, "They don't need to see people shooting each other" and --
L:  No.
R:  -- and stuff like that, that's -- that's --
L:  No, absolutely, they don't need to be exposed to that.  It's -- it -- but it's just such a hard world now and now it's so hard to know whether our country should, uh, take --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- care before of something before it happens or --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- if -- if we go and -- and we're aggressive with other countries to try and take out terrorism, the world yells at us for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being -- being aggressive and doing that and then, if we wait and something happens to us they get criticized, "Well, why did you wait?"
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  It's -- it's like you can't win. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's a no win situation.
L:  It's -- yeah, really it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's so difficult to know.
R:  I just -- I just hate war talk and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and everything like that.  It's like these totally innocent victims that [NOISE], you know --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- that get hurt.  It's -- it's the ...
