L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hi, my name is Oleg.
R:  I'm Tammy.
L:  Tammy, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  So --
R:  You wanna start? [LAUGH]
L:  Have you had any changes in your life after September eleventh?
R:  No, not really.  I mean, we're more, you know, we watch more.  I mean, we watch more of the TV and, I mean, kinda keep more on the national news, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that.  But, I mean, as for life itself, I mean, you really can't change it.
L:  Yes, um, I really believe that, uh, the position of the United States is fairly secure as it is because, you know, we're a big country, we're across the ocean from other people and, uh, the way security is set up now, it's a lot tighter, so I don't really think, uh, that September eleventh could happen again -- something like that could happen again.  So I'm not worried that much.
R:  Right.  I feel -- I feel like -- like you said, I mean, we're m- -- we're -- I think since September eleventh things have gotten tighter, you know, like the security in New York City and I think people are more aware and they watch more and, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you kinda keep track of people around you as well as your family, more than you did before.
L:  I definitely do.
R:  But ...
L:  Well, one thing I didn't do is, uh, I didn't start storing a yearly supply of food in my home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no way!
L:  [LAUGH] No, just maybe an extra gallon of water.  Not that it'll help me in case something real bad will happen.
R:  Right.  No, we didn't go that far.  I mean, we just live normal, normal life.  I mean, you kinda worry more when your kids go to school, you know, because, I mean, you just don't know what's gonna happen.  I mean, if a terrorist went into the school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just don't know what is gonna happen there.  So I'm more afraid of my kids going to school every day than I was before.  But, as for life itself, I mean, you really can't change it, especially when you have kids.  Because, I mean, they don't understand, you know?
L:  Yeah.  In cases like that I notice usually it's not the new change.  The life -- usually life would change you if, you know, something really bad happened and you have to adjust to that, but fortunately we didn't really have to adjust to almost anything.  Um, there is, of course, tighter security and we have to adjust to that, but we do not have to deal with it every day.  And that definitely makes a difference, if we would have to deal with security every day and, you know, there would be check points and our peep- [inaudible] people on the road, and, you know, well, they suggested for us to carry guns twenty four seven, you know, that would definitely change our lives.  But --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- so far, well, I've gone on as usual.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, we have to be more watchful for, uh, stranger activity, but, uh, there's also other people who watch for bad guys and we know that.
R:  I notice too.  I watch -- I do watch CNN more than I -- I ever used to, since September eleventh.  Just so I know what is going on around me.  Where, I never used to really watch the news.
L:  Mm, yeah, now that you mention it, that's right, I do check on the news more often and, uh, I now check on more news, uh, international -- more international news, to see what's going on in the world --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- not just, uh, what's going on in United States.
R:  Right.  See, I -- I watch the news more, I mean, I only -- before September eleventh I hated to pick up a newspaper, because I hated all the bad news.  But now I kinda keep track of what's going on because now I want to know.  Where before, I really -- I kinda just, you know, went with the flow of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now I wanna know [LAUGH] what's going on around me.  I mean, here we don't really see a lot of what is going on, we live in a small community ti- town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, it's not as affected to us as it would be po- for, say, if we lived like, in New York City, Washington DC, you know, the big cities like Chicago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, places that actually would be hit.  I don't quite think they're gonna blow up a town that's what, two miles long [LAUGH], you know!
L:  Hm.  Yeah, that's what makes, you know, United States better in this worse time, because people -- there aren't many people in the same place at the same time, so again, people don't believe that, um, somebody would attack such spread out target.  So -- and we don't believe that something -- like, somebody could deploy a nuclear weapon or maybe poison the water supply, which would affect a great deal of people.  We just don't believe that it will happen, we believe that, uh, I mean, we're going to protected by the authorities, by our government.  And so far, considering nothing like that happened, and I'm sure somebody thought about it at least, if not try it, I think we are in fairly good hands regarding the protection.
R:  Right.
L:  Of course, I am a little worried about all this loss of privacy thing that government now m- n- wants to know more, but they do know more and they collect more information and keep it, about us.
R:  But that's for our safety, you know.
L:  Well, I know it is for our safety but I'm still perplexed because, you know, what they collect for our safety can be always turned against us, one way or another.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  But I think of it as my safety, you know?  I mean, as long as it's being used for my safety, uh, I guess [LAUGH] I can feel assured, you know?
L:  Well, but you see, you can't really draw the line.  Where does your safety stops and where it, you know, becomes kind of overboard.  You don't know when it's gonna happen.
R:  Right.
L:  You most likely will never know that it ha- -- may- maybe it already have happened.  We don't know what might be an excessive amount of watching, probing, you know, checking out people's lives.  [COUGH]
R:  Right, that's true.  I do feel too that airline security is a lot better ... since September eleventh, which is a plus because, I mean, really they didn't really, you know, it wasn't that great before September eleventh.
L:  Well, and still there are all those reports of people bringing guns on a plane or people -- somebody slipping past the security at the airport, it still happens.
R:  Well, there's no foolproof way, though, you know?  That's the sad part.
L:  Except not flying.  That's what, uh, that's why American Airlines were hurting right now, because people have stopped flying.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, I -- I'm personally, if I have to fly -- I did fly after September eleventh and I would have no problem flying, but, um, a lot of other people would probably rather drive, take a train or just stay at home and use -- and make a phone call.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  It does affect a lot of people who I know.  It didn't affect me in that way.
R:  I mean, the sad part is, though, there ain't anything, there's no foolproof way to ever stop everything, you know.  Therefore, I mean, security it tight and -- but it is not gonna ever stop everything.  You know, kinda like, I mean, now with this war, I mean, there's more security than there ever was, like, around the air bases, but they're not gonna be able to stop everything if something happens.
L:  Yes.  I think by the way that is the reason why Europe didn't want us to go, it was -- to the war with Iraq -- because Europe is right there, you know, there is no sea and there is no three thousand miles of Atlantic Ocean separating them from this war.  It's almost in -- well, I wouldn't say Europe's backyard but, uh, it's very close.
R:  Right.
L:  So I really didn't think they wanted any trouble from, uh, muslims who would be very offended by this war, offended enough to go and do something about it, physical --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to other people.
R:  Right.  But it does make me feel good that the government is going after the terrorists and the people who are to blame for a lot of the stuff going on.  I mean, showing 'em we're not gonna take it no more.  [MN] --
L:  Definitely.  Because if we don't -- because they'll -- then they'll just know that they can do whatever they want and, uh, there won't be any repercussions.
R:  Right, and until --
L:  And, uh, they have to show them that, yes, they're definitely gonna be a pay back for anything they do.
R:  Right.  And they're also showing the families of nine eleven that they're not gonna let the -- those people's deaths, you know, go unnoticed.
L:  Yes.
R:  By going after the people who are involved in it.  They're there for showing the families that, you know, they're taking care of business and they're not forgetting those people.
L:  Yes.
R:  Which I feel is a very good thing for closure for the people.
L:  Well, I don't really think it would help them much, it may help a little, but I think it definitely helps the rest of us who didn't suffer the great loss like the people whose families and friends got hurt in September eleventh.  However, uh, we know that we now taking preventive measures and I believe that preventive measures in such cases are the best because we have to go in first and, uh, before somebody else can take a strike on American soil or American interest overseas, we have to prevent it or show that, uh, if somebody does try to, that they are gonna to be grave consequences, much greater, much wor- -- or lot worse consequences and what they can do to us.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think it worked.  Then --
R:  Well, we still haven't got 'em though! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I really hope that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we did win the war, more or less.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- 
R:  But now they're talking about more war.
L:  Yes.  Well, unfortunately though, the
