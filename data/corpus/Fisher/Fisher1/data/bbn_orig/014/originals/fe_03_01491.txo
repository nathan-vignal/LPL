R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Fine, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  I'm Susan.
R:  My name is Vee Vee.
L:  Hi, Vee Vee.
R:  Hi.
L:  [COUGH] Well, I guess we are talking about September eleven, right?
R:  Right.  And changes we've made in our lives since then.
L:  Yeah.  I -- well, I don't know about you but I know September eleven is a very big impact --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for both of our lives.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh, at the beginning it does seem to be -- make a lot of difference in a life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But as time goes by, it's -- the impact seems to be, you know, well, it's still a very strong impact but it just not as strong to influence my daily life, as before.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, I agree with that and I think that that makes a lot of sense.  If it were like it was maybe September twelfth for the rest of your life, I mean, we would all be in a state of panic --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so we can't live like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So things have to kinda get back to normal, but we don't forget what happened.
L:  Yeah.  I remember at the beginning we are kind of really panicking and we cancel --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a trip to Florida.  To Disney.
R:  Oh, you canceled a trip, okay.
L:  Yeah.  We -- 
R:  So that's one change that you made.
L:  Yeah.  In December [LAUGH] my kids were still very pissed with us! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Because we cancel that.  And my husband say, "Well, it just not worth that kind of risk".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because at that time I think they have some kind of bulletin up all the time.  You always see, uh, uh, some kind of alert.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A red alert or something like that.
R:  Right, uh-huh.
L:  So, [COUGH] I remember we cancel that, that's a major event.
R:  Yes.
L:  And we just reduce the -- well, we -- we did reduce the -- the -- the sa- -- the times that we spent in public event.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  That's another things we did.
R:  Like, in malls and that kind of thing?
L:  Well, more like, uh, a park concert --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- or a carnival or --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- things like that.
R:  Big public gatherings.
L:  Yeah, yeah, something like that.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, I didn't cancel any trips or anything but I don't think that, uh, my husband doesn't like to fly and he never did like to fly.  But now --
L:  Oh, my husband doesn't like to fly too!
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  He has a +phobia about flying.
R:  Yeah, mine too.  And so even though we did fly before, um, September eleven, now we try to do vacations where we don't have to fly.
L:  Okay.
R:  And --
L:  So that's -- that's make a really big impact, well [NOISE] probably this and that put together.
R:  Yes, uh-huh, well, the war, you know, that was from a couple of weeks ago too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  So we started with, uh, w- we made some changes from that.  I work at a VA hospital.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  And so, um, they've made changes, whenever there are these alerts, like you were talking about with the alerts.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And, um, they lock more doors and do more screening, um, make sure e- everybody has a badge on, and that kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And report -- you know, there's just more, um, security --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they hire more police to look around.
L:  Yeah, I remember my husband was complaining -- I -- I'm a stay home mom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he -- he is working.  So he say that they -- their, uh, company went a part of [several inaudible words] Texas Instrument.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Texas Instrument have a huge -- we live in Texas -- they have a huge spray[?] for, you know, a whole block, a really huge block of the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we call it campus.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then [COUGH] at that time he -- he was complaining they lock all the entrance, except, I can't remember, but either one or two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he had to go all the way to that side --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then go in and then go all the way back to his side.
R:  Oh, yeah, see, that's what they do at our h- our hospital too, same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they just lifted that yesterday though.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, uh, so it's a little different now.
L:  Well, maybe the war is [NOISE] over it's more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody feel more comfortable.
R:  Yeah, I hope so.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I'm trying to think of any other changes in my life.  Can you think of any other changes in your life?
L:  Yes, I -- I can, I can.  And it's not -- it's not that w- what use you say?  It's not the things you can see.  I think the -- the September eleven make a very huge impact on economic.
R:  Economics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then it's -- because economy is something like -- well, you -- you don't see it like, one -- one dollar, two dollars, three dollars, but it make a indirect impact in our life.
R:  Mhm.  On the stock market and everything too, 'cause it was down.
L:  Yeah.  And everybody -- well, since -- right now everybody's, uh, welfare [MN] what shall I say?  Wealth of the family is -- most of them have some kind of investment --
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  Four one K. or I.I. or something.
R:  Sure, mhm.
L:  It does have a impact, though that -- that kind of impact is difficult to measure.
R:  Right, right.  Well, like you say, a dollar here, a dollar there, and the gas prices have gone up too.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like gas prices, okay.
R:  Yeah.  So we're paying a lot more than we paid right before September eleventh.
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the other day I was reading a, um, business article from, uh, Business Magazine and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [COUGH] it was talking about how the Bush -- our government raised war with the, you know, Middle East and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and how it's going to impact global economy because of the cost of doing business when, uh, you will have more security, more this, more that.  And I was reading that article, I was thinking, "Oh, it -- the timing seems to be wrong".  It's not because of this recent war.  I think that all this cost were not go -- went back to September eleventh, it doesn't start right now.
R:  [MN]
L:  The global unstabilization didn't start right this moment.
R:  No.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I think you're right about that, and we -- we don't [PAUSE] there's a lot of impact.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, life goes on! [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- um, one of my, uh, somebody I used to work with years ago was in the Pentagon when -- when -- on September eleventh, and he died in the Pentagon.
L:  Oh, that's really sad.
R:  And so -- yeah, and I think about him sometimes.  Of course, I thought about him, you know, on September eleventh last year, when it was one year anniversary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, it's a sad thing and -- and you think about how this could affect somebody you know and their family, and that kind of thing.  It's --
L:  Yeah, since -- since you have mentioned it, I did remember something.  I have a college classmate who lives in New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uptown New York, just around there.  And he work in downtown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in financial district too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And [COUGH] after September eleven I know he's -- he is okay --
R:  You do?
L:  -- but I lost contact with him.
R:  Oh.
L:  All the phone, all the email, all everything [LAUGH] it didn't work.
R:  And --
L:  And for some reason if he didn't contact me, I don't know where he is.
R:  So you don't know if he's okay?
L:  He's okay, uh, because I went -- I went back -- where I'm from, Taiwan, so I kinda ca- [MN] after like, ten days or some -- some -- so many days I was really worried, so I called back to Taiwan and talked to the classmates --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then they went to their family and ask.
R:  Oh.
L:  He is okay.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  But [LAUGH] we just couldn't break up.
R:  But you haven't been able to talk -- yeah.
L:  We lost contact.  I don't know what happened.  He might --
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, maybe he left and we saw the telephone book or whatever it is [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We just lost contact.
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at least you know he's okay.
L:  He's okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I make sure that.  If he's not okay I'll be much more worried.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This person I know who died was not a close friend but somebody I had known for a long time, I used to work with him about twenty years ago.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so I had known him for a long time.  But, um, you know, they -- you [inaudible] --
L:  Doesn't that feel really sad, if a tragedy hit so much closer to your --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to the home?
R:  Yeah, it is sad.  I knew some people in New York but nobody was affected.  But they -- every -- they say everybody in New York knows somebody who was killed.
L:  I -- I would say so, I would think so.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I [several inaudible words].
L:  I would think so.  Even -- even the -- my friends who live, uh, out west, like, Montana or Idaho or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over there, they know somebody [LAUGH] in New York that died.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It just like ...
R:  It's sad.
L:  But this -- this world is getting smaller and smaller --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because the communication is getting, uh, more convenience.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And most of us know somebody or somebody in the war over there right now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't know anybody but people I know, know somebody who are over there.
L:  I -- I -- I think so, I think so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Once you -- well, one time I really did think that you alway- -- that -- that article is saying, "You always think your, uh, your friend, uh, the circle of your friend isn't too big, but once you add up the acquaintance and their friend, you will find out you know thousands of people"!
R:  Yeah, that's true, that's right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They say you never, uh, what do they say?  Six -- six degrees of separation from the president, or something like that?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  Or, you'll know somebody who knows somebody and somehow you'll know them.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I still don't -- don't think I'm that grand! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, let's see, um, with travel, I think that was the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- main thing that sorta touched our lives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we've not, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ever since September eleven.  And just being more careful.  I suppose there is some racial profiling too, if you see somebody from the Middle East, you kinda look at them twice, but, you know, chances are they're not gonna be a terrorist.
L:  I know, and it doesn't feel really good, I always feel bad [LAUGH] if I do that!
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I always feel bad.  The -- the -- the moment you kinda look at them, you feel bad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because you kind of like, feel you are putting them in the position ma- that they might not be but you are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- +involuntarily [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just look at them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've always told the -- the folks at the VA, that patients that I deal with, I -- I tell them that, um, you know
