L:  Hi, my --
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm Barbara Fayle, I live in, uh, Mishopin[?], Pennsylvania. 
R:  From where in  Pennsylvania?
L:  Mishopin.  
R:  Mishopin?  I'm in -- I'm Pamela Long and I'm from Birdsville[?], Pennsylvania.  I'm out by Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, well, we're -- I'm sort of in the, uh, near Bimington[?], New York, um, north east corner.
R:  North east corner?  So, you're the --
L:  Scratton[?] --
R:  -- complete opposite end.  We're like the south west.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  My -- my --
R:  Yeah, south west corner.
L:  My stepdaughter lives in the Pittsburgh area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, she loves it.  And my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sister went to school there and loved it.  So, tow- one of the few towns in this country I've never been to.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Never been through it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  So, have you made any changes in your life since September eleventh?
L:  I went out and bought a gun.
R:  Oh, did you really?  That's a big change.  [LAUGH].
L:  I did.  Well, we lived, uh, my husband, uh, and I lived in -- on top of a mountain, um, with nobody around.  I mean, it's just --
R:  Okay.
L:  And we were both getting older, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we bought it for protection, um, wondering who knew it, at that time, right afterwards, what was going to -- you know, happen, whether --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know, we -- we thought if, uh, more raids on New York City, hordes of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be [LAUGH] you know, migrating and, you know, you may end up having to protect what was yours.
R:  That's right.
L:  To -- to survive.  So, uh, and then we -- then, um, I had heard where gun permits were going to be hard to obtain, so um, we figured while they were available, we'd get the gun and, uh, you know, have it if we needed it.
R:  That's right. 
L:  And it just sits there in it's little box [LAUGH].  Thank --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Thank God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, really, other than -- you know, I -- I went out and bought food and things like that, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I've let those supplies dwindle down.  How about you?
R:  Yeah.  No, not really too many changes.  Um, we never, like, flew a lot --
L:  Yeah, me --
R:  -- not much at all, so you know, that didn't affect us too much, although I don't know if I would've been real happy with flying --
L:  Not me.
R:  -- if I had to, you know, with the way --
L:  I was never happy in -- to begin with.
R:  What's that?
L:  I wasn't happy flying to begin with.
R:  [LAUGH].  That's right.
L:  You know, I had to have two martinis before I got on --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the plane.
R:  Right.
L:  And keep them coming once they got me in my seat.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh --
R:  Have you flown since September eleventh at all?
L:  Actually, um, no.  I'm -- I -- we moved up on top of the mountain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it was what -- where we wanted to be.  I -- we traveled, uh, you know, through our younger years all over the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we -- I just -- I don't want to go anywhere.  My family's all in Chicago for Easter and they -- they say, "We're not even going to ask if you want to come.  We know you're not going to leave" and -- and my husband died right after we moved in, so I'm here alone.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, I just love it.
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm very happy, so --
R:  You like the solitude, huh?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  You like the solitude?
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  I do.  But I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tell you what, now with the -- the -- with the, uh, the nine eleven and then this war --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- it is a little frightening, you know?  You don't know exactly -- you know, there's so much, uh, that you don't know and they don't tell you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, whether -- you know --
R:  Have you worried about terrorists attacks in your area or anything?
L:  No.
R:  And you say you're -- you're somewhat close to New York?
L:  No -- well, yeah, but --
R:  But not -- not New York City, though?
L:  -- not -- no, not -- not -- well, we're actually about two hours away from New York City.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I would be worried about maybe a cloud of, uh, nuclear, uh, you know, particles floating over.
R:  Yes.
L:  I did -- I did go out and, uh, buy duck tape.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, did you?  [LAUGH].
L:  Duck tape and actually, I'd used plastic bags and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- decide which room I would camp out in.
R:  Right.
L:  They say you only need --
R:  In case there's any sort of chemical or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- biological --
L:  Yeah.  And I bought some stuff to, uh, some pills to take that save your thyroid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If, um, you know, if there's a nuclear, uh, leak or, uh, you know, a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nuclear disaster.  But --
R:  Yeah.  I worried about things, like terrorist attacks and, um, different things.  You know, we're in a rural area also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're not like downtown, but um, I've not really done anything to alter my life.
L:  Me either.  It --
R:  I figure anything can happen anywhere you are, right?
L:  That's exactly right.  [COUGH].  I think we're th- we probably feel safer than people living [COUGH] especially in New York City --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- feel.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, hey, um, you know, I'm glad I don't have young children that, you know, have to be growing up in this world today.
R:  It -- it's -- it's hard.  I have teenagers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- they're pretty good kids, but I know a lot of, uh, people have trouble with their teenagers and -- and, um, we've been lucky so far.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Knock on wood.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think it's all --
R:  My -- my daughter's going down to Washington DC, uh, this summer for a presidential class from scholars program, and I was a little concerned about whether to -- when she first asked, whether to let her go to DC with new -- all the other kids.  You know, they're all supervised and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um --
L:  Because of -- because of Washington being a --
R:  Well, the -- because being -- being in -- DC would definitely be a target area --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if anything were to be happening.
L:  I would --
R:  But then again, security is pretty good down there right now.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know?
L:  Like, you know, people tend to, um, relax, you know, when there's -- when nothing's going on, you know, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh --
R:  But you can't live your life in fear, right?
L:  No.  You can't.
R:  Of what might happen.
L:  I think Washington, though, with the President being there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is -- is -- is a lot more secure than, say, New York City would be.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, how are they going to pay for all this security?  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The taxes, um, you know, they're --
R:  I don't know.  President Bush is talking about planning to, you know, tax cuts.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know how he's going to do it, [LAUGH] like, where he's coming up with the money. 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Or has he --
R:  Well, he's taken it away --
L:  -- found a way to --
R:  -- from other programs, I guess.
L:  Yeah, the tax, the cigarettes.  I smoke, I --
R:  Well --
L:  I've been buying my cigarettes on the internet.
R:  Yeah, have you?
L:  They -- they -- they come from Switzerland.
R:  From Switzerland?
L:  I pay fourteen dollars a carton as --
R:  That's --
L:  -- opposed to forty dollars in -- in the st- you know --
R:  Is that what they are now?
L:  Forty dollars a carton.
R:  God.
L:  Forty and change.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I thought they were still, like, twenty something?
L:  No.  I mean,  I -- I'd have to give up smoking.  My gosh.  [LAUGH].  That would be terrible.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I wish I could give it up, but I really don't have the desire to, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, I tried.  I had a pneumonia at one point and I tried and then when I felt well enough, I was back to smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But anyway --
R:  Yeah.  Has anything --
L:  I can't think of what else.  You know, I -- I've -- I don't really want to travel, but I guess, you know, getting the gun and keeping my TV on a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  On -- on news stations, which I never watched before.
R:  I think that's probably something that I'm doing more of since September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm more aware of, uh, uh, you know, keeping more in touch with news.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and everything.  Now, how -- how did you first hear about September eleventh?  I had the T- I actually had the TV on.
L:  We -- yeah.  We actually did, too.  My husband, uh, used to --
R:  I had the Today Show on --
L:  -- like to watch --
R:  -- and they showed the first plane hit and it's, like, oh my gosh, what a horrible accident.
L:  I know.
R:  And then the next thing you know, this other plane hits and it's like, that couldn't --
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  -- possibly have been an acci- accident.
L:  Yeah, you knew it wasn't.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And then, you know --
R:  You know -- did you have the TV on when it actually happened --
L:  Yeah.  My --
R:  -- or did you find out about it later?
L:  My husband was, uh, he was an invalid at the time --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and he, uh, he used to sit with the TV on all the time, so ABC, he would watch Good Morning America.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- or else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what -- maybe he was watching Regis and Kelly, I think.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think it had gotten into --
R:  Well, it happened, I think, right before --
L:  Yeah, right at that time --
R:  -- nine -- nine o'clock or something.
L:  -- and -- and um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he said, "Barb, Barb, come in here and watch this", and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I came in and I remember -- and I said, I said, that's not an accident, that's a terrorist, right?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he looked at me --
R:  It's a terrible shock that something like that could actually happen, you know, of that magnitude in --
L:  That -- I --
R:  -- America and then just watching the whole thing unfold, the second plane, and then, you know, the plane in Pentagon, and then the plane here in Pennsylvania.
L:  I know.
R:  That went down, that they're saying that they actually diverted possibly from, you know, going to the White House.
L:  Right.  They -- they have a song now out by -- I listened to --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- the only -- we don't have great radio here, and uh, on top of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the mountain, so the only --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- station I get clear is country and western, which I'm not complaining about.
R:  You -- you have satellite --
L:  I like --
R:  -- out there?  Do you have satellite TV?
L:  For television I have to have, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Do you -- you have satellite?
L:  Satellite --
R:  You know, it's like a dish?
L:  -- dish.  I have dish network.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Television is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay, but radio is, uh, I get one good station and that's country and western, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they sing this song about -- about the plane and the guy talking to his wife and, oh, it just brings me to tears.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Those poor people.
R:  Is it just like somebody on that plane that --
L:  Call- calling --
R:  -- went down?
L:  -- his wife to say goodbye one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- last time.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- tell her he loves her one last time.  It's --
R:  Brings --
L:  -- it's sad --
R:  -- tears to your eyes every time, right?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  That would -- that -- that would choke me up.
L:  Yeah.  It does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and -- and it brings back the -- you know, the memories of the -- of the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which -- unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I often think that the people that died might be luckier --
