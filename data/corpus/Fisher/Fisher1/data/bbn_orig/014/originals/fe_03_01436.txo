L:  Hi.  I'm Tan- --
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Tanya from Wisconsin.
R:  Um, I'm Sammy Ore from, uh, South Carolina.  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, as far as changes since September eleventh, um, I have never -- I never really did any flying, but I definitely didn't think about doing any more after that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Um, I guess same for me.  I don't fly that often, but it -- it did make me really nervous.  Uh, my spouse had to fly a few months after that, and it made me nervous.  Um --
R:  Did he have to fly out of country?
L:  Uh, no, just within the state.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  And it wasn't anywhere in the area of where, you know, the actual planes blew up or anything, over New York, but it still kinda made me worry about it.
R:  Yeah.  Um, it also made me paranoid that, you know, if they hit something like that, you know, what makes them think that they wouldn't hit schools and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, you know, I've considered home schooling my two year old.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.  And I -- I actually have a thirteen year old, a nine year old and a seven year old, and four, and it's the same thing here, it made me really nervous and just more suspicious of people.  [NOISE].  
R:  An- and also, you know, they had so much coverage that, uh, I had to go buy movies for her to watch, so that she didn't have to watch that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, and -- you know, so I changed what I watched through the day because, you know, at first we had nine eleven, then we had the war, you know, that had continuous coverage, so --
L:  Right.  [NOISE].
R:  -- I just -- I have to keep it on PBS or keep movies going.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  And that's -- and it -- you know, that's what I found, too, after it happened.  It -- it almost became obsession to my husband and I to watch, you know, the TV constantly, of what was developing and it even happened again once the war started that, you know, I felt like I was just glued to seeing what was happening next.  And that --
R:  I sort of think it made me more aware that -- I think the government at that time knew more than what they were telling us --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- but I don't think they anticipated that happening.
L:  Right, and that's how I -- I felt, too, and I felt very suspicious of the government and in my own little way, I think I felt betrayed by them, that you know, there weren't -- they hadn't done more or let the public know more.  Um --
R:  Yeah, 'cause, you know, the -- the flight in Pittsburgh exploded and, you know, sometimes you wonder if they didn't shoot it down.
L:  Right.
R:  Although I know that, you know, those passengers may have attacked him and he might of been -- the terrorist, he might have been strapped with explosives which, you know, set off --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, you know, you just don't -- you don't know.
L:  Right.  [NOISE].  You're just, like, you're given the whole picture and --
R:  Yeah.  I don't understand why they had some stuff, but you know, choose what they want to give to the public.
L:  Right.  Now, did you feel like you were, uh -- did you feel like you were more patriotic, as far as putting the flags out and what not after September eleventh?
R:  I did.  
L:  Yeah, and I -- we still actually have the newspaper decal in the -- I think it was the Chicago Tribune, that um, you could put on your car and we still have it in our window and um, we've kind of got red, white and blue things outside.
R:  Well, I -- we've got, um, car tags that someone from Texas had paid for, I think in all the states, it says, "In God we Trust".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, you know, to me, that reper- the flag is under, "In God we Trust".
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].  And so, you know, we thought about getting that and, uh, I really need to get a new flag because it is just worn out 'cause I fly it all the time and I don't -- I don't ever -- it's down now, but I don't take it down until I need to.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And I don't just hang it up like at Memorial Day or July fourth or, you know, special occasions any more.  I pretty much fly it all the time.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's how I've been, too, and I -- we had one on our antenna for a while, but it came off and I haven't replaced it, but --
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, we --
L:  Yeah, I just --
R:  -- we had, like, arranged where they had some that you could roll up in your window --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or -- or somehow it was in their window, and they were, like, on backward or for -- like, three months.
L:  Right.
R:  And you -- so, you know, you saw a few riding around with it, but when I went to get it, they said I had to be put on the waiting list [LAUGH] and --
L:  Yeah, to get it.
R:  -- so I'm, like, well maybe I'll just try and find a sticker.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, but as far as -- you know, making me change my -- adjust my daily habits, I didn't really change them.  Um, I did go -- I bought some water that we put in storage now, just for -- I don't know, I just felt like -- I worried about that even more so once the war started, that contaminants in the water or whatever, are a little bit bothersome to me.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I'm kinda like you, not much really changed.  It just make me realize that, you know, we're that much closer to Armageddon.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  And I -- that's how I felt, too.  It's like, you know, everybody just assumes nothing would ever happen in the United States, and that was a really big wake up call for everybody, that -- that nobody's untouchable, you know?  If somebody wants to do something, it's -- you know?  There's ways of finding it, to ha- make it happen. 
R:  That's right, and you know, it -- it kinda makes -- you know, if I were to go to Chicago and want to go in the Seers Tower, that September eleventh would blast in my head.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.
R:  But, you know, I'm -- I don't know any other thing to do except put it in God's hands and [NOISE] you know, if it's -- if it's my time to go, then that's what's going to happen, because I can't really do anything to stop terrorists.
L:  Right.  We can't control a thing.
R:  So, why -- why should I even waste my time worrying about it?
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause that's what the- that's their -- I think that's their main go, anyway, is to scare everybody.
L:  Right.  To get into our minds or whatever?
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Our minds, our lives, and everything else.
L:  Right.  And it -- I think it certainly has, um, you know, changed like at the airport and what not, where my husband went through they -- you know, did the baggage check and things like that.  No, I -- I mean, it seemed like an inconvenience, but it's a good thing, too, that they're taking all the extra precautions about it.
R:  I do think that I'm more cautious about -- you know, like this SARS?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It kind of makes you -- or -- or even like when the [inaudible] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Was come -- it -- it makes you wonder if they didn't cause that somehow, you know, like by selecting mosquitos and injecting them with something and then releasing them over here, you know?  I -- I know it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- bizarre, but --
L:  Right, it --
R:  -- I -- it's stuff like that just pops in my mind and so, you know, when one of mine gets a cold, I'm like --
L:  Yeah, you just have a suspicion of --
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- what --
R:  -- you -- you don't know if they're going to get into the food lines, so you -- you -- I -- I do a lot of organic gardening.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which, you know, is not going to do no good if the ground gets radiation in it.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  That's -- so you have a two year old?
R:  Um, I have a two year old, a twenty three year old and an eighteen year old.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  And two grandchildren.
L:  Okay.  So you started from scratch?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, my -- my second husband --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- didn't have children and so that's why we had the two year old.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, that's great, though.
R:  Yeah.  And I didn't really get to raise my two.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's what -- you know, like I said, after September eleventh, I was like, you know, I really would like to home school her because I would hate for something to happen and her not be with me, you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It's just -- maybe I'm over protective, but --
L:  Right.  That's -- I guess that were some of my precautions were more towards my children and worrying about them and even with them watching TV, they have a, um, child at the elementary school that I guess is -- I'm not sure what -- it -- he wears the drape clothing and stuff, and it -- even the young kids, you know, were suspicious towards him and I try to teach them to not be prejudiced, but it's -- when they see all that on TV, it's hard for them, even as kids, to not think things about it.
R:  Well, shoot, you have adults acting a lot worse.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that -- we -- I don't live that far from Charlotte, North Carolina, which -- they say is supposed to be the bank capital on the East Coast --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- but they -- they elevated the terror alert when that happened.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, they even elevated it higher than what the national alert was.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, it -- it made me -- 'cause, you know, that -- that's our -- where we shop and go out to eat a lot now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or, we used to, so now we start -- we eat closer to home and, you know, if we decide to take trips, we -- we take the -- the two year old with us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, we try to encourage my old- my oldest child to, you know, try to do more things with the kids.
L:  Right.  [NOISE].
R:  'Cause you just never know what's going to happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- you know, they -- even though they've dropped the -- the -- the status to elevated instead of, you know, the next to the highest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think -- I think that the terrorists may be watching that.
L:  Right.
R:  Because th- those people, you know, if you do suicide bombs, you just don't -- you don't what to expect from them.
L:  Right.  And that's -- I think that -- you know, that was the thing --
