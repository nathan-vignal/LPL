R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Jamie.
R:  This is Amber.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  And my response to that is gonna be real short, I've made [LAUGH] no changes!
L:  Yeah, I was gonna say [LAUGH] pretty much the same thing.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm a big fan of travel and the -- the biggest thing to me is that I would like to go to the Middle East and don't feel comfortable doing that any more and I'm a little more cautious about traveling in general, but it certainly hasn't freaked me out to the point of, you know, not traveling or restricting myself altogether, but ...
R:  Yeah.  How -- where are you located?
L:  Uh, in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay, so you were actually w- I'm am in Connecticut, um, we're kind north east of Hartford.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, we're both of us, I mean, not real close to New York City --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but close enough.  I mean, it's not like we're out in, you know, Kansas [LAUGH] or something!
L:  Well, the weird thing is, I was actually in Ireland at the time and I -- I watched the whole thing, I watched it from the very beginning when they were sort of like, had no idea what was going on, a plane was buzzing around there and then I saw the whole thing on TV and it was just like some weird movie, some weird action movie or something.
R:  Right.
L:  It was really bizarre.  And I -- I was ... really shocked I guess but then I just sort of felt like, oh my God, we've had this coming and -- not that we deserved it in any way but that -- this was definitely a result of the way we've been acting in the world and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I think -- I think the people that perpetrated it were, I mean, were fanatics and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it wasn't a rational thing.  But I -- I do think that we, in some ways, brought it on ourselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And certainly those people shouldn't have suffered for that.  But ...
R:  Right.  Um, y- well, you said you were in Ireland, so do you travel a lot?
L:  Um, that was my first time really, out of the country.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Besides like, visiting friends in Canada.  But, yeah, I was -- actually, originally I was teaching English in the Czech Republic for a couple of months and then, um, I stopped in Ireland on my way back over here, um, the friend --
R:  So you were on your way home?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We --
R:  And couldn't get back home?
L:  No, we got delayed [LAUGH] for a little while, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Now, would you go back to Czech Republic and would you go back through Ireland, now?
L:  Oh sure, oh yeah, definitely.
R:  So, this wouldn't have affected your travel?
L:  Not -- not there.  I just ... I don't know, I just -- I think it's sad that -- I mean, I guess I would be a little more cautious going places in general, just -- I've always felt a little uncomfortable with how Americans are viewed in that [LAUGH] some senses we deserve the way that we're viewed, but just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, that we're very disconnected from the international world and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I -- I feel a little uncomfortable about that, but not -- not necessarily for my own safety, except perhaps in the Middle East I would -- I would not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably visit there now.
R:  Yeah.  Well I n- -- I didn't like to fly, I had a really bad flight that had nothing to do with nine eleven. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I, uh, we landed in, um, right before, um, tornadoes came into Florida.
L:  Oh God, ooh!
R:  And, um, the weather pattern was moving in.  We didn't land into the tornadoes but we landed into the weather pattern.
L:  Oh, man!
R:  And after that flight I never wanted to get on another one again in my life.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it was like, "Let me off right now --"
L: Yeah.
R:  "-- I don't wanna be on here and I, you know, you don't land".  So, I- I can't say that I like -- I haven't liked to fly since then.
L:  No, I wouldn't either.
R:  And I can't say that I'd like to fly less, now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I -- although I g- -- I've gotta say that every once in a while when the terrorist alert goes off --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or something like that happens, I think [NOISE] more about it being in a public place or in a big place or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on public transportation or [MN] say like, over, um, the school vacations here where -- where, uh, quite a few of my friends and relatives were gonna be traveling when they raise the terrorist alert --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right in -- in.  And I -- I guess, [NOISE] you know, I think of it more like that.  [NOISE]  But I don't know if I've really, other than that, done anything.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I didn't even buy duct tape or whatever it is [LAUGH] they were saying!  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you?  I mean, I have -- we have duct tape, but I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, there's h- hardly any on the roll and it's um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it's g- -- it's because it, you know, holds everything together that we've got it, it's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you do anything precautionary like that or put in water or extra food or ...?
L:  Not really, I mean, I -- I guess I feel [LAUGH] prepared enough but that if something were to happen that that stuff wasn't really [LAUGH] gonna help me anyway, but ... [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I don't -- I don't go around living in fear, but when, you know, when I hear something on the news about the alert and everything, I think more about it being on the ground and being in public places, like you said, that's ...
R:  Yeah.  And I guess if I was inclined to travel outside of the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there would be any number of countries right now that I would be disinclined to visit [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really ... unfortunate.
R:  You know what I mean?  And like you say, the Middle East, I would love to, at some point, you know, see like, Israel or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I would absolutely never go there but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we don't really have the money to do that anyway so it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R: -- kind of a moot point, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- should -- if I was rich enough to do it, I most certainly you're -- like you, would not visit there right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just think it -- I  -- I kinda think it'd be crazy.
L:  Well, totally off topic but I'm a poor college student and I [LAUGH] -- I did it, but you just have to make a lot of sacrifices, like I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, definitely sleeping in hostels and sometimes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sleeping on benches! [LAUGH]  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just depends how [inaudible] comfort you wanna have.
R:  Yeah.  Well, i- in -- it depends on who -- you see, I have a five year old and a two year old, so, well, I mean --
L:  Right.  I'd be a little different.
R:  -- y- you know, if I did it or my -- my husband and I did it, it'd be one thing ...
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  And -- and I think that -- that probably has changed my thinking probably more even than the terrorism and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that is to have a five year old and a two year old, that any decisions I make --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that endanger my own personal safety, impacts, you know, their right to have a mother [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  And I -- I just don't really feel like I have the right to make --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- decisions that impair on my wellbeing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- knowingly.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, because, you know, well, like I say, you know, I should, you know, I've taken out a commitment of two children, I should be --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- take on a commitment to raise them if I can.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...but, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But that's -- so how about like, with the Phi- -- like, would you go, like, the Philippines or some of those other kinds of places?
L:  I guess --
R:  Just -- just not the Mi- Middle East?
L:  Yeah, I guess I would still go.  I'm -- I'm going to Japan in the fall and I -- I mean, I just not really that fond of flying in the first place and that's a big flight and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I wouldn't not go there because of this, so ...
R:  Mm.  Although -- although SARS might give you a thought! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that -- that's [LAUGH] another concern and --
R:  Yeah, another whole -- whole another thing.
L:  -- and the whole scene in Korea is a little bit troubling and I'm not really too up on how the relations are with Japan right now, what's going on with that.  But I --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think that this -- the nine eleven -- would affect me going.
R:  Right.  Well, and I -- I think nine eleven, I would feel very --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I would still feel like -- we, um, adopted our children.  Had they come from Korea --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we were thinking, um, and actually in the works to a- adopt someone from Korea.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and also I would've considered China.  And had my children been in those countries, nothing would've stopped me! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't care what the flight was like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever, I would've been on it.  Um, so that wouldn't have changed at all.
L:  That's true.  Huh.
R:  You know?  And I -- I would still, you know, go to those countries, although, uh, it would give me pause -- not that you can -- but it would give me -- definitely give me pause to adopt from the Middle East [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or -- or somewhere like that.  I -- I don't know if I would wanna go there.
L:  It might be kind of precarious, yeah.
R:  E- even South America, I mean, there's some places down there right now --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that I'm not so sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] You know, where you just really feel, well --
L:  Yeah, that's one place where I -- I would love to go but I would definitely want to have a strong base there and know people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and speak the language and have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have some way another than just being a tourist.  I would not feel comfortable doing that.
R:  Right.  Well, and it's -- you think too, when there's -- when there's warnings on, you know, the websites --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, from the United States and they warn against certain areas or certain countries.
L:  Right.
R:  They don't do it lightly, I don't believe.
L:  Huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  And so I think -- I -- I think when you knowingly put yourself into danger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, if they put a warning out on a -- on a country becau- -- they usually do it-- I mean, there's gotta be a pretty high level of unrest there --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- for them to put the warning on.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  And if you knowingly go there -- not that people deserve it, but you know, they -- they are really ... accepting a -- a level of risk.
L:  Yeah, you should know you're taking that risk.
R:  In their own hands.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- then when something happens, it's not quite like the people in the Twin Towers that all -- their whole entire crime was, they went to work!
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  I- -- it's -- you know?  I don't know.
L:  That's true.
R:  It just is a kind of a difference to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't -- I don't think there is any part of the United States I wouldn't feel safe in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although I think ... s- --
L:  I did -- one time I -- a couple of weeks ago there was -- well, maybe it was more than that, I don't remember -- a month or so ago there was supposed to be a huge protest in New York and [SIGH] my friend invited me to go and I was asking about the best way to get there and he said, "Just don't drive, it's crazy, there's all these security measures here".  So I guess that influenced me more than feeling I was going to be in danger, just feeling that there were checkpoints and it would be a big inconvenience to travel there at that point.
R:  Yeah.  So I guess that kinda, in a way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- was not really what the first thing you would think of as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- nine e- eleven, but it's the whole security measures things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and what you have to do and that they're gonna confiscate your, um, fingernail clipper [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you go on the airplane.  I mean, there's a few of those kind of things.  And I -- and I guess those ways have changed too.  Like, I think
