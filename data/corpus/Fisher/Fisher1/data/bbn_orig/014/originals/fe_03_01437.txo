L:  Hi, I'm Dionne.
R:  Tobi.  
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  How you doing?  [SIGH].
R:  I'm doing good.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm pretty okay.  It's kinda grey outside, so --
R:  Where you from?
L:  I'm in Atlanta.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in, um, [inaudible] Louisiana, close to New Orleans.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I'm in Georgia, looking about to rain.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not over here.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  How are we supposed to do this?
L:  Yeah.  Talking about, um, Sept- what changes have we made in our lives since September eleventh, and to tell you the truth, I haven't really made any drastic changes.  I might of, um, I'm a little bit more cautious, I guess, you know of things around me, what's going on.  I kinda watch the stock market maybe a little bit more and [SIGH], um --
R:  I think I'm more closer with my family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it makes you kinda think that one day they might not be there, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wo- sometimes planes scare me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know it may sound kinda funny, but sometimes I hear a plane coming, especially now with the war also, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You hear a plane and you, like, look out to make sure that it's not going to crash, 'cause I'm real close to New Orleans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know right after September eleventh, I was really scared.  I thought that, you know, something was going to happen here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I didn't want -- you know, with cars that -- you know, you go to the store, you know, and you -- you see somebody that looks different from you and you're like, you know, is that somebody who -- you know, do they have a bomb on them?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know?  It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I have a small child, too, so it also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, affects the way I look with her, because I don't want -- I -- I don't want anything to happen to her.
L:  Of course.  
R:  So, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it ha- it hasn't drastically changed my life, but I think it makes my eyes a -- a little bit more open so, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's going on in the world, makes me watch the news a little bit more and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I -- I don't know, I just [NOISE].
L:  To me, it just kinda like -- I mean, I -- I knew that eventually something like this was going to happen anyway, there's going to be many more things that happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, I mean, just basically it's -- it's coming now to -- it's about really -- about to be the end of the world, you know what I'm saying --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whether people want to think -- think about it, or you know, just try to push it to the side, it is going to happen and these are basically -- I don't know what religion you are, this is not even any religion, this is just if you read the Bible, these are just the signs of the times, different things --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- just happen, you know?  And, this whole thing going on now, a war, nation versus nation, and just all this other crazy stuff.  I mean, this is going to get -- gradually get worse and the worser it gets, it's just know that th- the coming is soon, but I mean, like you said, I -- I do try to keep both eyes open, I'm a little more cautious.  Of course, with the little war going on now, everyone's watching the news a little bit more, even though it's like trying to settle down or die down now.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, there was just a shooting in New Orleans also, in a school and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- that -- that shocked me because that's close to home, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You think, you know, how is your kids even safe at home?  You know, you're not even safe, you know, going to work?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  There's people just go and sh- on planes and -- yo- -- you're just -- you're not safe anywheres, just the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess it's changed my lie.  'Cause I'm twenty five, you know, um, I'm fairly young and, you know, I have one child and it -- having a child makes you also open your eyes to what's going on because I think if I was younger and it wouldn't even -- it wouldn't bother me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause she doesn't know what's going on.  I'm not going to tell her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  At this age, but --
L:  Yeah.  'Cause she wouldn't understand anyway, so --
R:  Yeah, she wouldn't understand.  My friend has a seven year old, and he doesn't even know what's going on.
L:  My brother I don't think really understands.  He's thirteen, so --
R:  Yeah.  My mom's a school teacher and they're not even allowed to talk about it in the schools.  So, which is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good, because they don't need to be around it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the schools either, so I mean, it's bad enough that their parents are probably watching it twenty four seven --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they have to go to school and see it, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know, I think every -- it's just the world, everybody is just full of hatred, no matter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where you are.  You know, you're judged wherever you go and no matter what -- what race or, you know, what kind of ethnicity, you know, you are, people are going to look at you different and somebody doesn't like you, you never know what's going to happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, I don't go into the city.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I don't like New Orleans.  I try to stay out of the city, period.  I don't want tobe a part of it --
L:  It kind of violent to you?
R:  See, it -- yeah, you never know what's going to happen.
L:  True.
R:  They don't know how to drive, um, that's where a lot of crime go -- you know, you can go and saw [inaudible] Dixie and he might go shoot you.
L:  Oh, Lord.
R:  I mean, you never know what's going to ha- it's just New Orleans.  It's just not a -- it's not a good city and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- people go out there to the French Quarter for Mardi Gras, and you know, you -- you might end up getting shot.
L:  Yeah.  I don't even know it was really that even dangerous like that.  I've never been, but my sister, of course, they've been down there a couple of times for Mardi Gras and go to Bourbon Street, or whatever, but -- mm.
R:  Yeah, if you go -- if you go there late enough or if you go there during certain times, then it's not safe.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, you go in groups.  You don't go over there by yourself.
L:  Mm, okay.
R:  Because people, like, steal you wallet, you know?  There's always those people that ruin it, Mardi Gras, they rui- you know, they always have to ruin it.  I know September eleventh really affected Mardi Gras.
L:  Mm.
R:  And all the different things that we've had down here, I think Super Bowl was here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or something else, there's something else here that they had a -- you know, top security.  You know, you feel safe, but you never know.  I think I went to a football game right after September eleventh --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and I was nervous, being up in the Superdome with all those people and saying, you know what, this is a good place to bomb because there's so many people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it was packed and I was -- I was literally nervous.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 'cause you never know, 'cause I'm thinking, you know, these people, they're not -- you know, they're not going to do another plane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wasn't scared to ride a plane, they're not going to pull that again.  They're going to do something different.
L:  Yeah.  And you never know what it -- what it is, but I guess the only thing that kinda saves me from even being frightened or even worried about anything like that, that's just life, period, and that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just, I guess, how -- if God created it, things are going to happen, and if they're meant to happen, they're supposed to happen, they're going to happen anyway.  That's to you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's to me, that's to anybody, so you can't really sit around and actually worry or be thinking about, "Well, I hope this doesn't happen".  You just have to try to pray and keep a -- a pretty close relationship with God and just ask, whatever does happen, let me able to handle it, let me able to deal with it, 'cause if it's meant to happen to you, it going to happen anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  Like me, I was really about to go into the Reserves for a minute, even while, like, the war was going on.  People were like, "Are you crazy?  The war's going on and they're even sending reserves to the war".  If it's -- if it's meant for me to go to Kuwait[?] or whatever, even though by the time I got in there, it wouldn't even probably be a war anyway, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of course there's going to be more things further on in life, you know, I could end up in, but when it's time for you to go, it's your time to go.  You can't sit and worry about that, you know, that you have to live --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your life, you have to go out there and do the same thing, 'cause it's going to get worse.  It -- there's going to be more things, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, I guess I kinda look --
R:  Yeah, and all the people opposing it --
L:  -- at it like that.
R:  -- which is so -- makes me feel like they're not supporting the troops who are out there, risking their lives for us.
L:  Yeah, it doesn't matter what kind of feelings you have, or what George Bush, the decision he made, you still have to give them -- you know, support them for being out there protecting us, 'cause we're not out there, so I mean --
R:  'Cause they want to be --
L:  -- somebody has to do it.  Yeah.
R:  They want to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And those people, I mean, I'm in -- I'm in law studies, and I was learning that the people on September eleventh, the people that weren't in the building, that were, um, out having coffee before they went to work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were claiming insurance on their families.  Like, pretending like they were dead in order to get insurance money, and that right there --
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  -- was really wrong.  Because all these par- these people suffer with families and that, they're just trying to get a free ride out of it, which is sad.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  'Cause all the families that really did lose --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, they probably didn't get what they needed, and then they have these other little jerks out there that are just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to make --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a couple dollars.  
L:  I wonder how they could even try to do something like that, 'cause they'll eventually know that --
R:  Yeah, they event- they found --
L:  -- you're still living.
R:  -- a bunch of them, yeah.  They found them.
L:  That -- that's so dumb, I mean, 'cause they're still living.  What they going to do?  Go under, like, another code or something, another name?
R:  You can go under somebody else's name.  It's real easy to do it.
L:  And just act like you're another totally different person for the rest of your life?
R:  You just go -- yeah, you can just go look and pull up a deceased person's name and just go up and say, "My name is this person and I don't have my social security number, I lost it in a fire", and you get a new social and a new name.
L:  Mm.  Oh, okay.  I get it.  You know, that's --
R:  So, that's what they do.
L:  Yeah, you can -- yeah, well, you do bad like that, it's going to come back.
R:  Right.  I mean, there's ways.  You know, I mean, I learned about -- you know, he's not teaching us how to do it, but he was just telling us, you know, what these people are doing, you know, trying to get some money for their families illegally, which leaves probably less money for the people that are really -- that really did suffer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I mean, that right there was so sad.  I thought that was New Orleans, because my mother in law told me it's on, on the TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just see this building burning and I was, like, what is this?  She's crying, you know?  I thought it was New Orleans.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I mean, that was a real shock.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know, it was sort of like, what?  I got it -- re- it didn't hit me, I didn't know what was going on.  I was, like, what's so bad?  Okay, well, a plane hit, I didn't realize the effects of it.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And then my dad flies a lot and it makes me nervous, because I mean, I really don't think they're going to do it on a plane again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- but I was so scared that the plane, like, maybe that day because they had some other flights, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then your emails, you know, they get bombarded with, "This is the end of the world, Friday the thirteenth, the end of the world" because this is what's happening, and then you start freaking out, oh, my God, like, it's the end of the world because --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- Nostradamus predicted this, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All these crazy emails and I'm just glad that I -- you know, I wasn't in that city, 'cause I don't know what I would of done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yep.
R:  But, um --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- as far as, like, effect, you know, I do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my normal day thing.  Like, I was scared to leave -- I had to return a movie, a blockbuster, September eleventh, and I was scared to leave my house [LAUGH].  I didn't want to go --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know, leave and return?  I didn't know what was going on.
L:  Actually, it was kinda crazy, because um, earlier that day, I was at home and I was watching TV and I -- and I saw what it's like later on that day, I end up going over to my friend's house, it's way over there, maybe like thirty minutes away and, like, every -- and we were -- I think we went to the mall or --
