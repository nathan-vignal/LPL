L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
R:  Hi, I'm Raylene.
L:  Hi.  Uh, how did September eleventh change my life?  Uh, well, I'm very -- I'm more aware of wha- -- everything that's going on around me.  Uh, I try to pay more attention to people, uh, their actions and things like that.  Um, part of my thing is, I work for the government as it is, so we're -- we're very much trained on trying to stay alert.
R:  Have you taken extra training?
L:  Uh, they give us extra training --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- all the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Okay.
L:  How's it changed your life?
R:  Um, I'm more aware, more thankful for what I have.
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  I live in a ve- very, very rural area so, um, why we were -- I'm very much aware of what happened, the chances of something like that happening where I live are practically slim to none.  I live in Minnesota, in a rural part of Minnesota.
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm on the East Coast.
R:  Okay, I can hear your accent! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm on the East Coast and I'm right between New York and Washington DC --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, uh --
R:  We were in DC in August and we could -- we, um, noticed all the new barriers --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and all the new security measures that had gone up since --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- nine eleven.  And it was -- it was, um, comforting and yet it was scary.
L:  Sure it is, very terrifying.
R:  Yeah.  Um, other than that, I guess, um, life has continued as normal.  I had no one -- I wasn't personally affected by it, were y- -- did you have anyone ...?
L:  Um, not ind- -- not directly.  Indirectly, somebody.  Like the -- as in my family that had somebody who actually, um, someone, uh, one of my cousins, he -- a good friend of his --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, they had just had a baby and they decided that the husband was gonna stay home and she had just gone back into the w- -- to work.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And she -- she lost her life.  [SIGH]
R:  So, when you're -- when you know of someone personally I think, are you more aware of it?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I am thinking with somebody more personally, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess in working for the government, um, i- i- its -- it's on my mind constantly, like if I go and travel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, even if I'm just taking a relative up to the airport, [SIGH] uh, i- it's on my mind constantly that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, they tell you like, to alter your ro- -- your routes when you're -- in your day to day living, and I try to do that.
R:  Okay.
L:  And like, I keep my eyes open, my ears open, um, pay more attention to my surroundings and what's going on around me.
R:  Right.  I guess -- my daughter just flew in and I was, uh, more aware of her flying, you know, I didn't wanna say, "Don't fly" but y- there's the -- the threat, and especially with the war going on.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I think that's, you know, related to nine one one.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You're just ware of it.  And like you said, you pay more attention to where you're at and -- and pagers[?] that are left standing around and this type of thing.
L:  Yeah, but you can't -- you -- like you said, you can't let it alter your life.
R:  No.
L:  You have to go on living.
R:  Exactly.  I think if we, uh, go into our shells and our houses --
L:  Then -- then they've won.
R:  -- and basements -- then they've wo- exactly.
L:  They have won.
R:  [MN]
L:  They have terrified us to stop living.
R:  Right.  And so --
L:  And --
R:  -- I just don't feel that that's the right thing to do either.
L:  N- neither.  I have a two and a half year old and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I -- and I want the world for him, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and i- it's the weirdest thing because I had a child late in life and all I was ... d- growing up I was thinking, "Oh, I'd hate to bring a baby into this world" you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Thinking the way the world was going, not even speculating that it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- was gonna happen the way it was go- -- you know, that anything like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- could possibly happen.  And I happened to be home that day, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and watched it happen.  And I was in -- I was in total shock --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, to see it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and then when it hit -- I think when it hit the Pentagon i- i- felt -- I felt like it hit me more personally because that was a government install- you know, building.
R:  Right.
L:  And that scared the -- the daylights out of me.
R:  Oh yes --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I can understand that.  Very much so.
L:  You know.  I -- I wouldn't say it didn't bother -- it bothered me, but it didn't hit home as much as, now you're on my coast, now you're -- now you're on my home front!
R:  Right.  You're -- you're on my -- yeah, you're on my -- on my ho- -- on my ground.
L:  That's right, a- and, you know, here I am, right between the two things, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I can understand that very -- very much because of, uh, that's like, the corridor too, you know, f- for people to travel up and down and -- and terrorists to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to go anywhere near there.
L:  [NOISE] That's right. [NOISE]
R:  So, anyway.  We're supposed to be talking, what, for ten minutes?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oh my gracious! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And --
R:  That seems like a long time! [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, also working with the military, I -- I appreciate --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I mean, I appreciate the military to no end.  I -- I think that the soldiers are fantastic for what they [inaudible] and I -- I -- [SIGH] my heart and prayers are with them every second o- of the day, um, to try and protect us.
R:  Right. Did, um, do you think nine eleven had anything to do with w- -- or Saddam Hussein has anything to do with nine eleven?
L:  I'm not sure, to be honest with you.  I -- I'm not, uh, I've -- well, I've said, having a child, I have the Disney channel on all the time [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I don't want him to see this.
R:  Right.
L:  He's too young right now to even comprehend, and he's also at that age where he's picking up on things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't want him to be scared out of his wits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's too young for that.  So, I'm not really paying attention as much to what's going on as most people do.
R:  Okay.  I --
L:  But, um, I try to read the newspaper once in a while when I can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or if I'm online, read what's going on on MSNBC or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.  I know the day nine eleven came -- I work in the, uh, library at our education -- at our local --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- school district, and so we had, uh, it's for K. through six, we had grades five and six in there, and it was -- it was terrible for them and yet they -- we felt as a staff that they needed to know what was going on.
L:  Of course.
R:  And they needed to get the facts straight and be with someone that they trusted.  And, um, yeah, I can -- I can -- I'll never forget that day because we had all these kids cramped into this library and asking us questions and, you know, they'd go home and see it too but maybe mom and dad wouldn't be there right away to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to see this terrible thing and -- and to answer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of their questions and stuff.  So ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And plus there's the fact that some of these people's, uh, kids aren't -- don't like to a- talk to their parents or the parents aren't available to talk to them about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- these things.
L:  Sure.
R:  So ... but other -- well, like I said previously, um, I just don't think my life, other than being more aware of things, has really changed.  Um, one thing that did change out here is, right after this, or in a day or two, gas prices, you know, tripled and quadrupled.
L:  Oh, geez.
R:  And, um, we live in a farming community, so that really did affect us th- that way.
L:  Sure.
R:  But it didn't -- it didn't take long for them to come down when they realized what was happening. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  That was something I was afraid of happening with the war now [SIGH] --
R:  That --
L:  -- was that the gas prices were gonna sky rocket.  And i- they've creeped but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- i- it's not as drastically as I had imagined it would be.
R:  Right.  And don't you think part of that was because the, um, the gas fields were saved?
L:  Y- um, yeah.  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  So, anyway -- let's see, what else can I tell you about nine eleven?  I'm not sure.  Have you seen the memorial or anything?  People say it's really colorful.
L:  No.  Not -- not the, um, uh, I've seen pictures.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've seen, you know, photographs that, um, are of like, th- the big flag that they have out in, I think it might be out in California, [NOISE] in this big field. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  And that was just a- amazing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I think this has altered our life.  We'll remember this day just like remember the day, uh, well for me, that Kennedy was shot.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's one of those days that -- that you will -- you will remember where you were, like, the Space Challenger, when this all happened, you remember --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- exactly where you were, and that type of thing.  So ... okay, I -- I guess I don't really have anything else to say!
L:  Well, we gotta hang on 'til like, the beep comes on and tells us that --
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my second call, I did one last night.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I just --
L:  So ...
R:  I just, um, signed up about, oh, maybe three, four hours ago, so I was surprised to get a call this fast.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  I signed up about a month ago or so, and then when I got a call last night it was like, what is this?
R:  Right.
L:  Totally forgot about it! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I was reading on, uh, on one of the in line boa- -- online boards that people are -- are getting c- lots of calls and stuff, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it should be -- it should be a fun experience.
L:  Yeah, and I find it very interesting because I like to hear someone else's thoughts on -- on the subject of the day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, a- and, um, even just talking to someone else about it like this, it kinda puts y- you see, like I said, see -- seeing things from somebody else's perspective, but it gives you more to think about yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I think people become polarized, you know, you -- you know your views, um, in your own community and neighborhood.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But maybe not outside the neighborhood?
L:  Right, not knowing how it affects the -- a different part of the country.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I know one thing, I -- I was really scared that, you know, I -- I still think about all those bridges out there and how they -- I keep hearing things that, you know, those could be a big target, or -- or the nuclear plants, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a- and all I -- all I can do is just pray for everyone every day [NOISE] that, you know, [NOISE] God is with them and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this isn't gonna happen again.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I guess maybe I'm very naive but I cannot fathom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- such a thing happening again.  I think, you know, like you had said, the military were all on alert
