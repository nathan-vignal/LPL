THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO KNOW ARE THE ONES THAT IT AFFECTS SO  (fe_03_01438-B-0046)
BUT I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE I MEAN THEY COULD STILL BE STATESIDE FOR ALL I KNOW  (fe_03_01438-B-0047)

TOO WEIRD  (fe_03_01438-B-0062)
AND PEOPLE THAT I KNEW WERE WERE CHANGING I'M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AND THERE WERE TEACHERS  (fe_03_01438-B-0063)
SUBS THAT I KNOW THAT WERE TELLING THE SUB OFFICE THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE WHEN WAS IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHEN THEY WERE THAT WAS THE END OF ONE OF THE ISLAMIC HOLIDAYS OR SOMETHING AND THEY WERE SAYING THAT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE THE DAY THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK  (fe_03_01438-B-0064)
THIS IS BEFORE THE WA- THE WAR EVEN STARTED BUT THEY WERE CALLING IN AND SAYING THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE THAT DAY AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TEACH THAT DAY BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN AND I THOUGHT  (fe_03_01438-B-0065)
THAT'S JUST YOU YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR LIFE JUST THINKING SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_01438-B-0066)

IT PISSED ME OFF [LAUGHTER] MADE ME MADDER THAN ANYTHING  (fe_03_01438-B-0071)
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I'M A WAR SUPPORTER BUT I I THINK THAT BY NOT SUPPORTING WHAT'S GOING ON BY THE COUNTRY GOING ON WITH THE COUNTRY THAT LIKE GEORGE BUSH KEEPS SAYING IF YOU'RE NOT WITH US YOU'RE AGAINST US  (fe_03_01438-B-0072)
AND ASK SOMEONE WHO'S IN THE MILITARY TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE DOING THAT ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I HAVEN'T GONE ANYWHERE BUT TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE DOING THE PROTESTING THAT CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT BRING THE SPIRITS DOWN OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FORCED TO BE THERE  (fe_03_01438-B-0073)
THEY SEE THAT I MEAN THEY YOU KNOW THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON PEOPLE ARE TELLING THEM WHAT'S GOING ON  (fe_03_01438-B-0074)
I JUST I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING THERE BEING ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE FIGHTING AND HEARING FROM BACK HOME OR GETTING A LETTER FROM HOME OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THAT PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING AGAINST WHAT YOU'RE DOING THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME FEEL SO HORRIBLE AND IT DID MAKE ME FEEL HORRIBLE EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T DOING IT  (fe_03_01438-B-0075)
I JUST THINK THAT WAS IT'S A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE THING TO DO TO THE HUMAN SPIRIT  (fe_03_01438-B-0076)

OH THIS COULD BECOME A HEATED CONVERSATION [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE I'M A TOTAL BUSH SUPPORTER AND [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01438-B-0078)
