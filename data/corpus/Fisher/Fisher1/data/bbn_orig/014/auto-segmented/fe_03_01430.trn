YEAH YOU SAID UM WHEN IT HAPPENED YOU WERE GOING TO DO A BIRTHDAY  (fe_03_01430-A-0077)
IT WAS FOR THE KIDS  (fe_03_01430-A-0078)
HI MY NAME'S ED [MN]  (fe_03_01430-B-0001)
I'M IN KIND OF A SIMILAR SITUATION I AM AN EX NEW YORKER LIVING IN VIRGINIA  (fe_03_01430-B-0002)
[LAUGHTER] IT'S A SMALL WORLD ISN'T IT  (fe_03_01430-B-0003)
AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF RELATIVES IN NEW YORK I HAVE BEEN IN THIS AREA FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS BUT I'VE GOT A STEPMOTHER A SISTER A WHOLE A WHOLE LARGE STEP FAMILY AND A LOT OF CONNECTIONS IN NEW YORK SOME OF WHOM ARE IN THE FINANCIAL BUSINESS  (fe_03_01430-B-0004)
AND I  (fe_03_01430-B-0005)
WAS CONCERNED WHEN THINGS WERE HAPPENING WHEN WHEN PLANES WERE CRASHING AND ALL  (fe_03_01430-B-0006)
FOR RELATIVES AND AH SOME IN LAWS BUT EVERYBODY TURNED OUT TO BE OKAY AND AND AMAZINGLY ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'D WORKED AT THE PENTAGON AND KNEW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THERE  (fe_03_01430-B-0007)
I AS FAR AS I CAN TELL I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WAS EVEN INJURED IN EITHER OF THE CATASTROPHES  (fe_03_01430-B-0008)
AND OF COURSE I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT  (fe_03_01430-B-0009)
WE HAD PLANS TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY ON I THINK IT'S ABOUT OCTOBER EIGHTH OR SEVENTH  (fe_03_01430-B-0010)
AND WE HAD OUR TICKETS IN HAND AND THEN SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH CAME ALONG AND WE DECIDED THAT  (fe_03_01430-B-0011)
FIRST OF ALL EVERYTHING WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT SAFER AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND SECONDLY WE WEREN'T GOING TO LET THE POSSIBILITY OF TERRORISTS WRECK WHAT HAD BEEN A PLAN FOR THE KIDS TO HAVE A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY WEEKEND  (fe_03_01430-B-0012)
SO WE WENT OFF TO THE BAHAMAS AND HAD I GUESS FOUR DAYS THERE OVER THE COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND AND THEN AH CAME HOME  (fe_03_01430-B-0013)
AND EVERYTHING WAS AMAZINGLY NORMAL EXCEPT FOR AIRPORT SECURITY WHICH WAS A BIT OF A MESS ESPECIALLY AROUND WASHINGTON  (fe_03_01430-B-0014)
AND SINCE THEN [MN] I THINK WE'VE BEEN  (fe_03_01430-B-0015)
WE'VE STAYED A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO HOME BUT IT HASN'T BEEN SPECIFICALLY SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I THINK IT'S REALLY BEEN MORE THE EFFECT OF [MN] THE SECURITY PROBLEMS AND THE AIRLINE PROBLEMS AND THE ACTUAL TRAVEL ISSUES  (fe_03_01430-B-0016)
UM WE HAVEN'T STAYED OUT OF WASHINGTON AND OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE A PRIME TARGET BUT WE GO IN BY METRO WE GO IN BY CAR WE DRIVE AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE AND SHOW FRIENDS THE MUSEUMS BUT WE HAVEN'T CUT BACK ON ANY OF THAT ACTIVITY AT ALL  (fe_03_01430-B-0017)
IT'S NOT THAT I MINDED SO MUCH IT'S THAT I USED TO  (fe_03_01430-B-0018)
WELL YEARS AGO WHEN I TRAVELLED A LOT I'D FLY OUT OF NATIONAL AIRPORT AND I LIVED OUT AT ALEXANDRIA AND I WAS MAYBE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT BY CAR AND I WOULD LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT LESS THAN AN HOUR BEFORE FLIGHT TIME AND I NEVER MISSED A PLANE  (fe_03_01430-B-0019)
AND THESE DAYS FIRST OF ALL THE TRANSPORTATION HAS GOTTEN SO BAD AND SECONDLY THE THE AIRPORT STUFF HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT I'D HAVE TO LEAVE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE THE FLIGHT TO MAKE SURE OF GETTING IT  (fe_03_01430-B-0020)
AND I MIGHT END UP WITH AN HOUR ON MY HANDS TO KILL AT THE AIRPORT BUT BUT I HAVE TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A LONG STAY BEHIND SOME LINES  (fe_03_01430-B-0021)
AND SO IT'S CHANGED THE FREQUENCY THAT I DO SHORT TRIPS IT DOESN'T STOP ME FROM DOING  (fe_03_01430-B-0022)
OH A TRIP WITH THE FAMILY ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT IT STOPS ME FROM POPPING UP TO NEW YORK TO VISIT WITH MY SISTER FOR JUST A JUST A DAY  (fe_03_01430-B-0023)
WHICH I USED TO DO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WHERE WE HAD FAMILY BUSINESS MEETINGS AND I WOULD GO UP THERE IN THE MORNING AND COME BACK DRAGGED OUT LATE AT NIGHT AND I HAVEN'T MADE A TRIP LIKE THAT IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS  (fe_03_01430-B-0024)
YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01430-B-0025)
I LIVE NOT FAR FROM DULLES AIRPORT AND IT WAS WONDERFUL WHEN EVERYTHING WAS GROUNDED AND THEN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WHEN THERE WERE JUST A FEW FLIGHTS FLYING BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING NOISY PRETTY MUCH UNTIL ABOUT TEN IN THE EVENING IT WAS NICE AND QUIET ALL DAY LONG [LAUGHTER] YOU COULD  (fe_03_01430-B-0026)
HEAR THE NEIGHBORS CUTTING THEIR GRASS A MILE AWAY  (fe_03_01430-B-0027)
AND NOW IT'S KIND OF JUST THE OPPOSITE IT'S NOT THAT THE SKIES ARE SO BUSY OR SO NOISY BUT IT'S THAT WHENEVER I SEE AN AIRPLANE OR HEAR AN AIRPLANE I STOP TO THINK WHAT'S THAT AIRPLANE DOING IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE IS IT ONE THAT I RECOGNIZE  (fe_03_01430-B-0028)
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO I HEARD  (fe_03_01430-B-0029)
PROBABLY A MILITARY JET PROBABLY FLYING QUITE LOW AND DEFINITELY MAKING A LOT OF NOISE AND IT'S UNUSUAL TO HEAR AH JET AIRCRAFT LOW RIGHT WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T FLY OVER US ON THE WAY INTO THE AIRPORT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO  (fe_03_01430-B-0030)
AND I WENT RUNNING OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE HECK WAS MAKING ALL THAT RACKET AND  (fe_03_01430-B-0031)
I THINK IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULDN'T HAVE I MIGHT HAVE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE IF I SPOTTED ANYTHING BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY OPENED THE DOOR AND GONE OUT TO SEE IF I COULD SPOT IT  (fe_03_01430-B-0032)
PART OF THAT'S BECAUSE I'M AH AN AIRPLANE NUT AND I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN AIRPLANES AND IF IT WAS SOMETHING EXOTIC I'D LIKE TO GET A LOOK AT IT BUT IT NEVER SHOWED UP TO ME  (fe_03_01430-B-0033)
I AGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY AND I'M A PRETTY STUBBORN GUY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01430-B-0034)
YEAH IT WAS HARD TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS TO THE KIDS THAT WE WANTED THEM TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO LET IT STOP US FROM DOING THINGS THEY COULDN'T  (fe_03_01430-B-0035)
THEY HAD TO WORK A LITTLE BIT TO SORT OUT THAT THAT FINE LINE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO TREAD AND WHY COULDN'T WE JUST POP IN THE AIRPLANE AND GO OFF TO SEE GRANDPA WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE MORE TROUBLE THAN IT USED TO BE  (fe_03_01430-B-0036)
YEAH WE HAD SOMETHING LINED UP FOR I GUESS A LITTLE LESS THAN A MONTH ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_01430-B-0037)
AND  (fe_03_01430-B-0038)
YEAH WE TOOK THE KIDS AND THE AIRPLANE WAS  (fe_03_01430-B-0039)
