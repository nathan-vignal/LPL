AND THEY LOOK PLUS THEY TELL YOU THAT THEY DO RANDOM CHECKS NOW THAT SCARES ME A LITTLE BIT ALTHOUGH I KNOW THEY CAN'T JUST CHECK EVERY SINGLE ONE  (fe_03_01427-B-0046)
BUT SOME CRIMINAL COULD LOOK THROUGH THIS LOOK THROUGH THE SYSTEM MAYBE AND AND JUST CALCULATE WHAT A RANDOM CHECK WOULD WOULD UH WHERE THAT WOULD PUT HIM AND HE COULD TRY SOMETHING  (fe_03_01427-B-0047)
MAYBE I'M PARANOID [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01427-B-0049)
