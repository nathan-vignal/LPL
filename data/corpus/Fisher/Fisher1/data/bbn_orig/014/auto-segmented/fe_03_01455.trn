SPIRITUALITY HAS CHANGED ANY OR DEEPENED ANY MORE SINCE THAT TIME  (fe_03_01455-A-0010)
UM I'VE  (fe_03_01455-A-0011)
TRIED TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO  (fe_03_01455-A-0012)
STILL  (fe_03_01455-A-0013)
ACCEPT DIFFERENT PEOPLE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WITH THE ATTACKS UM  (fe_03_01455-A-0014)
UM  (fe_03_01455-A-0015)

RIGHT RIGHT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY OR HAVE YOU DONE DIFFERENTLY  (fe_03_01455-A-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_01455-A-0021)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01455-A-0028)
NO THAT'S FOR SURE THAT IS REALLY FOR SURE  (fe_03_01455-A-0029)
RIGHT RIGHT BUT BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER COMMUNITY EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE ELSE AND SO EVERYONE IS MORE AWARE OF ODD THINGS GOING ON  (fe_03_01455-A-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01455-A-0031)
YEAH  (fe_03_01455-A-0032)
RIGHT VERY TRUE VERY VERY TRUE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01455-A-0033)
[NOISE] RIGHT  (fe_03_01455-A-0034)
RIGHT AND THAT IS A HUGE CHANGE FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM  (fe_03_01455-A-0035)
THE HUGE METROPOLIS OF CHICAGO TO A TOWN OF EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE  (fe_03_01455-A-0036)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A VERY HUGE LIFE CHANGE  (fe_03_01455-A-0037)
THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_01455-A-0039)
I I THOUGHT I MADE A SIMILAR CHANGE WHEN I MOVED FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUT TO THE MIDWEST  (fe_03_01455-A-0040)
MANHATTAN IS A SMALL TOWN OF ONLY ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S SMALL  (fe_03_01455-A-0041)
BUT NOT QUITE AS DRASTIC OF A CHANGE AS YOU'VE MADE SO  (fe_03_01455-A-0042)
UM  (fe_03_01455-A-0043)
REALLY LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_01455-A-0044)
[SIGH] YOU KNOW POSSIBLY A CHANGE THAT OCCURRED IN ME WAS YOU KNOW REALIZING THAT THESE THINGS COULD HAPPEN ON OUR SOIL  (fe_03_01455-A-0045)
OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN SELVES I MEAN WE HAD THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING BUT THAT WAS FROM WITHIN [NOISE]  (fe_03_01455-A-0046)
AND UM  (fe_03_01455-A-0047)
I THINK IT WAS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPED BREAK THE I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE ARROGANCE THAT MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE HAD THINKING THAT WE'RE INVINCIBLE  (fe_03_01455-A-0048)
AND  (fe_03_01455-A-0049)
I THINK IT HELPED BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE TOGETHER AS A SENSE OF A COMMUNITY THE WHOLE NATION  (fe_03_01455-A-0050)
AND REALIZING THAT WE HAVE TO  (fe_03_01455-A-0051)
REALLY SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_01455-A-0052)
AND YOU KNOW REACH OUT OF OUR OWN SELVES AND NOT BE YOU KNOW CLOSED OFF TO EVERYONE BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND I THINK YOU PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN TOWN  (fe_03_01455-A-0053)
BECAUSE OF THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY THERE THERE'S A STRONGER UNITY AND  (fe_03_01455-A-0054)
