HI  (fe_03_01495-A-0001)
MY NAME IS EMILY  (fe_03_01495-A-0002)
I'M IN UH PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_01495-A-0003)
VERY NICE  (fe_03_01495-A-0005)
UM I UNDERSTAND THAT [LAUGHTER] WE HAD UH PLANS TO TRAVEL  (fe_03_01495-A-0007)
TO ITALY WHERE MY HUSBAND IS FROM IN  (fe_03_01495-A-0008)
MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND ONE AND WE ACTUALLY DID GO BECAUSE UH WE WENT BUT I WAS VERY PARANOID [LAUGHTER] BUT I FELT SAFER ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON I I DON'T KNOW WHY  (fe_03_01495-A-0009)
I'D SAY THE MAIN THING THAT WE CHANGED WAS THE AWARENESS AND OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT LIKE THINGS THAT MATTERED BEFORE  (fe_03_01495-A-0010)
DON'T MATTER ANYMORE WHAT WE FIND  (fe_03_01495-A-0011)
WE WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN OUR CHURCH BUT WE WENT TO CHURCH A LOT THE NEXT TWO WEEKS BECAUSE WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT ELSE TO DO  (fe_03_01495-A-0012)
[LIPSMACK] AND WE ACTUALLY CALLED  (fe_03_01495-A-0013)
TO GIVE BLOOD AND JUST COULDN'T FIND  (fe_03_01495-A-0014)
HOW TO GET THERE AND DO IT BECAUSE THEY YOU HAD TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND EVERYTHING IT WAS AMAZING  (fe_03_01495-A-0015)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01495-A-0016)
MHM  (fe_03_01495-A-0017)
DEFINITELY FOR US IT WAS  (fe_03_01495-A-0018)
AND I HAVE A FIVE FIVE YEAR OLD SOON TO BE SIX YEAR OLD WHO AT THE TIME WAS FOUR  (fe_03_01495-A-0019)
AND WE HAD THE T._V. ON CONSTANTLY FOR THE FIRST FOUR DAYS AND HE HADN'T BEEN ASKING ANYTHING WE HADN'T BEEN TELLING HIM ANYTHING  (fe_03_01495-A-0020)
AND I GUESS THE ONE THING WE DID TELL HIM WAS THAT  (fe_03_01495-A-0021)
UH THERE WAS A REALLY BAD ACCIDENT AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE GOING TO CHURCH  (fe_03_01495-A-0022)
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED BUT WE DIDN'T GIVE HIM DETAILS  (fe_03_01495-A-0023)
AND BY THE FOURTH DAY HE STARTED HE WAS A MESS HE HE JUST  (fe_03_01495-A-0024)
EVERYTHING UPSET HIM AND I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT WATCHING THE TELEVISION HE'S ABSORBING IT AND WE TURNED IT OFF FROM THEN ON AND AND REALLY HAD TOO MUCH  (fe_03_01495-A-0025)
TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE AND UM  (fe_03_01495-A-0026)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK IT IT ROBBED ME OF THE SECURITY FOR MY CHILD WHICH I REALLY  (fe_03_01495-A-0027)
ENJOYED HAVING THAT SECURITY  (fe_03_01495-A-0028)
YES  (fe_03_01495-A-0029)
YES  (fe_03_01495-A-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01495-A-0031)
BUT EVEN FOR A TEENAGER I THINK IT WOULD BE EVEN SCARIER BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE  (fe_03_01495-A-0032)
SO THAT'S GOOD  (fe_03_01495-A-0033)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01495-A-0034)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01495-A-0036)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_01495-A-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_01495-A-0042)
WE ACTUALLY HAD UM  (fe_03_01495-A-0043)
BECAUSE WE LIVE WITHIN A CERTAIN WITHIN TEN MILES OF A OF A NUCLEAR PLANT  (fe_03_01495-A-0044)
THAT WAS VERY SCARY  (fe_03_01495-A-0045)
THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T UH IT WAS SCARY AFTER IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF PLANES CIRCLING THE POWER PLANT AND OF COURSE THE FIR- [MN] NOW WHEN I SEE A PLANE IN THE SKY THAT'S THE MOST THING  (fe_03_01495-A-0046)
PROBABLY IT SCARES ME IT NEVER USED TO SCARE ME BEFORE AND NOW I SEE A PLANE AND I THINK WHY IS IT THERE  (fe_03_01495-A-0047)
AND IT LOOKS AWFUL LOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01495-A-0048)
BUT WE HAD UM FIGHTER JETS AROUND THE PLANT  (fe_03_01495-A-0049)
FOR [LIPSMACK] I THINK THE FIRST WEEK IF NOT A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND THAT WAS VERY SCARY  (fe_03_01495-A-0050)
MHM  (fe_03_01495-A-0051)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01495-A-0054)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01495-A-0055)
I THINK ONE THING THAT UPSET ME A LOT  (fe_03_01495-A-0057)
WAS THE COMMUNITY THAT THE WHOLE NATION WAS ON SEPTEMBER TWELFTH WENT AWAY REALLY QUICKLY  (fe_03_01495-A-0058)
AND I JUST KEEP PRAYING THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW I FELT ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_01495-A-0059)
BECAUSE  (fe_03_01495-A-0060)
I'M A FRIENDLY PERSON BUT IT SEEMS OUT IN PUBLIC YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T  (fe_03_01495-A-0061)
AND THAT FIRST TWO WEEKS YOU KNOW WE WERE ALL SAYING HI TO EVERYBODY AND HOW ARE YOU AND MEANT IT AND THAT I THINK BY CHRISTMAS WAS GONE AND THAT WAS REALLY SAD  (fe_03_01495-A-0062)
I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TRAGEDY LIKE THAT TO HAVE PEOPLE ACT THAT WAY BUT I THINK IT SHOULD'VE BEEN THAT WAY ANYWAY  (fe_03_01495-A-0063)
WELL THAT'S GREAT  (fe_03_01495-A-0064)
IT REALLY DID IT REALLY DID I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT WAS IMPORTANT BUT UM  (fe_03_01495-A-0065)
I I HAD IT HALF WRONG I WOULD SAY AND NOW  (fe_03_01495-A-0066)
IT THE ONLY THING THAT IS IMPORTANT WHAT I MAKE MY PRIORITY IS HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE FAMILY AND IS THIS GOOD FOR THE FAMILY  (fe_03_01495-A-0067)
AND  (fe_03_01495-A-0068)
IT VERY MUCH MAKES ME WONDER THAT  (fe_03_01495-A-0069)

AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT CAME UP A LOT AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WITH MORE SECURITY IN CERTAIN PLACES AND HOW PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT INFRINGES ON OUR RIGHTS AND I JUST DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY I FEEL SAFE KNOWING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SECURITY CHECKS AND  (fe_03_01495-A-0073)
I- IF YOU'RE NOT [SIGH] I I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE FREEDOM AND EVERYTHING YOU WANT I- I- IT'S IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE IT ALL  (fe_03_01495-A-0074)
AND WE N- IF WE NEED I DON'T CONSIDER IT GIVING UP MY RIGHTS YOU KNOW I I REALLY DON'T WE WENT TO THE CIRCUS LAST NIGHT AND HAD METAL DETECTORS AND I WAS THANKFUL AND  (fe_03_01495-A-0075)
