I REALLY FEAR FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THIS AS THEY GET OLDER  (fe_03_01464-B-0032)
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE EMBEDDED IN THEIR MINDS WHETHER YOU KNOW THEY THEY OUTWARDLY TALK ABOUT IT OR NOT AND IT IT IS JUST SUCH A FRIGHTENING THING FOR A CHILD IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR ADULTS TO DEAL WITH IT BUT I JUST  (fe_03_01464-B-0033)

THAT IS JUST NOT GOOD BUT I THINK EVERYBODY HAS TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO FEEL THAT LEVEL OF COMFORT THAT WE HAD BEFORE NINE ONE ONE  (fe_03_01464-B-0046)
'CAUSE GOD KNOWS THAT THIS WORLD IS NOT THE SAME SINCE THEN  (fe_03_01464-B-0047)
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S THAT'S THE THING YOU YOU DON'T KNOW AND THE ONLY THING WE HAVE IS THIS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF US AND REALLY RELATIVELY FEW OF THEM  (fe_03_01464-B-0048)
AND WE ARE A VERY STRONG NATION AND OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE AND ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE AND PRAY FOR THE BEST  (fe_03_01464-B-0049)
I KNOW UH LIKE I BROUGHT UP WITH SOME OF MY OTHER CALLERS THAT I WOULD HEAR WE LIVE OUT IN A A RURAL FARMING COMMUNITY BUT WE'RE WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MILES OF A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT  (fe_03_01464-B-0050)
AND THEY HAVE BEEFED UP SECURITY THERE AND THEY'VE STOPPED THE TOURS AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE PERIMETER OF IT  (fe_03_01464-B-0051)
AND I SAID AND THEN I NOTICED IN A IN OUR LOCAL UM NEWSPAPER THAT UM THE F._D._A. IS ASKING FARMERS TO BE VIGILANT ON THEIR FARMS FOR ANY POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES  (fe_03_01464-B-0052)
NOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT LIKE SOMEONE IS GOING TO COME AND APPROACH A THREE HUNDRED ACRE WHERE  (fe_03_01464-B-0053)
THE FARMERS OUT IN HIS FIELD SOMEWHERE OR IN THE BARN AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS IN TOWN  (fe_03_01464-B-0054)

BUT WE CAN'T THINK OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT'LL JUST DRIVE YOU INSANE AND NUTS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU  (fe_03_01464-B-0056)
