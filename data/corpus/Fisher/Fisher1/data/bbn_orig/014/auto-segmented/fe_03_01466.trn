WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO US FIRST LIKE I MEAN LIKE I MEAN I'M NOT I'M NOT AGAINST THE WAR AT ALL AND I MEAN I I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT OR ANYTHING BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_01466-A-0039)

YEAH OF THE TERRORISTS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF LIKE I MEAN  (fe_03_01466-A-0041)
I THINK LIKE MOST AMERICANS ARE AGAINST THE WAR ARE OVERLOOKING IS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY DIDN'T GO IN AND UH AND TAKE CARE OF SADDAM AND ALL THAT  (fe_03_01466-A-0042)
AND LIKE I MEAN SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I THINK PLAYED A BIGGER PART THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE LOOK AT AS FAR AS THE WAR GOES AND STUFF BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_01466-A-0043)
WELL I I THINK I THINK IT'S A POINT IN WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE OVERLOOK I THINK IT WAS  (fe_03_01466-A-0044)
I MEAN WITH THE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THAT I THINK THAT WAS A BIG POINT FOR THEM IN THAT WE DON'T LOOK ABOUT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED LIKE TWO YEARS AGO  (fe_03_01466-A-0045)
AND SO I MEAN IF WE LOOK AT THAT AND JUST SAY HEY I MEAN THIS WILL PROBABLY SETTLE IT DOWN OR STOP IT I MEAN I I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING  (fe_03_01466-A-0046)
BUT I'M NOT TOO I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WAR AND WHAT WHAT WHAT THE REASONS ARE AND WHAT NOT BUT  (fe_03_01466-A-0047)
I I'VE I'VE I'VE READ SOME AND FIND OUT IT LOOKS LIKE WELL MORE LATELY IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE THE STORIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THERE AND HOW MANY OF THE SOLDIERS HAVE DIED AND THEIR STORIES OF THE SOLDIERS WHO DIED  (fe_03_01466-A-0048)
I MEAN AS FAR AS WE AS FAR AS LIKE I THINK THE PUBLIC KNOWS AND EVERYONE KNOWS  (fe_03_01466-A-0049)
THE POLITICAL VIEWS I DON'T THINK WE KNOW EVEN HALF OF IT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MORE THAN THE REASON JUST TO GO OVER AND GET SADDAM I THINK THERE'S MORE THAN THAT THAT WE JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT  (fe_03_01466-A-0050)
YEAH YEAH THE THE LIKE I I I'D THINK LIKE I MEAN THEY MIGHT HAVE LIKE  (fe_03_01466-A-0051)

AND SO IT'S KINDA SAD WHEN THEY COME HOME TO A COUNTRY THAT'S HALF OF THE PEOPLE ARE UNAPPRECIATIVE OF  (fe_03_01466-A-0062)
FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING OVER THERE EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT BE IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF THE WAR  (fe_03_01466-A-0063)
I I DO I MEAN THEY THEY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GO OVER THERE AND JUST KILL PEOPLE AND JUST JUST LOOKING FOR ONE MAN TO STOP SOMETHING I KNOW  (fe_03_01466-A-0064)
THERE HAS TO BE A REASON THEY KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR SOLDIERS WOULD BE KILLED AND THEY THEY KNOW THE RISKS THEY'RE TAKING OF DOING THIS AND SO I MEAN IF IT'S WORTH DOING FOR THEM AND THROWING ALL THIS MONEY INTO IT THERE MUST BE A A REALLY GOOD REASON  (fe_03_01466-A-0065)
'CAUSE I MEAN LIKE THEY SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON THESE BOMBS AND EVERYTHING AND ALL THE TROOPS TO FEED ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF WHEN THEY COULD BE  (fe_03_01466-A-0066)
I MEAN GETTING EVERYONE OUT OF POVERTY IN THE U._S. AND WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT I MEAN THERE MUST BE MORE THAN JUST THE REASON TO GET SADDAM THAN  (fe_03_01466-A-0067)
