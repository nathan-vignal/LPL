R:  Hi, I'm Ashleigh.
L:  Hi, Ashleigh.  My name is Antonio.  How you doing?
R:  Hi, Antonio.  I'm fine, thanks.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Um --
R:  Good.
L:  -- this is totally random.  Ah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I don't even know how to do this, really, so I'm gonna follow your lead.  Have you done this?
L:  No, I haven't actually done it.  Um --
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I -- I jus- where am I -- where are you, ah, calling from?
R:  I'm in Santa Monica, California.  Where are you?
L:  Oh.  Okay.  I'm in New York.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  How funny.  Yeah.
R:  Look at that.  Perfect.
L:  I'm actually right in, um, right in downtown Manhattan, so --
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Very good.
L:  Yeah, and you're in a beautiful area, too, so --
R:  I am.  I'm right by the beach.  I'm --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- about two blocks from the beach right now, so yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Um, so I guess we're supposed to be talking about colds, and I -- I only got the first question, um, because I had it on speaker phone and I wasn't really listening, and when then I picked it up, so first question, I guess, was um, do we get sick when the seasons change?
L:  Right.  Um --
R:  Okay.  Do you remember the rest of the questions?
L:  And something about what do you do to keep yourself, um, getting sick when the seasons change.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then there was some sort of phrase like, uh, you know, like a stitch in time, one of those things.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  And it was something about, you know, give it a week, uh, I can't remember it, but um, there was some adage, um.  That's all I really got --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- from that, so.  [LAUGH].  It sounds like a robot.
R:  All right.
L:  So --
R:  So we'll play it by ear?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  So, let's see.  So, do you, um, do you typically get sick when the seasons change?
L:  Yeah, I do.  Um, especially in, um -- especially like when it gets wet in the fall and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I get sick.  This -- and the springtime I get sick because of allergies, so um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But other than that, I'm pretty good.  Well, that's pretty much two seasons out of four so [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I -- I am the same way.  I get sick in the spring and the fall when the seasons change and that's primarily because I'm allergic to trees.
L:  Oh, that would be a problem in California?  [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, so, um, whenever the -- whenever the trees change, whenever the new leaves start or the old leaves fall off, I get sick.  And um -- but it's primarily allergies --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that I get sick with, but even so, I take zinc to try and shorten the duration of it.
L:  Oh, cool.  Does that actually work?
R:  Yeah.  Actually, it -- it cuts, uh, the duration of your illness in half.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
R:  And, um, my boyfriend just was suffering a cold this past week and he took zinc and he's much better now, so --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  So I know that works.  What about you?  What do you take when you start to feel sick?
L:  Um, I um -- well, I take Claritin when my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- allergies start kicking in which really helps.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, except -- I don't know if you've ever taken Claritin, but it like, really dries you out.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Um, so um, I do that.  And, um --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- in the -- in the wintertime I try to exercise as much as possible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because I just notice that when I exercise I, like, non drowsy, like you feel much better, but it just prevents me from getting sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [COUGH] and because I live in New York, like, you can pretty much catch anything from anything, so um, I tend to -- you know, I know this is probably not effective, but I tend to, you know, take the subway, wash my hands --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- you know, go back on the subway, go home, wash my hands.  You know, all that stuff, so --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I think half the time that -- that I get sick is -- is either because, um, I -- I travel a lot for work, um, so being on an airplane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, and then taking the train.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, so it's -- and then, you know, just generally I'll just, like, pop a few pills or something, especially Aspirin.
R:  Right.
L:  If I get sick, but that's generally the extent of it.  I mean, something like a cold is just -- having a cold is just annoying, but you can generally get through it.
R:  Right.
L:  The allergies can get a little bit worse, especially if you can't sleep, so --
R:  Yes.  And I have, um, developed sinusitis from not taking care of my allergies --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- in time, for just letting them go and sinusitis is extremely, extremely painful, so I can --
L:  What -- I don't even know what it is.
R:  It's when your sinuses get inflamed and it can localize -- the pain can localize in any part of your head and I've had it localized in my jaw before.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it just feels like you want to take a hammer and, you know, knock off the -- your bottom jaw, it's so --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  It's so painful, so in order to avoid that, I've taken Claritin before and I've taken Flonase[?] I believe, and Wynocourt[?].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And, um, and then of course, I take extra strength Tylenol.  I -- I'm just trying to give them whatever information they need as far as medicine.
L:  Sure.  Right.
R:  Kinda weird not to have a moderator on here.
L:  Right.  No, yeah.  It's totally random, right, so --
R:  Yeah, this is bizarre, but okay.  Um, so yeah.  And now I don't remember the saying that they were asking about.  Were they asking about an -- an apple a day keeps the doctor away, or what -- what kind of saying --
L:  Yes, it was -- no, it wasn't that 'cause I'd definitely remember that one.  Something like that, but you know, whatever, we can't remember it, so we can't remember it.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  Do you ever -- do you ever actually do any, like, sort of steaming, like a sauna, because I notice that helps me, too?
R:  I would love to, but I don't have access to a sauna.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I haven't really done that.  Um, I just, ah, I pretty much stay indoors when the seasons change.  I don't get sick very often.  I mean, oth- other than my allergies in the spring and the fall, I -- I don't get colds very often.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So I've been lucky that way, and um, one of the -- oh, here's, um, a trick that I learned, that actually --
L:  Okay.  Good.
R:  -- you might want to try because this is -- it's fantastic.  I learned -- it's kinda of an old Greek folk remedy.  Um, when you have a sore throat, it's pretty hideous, but garlic with vinegar -- I mean, gargle with vinegar, and uh --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- you won't have a sore throat in the morning if you do that before you go to bed.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  And it -- it's pretty miserable while you doing it --
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  -- but it works and it has worked for years for me.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I um --
L:  I've always heard about salt water, like it says to gargle with salt water, but never vinegar.
R:  Right.  Well, I've done salt water, but that -- I -- I don't know if that really works.  I've -- I've tried it and I've never had it work, but I've woken up in the morning after having a really severe sore throat and I've woken up with no sore throat after gargling with vinegar.
L:  Okay.  Cool.
R:  So -- so that's a little trick I know.
L:  All right.  I'll try that.  I have, like, you know, I can't think of any little tricks for you.  Um -- 
R:  Ah, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.  No -- no home remedies or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've of- I've often heard that washing your feet helps too, every day.  I don't know.
R:  Washing your feet?
L:  Like -- like, tak- taking your feet and dipping them in cold water and --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, jus- just washing your feet.  Don't, like --
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  -- quote me on that, but that -- that's an old wives' tale.  So --
R:  It keeps you from getting colds, or what?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't know why.  It doesn't actually make sense, but you know --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- it's actually kind of contradictory, but you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's what I've heard.  So.
R:  That's very interesting.  Okay.
L:  So, um, yeah.  So [LAUGH].
R:  Keep that in mind.  Um, I don't know what else we're supposed to do and I don't know how long we've been on the phone.
L:  Yeah.  I think we've been on the phone for, like, seven minutes.  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I think we've kind of ex- like, kinda hit everything that I can possibly talk about.  [LAUGH].  I'm so --
R:  I know.  I'm trying to think of anything else about illness.  Illness?  Well, illness is really not confined to just colds and everything.  I suppose, um, and major illnesses, but I don't have any or luckily haven't had any yet.  Um --
L:  Are you -- you -- are you in your twenties?  You sound like you're fairly young?
R:  I'm thirty one, actually.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, I'm twenty nine, so --
R:  Oh, you are?  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So you're very lucky to have not -- yeah, I -- I've been, like, knocking --
R:  Thanks.
L:  -- wood, like very healthy, so --
R:  Yeah.  Um, well that is good.  I -- I've recently just been checked for everything because I've been suffering from excessive tiredness.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I just -- yeah.  I cannot get enough sleep.  No matter what I do.  So I have been going to the doctor time and time and time again to have all these tests done, um --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- because they figured it must be something, must be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some sort of illness, but I just finished the last test last week, which was a CAT scan of my entire torso --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and because they were worried I might have cancer, and I --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- I -- I don't, so um --
L:  Have they checked you for a Lime disease?
R:  Lime disease?
L:  Have you heard of that?  It --
R:  Um, yeah, I've heard of it.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I don't know if they checked me for it.  They did a billion tests, but um, would that be a blood test?
L:  Yeah.  What happened, I -- well, actually, I have Lime disease and um --
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I -- I grew up on Long Island.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I'm not sure if you're familiar with it, but it's huge tick, um, area and uh, I got bit by a tick, I didn't even realize it and about, like, maybe a month or so after I -- they think I got bit --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I started just -- I was just wiped.  I -- like, every day I'd wake up and I'd get out of bed and I'd take a shower and at the end of the shower, I was just, like, exhausted, and uh --
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And so, I mean, it was really, really bad, to the point where I was calling in sick to work and if I was at work, I'd just be, like, miserable and everything was aching me.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Um, so I went to my doctor and he -- actually went three or four times, then I went to a specialist.  Um --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and it turns out that, you know, he said, well, you know -- he was actually pretty good.  He said, "Well, where have you -- where have you been over the summer?" 
R:  [NOISE].
L:  And I said Long Island, and he said, "Let me check you for Lime disease, just in case", and sure enough --
R:  [NOISE].  Mhm?
L:  -- they did a specific test for Lime disease and that's what I had.
R:  [NOISE].  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And so I've been on -- um, I've been on medicine for the past, like, three years.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Like, just like an antibacterial medicine.  Uh, but --
R:  Right?
L:  -- you know, once you catch it, you're good.  It's just a matter of if you let it progress too much, it -- it really affects you, so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So you may want to ask your doctor if he could take some of that blood that you've given him and see if he can send it for a, you know, a Lime disease test?
R:  That's a really good idea.  Thank you so much for telling me about it.  I'm sorry you've had to go through that.  That sounds miserable?
L:  It's -- it actually -- the -- the month I went through it was miserable, but once I started taking the medicine, it was fine.  
R:  Right.
L:  It was like getting a virus out of my system.
R:  Okay.  Oh, wow.  That's really interesting.  So, how -- and how long do you have to take the medicine?
L:  Um, I'm going to take it probably for another two years.
R:  Two years?
L:  Like, it's -- yeah.  It's the kinda thing that it, um, luckily, though, it's the same kind of stuff you would take if you had, like, skin problems.
R:  Mhm?
L:  So my skin looks great.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Um, it's a -- it's an antibacterial, um, but the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- problem is, it's like, who wants to be taking medicine for five years?  But it -- it keeps --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- it keeps the virus, um, or bacteria, I don't even know what it is, like, suppressed in my system, but once I go off the medicine, if I -- if I ever do, like it'll -- it'll rise back up.
R:  Mm.  I see.
L:  So um, you know.  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  So you may want to just get your -- I don't know if you --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- have ticks in California --
