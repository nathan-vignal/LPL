R:  Hi, I'm Anna.  How are you?
L:  Hello, I'm Nancy.
R:  Hi.  Uh, it --
L:  Oh, jus- just one minute?
R:  Okay. 
L:  So, um, yes.  We're supposed to be talking about health care?
R:  Yeah, about the seasons changing and um how it affects you and um -- um --
L:  And what you do about it.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Well, um, I myself and most of my -- my -- I have two kids and my husband, we all suffer from allergies, so --
L:  Right.  So do I.
R:  -- yeah.  So you can say definitely when the seasons change, you can definitely tell it.
L:  Yep, and um, and -- but I live in -- in the south, in -- in Tennessee and we have a lot of pollen and I just -- you know, when this kinda stuff comes round every year, I just have to take, um, allergy medicine [MN] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, if I don't, I mean, I'm just like suffering.  You know, I have to keep the air conditioning on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have to turn it on sooner than I want to, and I can't open the windows for fresh air, so um --
R:  Well, I'm in North Carolina and I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the same way.
L:  So you're right down the road from me?
R:  Yeah, I'm the same way.  It -- it's -- and so far, my daughter got it first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I didn't think she'd ever get rid of it.
L:  Oh, it's nasty.  It's -- it's just like green pollen --
R:  I know.
L:  -- that just hangs on.  I mean, it's everywhere.
R:  She -- and I don't take her to the doctor because if you take her to the doctor, they're going to tell you it's allergy related, you know, and once she's got real bad congestion from it, then I take her.
L:  [COUGH] right.
R:  I myself, I have asthma and when I -- I've got to watch what I take, and plus when I do take something, a lot of times it puts me to sleep.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't --
R:  So -- 
L:  -- operate as a -- a mother with two children when you're taking --
R:  No.  I --
L:  -- sleepy medicine.
R:  -- I can't even hardly take anything for mine any more because it puts me to sleep.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just have to suffer through it.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um --
L:  That's kinda hard to do, when you can't breathe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or when you -- shortness of breath --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then running after two kids?
R:  I just got over to -- my voice is still not back to normal, but I just got over the part where I felt like I was totally breathing through a straw.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I still got the lump in my throat that stays there, that won't go away.
L:  Right.
R:  And occasionally I do take an over the counter medication and I just suffer the consequences of -- end up having to take a nap and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  It's hard, though.
R:  -- sleep it off.
L:  It's hard.
R:  It is.  And --
L:  And, I mean, especially when the kids want your attention.
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  And it's like, okay --
R:  -- yeah, sometime a question about, um, do you believe about the, uh, if you suffered out -- a cold last shorter than if you go to the doctor.  I kinda caught part of there --
L:  Oh, yes.  I guess, uh, they want to know if is it better going to the doctor and getting medicine, or is it just kinda, you know, like in the old days, just tough it out and, you know, get by on your own remedy?
R:  I think on some of it, get by on your own remedy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because a lot of times you go to the doctor and you --
L:  It's artificial.
R:  You -- you run to the -- you run the risk of running into something else because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the doctor's office is so full of --
L:  Germs?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  My daughter used to get sick every time we went.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I'd take her in there for a simple check up, she'd come out with what everybody else had.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I had to switch to a --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's been proven.
R:  -- smaller office, so --
L:  Yeah, that's been proven more.  As a matter of fact, um, when I took my kids to the doctor, they used to have a -- a -- a well sick -- a well room and a sickness room.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And if you were just for a check up, you go to the well room, and if you were sick, you go to the sick room.
R:  And a lot of people don't -- they don't -- they don't pay that any mind anyway.
L:  No.  It's like they can't see or can't read.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the, um, colds and stuff, I feel like the season --
L:  I mean --
R:  This year's probably going to be one of the most difficult we've had.
L:  And some things they can't treat anyway, so why go and pay -- get a doctor bill or forty, fifty dollars, to -- for them to say, "Well, you know, we can't do anything for you.  You just have to kinda tough it out".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  They give you --
L:  -- I run a humidifier --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- every night.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that really helps a lot.
R:  I've got a air purifier in my house that --
L:  That helps a lot.
R:  -- that cuts out a lot.  Yeah, it helps me.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But --
L:  You know, it just -- you know, change the filters out and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, but it's, um, I think all that does -- I mean, a lot of times I think we can -- you know, do ourselves and keep the costs down.
R:  Yeah.  My husband says, "Don't you want to come outside?  Don't you want to go this?" one --
L:  Well, we'd love to, but we can't.
R:  And I'm like, "No, I -- I -- I really don't", you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They [inaudible] here.
L:  Yep.
R:  And -- but you know, you run the risk every time you walk out the door, you've got --
L:  Well, because you don't know what the -- uh, the pollen count's gonna be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if it's a heavy pollen count, you're going to pay for it later on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that evening.  Or the -- you know, the next day, whatever.
R:  I've suffered a lot right here lately.  I mean, I just -- usually from January right on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's only during the winter months that a lot of people find theirselves sick in the winter.
L:  Right.
R:  I might have, you know, a little minor cold, but a lot of times it starts in January -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just run off and on all through the summer.
L:  Right.
R:  All through spring especially is the worst time.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I think we share the same weather pat- pattern.
R:  Yeah, and it's just --
L:  'Cause I'm in -- I'm in Knoxville and uh, I mean, it's like -- I -- I mean, I'm like an hour away from Smokey, and we have major pollen.
R:  I've -- I've got even to the point where I just -- I -- mine is so sensitive when it gets aggravated by the weather conditions, if I go into a room where someone's smoking, I have to immediately leave 'cause I can't handle it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I can't breathe.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know, I don't -- I try to avoid all the -- the -- the restaurants that have smoking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or I mean, it -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just like when you come upon it, you -- yo- -- it just kinda hits you like a brick.
R:  This -- this weather, though --
L:  So --
R:  -- I'm afraid I've already seen the -- the downside of the rain and everything.  Yeah, it's washing the pollen down some, but it's bringing the mosquitos and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everything else.
L:  And that's another issue you have to fight?
R:  Yep.
L:  You had to worry about it.
R:  Yeah, because there's so many viruses and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff that -- that can be related to them, that we have to deal with.
L:  Right.
R:  And they're especially bad around here.  I mean, they will attack you in a heart beat.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I joke with people and tell them that you either walk out my door and you fall in the mud hole if the mosquitos don't pick you up and carry you off first.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  You got the choice
L:  Mhm.
R:  The mosquitos are gonna air lift you, or you're gonna fall in the mud hole.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And the majority of the mud holes round here, I've never seen the ground be so moldy in areas.
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  And --
L:  I noticed that, yeah.  It's the same way here.
R:  And -- and right out here, outside of my house, the -- round my front door, it's -- it's horrible.  I mean, and the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- smell is horrible.  It's from all the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- rain and stuff that -- that's soaked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- into the ground and it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's terrible and I'm trying to stay out of it as much as possible.
L:  Well, yeah.  You don't want to get in that mess.  I told my husband, we have a little spot in the yard here that he needs to -- it -- it's like a -- just a -- a -- a -- a area where grass is not growing, it's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- moist, just standing water.  I said, "You need to fill it up with wa- um, with some -- some soil, lay it with rock, and then cover with soil and you know, maybe a couple layers of rock and then cover it up with some more soil and then plant your grass seed",  I said, because it has no base.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I said -- 
R:  My husband's out there mowing grass now and I know better than to step out, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I just --
R:  -- even with the allergies that I have, I have been known to get out and mow grass before we moved here --
L:  Oh, don't want to do that.
R:  -- I was the one who frequently -- I frequently mowed grass and I did it because my mother -- it was when I lived with my mother, she was worse off than I was.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I could get out and bear with it and it wouldn't bother me as bad.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I could mow and -- and weed eat, and you know, I'd give myself out and I'd suffer the next day, but you know, it -- it was something I knew I had to do.
L:  Right.
R:  But I try to limit it.
L:  I stay away from that.  I -- I don't do that at all.  I tell my husband, I said, "You do it.  I'm not going out there". 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, it's not worth my health.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and --
L:  And maybe I have enough to do in the house. 
R:  The thing of it is, when you got small children, my daughter's two --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- and they can't tell you everything.
L:  No.
R:  She -- she can feel when something's going on and she'll come to me and she'll say, "Mummy, I getting sick.  I need medicine".
L:  Mm.  Ooh.
R:  And you don't know whether, "Are you really?"  Or are you just used to that flavor of medication?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because you --
L:  Yes.
R:  You gotta find something that they'll take --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that'll help their condition and [SIGH] I'm going to tell you, the people who make medicines, they've got it made because there is not one medication out there that is for every symptom you have.  There's always some symptom that you don't have that's in this -- or that you have that's not -- that's in this other bottle.
L:  Right.
R:  And you can't take two of them, you gotta pick the one that best suits you.  But they combine -- they've got a way of combining something out them in the medication that -- that I don't know that it's keeping you sick or -- but it's not covering all your conditions.
L:  No.  It's not like one medicine that covers everything.
R:  And it -- you may be coughing and sneezing --
