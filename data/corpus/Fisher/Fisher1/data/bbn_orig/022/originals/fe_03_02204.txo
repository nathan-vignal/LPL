R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Anita.
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hi, Jennifer.  Um, so where do you prefer to eat?
R:  Um, well, anywhere that has good food.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I prefer eating out, myself.  I hate to cook.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  I actually work in a restaurant, so eating out for me is, ah, what I usually do.
L:  Okay, so I -- I don't know what we're -- excuse me for a second.  Go away.
R:  I know, I don't either.  This is the first time that this has happened to me.
L:  Yeah, this is my first survey, too.  And um, ah --
R:  So, are we just supposed to talk for ten minutes about eating out?
L:  Yeah, and -- what did she say, um, we're supposed to say what our perfect meal would be.
R:  Oh, okay.  There you go, it's --
L:  I think that's what -- I think that's what it said.
R:  All right.  Do you know what yours is?
L:  Prime rib. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I think mine would be, um, Ahi[?] tuna.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  My, ah, the ch- -- the chef where I work does a raspberry teriyaki sauce.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then he cuts the Ahi into like, eight to twelve ounce pieces, so it's really thick, like one or two inches thick.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then he just sears each side, he rolls it in sesame seeds, and then drizzles it with that sauce.
L:  Oh, sounds good.  [LAUGH].
R:  It's pretty good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you like your prime rib?
L:  Um, medium well, but I -- I don't get to go to those type restaurants too often, so it's a big treat for me.  Usually, when we go out, it's to McDonalds, or something like that and like, I really can't take that much of that any more.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, something nice and quick.
L:  Yeah.  But, um, we also have to consider -- we have two small kids --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and [NOISE] they're not gonna eat the stuff that's in a nicer restaurant.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, so, um -- but occasionally we do get to go out, and I apologize, I'm getting laryngitis, so if it's hard for you to hear me, that's why.
R:  Oh, no that's okay.  I can understand you fine.
L:  Okay, good.
R:  Well, what -- how old are your kids?
L:  Ah, six and a half.  Well my son will be seven in a couple of weeks, and my daughter's five.
R:  And what do they like to eat?
L:  McDonalds.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my daughter is a big McDonalds fan, um, my son is more Taco Belle.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, he loves Taco Belle.
R:  Well, that's pretty good for a younger kid, right?
L:  Well, considering it -- I wouldn't call it real Mexican food.  You know what I mean?
R:  Well, yeah, but it's still better than, you know, McDonalds or Burger King.  Something different.
L:  Yeah, it is different.  But my daughter won't eat it.
R:  Okay.
L:  So if -- if we went to -- well, if my husband went to Taco Belle to get something for him and my son, he'll go to McDonalds for me and my daughter.
R:  Okay.  How often do you get to eat out then?
L:  Um, well, we eat out every weekend, 'cause, um, I'm a stay at home mom.
R:  Okay.
L:  But -- but my reasoning is people that go out to jobs, their weekend starts at five o'clock on Fridays, so mine does too.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  And my husband doesn't -- my husband doesn't get home 'til six thirty, so five o'clock, I stop everything.  Which means we eat out Friday night, Saturday, S- Sunday night.  And then -- and then I go back to cooking on Monday, but then, um, with little league and, um, CCD classes -- it all falls in -- around dinner time, so we wind out running out real quick and grabbing something.  So, I'm down to cooking, I think, maybe once or twice a week now.
R:  Okay.
L:  [several inaudible words] and how about you?
R:  Um, well, being in the restaurant, I usually eat out every night. I actually never have a meal in my house.
L:  Oh, you're lu- [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I have a refrigerator, but there's nothing of mine in it.  My room mate has food in it, but not me.
L:  You know, um --
R:  And I usually eat, like, just in the mornings at a breakfast bar, on the way to the gym, before I go to work and then I have lunch at the restaurant, and usually dinner as well, if I don't go out somewhere else.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, I -- I would enjoy that, you know.  Um, I -- I have no idea where you live, like, um, I wanna ask you what restaurant you work at, but it --
R:  It's called the Caboose Grill.
L:  The Caboose Grill?
R:  Yeah, it's up in Souderton.
L:  Oh, okay and you're here in Pennsylva- -- 
R:  What area are y- -- 
L:  You're in Pennsylvania?
R:  Yes.
L:  So am I.  I'm i- -- I'm in Montgomery county.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's where I am.
L:  Are you?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I -- well Souderton is Montgomery county, like.  I live in Perkasie.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's right down from the Montgomery mole.
L:  Okay.  I -- I'm out in [inaudible].
R:  Where is it?
L:  Um, in Sanatoga.  It's between Pottstown and Limerick[?].
R:  Ok, okay, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I grew up over in Harleysville, which is on the other side of Skippack.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah.  And actually kids eat --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- free, week nights there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays, yeah.
L:  I'll check it out.
R:  So, like chicken fingers and grilled cheese and burgers.
L:  Now, have you ever heard of Georgine's?
R:  Yes, I love Georgine's.
L:  Oh, I love them too.  That's were I had my --
R:  I --
L:  -- wedding reception.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  They give you so much food.  I used to live in Newtown[?] --
L:  And for the price too.  The -- the -- I mean, did you ever have their, um, ah, veal parmesan?
R:  Yeah.  I think I've had everything that they have.
L:  They [inaudible] over the plate and it's like --
R:  It's huge, yeah.
L:  -- like nine ninety five, oh, my God.
R:  Everything.  I don't know how they do it.  Every time I'm there I wonder, because they give you so much food.  I --
L:  Ow.
R:  -- and you can't possibly eat it all.  And it's so cheap.
L:  Well, did you -- did you know if you, um, got an order to go, they give you the whole thing as well.  You still get all the --
R:  Oh, do they really?
L:  -- bread and the cheeses and the salad.  Oh, yeah, they give you everything.
R:  Wow.
L:  You walk out of there with two grocery bags full of stuff and it's just one meal.
R:  Wow.  And they do huge take out.  Didn't they build a whole 'nother place, just for take out?
L:  They have -- they have a Georgine Junior's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that one's sort of like a fast food style, um, but I couldn't get a half a chicken for a dollar fifty.  You know and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and comes with, ah, stuffing and two vegetables.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know.  Oh, I love Georgine's.  Oh, my God. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's a ton.
L:  And their French onion soup is to die for. [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  I haven't been there in a long time.  You're making me wanna go there.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, ah, we usually go there for our anniversary, which just passed, and we didn't make it this time --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- but, um, oh, I love Georgine's.  And that's where I usually get the prime rib at.  But, um, but yeah, we had our wedding reception there, and, um, they gave you so much food and it was -- it was very reasonable, I mean, their prices are reasonable to begin with, but for a reception as well --
R:  Well that place is so huge, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do they -- do they take reservations or no?
L:  They take reservations, um, during the week, except for on Saturdays.
R:  Okay.  That's probably usually when I'm there.  Huh.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  I used to always used to wait forever at the bar.
L:  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  And I'm always -- I always go starving 'cause I know how much food they're gonna give you.
L:  [LAUGH] No, um, I believe they're closed on Mondays and they take reservations all week long.  Saturday is first come, first served, and then Sunday, um, they have reservations as well.
R:  Ah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I'm gonna have to call my old room mate and tell her we should go.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I have to get back out there again too, 'cause it's about a forty five minute hike for me, you know, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or maybe a little bit longer, now, 'cause I'm not that close to ninety five.
R:  Huh.  Yeah, how did you -- how did -- how did you hear of this survey thing?
L:  Um, I'm part of a freebie group, and one of the girls in the group, she does it, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she, um, she actually won the, ah, the sweepstakes thing.
R:  Did she really?
L:  Yeah, and she had posted to the group that she had won, and she said if anyone was interested in doing surveys --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- here's my referral number, can you please put me down as referring you.  So I figured okay, well she could get the dollar from me, so I went and did it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Yeah, seems pretty neat, I mean, like I -- you know, the whole idea of it --
L:  Yeah, um, some --
R:  -- with the -- the subject.  I mean, do they -- like what do they -- is it -- they -- they're testing our voices.  Is that what they do?
L:  I have no idea, maybe they are looking to see what kind of foods we like.
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  I -- I really don't know.
R:  I wonder if it's like, marketing research, or --
L:  It's possible.  But -- but, um --
R:  What other kind of food, other than prime ribs, do you like?
L:  Um, well, I like Italian food.  But I don't get to eat that too often, um, 'cause my son has this life threatening egg allergy, and most of the pastas are like, home made pastas are made with egg.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So, we're stuck with boxed stuff.
R:  Yeah, we have some customers that come in, and their children are allergic as well.
L:  Yeah, so I mean, like --
R:  And it doesn't seem like they can barely eat anything.
L:  It -- it's really hard and that's another reason why, like, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when we go to Georgine's, I can't bring my kids.  Well, one, they wouldn't eat the stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, two, um, the only thing that they would have for little ones would be like the chicken fingers --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and [several inaudible words] that's dipped in egg, before they, ah, bread it.
R:  Right.
L:  And so he wouldn't be able to have that.
R:  Huh.
L:  You know, and it's just -- it's really tough, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- and I -- I feel bad for him because he wants to have different things and he can't have it, because there's eggs in it.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, but --
R:  Now, is that hereditary, do they say?
L:  No, and, um, it --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and, um, and it seems to be getting worse, too.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Really?  How old is he now?
