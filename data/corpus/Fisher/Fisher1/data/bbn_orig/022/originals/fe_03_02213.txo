L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Yes?
R:  My name is Angie.
L:  Oh, hello, this is Nadia.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine too.
R:  Good. [LAUGH].
L:  So, is this your first time with the phone?
R:  Yes, it is.  How about you?
L:  Oh, this is my second time.
R:  Oh, it is.  Okay. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]. Well, it does -- it doesn't mean I know much more than you do. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. Oh, right. [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I hope I know more about food [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. Right.  So, we're supposed to talk about if we like eating in a restaurant better or at home better?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what -- what do you prefer?
R:  Um.  I like cooking a lot, but I -- I like eating at a restaurant better.
L:  Okay.  I --
R:  A good restaurant, yeah.
L:  Okay.  What -- what kind of food do you like?  Wha- what's your favorite restaurant?
R:  Um.  I like almost -- well, I like lots of different things.  I think Thai restaurants are one of my favorites.  Um.
L:  Which restaurant did you say?
R:  Thai.  Thai food.
L:  Oh, Thai food.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  What about you?  What do you like?  [NOISE].
L:   Um.  I like pretty much everything, I think.  I  -- I do like cooking and, um, you know, restaurants.  I do -- I do enjoy, um, eating there, obviously.  You know, being a woman, you don't have to cook.  You just can go --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- relax, eat and that's that.  But sometimes it can get very pricey so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of times we just stay at home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So.  And I guess, Thai food, I -- I don't think I've eaten much of it.  Maybe a couple of times and that's about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Maybe, uh, depending on where you live.  I don't know where do you live in the country?
R:  Right.  Right now I live in Virginia, but I -- I used to live in, um, San Francisco and there's some really good Thai restaurants there.
L:  Well, I bet.  Yeah, Virginia or San Francisco, that's a --  I'm from in the Mid West so there's not, you know, that much Thai food available [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right. [LAUGH].
L:  -- right here [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So.  Well, that's good.
R:  Um.  So you like -- which do -- do you prefer eating at home or --
L:  Um. 
R:  If you had your choice?
L:  If I had my choice I'd probably go to a restaurant, but then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm kind of picky.  Like for example, I don't really go to restaurants, um, that serve food that I can cook.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think it's worth my money, you know.  Just go and eat spaghetti.
R:  Right.
L:  For seven bucks.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So I don't think, ah, it's worth it, but you know, if we're going to a nice restaurant where it's, um, good food that I -- I don't want or I can't cook at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then it's, you know, it's fine with me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I like, you know, like crab lobster or Olive Garden or something like that, so.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Things.  Like, Saturday we went to Lone Star Steakhouse so --
R:  Oh.
L:  That was good [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  
L:  So, I don't know if you've ever been to that restaurant, restaurant, so. [NOISE].
R:  I don't -- I've been to Olive Garden.  I don't think I've ever been to Lone Star --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Steakhouse.  What -- what's your favorite food?
L:  What's my favorite food? 
R:  Mhm?
L:  I don't even know if I have a favorite one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I do like seafood.  I like fish a lot [NOISE] because I'm -- you can probably catch my accent.  I am a foreigner so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I'm used to eating more -- much more fish than I can get here. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's -- 'cause it's so expensive here.  So that's, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, that's difficult.  But then, um, at the restaurant you can get pretty good choices a lot of times.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Do you have a favorite food or is it just Thai food in general?
R:  [LAUGH].  Um, I don't know.  I always have a hard time picking favorites too.  Um, I -- I don't know.  Recently I have been eating, um, not as much meat.  I've been, like, eating a lot more vegetables and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think I like -- my favorite vegetable right now is kale.  I don't know if you have ever had kale?
L:  I don't think I've ever had kale.  How does it look like?
R:  Yeah.  It's like a dark leafy green. [NOISE].  It's kinda like spinach except it's, um, it's a little bit -- it's bigger and like, leafier.
L:  Okay.
R:  I like to boil it and then I make, um, I saute garlic --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and put garlic and salt and lemon juice on it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And that's been my favorite vegetable [LAUGH] for the last few months but, um --
L:  Oh, that's interesting because it's -- it sounds like it's very unusual because if you're boiling it, it's -- but it's not spinach, so does it have some taste to it because spin- spinach doesn't really have a taste?
R:  Yeah.  No, it's much better than spinach.  It's -- it's a little bit bitter.  Um.  It's -- have you ever had collard greens?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's kind of like that.  It's like a strong, little bit bitter taste but, um, it's not too bitter.  It's when you put on, like, lemon juice and garlic, it's -- it's very tasty.  It's a really kind of thick, hearty green vegetable.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long do you have to cook it?
R:  I boil it for -- I like, boil water and then I put the kale in and I boil -- and I let it in for twelve minutes.  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, it doesn't boil 'cause when you put it in it kind of stops boiling for a little bit, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  I [NOISE] find that I do it for twelve minutes and [NOISE] and then I drain it and then I add the -- you know -- I saute the garlic separately and put on the garlic and the lemon juice and the salt and [NOISE] it is very tasty and kale is very cheap in the grocery store. [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  It's like sixty nine cents a pound or something like that.
L:  Mm.  I gotta check it out.  I'm not sure if it's available here or not.  Maybe it is in the larger store because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my store is pretty -- I mean, my store.  My -- my town is pretty small.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Has about fourteen thousand, so I'm not sure if I can get it here.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's kind of -- I mean, in the south, I think they eat those kind of greens a lot.  I don't know if they do in the Mid West.
L:  Oh.
R:  So much.  It may be harder to find.  [NOISE].
L:  I -- I -- I do, I mean, we do like vegetables, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in my family, so, um, I -- I think, uh, I'm originally from Russia and we do a lot of -- we do eat a lot of meats, but here --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- I think there's a larger variety of different vegetables, so I kind of switched to vegetables as -- as well.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, so how long have you lived in --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- there in the Mid West somewhere?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] five and a half years [LAUGH].
R:  Five and a half?  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a pretty long time.
L:  It's a good topic, actually.  You can talk a lot about food [LAUGH].  We can like, share --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the recipes. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know.  I know.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it -- it was funny, because when I came over here and I have some friends visiting from Indiana and I was looking for, um, for -- for beet.
R:  For beets, uh huh. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, beets.  Um, just, you know, to cook like soup for them because, um, they -- they visited Russia, so I knew that they would like soup, that kind of soup --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they've had it before.  And I couldn't find them, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was funny because it was in the fall and I know that they harv- harvest beets in the fall and we couldn't find anything.  And, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my husband went looking with me and he went all over the store and then he came back and he basically said, "How does it look like?" [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  So he -- he didn't even know what he was looking for.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, that was funny.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Ah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What else?  Well, maybe you should be giving me some recipes or something?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, let me think.  What else?  
L:  You have a -- what do you have -- do you have favorite dessert?
R:  Um, yeah, yeah.  Well, I think my favorite dessert -- I like pie.
L:  Mm.
R:  Usually more than other desserts.  I like making apple pie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's one of my favorites.  Um.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  What about you?
L:  Oh, you're a healthy eater.  You're eating, is it kile here, kile, right?
R:  Kale, kale.  Uh-huh.
L:  Kale.  Kile or kale.  I was not sure.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I think I've seen it, because I remember.  It's K.A.L.E. right?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  I've seen it spelt somewhere.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Maybe it's Super Walmart or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I do like pies and I like cakes.  I gotta admit it.
R:  [LAUGH].  Uh-huh?  So --
L:  But I like, um, like, baking cakes like, um, at home, with lots of layers and a little bit of filling in the middle.
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  That's, that's what I like. [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE].  Yeah.
L:  Any big celebrations coming up that you gotta make pies or anything?
R:  Um.  No.
L:  Or you just bake them?  Without any reason?
R:  Yeah, I just bake them when I -- yes, if there is a good reason, I guess.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm a graduate student, so I'm usually pretty busy.  I have to look for time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to cook.  But, um, yeah, I'm trying to think what other foods are -- mm -- favorite foods.  That's always hard.
L:  Do you, um, do you have a large family?  Do you have to cook a lot?
R:  No, I have just me. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't have any kids or anything, so, um.
L:  Well, that's why you can be a healthy eater.  
R:  I can try.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I go back and forth.  Either I am cooking healthy or I am so busy that I like, eat fast foods. [LAUGH].  It's usually one or the other.
L:  Oh. Oh.
R:  Do you have a couple of kids?
L:  Ah, I -- I just have one child.
R:  One child, uh-huh?
L:  Mhm.  Yes.  He is keeping me busy though.
R:  I'm sure it's more work when you have to cook for other people [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  How old is he or she?
L:  Oh, he.  He is eighteen months.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm just --
R:  So, is he eating -- is he eating, like, solid foods and stuff?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He is a really healthy eater.  I kind of, you know, get him cooked up on vegetables right away, so.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I'm cooking everything from scratch most of the time so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he is kind of helping me and trying everything and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's fun and he likes food.  That's why --
R:  That's good.
L:  Um, like, he olives and mushrooms and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He's not a picky eater, so --
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  That's helpful.
R:  I think it's good when you get them started early eating a variety of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they don't get so picky, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I was hoping for, otherwise I'd be in trouble [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Well, you shared a really good recipe.  The only thing that, um, I can share is, I -- I really like the Caesar salad and the -- I'm making the dressing from scratch.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I think it is really nice.
R:  How do you make it?
L:  Um.  Gosh.  I've got a [inaudible] [LAUGH] recipe --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- that I think our ten minutes are going to be fast.
R:   [LAUGH].
L:  But, um, it's pretty easy.  Basically most of it is, um, olive oil.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And then, um --
