L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.  Hi, this is --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- this is Rocco.
R:  Hi, my name is Sheila.
L:  Sheila, how's it going?
R:  Hi, it's fi- I'm fine.
L:  Good.  So, um, never done this before.  I don't know 'bout you.
R:  Ah, neither have I.  I have no idea [LAUGH] what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what do to, really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah [LAUGH].
L:  Figure it's a quick ten bucks, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly [LAUGH], the things we do, right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Totally.  Um --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- so the seasons -- people get ill when the seasons change is the topic, right?
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm from -- I grew up in New York and, ah, so it's a pretty drastic change of seasons up there.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, like, ah, you know, during -- during the winter, usually when the winter season would hit, um, remember it as summer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Lotta people would get sick.  They say the average person gets sick once a year, maybe twice a year.  I don't know.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, what about you?
R:  Um, yes, likewise.  I grew up in the midwest --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in Indiana --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and it sure -- it would, you know, when the snow would come in the fall, late fall --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, November, December --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, more people would get ill --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  Um, then, in the spring -- I'm not sure if that's flu season or what, but, um --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- flu season, ah, seemed to be around the time of change of season, you know.
L:  Right.  Yep.  Yeah.
R:  Ah.
L:  I don't know.  Um, I don't know if they're really considering -- they're considering allergies to be ill.  That's just more of a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- affliction [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it is a nuisance, but that's a good point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Spring.
R:  -- yeah.  Um, I'm not sure about the seven days.  Was something about --
L:  Yeah.  They say --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- a cold --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- lasts seven days.  I don't know.  Um, seems about right, maybe.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Depends on what you -- what you do about it, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But I -- I -- I do find truth to, you know, the way they said going to the doctor really doesn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doesn't help 'cause, you know, it's gotta run its course, right?
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  Um, they can -- doctors can only do so much and sometimes it's not anything they can do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Especially for a common cold.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  They can adjust the symptoms, you know, but it's probably not a lot more than, ah, they probably can't do a lot more than you can do on your own just, ah, you know, going to the drugstore and getting some over the counter cold medicine, you know?
R:  That's true.  Yes.
L:  Unless it's -- unless it's drastic, they could prescribe stronger stuff, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I think there is a problem with, um, the over prescription of, um, antibiotics.  Apparently some people are resistant now or something -- you know, the -- they didn't really need antibiotics or something like that.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, and I'm not sure what the whole story is but, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I've heard a little bit about that [NOISE].
L:  Huh.  Well, it's --
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah, I guess they -- you build up an immunity to 'em.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Like anything.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just --
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah, I just -- I'm -- just recently moved to, ah, Los Angeles area in California --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yeah.  And, ah, so I've gotten sick twice since I've been here in like, ah, um, back in [SIGH] what was it?  AH, November I got --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- sick.  I got really sick.  It was like probably the worst it had ever been.  It was just a nasty flu type thing.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  yeah, it was really bad and, ah, but, you know, been fine ever since, you know.
R:  Do you think it was seas- even though the seasons don't change much [LAUGH] in southern --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- California?
L:  -- that was the -- that was the weird thing, you know.  I mean I wonder if sometime, you know, the body has an internal clock type thing and, um, you know, maybe from years of growing up in New York where, you know --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- it's almost a subconscious thing where, okay, it's November, it's time to get sick, you know, without ever even thinking it.  It's just the body's internal clock.  After --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, thirty two years of training, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  I don't know, but either way, I mean, um, it wasn't particularly cold, you know.  Not compared to what I was used to, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Digging my car outta the snow in November and here I am in southern California and I still got sick in November [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].  Yeah, that is funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The -- we've usually associated, you know, with snow and everything, but --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I don't know.  It's weird.
R:  Yeah, that is weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, is -- just on this topic, I heard, um, like one study say that it wasn't so much the cold, like the snow --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that made people ill, but staying indoors.  And I don't know if I believe that.  I don't --
L:  Really?
R:  -- think that's -- yeah.  Apparently, if you stay indoors, I don't know if it's indoor air or just being around the same people more or something, it's more likely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that you'll get a cold, but --
L:  Well, I could -- I could imagine that.  Um, you know, being around people that are potentially, you know, sick or could pass stuff on, definitely.  And also, ah, you know, breathing stagnant air.  If you don't have good circulation, but I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot of it has to do with exercise.  You know, if you're, ah, if you're somewhat stagnant and not getting a lot of exercise, you know, there's not gonna be -- your heart's not gonna be beating as fast, there's not gonna be as much blood going through and you -- and your immune system's not gonna be working and it's -- you know, as efficiently as it could be.  And also, then, if you're outside doing a lot of errands and running around and doing stuff, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  You -- that'll be better, but at the same time, the cold brings the -- the body's temperature down which also lowers the immune system, I think, to --
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  So it's kind of a catch twenty two.  I think that's why a lot of people get sick 'cause it's kinda hard to avoid.  If you could just manage to stay indoors and stay active --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then, ah, you'll probably be better off.  I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  No.
L:  Interesting, though.
R:  That's -- yeah, that is interesting.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think it is true, though.  People who exercise outdoors, even when it is cold, are probably healthier --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than people who just stay indoors because it's cold, yeah.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure.  I remember growing up, my mother always would yell at me for fooling around with, you know, bare feet.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And, ah, 'cause we had, you know, different rooms would either be hardwood floors or ceramic tile or whatever and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know. We wouldn't keep the house cold per se, but just knowing that it was cold outside and, you know, the -- the floors would be a little bit cooler and, ah, you know, she would say, "Running around with bare feet, you're gonna get sick" and [LAUGH].
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And that really, you know -- or she would say, you know -- you go outside, you know, "Come on in.  Put a jacket on.  You're -- you know, you're gonna get sick 'cause it's cold outside if you don't have a jacket on".  And it's like, well, you know, doesn't really hold a lot of truth, other than the fact that when your body temperature is low it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it decreases it, yeah, immune system, you know.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, it's kinda, mm.
R:  Mhm.  But if you're active, you raise your body temperature, right?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  It helps your immune system that way.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And wearing a hat, too, I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lotta -- they say most of the body's heat escapes through the head.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Up your head when it's real cold out.
R:  I think that's really true.  I've -- I've experienced that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wearing a hat is -- is really helpful.
L:  Yeah, definitely. We always used to -- we'd have our hats on when we were running out playing some ball in the snow or whatever and then we would all take our, you know, our snow -- our ski hats or whatever.  We would take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'd all take 'em off and [LAUGH] all our heads would be steaming [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's true, yeah.
L:  There was no -- I remember one time we did that and then we all lined up, we took a picture of all our heads up like we were all smoking 'cause the [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Our body temperature was like, you know, a hundred and whatever degrees from playing football, but it was like, you know, ten degrees outside so we took the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we'd take our hats off and get in a line and, you know, all our heads would be steaming and it was pretty hilarious.  Took --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a picture [LAUGH].
R:  That is funny.
L:  Yeah.  But, ah, yeah, I spent a lot of time in Florida too, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- then it was -- I always would get [SIGH], you know, get ill during the spring and the summer from all the pollen.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I don't know if that's really considered illness per se.  I guess it is.  I guess, you know, I don't know.  Allergies.
R:  Yeah.  I lived in Michigan for a while and had a very similar problem.  Um, that's where I first discovered I had allergies to, um, grass and, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- certain seeds and things like that.
L:  Really?
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, where I live, I live near a [inaudible] area and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- um, apparently that really was affecting me and I didn't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, that's what it was.  But it felt like, kinda like a cold or flu, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But it was allergies.  It was allergies.
L:  Wow.
R:  'Cause when I -- when I took the medication --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean the allergy pills, it definitely helped.
L:  Really?
R:  Then I didn't have the same problem, you know.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I was allergic to, um, fresh cut grass and hay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that type of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember -- I remember when, ah, when the first time I got -- I realized I had bad allergies, I woke up and I couldn't open my eyes 'cause, ah --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- my eyes were, ah, were, ah, you know, having a reaction overnight while I slept and then I -- I guess that had got 'em stuck together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I woke up, I -- I thought -- my older brother, you know, like plays tricks.  I thought maybe he
