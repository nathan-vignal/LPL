L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name is Jane.
L:  Hi, Jane.  My name is Jim.
R:  Hi, Jim.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm doing fine.
L:  Good.  Ah, talking about food.  They only give us ten minutes, huh?
R:  Yeah, restaurant or at home cooking.  I like to do at home cooking.
L:  Well, ah, I obviously like home cooking the best, myself, because that's where you get homemade, the best nutritious meals I would think.
R:  Do you cook for more than one person?
L:  Well, um, my wife and I kind of share the duties.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, I will do some cooking and she does some cooking and ...
R:  What -- um, do you like ethnic food better or just meat and potatoes?  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's a good question, because they did ask us to name our favorite thing to eat, I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Our favorite meal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I've kind of tempered that, because I've tried to, ah, cut down the number of carbohydrates that I take in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so I -- I cut out the, ah, white potatoes and the white bread and rice and things -- and pasta --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and things like that, best I could.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, if it was before I started doing that, I could name you a lot of good things [LAUGH] that are my favorite meal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but since that time, ah, I guess you could say, um, ah, I love fish.  Um --
R:  Oh, yeah, fish.  Yeah, the --
L:  I love fish.  Ah --
R:  -- fish and chicken are my two favorites.
L:  Fish and chicken are my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- favorite by far.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, I don't know what part of the country you're in, but I'm down --
R:  I'm in Dallas, Texas.
L:  Well, I'm in Paris, Texas.  I'm a hundred miles north east of you.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right.
L:  And, um, I have a sister that lives in Plano, so I do get over there quite a bit --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and my parents live in downtown Dallas, so --
R:  Uh-huh, oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm over there all the time.  But, ah, anyway, um, here in Paris, obviously, we don't have as many things available to eat at as you do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so that's interesting that you like, uh, the home cooked meal the best, because you have so many good places to eat out.
R:  Yeah, but I'm just one person --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and so, even though I have room mates, you know, we each cook separately.
L:  I see.
R:  And, so I would cook -- like, on Saturday or Sunday I'll make a big crock pot of chili --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and then --
L:  So, what would be your favorite, then?
R:  Probably, um, green chili is probably my favorite --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and by the end of the week, you know, it's getting pretty small portion or whatever, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll start adding stuff to it, you know, like, ah, maybe a salad or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The first couple of days, you know, I'll just eat it as a stew --
L:  Now, when you say green chili exactly what, ah ...
R:  Green chili is, the -- the -- the green hatch[?] chilies that have been roasted and peeled and seeded and then chopped up --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then you add, um -- you put them in last, of course, because you don't want to dissolve them, but you use like, maybe pork or chicken and saute it, get it brown and then --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- then I pour in a can of beer and make it all real tender and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, couple of cans of chicken stock and potato, onion, some garlic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then it's all done.  I put in my, um, green chilies and then a cup of -- of you know, water and -- and flour stock --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and make it thick.
L:  All right.
R:  And so by the time the end of the week is, you know, I've like, served it over rice, I've like, you know, served it on a hot dog --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, even though it's got the potatoes and onions and stuff in it --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it's still good on a hot dog.  So --
L:  Sure.
R:  But, I -- I like chilies mostly --
L:  You can be creative with it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you have to change it up.
L:  And make other things with it, then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Y- you have to change it up, because [SIGH] you know, green chili for a week ...  You know, big old crock pot for one person.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] you know, i- --
L:  You gotta make it stretch out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and last a while, for everybody.
R:  Yeah.  It's the --
L:  Or, I mean, that it is going to do that anyway, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, ah, I would say that, um, [LIPSMACK] at one time fried chicken and mashed potatoes and corn and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- peas and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was one of my favorite meals.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, baked salmon.  I -- I've got a George Foreman grill that I can grill salmon on --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, oh, my goodness, there's so many things.  There's too many things that I like to eat.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, as far as a favorite goes, it's difficult to say, but, ah, like at my church, when we have a gathering there, and we have pot luck and everybody brings something, that probably be my favorite place to eat.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like eating out, but it's eating home cooking out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And everybody brings, ah, different things, and I've got one man there that, um, his specialty is, ah, ribs.
R:  Oh, man, yeah.
L:  And he -- he brings the best barbeque ribs you can ever eat.
R:  Oh, I bet --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- it takes him all day to make 'em.
L:  They're -- they're coun- -- they're country folks, ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's a small area outside of Paris, and, ah, so these country cooks can really ... oh, it's just unreal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they can fix.  And it is so wonderful.  And so that's why I -- I'm having to -- to cut down on [LAUGH] things, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I won't get awa- way from me here, eating those wonderful things.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  But, ah, as far as eating out -- I like to go to Dallas and eat out at several places there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I -- I -- you know, there's so many.  Ah, The Outback and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I could just name so many different places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I enjoy eating, but when I got there I think eating at my sister's and eating there at her home, ah, is what I enjoy the most.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, ah, I have a large family.  We all bring food together, so I guess my favorite, I'm saying, is -- and th- that I enjoy eating out, but you can see by what I've described here, that it's all the places I can go to where people have brought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their favorite dishes, or their food that they have cooked.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we come together and eat.
R:  Sometimes they're family recipes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  An- and sorta like what you're saying, is that you have a group there that you all take turns cooking, and you enjoy each other's specialties --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- or each other's things that you make.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, so I think that -- that we're both kind of agreeing in the same way on that one.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- let's see, ah, ah, your favorite -- I think we talked about our favorite, I guess, and um, [LIPSMACK] whether we like to eat out or at home.
R:  As far as eating out, I would pick a sushi bar to go to.
L:  Yeah, now I have not, ah, really gone into that part of it as much.  Ah, but I do like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, Chinese food --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We have good places here in town.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  You know, where it's all you can eat buffet.
R:  Yeah, well, I like sushi the best.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Because that combines all the rice and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um the vegetables and the seafood.
L:  So ah, now, the -- as far as the sushi goes, ah, do you like best the, ah, fish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, roll that's -- that has the vegetable wrapped around it, or --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh, yeah.  It's those that are the ones I like.
L:  Okay.
R:  California roll, and the spicy salmon.  I love salmon.
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love salmon, it's one of my favorite.  'Course I prefer, myself to --to have it cooked.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I'm not opposed to trying, you know, different things.  Um --
R:  In fact, I was at a restaurant the other night, and they served a plain salmon.  It was on a cedar shingle.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, it was so good, with --
L:  On a cedar shingle.
R:  On a cedar shingle, yeah.  And they put it on the grill, and the cedar shingle kinda smokes and starts burning --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and it give the fish that good smokey, cedary flavor and then --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they serve it to you with -- on the -- on the shingle, on your -- on your [inaudible] and, um, whipped potatoes --
L:  Do you mind me asking what the name of the place was?
R:  Um, Todi.
L:  Todi.
R:  T.O.D.- D.I.  It's up there on, um, Parker Road.
L:  Okay.
R:  Over there by George Bush.  Todi.
L:  I -- I'm not sure where that is, but, ah, my sister lives at the corner of Quoit and Parker.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  On Quoit and Parker there's a --
R:  No, see, no, I get mixed up on --
L:  She's about two blocks north of that.
R:  I get mixed up on Park and Parker.
L:  Me too.
R:  I'm not sure which one it is.
L:  Parker's further out north.
R:  Yeah, they're right beside each other and I get confu- --
L:  Park is closer to the, ah, mall --
R:  Yeah, so I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's called T.O.D.I.
L:  T.O.D.I.  Well, I'll ask my sister --
R:  And it's all you can eat sushi and everything else.  They cook the -- cook your dinner for ya -- your -- your seafood for ya, and it's like, twenty one dollars, all you can eat.
L:  Yeah?  Oh, my goodness, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I appreciate you telling me that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'll be something to keep in mind.
R:  And -- but lunch is way less expensive.  It's more like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, ten ninety nine or something.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  And they have the same things.
L:  So, you're --
R:  At lunch time.
L:  -- you're telling me, then, that most- mostly you eat at home, rather than go out and eat.
R:  If somebody's buying me dinner, yes, I will go out --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- for dinner.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, but -- but, ah, your favorite is to eat at home, a home cooked meal.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Okay, I -- I agree with you on that.
R:  I like to do the grocery shopping and just cutting up the vegetables and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  Seasoning it myself, and I like special seasonings.  I like to -- I buy, um, salts from Hawaii.  I order --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- those online --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and get different flavored and colored salts and stuff, and --
L:  You sound professional.
R:  Oh, no --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no, just -- I'm -- I'm a -- I'm -- I'm a thin
