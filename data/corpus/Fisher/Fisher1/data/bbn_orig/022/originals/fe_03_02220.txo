R:  Hi, I'm Pam.
L:  Hi, I'm Amy.
R:  Do we start now?
L:  Yes, I think so.
R:  [LAUGH].  Okay, so the topic is food and what do we prefer?  Eating out or at home?
L:  Uh-huh.  And I prefer at home.
R:  Do you?  So do I.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't like the fast food, um, restaurants and the um, ah, non nutritional meals.  I like cooking at home and, uh, fixing something nutritional for my family.
R:  Mm, me too.  And I like knowing that um, you know, weird people haven't been handling my stuff or dropping it on the floor.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know exactly where it's been and you know that it's been prepared correctly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, it's nutritional and the value.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where you got it from and --
R:  And -- and I like cooking fresh, too.  I don't like, um, you know, processed foods.
L:  Right.  Me either.  And I -- well, I like um, fresh fruits and vegetables and -- and being able to cook my own things from scratch and being able to cut up my own foods and just give my children something healthy to eat.
R:  Mhm.  So do I.  Um, I think the other important thing is, is the cost, 'cause I know when I go out to eat, um, at a restaurant that I think sells quality food, it's got a real quality price to it.
L:  Oh, right.  It's very expensive.
R:  And um, I could feed my family for, like, three meals on what it costs to eat just one.
L:  Right.  And that's the same even for fast foods.  Even for myself with just a family of three, it costs twenty bucks just to go to McDonald's or any of the other fast food restaurants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I could go home and cook a nutritional meal and it'd be much -- much less expensive.
R:  Yes.  I -- I -- I just made tonight, um I went to the grocery store and picked up um, skinless, boneless chicken breasts and pasta and tomato sauce and a few vegetables and I made Chicken Cacciatore.
L:  Oh, it sounds good.
R:  And it cost ten dollars.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH].  And it fed four of us.
L:  Right.  Well in --
R:  So.
L:  -- with me, I'm a single mom and two parents and I can make dinner and have leftovers and take it to work the next day and not have to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and not have to pay for lunch the next day at work so it really is like a double -- double scoop for me.
R:  Right.  Well -- 
L:  And it helps me on money
R:   -- and I'm a single mom and I have three grown daughters and a grandson that live with me.  So.
L:  Yeah.  So that's a big help.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, yeah, so it's -- it's [NOISE] really helpful because we -- we ate um, at like Hard Rock Cafe a few weeks ago and it was like a hundred and twenty dollars.
L:  Yes, very expensive.
R:  For three of us and a baby.
L:  Right.  Mhm.  We ate at Amerigos.  I don't know if you have one of those, but it's an Italian restaurant and it's really nice, but like you said, it's very expensive and you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can't do that very often and you don't wanna eat the fast food when you go out.  You wanna have a nice meal that your family can enjoy and you know that it's healthy and it -- it costs too much to be able to go out and do that.
R:  That's right and I -- I did studies when I was younger.  Um, my husband, my ex-husband and I owned a restaurant back in the mid seventies and it was a natural food restaurant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.  And I had to take classes on food handling, like you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- through the Health Department.  And I was amazed at some of the nasty things.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I've seen it.  I've -- I've gone to like Subway --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- to get a sandwich and um, I've seen -- I've act- I've actually walked out as they're in the middle of making my sandwich because the person would sneeze in th- in their arm.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, or the no gloves -- 
R:  I go, okay.  Where did that sneeze go?  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Or the no -- no gloves right after they've handed someone back their change.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, yes, I've -- I've -- I've worked in fast food and I actually managed a fast food restaurant at one time and it was -- it was horrible and we always showed all of these videos to our employees about where -- where they had had secret cameras in some of these stores and the horrible things --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that the employees had been doing, and you know, ever since then, it has been very difficult for me to be able to go out [LAUGH] to a fast food restaurant of any type and --
R:  I need to know --
L:  -- ev- even -- even that restaurant.  You know -- 
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- even the one I worked at that I trusted at one time because I knew what was going on there, you can't trust it if you're not there twenty four hours a day.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So.
R:  That's right.  I just -- I get like -- especially in -- in the winter.  I mean, I live in Florida.
L:  Mhm?
R:  But in -- in the winter, a lot of tourists come down here and there's a lot of -- you know, everybody gets sick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I just won't eat out then.  Because it's -- it just grosses me out with all the people, like, sneezing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spreading their cold germs all over my food.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm in Tennessee and [LAUGH] it's the same here.  Well, when the hot weather --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gets -- well, you know, whenever it changes from hot to cold and -- and people are getting sick and -- and then they're eating out and then, you know, these people that are at the restaurants who don't -- that keep going to work even though they're sick.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's a -- that's a really sad thing and even when I worked in a restaurant, I mean, even when I was sick, you couldn't, you couldn't miss work.
R:  No, you can't.  A man- -- 
L:  If you were a manager, you couldn't miss work and you know, you're not supposed to work because you know, you're sick and you could spread germs.  So I would try --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to stay in the back office, but you know, we were forced to be there and that's a -- that's a sad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing because it just -- it makes you not want to go and eat somewhere because you know how it is.
R:  Oh, I know.  I -- I've seen -- I've seen sick people in -- in restaurants, like, working.
L:  Right.  It's amazing and --
R:  Like, okay, I've walked in.  I'm like, okay, I'm not eating here [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Sneezing and wiping their nose and [LAUGH].
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Or just like, you know, sneezing off to the side.  Hello, that's spreading germs.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Or even -- I've -- you know, I've been to [LAUGH] a restaurant before and go in the bathroom and you see an employee [LAUGH].  Well, actually you know, you see an employee that just comes out of the stall when you're walking in and they just go straight through the door and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't even bother to wash their hands and you know, of course they could be washing their hands when they got back to the kitchen sink, but who wants to trust that?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  You know, there's no way.
R:  I -- I've seen, um, employees that handle money and then go to handle my food and I've told them, "Oh, no, you go wash your hands".
L:  Right.  Wash your hands.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Put on gloves, you know.  
R:   Ahah.
L:  It's a requirement and the hairnet and [LAUGH] I even had a boy one time that had really, really long fingernails and he left nail marks in the um, cheese --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and we asked him to cut his nails and he quit over it.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, it's like, oh my goodness, you know, you would think that they would want to be, you know, to make it a healthy environment and think about it.  Their own families even come in and to eat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you don't want to do that.  I mean, I wouldn't want to put my fingernail in my own [LAUGH] you know, cheese --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- an- and trust it.  So.
R:  Unfortunately, fifty percent of the population today just doesn't care.  They don't -- they don't think beyond themselves.
L:  Right.  Well, and --
R:  That's why I don't like going out.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, an- -- and you know, everybody is so busy now that they feel like that they have to eat out all the time and it's just -- that's part of the unh- one of the unhealthy things that's going on now, and you know, the overweight deal that everybody keeps talking about.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And the different things and it's -- they don't watch what they're feeding their children or they don't watch what th- they eat.  You know, m- my son is a healthy size, but I mean, he's a -- he's a pretty big boy, but it's not because he doesn't watch what he eats.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's like a metabolism thing, but you know, I like to -- I would like to think that everybody was like that, but they're not and it's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- really sad.  
R:  -- and when -- when my children were younger I was divorced and I would stand Sunday in the kitchen preparing things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I would -- I would prepare, like, the start of food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I would wash my lettuce and have it ready so I could make a salad.  
L:  Right.
R:  And I would wash my vegetables and have them all prepared.  My broccoli cleaned and all prepared so when I was ready to cook it, it was -- 
L:  It was there.
R:  -- it was ready.
L:  Yes.
R:  It was just like if I was working in a restaurant, I would do all of the prep on Sunday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sometimes, I would pre make like, um, um, a tomato sauce or -- or I might pre cook chicken, like you know, just get it browned a little bit and then all I would need to do -- and then marinade it and all I would need to do the day I was cooking it, is just, you know, put it in a pan and -- and finish cooking it with a lid, or put it in the oven.
L:  Right.
R:  But everything would be ready.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was just a matter of finishing it off.
L:  And that's a great way to do it.  But, I used to sell Tupperware and we used to teach classes about you know, when you don't have any time during the week, preparing your meals on -- on the weekends and then -- and putting them in the containers and putting them in the freezer and you know, if you -- you have a late meeting at work, you know, the kids can come in and put something in the microwave and heat it up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know you cooked it and you know it's good and nutritious.
R:  Right.
L:  And you don't have to worry about sending somebody out for takeout or anything like that.  And they had --
L:  I know.
R:  --something good to eat and -- and you knew you made it --
