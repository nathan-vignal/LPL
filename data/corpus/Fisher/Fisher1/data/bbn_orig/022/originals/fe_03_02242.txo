R:  Hello, my name is Lisa.
L:  Lisa, my name is Gene.  How are you doing?
R:  Good, thank you.
L:  How are you feeling, Lisa?
R:  Um, I'm feeling okay.  I'm a little sick from allergies right now.
L:  You got those allergies when the season changed?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  How do your allergies, ah, show up?
R:  Um, like what are my symptoms?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, really itchy, watery eyes.  Um, and a really itchy throat, mostly.  And my nose gets a little drippy too.
L:  That -- that only happens, like, in the spring?
R:  Yeah.  It starts about mid April.
L:  And when does it end?
R:  Um, probably about the end of June.
L:  [MN].  A lot of people have allergies.  They s- sell a lot of medicine for it in the drug stores.  Any of that stuff work?
R:  Um, well I get, um, an allergy shot every year --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- from the allergist.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I also take, um, prescription medication.
L:  Does it work?
R:  Um, the shot helps a lot.  Like, this year is ten thousand times better than years that I haven't taken a shot and, um, the prescription medication is just for like, when the shot's not strong enough and that usually works well too.
L:  Well, that's good, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you allergic to any animals?  Any cats or anything?
R:  No.  I'm not allergic to anything.
L:  Okay.  I -- I am, ah, I don't get seasonal allergy --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I am allergic to, ah, cats --
R:  Right.
L:  -- although we have two of them.
R:  [LAUGH].  Seems to always be the case, that way.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  You know, and, ah, and my allergy is, um, that I -- I -- I can't breathe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would be different if it was just, ah, you know, you get itchy, watery eyes.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  But, um, too bad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my wife likes the cats.
R:  [LAUGH].  Do you take anything for it?
L:  Um, an inhaler.  Something, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- one inhale a day or something.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  It's not a lot.
R:  Not very helpful?
L:  On no.  It works, works, works.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  No problem at all.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  I mean, it works.  And, um, I play with them.  It's no problem.  The cats aren't a problem.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  And, um, if I'm in a, ah, like a very smoked bar or something like that.
R:  Right, yeah.  That happens to a lot of people.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  Major.  But other than that, it's not -- not too bad and, ah, you know, I try to stay fit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Try to exercise.  Try to stay away from, ah -- I say, I try --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- but I do.  From, ah, you know, I guess fatty foods, although --
R:  Yeah, crappy foods.
L:  -- course, if there's a party or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- that's the way it goes.
R:  Once in a while, of course.
L:  Yeah.  And, um, you know, it happens.  What can you say?  It happens, ah.  And as, um, as it gets, you know, we are getting into a particular period of time now with, um, with, um, with a lot of parties coming up, you know, you gain a little weight.
R:  Yeah, you do.
L:  You got to exercise a little bit and lose it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where -- where are you calling from?
R:  Stratton Island, New York.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Philadelphia, so.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was up in Stratton Island last week.
R:  Yeah, I was just up in Philadelphia last week.  [LAUGH].
L:  Ralph's.  Do you know Ralph's?
R:  Um, on Victory Boulevard?
L:  Yeah.  The  Italian water rice place?
R:  Yes, it's right by my school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ralph's.  What school do you go to?
R:  Wagner College.
L:  Okay.  Ralph's Italian water rice.  Now water rice doesn't have many calories.  It's supposed to be good for you.  It's fat free.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  So that doesn't make --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you feel unhealthy.
R:  Yeah.  Better.  Yeah, then it makes you feel like you're eating something healthy.
L:  Yeah.  And then, um, of course, we stopped at a couple of bakeries up there too.
R:  Yeah.  There's so many.
L:  That's not real good.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  But anyway, um, the bakeries aren't bad.  Ah, the food isn't bad and, um, everything else is pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The seasons here, you know.  Oh, they want to know if you get a cold.  Do you get many colds?
R:  Um, no.  I -- I rarely get like sick other than allergies.
L:  Okay, well sometimes I get colds.  Once or twice a year.  I mean, knock the socks off me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you don't feel like doing anything.
R:  Yeah.  I get like the flu or bronchitis like once every like three years and it like knocks the crap out of me but other than that, like I don't get, like little stupid sick, ever.
L:  Yeah, right, right.  I was -- I'm working with somebody who's on -- who's, um, trying to get disability income.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was looking at his, ah, he made a list of his drugs.  He's on sixteen different drugs.
R:  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
L:  And, ah, I said, "Well look, you're disabled.  Look, you've got sixteen drugs."  And I said, "Look, mine is zero."
R:  Ah huh.
L:  I said, "Yours is sixteen.  You're ahead of me.  Why do you feel guilty about this?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "You know, you got what you got.  That's the way it is."
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So he's not as healthy as others.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some people are not healthy because they choose to live that lifestyle.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  They're either grossly overweight or they're diabetic and they don't service their needs.
R:  Right, yeah.  A lot of people bring it on to themselves.
L:  Well you bring it on and when you get it, you got to do something and, um, you know, ah, you know grossly overweight people have a significant health problems in --in all areas of their-- their body and, um --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- diabetes people get sick.  It tears apart -- I mean, it attacks their circulation.  They get bad feet, they get poor vision.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, they are prone to Parkinson's.  Um, you know, what you eat is like, ah, like what you put in your car.  If you get a brand new car, you want to put nice gasoline in it,
R:  Yeah, put the best stuff in it, of course, yeah.
L:  Geez, I figure I got a brand new body.  I want to put the best stuff in it.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Although, like I say, I'm always, ah -- always up for a donut or something.
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH].
L:  But, you know, you got to do somethings, occasionally.  Occasionally you got to eat right.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Well, if you're in college, you get three meals a day?
R:  Um, we do, but I never wake up for the first one, of course.
L:  That's supposed to be the most important.
R:  It is but if you wake up only an hour before lunchtime, then that'll be the first one and counts just the same.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, you're right about that --
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  -- aren't you?  Okay, all right, fine, fine, fine.  It's not quite the way you're supposed to do it but what the heck.
R:  Yeah.  But whatever works, it's college.  It's only four years in your life.
L:  Oh yeah?  Are there people that are still getting through in four years?
R:  Yeah.  I'm getting through in four years.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  I thought most people took five years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now.  Well, anyway, it's a -- it's good to, um, to know that, ah, you know, what you -- what you put in your body has a significant impact upon the health of the body.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, what they say about this cold -- is it seven days or a week?  Colds are colds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Flu's the flu and, ah, no matter what the doctor gives you, um, it's tough to fight a cold.  Other than that, you got to stay healthy.  It depends upon what you eat and often times, on how you, ah, exercise.  If you do anything at all.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  If you're not getting up until eleven o'clock in the morning, that's a problem.
R:  Well, not necessarily.
L:  Unless you're staying up till dawn.  Unless you're staying up till three in the morning.
R:  Exactly.  So it works out.  Yeah, that's when I went to bed last night, was three.  So, it works out.
L:  Hopefully studying and not eating pizza.
R:  Oh.
L:  That'll make you sick.
R:  No, I wasn't eating that late that night.
L:  Okay.
R:  It does make me sick, like in the middle of the night, to eat that late.
L:  If you eat that late --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually if you -- that stuff's not real good for you.  Although I eat it, it's not -- you know, loaded with cheese --
R:  What, pizza?
L:  Ah, so much cheese.
R:  Yeah, I don't like pizza.  I rarely eat it.
L:  Right, and we have, ah, there are things here that people, like salt pretzels and cheese sticks that people eat and they get sick and --
R:  Yeah, those cheese sticks are so good.
L:  Or somebody else, New York cheesecake, and they want to gouge themselves on it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't really like cheesecake either.
L:  And they get sick as a dog.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You got to be careful what you eat.  Get exercise a little bit.  You can eat just about anything you want but in moderation.
R:  Yeah.  Get good sleep.
L:  And when you get sick, you know, it doesn't pay to go to -- go to class or go to work and get everyone else sick.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  It just pays to sit home, relax, try to get through it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like you should couple that stuff with a -- with a little exercise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so what else?
R:  Um, I don't know.  What else do you need to ask me?
L:  Oh no, you're supposed to ask me.
R:  [LAUGH].  Um, I don't know.  What do you guys do this survey for?
L:  I am just like you.  Somebody that phones in.
R:  Oh.
L:  I know nothing about the survey.  All I know is somebody came and called us.  We are supposed to talk about illness.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  And, ah, illness is bad.  Illness is -- you know, you got maybe seventy five or eighty years in life.  The first ten years you can't remember -- you can't remember the last ten years.
R:  Right.
L:  So you got sixty years and you hate like heck to be ill during the sixty years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you see people that either have emphysema.  You can tell them a mile away from their -- from the time they're fifty on, they weigh --
