R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, um, my name's Cindy.  Who's this?
L:  Uh, hi, this is Daniel.
R:  Hi Daniel. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you just another participant, or you a part of the, the [inaudible]?
R:  No, I'm just another participant.
L:  Okay.
R:  And this, the whole thing is such an intriguing concept, I just, even though I consider myself a very busy person, I thought well, I gotta check into this.  It's the first time anything like this had come, um, come across my desk or across my computer screen. [SIGH] Um, Daniel, we're supposed to talk for ten minute, minutes on this topic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of illness.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, seasonal illness and whether or not we believe that, um, illness is tied to the calendar, and what we do to prevent that.  Um, [LIPSMACK] is that a topic that's, um, ah, that you feel you've got a, a, a opinion about?
L:  Uh, sure, not that I really am affected by seasonal changes as far as my health goes.
R:  Yeah, so you, you're not a seasonal allergy sufferer then?
L:  Not at all.
R:  Yeah, you're lucky, that's good.  I'm not either.
L:  [MN]
R:  But I do have some friends that, that suffer and I know when we moved to California from the east coast for the first year that we were here, my husband had allergies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like he'd never had before, and it really, he thought it was just adjusting to a whole new setup, um, [LIPSMACK] flora and fauna out there.
L:  Yeah, that's unfortunate.  You know what?  This call came like right in the middle of a call with my grandmother. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Can you hold on just a few seconds?
R:  Sh- -- yeah, go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Hey Daniel I hope you come back, because I believe our call is being recorded, and it may be that we'll be discontinued or disconnected if there's no, uh, voice on the line, because I know this is a voice study, so, um, I respect the fact that you're saying goodbye to your grandmother, it's very important, but, I hope you come back soon.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hey Daniel. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Have you said bye to your grandmother?
L:  Yeah, grandmother says hello.
R:  Oh, that's nice, I think that's terrific.  What part of the country are you in?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, I am too.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Where do you live?
R:  I'm, I'm in southern California.
L:  Me too.
R:  I'm about fifteen minutes north of Disneyland.
L:  Oh, so you're, like, near Anaheim somewhere.
R:  Yeah, just, ah, north of Anaheim and Fullterton.
L:  Ah.  I live, um, right near Griffith Park.
R:  Okay, Griffith Park is in LA, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  What's your cross streets in LA?  I'm trying to place where it is in the city, if it's --
L:  I live ah, for [inaudible] Boulevard, and Griffith Park.
R:  Okay, so that's like going on the one oh one a little bit north of, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  It's right next to the five.
R:  Right by the five, okay.
L:  We're, like, Glendale is.
R:  Okay, where the five and the one.  Okay, that's right, then I've got, that should put it on the map. [SIGH] Well, I guess getting back to the topic here in terms of illness --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's something that I've spent a lot of time studying.  My background's in biochemistry --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I've worked with a lot of viruses that are, um, [LIPSMACK] light sensitive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so those viruses tend to, um, proliferate in the spring.
L:  Right.
R:  When people come out from their winter hibernation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're back out in the sun, sunlight, particularly in the parts of the country that don't get, you know, as much sun as we get here in, in sunny southern California.
L:  Right.
R:  So I know that there are certain viruses.  Chicken pox usually flare up in the kindergarten populations in the spring.  That's a light sensitive virus, persella[?].
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  Um, there are a couple of other ones, herpes simplex, a lot of people will say they get, ah, fever blisters, cold blisters.
L:  Right, I've heard that.
R:  In the spring, they go out in the sun.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, that's a seasonal, um, illness.  My personal feeling from, um, not only biochemistry, but also just from raising four kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and working on keeping myself healthy is that we've got to strengthen our immune systems.  What do you think?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Um, do you take supplements to try to do that?
L:  I do, I've been a big propounder of my own health since grade school.
R:  That's good.
L:  And, uh, definitely.  I'm, I'm a completely organic, you know, weirdo. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  And, ah, as far as medicine goes, you know, I balance my, my, you know, pharmaceuticals with, uh, healthy and [several inaudible words] herbal supplement.
R:  Well that's great, I, I agree with that completely.  I've been researching and participating with various nutritional companies over the last, uh, thirty seven years, um, looking for the best, um, supplements that are on the market.  And, um, I've come up with a few that I feel very very strongly about. I'm knock on wood healthy, the only time I've ever been hospitalized really is to have the four kids.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, and a skiing accident, the last thing was arthroscopic surgery on my knee, they repair it.
L:  Really? I'm a big skier too.
R:  Are you really?  Where do you ski?
L:  And I, and I broke my ankle about six months ago.
R:  Oh, no, on the slopes?
L:  Uh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well I guess that's a seasonally, seasonally reoccurring --
L:  [LAUGH] It is seasonal.
R:  -- illness then. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's in the chicken.  You know, you know what, strengthening your immune system does definitely affect healing those kinds of injuries, too.
L:  Definitely, my ankle's better for it.
R:  Is it good, is it good and strong now?
L:  Yeah, it's fine now.
R:  That's good.  I bet you doubled up on the vitamin C. and all the things that promote collagen and boatly[?] --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and now new bones.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah, calcium, all those things are, are really really important.  Well, you sound like you're young.  Are, do you, are you, um, um, married, do you have children?
L:  No, completely single.  I'm twenty nine.
R:  Oh, you are young.
L:  I'm a graphic designer.
R:  Cool.  Are you self employed, or do you work with a company?
L:  Um, both.  Right now I work, I've been doing a lot of community based work with non profit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh, and I do design work on my own.
R:  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I'm working with a non profit community myself, um, [LIPSMACK] my, um, organization locally here is National Charity League.  I'm, ah, club president of the Fullton chapter on my way to hand over the gavel to my successor in, um, about four weeks.
L:  And what do you guys do there?
R:  We, we, we support fourteen different philanthropies in our communities.
L:  Really.
R:  And I know we're probably gonna get our hands wet because we're straying from the topic of illness, but, I was in the emergency room yesterday from one o'clock until seven o'clock with a very dear friend of mine, who, um, I feel, still very, very, um, almost shocked that, at my good fortune to have been on the phone with her when she collapsed, and I heard the phone thump, and I was able to call nine one one.
L:  Really.
R:  And get the ambulance over to her right away.  Um, so, I mean after being in the hospital and observing emergency room technicians for the bulk of the day yesterday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I came home really wiped out, but completely, um, committed to the importance of staying healthy.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  It's just, it's so obvious to me.  My husband is a physician.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And his sub specialty is, um, endocrinology.  And um, you know, endocrine, ah, is a, it's a very interesting sort of specialty, because it involves all different areas of metabolic, um, uh, balance. 
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, balance to me is the key word.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's tough trying to stay healthy in this, uh, fast paced age.  It's also a real, um, mission I think, and I, I think you've accomplished it to be able to stay, um, in the mode of feeding your body whole foods, organically grown whole foods. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean, especially in our culture.  But it's much easier to have, have poor health, or a sort of poor health in, in any way, emotionally, visually.  Our environment's so polluted with refuse.
R:  It's so true.  I mean it really is, and I've been try to get my kids to understand if they start to spinoff from us and establish their own apartments, um, that, you know, they've got to be responsible for how they eat, and that they should really think when they go to the grocery store to get as much food as they can that does not come in any kind of package.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I just tell them, look for food that's packaged as nature packages in.  And try to stay away from anything that's coming in a microwave safe container [LAUGH] or can.
L:  Yeah, I mean even just the protas[?], the protas are grandparents, it does not, it's, it's not coming from the safe well.  The ground is not the same ground.
R:  That's right, we've depleted our soil.
L:  Mm.
R:  And of course we have all these pesticides.
L:  Right.
R:  And we've got all of the things that are taking agriculture to new lows. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's really [SIGH] it is quite a challenge.  I mean, it, I remember back as a child being, um, in my, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] great aunt's garden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and looking at the protas that she grew, and thinking, "My gosh, they didn't have this at the local grocery store".  And tomatoes that just were so sweet that you, you really knew they were fruit. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  It was really, oh, I don't know, but I, I mean, there, I do believe there is still [MN] the ability for us to stay healthy, and to, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, go with the natural flow of the seasons by looking to see what's, um, you know, what is in season and then making sure that we get enough of that for our bodies.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, [MN] there's a few companies that I've been involved with that have come up, that have individual products that are unique to those companies, and I think that those are very good, there are some things that are kind of exotic, you wouldn't find them necessarily in the local grocery stores like, um, puree of the mango steam.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is a, I don't know if you've ever heard of that, it's a very exotic fruit.
L:  Right.
R:  Grown in the tropics.  But it has a very high concentration of zanthoens[?].  Zanthoens are some of  the most potent antioxidants on the planet.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, that particular, um, garsinia[?] ma- --
