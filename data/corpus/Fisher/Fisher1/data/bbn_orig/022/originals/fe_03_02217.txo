R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm, uh, Virginia.
R:  My name is R- Ralph.
L:  Ralph?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm glad to meet you, Ralph.
R:  Glad to meet you [LAUGH].  
L:  I don't know where you're calling from.  I'm calling from, uh, Texicana, Texas.
R:   Oh, really?  I'm calling from California.
L:   California.  
R:  Right.
L:  Well, we're kind of miles apart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  What part of Texas?
L:  Um, Texicana.
R:  Oh, okay.  Because my mum lives out in, ah, in Houston.
L:  Yeah.  Um, we were going to talk about food.
R:  Correct.
L:  And I really like eating in a restaurant.  Um, mainly because, you know, I like to sit down and be served [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].  
L:  I get kinda tired of cooking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's just not my bag.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, well, I eat out quite a bit. And, you know, I have some preferences.  Um, sometimes, you know, I -- I like to, uh, have a good fish, like um, um, catfish.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like to eat that.  And, uh, I like things like pizza and especially I like Mexican food.
R:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  I like enchiladas and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- tacos and we have, uh, some very good restaurants here.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And a lot of times, you know, even if we've been out in the evening, we slip in there and we get some tacos and enchiladas.  I mean, we really, really enjoy the food.  How about you?  What do you like?
R:  Um, I kind of like a little bit of both.  Um, usually on the weekends we like to, um, eat out. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My wife kind of likes to take her time out.
L:  Uh, [LAUGH].
R:  For cooking, so uh, usually during the week we tend to eat at home most of the time.  Um, and it's usually on weekends or there are certain days, maybe like on a Wednesday, where we'll just eat out.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.
L:  Do you have any particular restaurants you like to go to?
R:  Uh, we usually like to go eat, um, ribs.
L:  Ribs?  Uh-huh.
R:  Right.  Or anything like barbecue.
L:  Yeah.  We like barbecue.  That is good.
R:  Right.  Barbecue chicken, and uh, we have -- try to just, uh, certain restaurants where they make, like, really good barbecues out here, so.
L:  Yeah.  I like chicken real well too and we have Kentucky Fried Chicken.  You know, they have some good place here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, a lot of blacks, you know, that live round here, they really go for that, but --
R:  R- right.
L:  I like it, I really do.  It's good.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I hear they have, like, different types of chicken.  They have, like, the um, fried and deep fried?
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Like Louisiana style and -- and I don't know --
L:  I've tried a McDonalds, um, salad with, uh, chicken uh the other day, that -- some premium salads that they were trying?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And uh, it was good.  Ah.  I really prefer other things but, you know, it had strips of chicken --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- over um, you know, lettuce and like four tomatoes and it's their big thing now.  Their new thing.
R:  Oh, wow, really?  I mean --
L:  I don't know what they have in California?
R:  Actually, no.  They haven't introduced that over here yet.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And, uh, they introduced tacos here for a while at McDonalds --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, I don't think that went too well.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  They didn't taste that good.  I mean these -- these, I mean, you're used -- used to that place just being, you know, burgers and stuff, so.
L:  Yeah.  But they have pretty good biscuit and sausage in the morning.  You know, McDonalds does? 
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And I like that.
R:  Yeah.  I always -- that's a -- that's a good breakfast.
L:  Yeah, a couple of those start off the day.  [LAUGH].
R:  A little quick breakfast.
L:  I like to eat.
R:  Yeah.  And it -- you know, it's pretty cheap, too, you know?  So --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, really they are reasonable and -- and even though I'm not fond, uh, you know, of eating, like, hamburgers and everything -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like that, ah, they do have a really a pretty good -- pretty good hamburger.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I used to like, um, going out to, like, hamburger --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- different -- different hamburger stands 'cause everybody just has to make it different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Especially, like, those little, like, Mom and Pop stores.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that can be -- make the best hamburgers, to tell you the truth.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  You know?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I had um, a big time when I first got married.  You know, I didn't know anything about cooking.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I -- I got a nurses' training, and all they taught us to eat was some porridge type stuff that, you know, when nobody was looking, we threw in the wastepaper basket.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, I really didn't even know how to fix coffee and, boy, my first attempts at coffee were something else.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Finally my brother in law who used to come in every morning, he said, "Sis", he said, "from now on, I'll make the coffee".
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And you know, then I started cooking and -- and a lot of times, you know, I would just fix casseroles for the family.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah?
L:  And I'd have one, one day and the next day, I'd have another one.  Because they're really reasonable and cheap to fix, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But sometimes the kids get -- got sick of it, you know?  They got tired of the same old thing, so I'd have to plan something new.
R:  Yeah, you really want --
L:  And mainly something nutritious for 'em, you know?
R:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, that's why a lot of, uh, we tend to eat at home.  You know, sometimes a meal will just tend to be, like, a little bit more nutritious and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, fast food, they just put all kinds of grease and stuff, so.
L:  I know.  And then you have to worry about the fat content and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  -- end up with gall bladder trouble or something like that.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  It's -- I mean like, you know, we tend to, like, sometimes watch what we eat and you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we eat out too much, I'm like, "Okay, we better take a break", so --
L:  Mhm.  So, what is your perfect place, do you think?  There, where you are, in California?
R:  Uh, fast food wise?
L:  Mhm?
R:  Um.  I guess it can't be McDonalds, 'cause they're, like, on every corner almost.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Out here.  I don't know how it is up there, but out here, they're like every other mile or so, so --
L:  Yeah.  Do you have a Sonics out there?
R:  Ah, you know what?  There's a limited area.  Not in the LA area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But when you get out to, like, Central California --
L:  Then you have them?  Mhm. 
R:  -- California -- you'll find them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, uh, I remember when I went out to Texas, ah, they took me to a Sonic and that -- that's where you, like, pull up and then they bring the food out to you?
L:  Yeah, right.  You're waited on.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I was like wow, this is me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause back home, you don't have that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and uh --
L:  It is pretty neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes you have to wait a while, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Depends on how busy they are, at the drive ins, but they have some pretty good food.
R:  What's your favorite restaurant out there?
L:  Oh, um, I usually like to have, uh, something like the tacos, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I go for that Mexican food.
R:  Yeah, actually, I don't know if they have some out there, but we have, uh, what's called, Poya[?] Loco.  
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Um, it's pretty good.  Just -- all -- that's all they sell is chicken, like uh, marinated chicken and it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's pretty good.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I like, uh, when my family comes down -- down here, they kinda like, ah, pig out in uh, all the restaurants, they don- they don't have back there, they like, they have to visit here.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  We have uh, a real good Mexican restaurant they call La Creditas[?] here.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And it has a lot of, uh, style.  I've gone in -- with my church group and uh, I -- I don't even know -- I think they go there because they do serve drinks in one part, but we did.  We went in there as a group and when you go in, they've got all this Mex- uh, Spanish music going, you know?  And it really makes you feel like you want to do a la karacha[?] or whatever [LAUGH] it is they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, my friends, um, well, they were treating me.
R:   Uh-huh?
L:  So, I ordered something that I thought I was going -- just get one of those um, oh, deals, you know, where there's a rolled up tortilla and a bunch of stuff in it, you know, and I thought that was what I was ordering.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  My goodness, when they brought my food, they had big plates.  I mean, I --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- had tortillas in one bowl.  I had um, fried rice and beans and then they served this dish.  I mean, it was a heated dish and it had chicken strips, beef strips.  [LAUGH].
R:  Kind of like fajitas?
L:  Um, I could not believe it.  I looked at my friend, you know, that was paying.  I said, "I -- why didn't you tell me?  I didn't know they served all this".  You know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, talk about a meal.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I said next time I will know better.  [LAUGH].
R:  Usually like for Mexican --
L:  Like their dinner, you know?  Just a little bit of rice and --
R:  Yeah.  Usually with Mexican food, I hear that it is usually best served, like, in restaurants.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, 'cause the fast food out here -- like, Mexican wise, is not as -- not as good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And here the waiters, um, they take up the bill themselves.  You know, they have their little black, uh, deal they put down with the bill on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they actually pick up the money themselves.  You don't have to go through the cashier or anything.  They take care of all of it.
R:  Yeah, I know.  That -- I mean, that's a great thing.  You just, like, give them money or credit card --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they take care of it for you, so -- [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].  So, anyways, it was real good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my friend --
R:  And --
L:  -- had an enchilada and -- and it was just a regular one, but it was a real big one, and it looked real good too.
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah, I hear they have this, uh, nice, um, hamburger restaurant where, um, all you basically pay for is, like, the meat?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You pay kind of -- you could either get it by the quarter pound, half pound, three quarters or a full pound.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh?  Uh-huh.  
R:  And you just basically tell them how you want your meat and they'll cook it and then there's, like, a little salad bar where they have like all lettuce, onions and you just stack it up however you want.  [LAUGH]. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  And -- and that's great, you know, 'cause you just put in your own toppings and they have all kinds of um, relish, mustard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you name it, it's there, so.  [LAUGH].
L:  All the extras.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's great.  I mean, I always like going there.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, and they're not badly priced too, so.
L:  Well, you get your meat and you get your vegetables, you know, and lettuce or whatever.
R:  Oh, yeah, and uh, and all the lettuce and tomatoes, they're, like, nicely fresh and cut.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That same day, so I mean, it's -- it's pretty good food right there.
L:  My daughter likes chicken fried steak, so most of the time when we -- when the two of us go out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, she has the chicken fried steak.  She's crazy about that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  With -- you know, with some -- like, white gravy and her baked potato.  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  She's kind of a stickler on that.  She kind of likes that real well.
R:  Yeah.  Out here, I mean --
L:  Some --little sour cream on top, you know, and that'll satisfy her.
R:  Yeah, they have this place out here where, uh, they --
