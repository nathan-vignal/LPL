L:  Hi this is [inaudible]
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, hi this is [inaudible]
R:  Hi this is Shelley. 
L:  Hi, um, I actually did not quite catch what that saying was that we were supposed to comment on. 
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't either, something about a cold, but I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it had to do with, um, getting sick when the seasons change. 
L:  Right -- right and said something about you know if the cold lasts for seven days will you go to the doctor or you don't. 
R:  Right.  That's -- that's about what I heard.  Don't worry about the whole thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep -- anyway I mean in fact the seasons just changed here in Washington and, uh, -- 
R:  You're in Washington? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Rochester, New York. 
L:  Okay so I -- I guess you're still having winter? 
R:  Um, actually it's -- well the winter weather has gone about, um, a week ago I'd say, so we're -- we're in the mid, um, -- mid to upper sixties today -- plus it's been like spring for the last week.  How about there? 
L:  [inaudible] It's actually been wonderful since yesterday.  I was, uh, -- the weather was pretty bad on Saturday, and, uh, I think I got out of the rain a little bit and managed to get some water on my head and perhaps a little into my head because I've been having, um, a cold and some, um, headaches because of this weather change.  Um, -- I'm sorry. 
R:  I [inaudible] and I don't seem too effected by the -- the season changes -- I get -- I did, um, -- I get a little bit of a nose bleed every now and then, and that sure gets because of the season changing or just the days only get dry weather, cause I get them pretty much in any season.  But, um, I notice -- I'm a schoolteacher -- I notice a lot of my students, um, having been out the last week or so.  A lot of absenteeism which could be because of the weather.  A lot of colds going on. 
L:  Well if you're a school teacher then you also come into contact with a lot of children who are probably tend to be more sick of each other than, uh, most of the office environment.  So I guess that there is a higher chance that you actually -- I mean even if there was a small increase probability that you know changes in weather make people sicker that they normally are. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Place like a school probably amplifies that -- amplifies that a lot.  Where as in an office space you probably get a little bit more, um, sort of isolation from each other because you -- you normally not out in the field playing soccer, stuff like that.  So I wonder maybe if -- when -- when -- when seasons change is it -- is it that you see a huge number of students being sick at school or --
R:  Um, it -- it seems like it -- I -- I've noticed it more in the last week than it's been may been maybe since Christmas time.  So, it's hard to tell, um, -- it's -- I teach High School too, so it's harder to tell if the -- you know the absenteeism is because of illness or because when the season  when it gets nicer weather out we have a lot more truancies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A lot of kids -- a lot of kids just, uh, like to be any place other than school so it -- could be somewhat you know, related to that too it's rely hard to say. 
L:  Well I see -- I didn't actually go through the, uh, High School or -- or the Pre High School system in the US. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So --
R:  Oh where did you go? 
L:  I -- I went to school in India. 
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] 
L:  And so -- how is it here -- so if people are sick they -- they just don't show up at school but they don't have to bring in letters from the doctor or -- 
R:  Um, they do -- well usually -- usually just a parents, um, note is enough, but if it's going to be any kind of extended illness where um, the student's going to need help, uh, like tutoring outside of school, then it would have to come from a doctor in order to get the tutoring.  But if they are just out for a day or two -- actually even up to a week sometimes when the flu season comes, then just a parents note is enough to, um, to give them excused absences. 
L:  I see and if the parents are planning a big family picnic, then it works fine. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Well so -- so wh- what do you teach at school -- I guess I don't know if we're supposed to stick to the conversation. 
R:  Yeah I don't know, I was wondering that myself.  Um, --
L:  And --
R:  -- I'm a special education teacher and I -- I teach, uh, -- I teach kids that, um, have a lot of emotional and behavioral difficulties and so they're in a very small class size with a high teacher to student ratio.  We -- we have no more than six students in our classroom at a time. 
L:  Wow.
R:  So they're very -- it's kids that need a lot of um, intensive behaviour support, and supervision, um, and it's just that kind of thing to get through their school day.  Some of them have learning disabilities but it's more, um, these tend to be kids more emotional and behavioral problems -- a lot of them are coming out of jail, either juvenile justice system, and they're on probation or they're um, at risk of getting involved with um, the law again -- so basically we're just there to give them a lot of supervision and behaviour support. 
L:  So do these programs -- I mean is there a track record of these programs actually make a big difference -- I mean do you actually see people become functioning members of society or -- or is this -- 
R:  Um, yeah we see -- I say we see about half of the kids [COUGH] [inaudible] and others getting returned back to the, um, the juvenile system and then eventually the adult system, um, so at -- at -- at this point it's the working for about half the kids I would say. 
L:  Yeah surprising too -- I actually do speak recognition -- I'm one of these people who's going to use this data that is coming out of this collection, and I have no clue whether I'm supposed to stick to the topic and I was just wondering that the instructions needs to be probably a little bit more explicit from -- from NBC. 
R:  Before the -- before the call? 
L:   Yeah, uh, that you know whether they are expecting people to stick strictly to the topic or, uh, -- because basically what is going to be done is this -- this data is going to be used to test different research sites that are working to develop, um, speech recognition programs. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And, um, and so one of the things that, uh, you know automatic speech recognizes find very hard to do is -- is recognize conversation speech because just like we've been doing in the past seven or eight minutes there's a huge variety of topic and people will skip from topic to topic. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And so it's very hard and, uh, because these recognizers use emotional language that's very primitive, uh, it's very hard for these recognisers to automatically adjust to changes in language, ah, -- yeah -- changes in topic. 
R:  I wonder if that's part of what they're looking for though, cause I -- I know on the website it said it was, um, study of linguistics and, um, something related to language so I would think that may be there was concern about the topics and about how people, um, are discussing that topic, and you know whether and wonder if they are looking at things like how they stick to the topic or go off on tangents. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  From that topic. 
L:  H- how did you actually end up going to this website and finding out about [inaudible]?
R:  Um, I typed in -- I did a search that said page research study --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- cause I'm always looking -- I'm always looking, um, -- being a teacher I'm always looking for extra money over the summer. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, this is just one of the first things that came up on the search and I clicked it on and kept reading and it -- and the more I read the more it sounded pretty interesting so -- 
L:  I see that's [inaudible] we get on email from, uh, NBC [inaudible] you know the data collection they're putting on and being part of that group that does research with this stuff -- it's -- I have an [inaudible] interest in joining these conversation -- you know how awkward it might be just to actually sustain, uh, I mean sort of strange actually you know get connected to someone and -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  H- have to talk about a particular topic which [inaudible] the two people might be really interested in.  And one would be asked like you know [inaudible] and how often is one sick.  It's a very strange thing so -- so we try to participate to get the data collection going. 
R:  Yeah and I -- well I, um, -- I thought the same thing too that it just sounded interesting, I mean of all of the different things that I saw on the screen last night this -- seemed like one of the more interesting things just to have a random conversation on a -- on a you know whatever topic with a -- with somebody you haven't discussed it with.  I thought it was pretty interesting. 
L:  Well it is -- it is in fact, uh, I think you would find it even more interesting to actually review the conversations that people
