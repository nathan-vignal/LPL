R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, I'm Jenna.
R:  Fiona, I'm Dee.
L:  Hi.  Ah, so how do you feel when the, uh, seasons change, ah ...?
R:  Well, I'm from Michigan.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm from the east coast, from New York.
R:  Oh.  Well, you get the seasons change then too, don't ya?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm -- it doesn't really affect me too bad.  I guess I'm just used to it after living here so long.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have allergies [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  Yeah, so it definitely affects me, ah --
R:  Outdoor allergies?
L:  Yeah.  Outdoor allergies.
R:  Oh.
L:  With the -- like the ragweed and the pollen and that kind of thing.
R:  Do you take medication?
L:  Yeah, I do.  I take Claratyne.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Which --
R:  Yeah.  My roommate has allergies too.  I think he does Aflonase[?].
L:  Yeah.  Well, Claratyne actually -- it used to be you had a get a prescription, but now you can get it, um, from the, uh, drugstore directly --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- over the counter.  But, uh, yeah, I have -- I find that when it gets to be, ah, like the beginning of fall to, um, to winter --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- until about like, November, my allergies really kick in and I really start to like, have a runny nose and eyes tearing and red and that kind of thing, so I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to usually take medicine for that.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess I'm lucky.  I -- I don't really have any allergies.  I get, you know, oh, right about springtime I'll get a little cold in the change of the weather, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Sometimes you just get a little sniffle or something like that, but then the weather stays warm and it goes away.  [SIGH]  But I don't really have any allergies.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think everybody gets that.  I mean I also get that, like a -- a little spring cold that comes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from the change of seasons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think maybe it comes from, you know, not being used to what the weather is.  'Cause right now, um, where I am, the weather is -- is really [LAUGH] out of whack 'cause, of, you know, just becoming spring now, so some days, like today it's going to be like, eighty two and some --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  A couple weeks ago, it was like thirty two, you know [LAUGH].  It's like you don't know what the weather's going to be so you don't know how to dress.
R:  Yeah, it's a little chillier here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's only about, ah, in the fifties today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the sun is shining. 
L:  That's good [LAUGH].
R:  Not a cloud in the sky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's still got a little chill to it.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But, um, I mean in New York, the weather is kind of unpredictable.  Like one day, I was out and it was sunny and I felt like I was like, I was getting a tan and then like, you know, a half hour later it was freezing and shivering.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So you don't -- you don't know how to dress and, you know, that -- that can make a cold come on, you know, 'cause --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you catch -- catch a cold from the cold weather when you dress lightly so ...
R:  Yeah.  The change in the clothes things, that -- that always gets me, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  I hate putting on all the winter stuff, but then when spring rolls around and I'm like it gets -- it's hard for me to get used to the shorts and stuff all over again, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know why that is.  It's so much easier not to have to wear a coat and boots and, you know.  Gloves and a hat and scarf and warm up your car for ten, twenty minutes, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, ah, yeah, but the -- ah, well, the weather, I don't know how it is where you are, but the weather here is a little crazy.  Like, in April, we actually had a snowstorm, which is --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, which is a little, is a little rare [LAUGH] for April, you know.
R:  Yeah.  We had an ice storm.
L:  In April?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, oh, no, that's, ah, no, March.  In March.  Last month we had it.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  Brought down tree branches and people went without power.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The ice storm -- didn't you guys get it?
L:  Um, we might have.  I don't remember too well.  Maybe.  I think we did.
R:  It -- it was really cool, though, 'cause when you -- it wasn't cool for driving, but when you looked outside, every single branch had a ice coating.  You know, it kind a looked like everything was almost invisible because everything glared.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, it was like a ice coating over everything.
L:  Mhm
R:  You know, it was kind a neat [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean I, ah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  A friend of mine actually took pictures once of when there was ice on the trees and it -- it looks very -- it looks very pretty, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  In a picture [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it's cool looking.  It's not a lot of fun, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it takes down weak tree branches and weak, um, electrical wires and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  People were without electricity.  Mostly the east side of Grande Rapids -- I live in Grand Rapids -- was -- was out.  We didn't get it, thank God, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause those people that lost -- lost electricity and stuff, they had to go all weekend.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Without it [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.  Do the -- are the winters like very severe where you are or are they not so bad?
R:  They -- they fluctuate.  Um, I'd say the past three years have been really mild.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, so far as winter goes.  Not a whole lotta, you know, heavy snow banks and stuff like that.  It did come and it'd melt and come and melt and then, you know, we'd get five to ten inches and that would be pretty much it all winter.  But we've had some winters, you know, you just get snowed in.
L:  Mm.
R:  But we haven't had a -- we haven't had a bad winter like that probably in since the seventies.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, see, here in New York, we had --
R:  Yay for global warming, huh?
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This whole global warming thing, this is changing everything.  But, ah, for a couple, I mean, for a couple seasons in New York, we had pretty mild, ah, winters and all of a sudden this winter we got like, you know, the big s- -- we got like one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the biggest snowstorms ever and --
R:  Yeah, I remember, I remember hearing about it on TV.
L:  Yeah.  So I guess we were -- we were due for a bad, ah, winter but --
R:  That's what I figured.  I figured we were gonna get a bad one too, but we didn't.
L:  Yeah.  It's just like -- it was like the winter that didn't wanna leave, you know, 'til it becomes -- then -- then it's like, it's thirty and then the next day all of a sudden it's summer, it's like, ninety, you know.  That's, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of like what it is in New York.  Like one day, all of sudden, out of nowhere, summer's come and we usually have a very short springtime.  It's not a long springtime.
R:  Yeah, us too.
L:  Usually a month.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess that it's similar.  I think, ah, it's similar where you are to New York.  It's kind of a similar --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- climate, so ... but, ah, yeah.  So, um, that's -- though, I mean, we have four sea- --you know, just like everyone, you know, we have four seasons, but it just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the winters always seem really long and the spring is really short and the summer's really short and it seems --
R:  You know when I was a kid, it seemed like winter lasted forever and now that I'm older -- I'm forty three --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but now that I'm older, it's just like, it just slides by.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  It's just a few months and before you know it, it's gone.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  And I'm like, I like this getting old thing, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I guess it's different when you're a kid.  It's, ah, feels like it's longer.
R:  Yeah.  Time lasts a lot longer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when you have to wait an hour, it seems like two days.  You know, now an hour is like a second.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The only thing is like -- like, you know when you're younger, you sometimes you appreciate the winter 'cause, you know, they close the schools [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's the only good thing I -- you know, you kind of like having a snow day and get to play in the snow.
R:  That's the favorite part of winter, getting out of school.
L:  Yeah, I mean for the kids, you know, they play in the snow and that kind of thing, but for the adults, it's a hassle having to clean off cars and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That makes it kind of, ah, a hassle and, ah, we had a lot of rain here too, it seems like.
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  To me, it seems like every -- every weekend it was always -- they always predict rain here and, you know, I mean --
R:  And also --
L:  I'm sure it's worse than like, I -- I think Chicago probably has a worse winter than New York, but it always feels like New York has some of the worst winters, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some -- like, the most chilly and hard to bear winters, but also I -- you know, in -- we had like some pretty bad snowstorms in the seventies and somehow the seventies, I guess, was a bad time for a snowstorms everywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had pretty bad snowstorms but, ah --
R:  Yeah, I think it was seventy seven or seventy eight when we had our last bad one.  I remember it 'cause I couldn't get the front door open.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I did, it was like, knee high, you know.  I'm five four so that's not real tall, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was knee high and then we had to get down to the corner store 'cause we had a two year old baby.  My sister -- my nephew, he was only two, so we had a get milk and stuff, milk and bread, stuff like that.  And I had a walk down to the store and there was no, no snowplows out or anything.  So I thought, "Well, I'll walk in the middle of the street".  I got to the middle of the street, it was all the way up to my thighs.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I had to walk -- the store was a half a block up.  I had a walk through the snow like that.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, and then at the other end of the block where the liquor store was -- we needed, you know, some beer, 'cause we were gonna be in there for a couple days.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was a couple a -- two or three days before the snowplows --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- got all the streets clear.  People's cars were completely covered.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, all you could see was the top.
L:  Unbelievable, wow.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean we had something similar.  We had -- like,  I remember the blizzard of ninety six.  It was this big, ah, this big blizzard here that like the drifts were like, a foot high and --
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, that kinda thing, and, ah --
R:  Jump off your roof into the drift?
L:  Yeah.  It just was, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- also it was like -- it felt like it came up to my, to my hip, the snow and, um, also like, you know, five feet four and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just felt like it came up so high and --
R:  Uh-uh.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, it was -- I mean at least the only good thing is I didn't have to go -- I mean I was in college at that time, but I didn't have to go to -- I didn't have to go to school 'cause it was during an intercession, so thank God --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- 'cause it would have been really hard to get to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- school and people were staying home and it was just, ah, it was just, ah, really, really hard.  But, ah, yeah, this was -- this was pretty bad, the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- snowstorm that we had, that we recently had this year in April.  It was also hard to walk through and get through and, ah, [SIGH] it was very difficult.  A lot of people, you know, get hurt, you know, in a snowstorm.  People have to shovel and they get heart attacks and, you know, it can --
R:  So --
L:  -- be very, very treacherous, the snow, ah, snow situation.
R:  So where's your -- where's your allergies?  Have you had them, like, since you were a kid?
L:  Ah, no.  Actually, my allergies came about when I, ah, was like, a teenager.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Or started to become a teenager, I noticed that they were -- they started and, ah, yeah.  I've had them -- I mean, they vary from year to year.  I guess the ragweed and the pollen count and --
R:  Yeah.
R: That varies from year to year so that affects -- some ye-- some years it's not that bad and some years it's very bad, so --
R:  So have you tried a bunch a different allergy medicines?
L:  Yeah.  I try basically Claratyne and Allegra --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And, ah, I find Claratyne, Claratyne works pretty well, ah --
R:  Does that work on pet dander too?
L:  I don't know.  I don't have pets, so I don't know, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, I don't think I'm allergic to pets, so --
R:  Hm.
L:  But I mean it works well for my particular allergies.  It's very -- it's also a very easy pill to take.  It's the most -- one of the most tiniest pills I've ever seen.
R:  Yeah.  I've seen the commercial, when a guy shows it, uh, shows the pill.
L:  Yeah, it's very -- if you have trouble taking pills, it's very easy to take and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also, once you take it, it lasts for the entire day.  It's a twenty four hour pill.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So you only have to take it once, which is good.
R:  Does it relieve all your symptoms, your itchy and runny nose and itchy eyes and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it works pretty well.  You know, I mean --
R:  Is it expensive?
L:  It is expensive.  That's the thing.  It's about a dollar or two dollars a pill, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You see, the best medicine costs a fortune.  You gotta be rich.
L:  Yeah, that's the problem, yeah.
