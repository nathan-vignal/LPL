R:  Hi, I'm Pauline Smith.
L:  Hi --
R:  So --
L:  -- I'm Dee [LAUGH].
R:  Nice to meet you over the phone [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I think the changing of the seasons is a good thing.  Um, some people do get sick, but I think if they put their mind to thinking of the prettiness of the spring [SIGH] and some other things, that that kinda -- kinda counteracts the feeling of illness.
L:  I think I lot of it is mental, when people get sick when the seasons change.  Because a lot of it is due to, um, the typical saying of, um, is it winter blues?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And everybody and their mom gets depressed in the winter.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  [inaudible] the time.
R:  I think that too, and I think sometimes if you can get involved into like a [SIGH] -- a reading group or, ah, a group of people where you can go out and coffee with, you know, and just get away from the house for a little while, that kinda helps.
L:  I think a lot of it is just not dressing for the weather.
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, and some things like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think a person just doesn't like to give up the nice weather in -- in a lot of respect to that and -- and some of em [SIGH] might not have the heavier clothes and stuff for the colder climates.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  But there are a lot of factors that filter in there, you know, and if you watch a lot of TV and stuff, sometimes that gets depression -- depressing too and people that stay in a lot during the winter and cold months, do do that.
L:  There isn't really much ha- many happy things on TV nowadays.
R:  Yeah, that's true. That's true.  But there again, mindset, you know, w- plays a lot into it and -- and, ah, sometimes if you have grandchildren or people come over when the weather's cold and stuff and you can't get out, you know, that'd lift a person's spirits.
L:  Yes.
R:  And then we come into the spring and there's such beautiful flowers and stuff coming up in April and -- and May and -- and I don't know.  It just kinda puts a whole new glow to the world, you know.  Just gives everybody a -- a uplifting.
L:  I think when the spring comes there's a prerequisite where you just have to get out of your house.
R:  That's true.  I think that's called spring fever.
L:  And calls you and they're like, "It's so nice out.  Have you been outside?"  Mhm.  And you're compelled to go out.
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  After then.
R:  Even in the early mornings and stuff and the birds sing and stuff when you have your windows open or you go outside and you first get greeted by that fresh smell, you know, especially after a nice spring rain ... which is what we could use right now, 'cause we're dry.
L:  Could use a lot more -- I sorta think it was raining about --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- twenty minutes ago.
R:  Yeah?  Oh, the -- it's just lovely.  The daffodils are all in bloom and -- and the birds sing and the -- ah, fruit trees and stuff are starting to put on their -- their buds so that they can [SIGH] later produce the fruit, so it's a fun time of year.
L:  [NOISE] It's -- it's -- people just naturally become happier.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause a lot of the things that just, um, springtime, you know, the sun's out long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everything's in bloom, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Less cloudy days --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it's not only being out in better weather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but just being out it doesn't look so gloomy out.
R:  Yes.  And then with the summer comes all the kids and -- and their, ah, anxious to go out and swim and -- and I know my husband loves to fish so he waits for the summer to come and the warm weather and [SIGH] it's just -- just fun to be out and about during that time.  A lot of picnics and stuff go on and --
L:  Yeah, 'cause summer's only really the best -- the best season to barbeque.
R:  That's true.
L:  Except for early fall.
R:  Yeah.  Fall's good too because I know when -- then comes the pretty leaves and stuff and we have a lot of our nice sixty and seventy degree weather comes anywhere from September through October and sometimes into mid November where I'm at.
L:  Well, if we're lucky, it'll stretch for the la- -- for the first week or so of the summer.
R:  Oh, that'd be nice, yeah.  We didn't have a lot of snow here for last winter, so we're dry but, you know, the winters, they change so much and so often.  One winter we'll have [SIGH] quite a bit of snow and the next winter we'll have hardly any and it's just weird sometimes the way the seasons go.
L:  Oh, we actually had a pretty fair amount of snow.  It just came later on in the winter.
R:  Yeah.  December here was good this past year.  It seemed like we didn't have most of our snow or our real cold weather, even until about mid January and then it lasted up until mid March [SIGH].
L:  How it was here.  It didn't really get start to warm up here until last week.
R:  Yeah?  Well, it's been a little warmer last week here than what it's been this week, but then -- there again, you know, it's just that it changes so fast sometimes in different parts of the world that -- temperature wise, you know.  One day we'll be up in the seventies and eighties and the next day we'll be down forty and fifty and that's quite a change.
L:  That's a change.
R:  Yeah, a person's body temperature doesn't change that fast and then people get sick. [PAUSE]
L:  I think some of it might also be, like, the way people eat too.
R:  That's true.  I know I find that we do a lot of snacking and stuff and that's not healthy for a person.
L:  No.
R:  And then you get out and you get your fresh stuff out of your gardens and stuff and that -- that always tastes good and makes you think more about the spring and what all you could be doing in raising, you know, to eat a little healthier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm, hm, hm, I know this year, we're planning on putting in some, ah, radishes and carrots and, um, potatoes and onions and peas and I don't think we're going to do tomatoes.  They both too acidy for us.
L:  Hm.
R:  Hm, hm [MN] ... well, it's cloudy up here now.  It looks like it's gonna start raining.
L:  Been a little cloudy out here for the last hour or so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rain again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Supposed to get thunderstorms.
R:  Yeah?  I see some of the farmers are rushing around to get their crops in, they're cro- planting corn here now, [MN].
L:  I see squirrels.
R:  Yeah?  But I think with every changing of the season that there is something, you know, good to be said about -- about each -- each season, you know.  Fall has it's beautiful colors with the trees and everything and -- and then winter has the snow and it just makes it seem so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- serene, you know, and -- and just so quiet.
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.
R:  Mm, and spring is full of life and -- and vigor and -- and then summer, you know, we always get out there and we get hot and get sunburned and -- but it's fun. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, certain seasons compel you to socialize more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I do think that's a difference in the world today too.  It's -- you know, people don't neighbor like they used to years ago.
L:  No, they don't.
R:  [MN] And I know a lot of it is fear and -- and, you know, the changes and stuff, but [SIGH], um, I've been trying to get a few [SIGH] plants started up here and -- and to put out, so ...  [MN] Are you from Iowa?
L:  No, I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, I'm from Iowa [LAUGH].  
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  That's quite -- quite nice, you know.  Ah, it's nice.  Do you -- you guys had a lot of snow this last winter.
L:  Yeah, we had three weeks of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it snowed here for three days straight.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Haven't --
R:  Oh, we --
L:  -- had that much snow since ninety six.
R:  Yeah.  Even the animals and stuff I think enjoy spring and -- and summer and fall a lot better than they do winter, especially if they have to stay out [SIGH].
L:  Definitely.
R:  The outside animals, so, hm.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  And I think it's hard on the farmers if they're have to go out and milk and -- and -- and slop hogs and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I grew up on a farm but I know -- I know a lot of 'em have gone more to just cattle and -- and, ah, grain farms now than what they used to, doing a whole lot of every kind of farming.
L:  Probably just not as, ah, [inaudible] wise.  Probably not as good any more.
R:  Yeah, it could be.  But I'm sure, you know, the -- the seasons, the changing of the seasons affects that, too. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Especially when you don't have pretty stable weather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This year's weather's been really unstable.
R:  Mhm.  Iowa's weather's been weird.  Well, unstable's a good word for it, but I call it weird, for the last, I don't know, four or five years.  It seems like nothing's been the norm [SIGH] from what I can remember, you know.
L:  Yes.  I mean, last winter had a ton of snow.  The winter before that, I don't think -- it didn't get cold until the last week of February.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then it started to warm up again in March so we didn't really have a winter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Had a big drought.
R:  Yeah, and I noticed, ah, the difference with the spring this year from last year is last year all my tulips and stuff were in bloom in March and this year, now they're just starting to bloom and here we are close to the end of April [SIGH], you know.  And it's just -- and they're not as tall.  They're -- they're short.  I think that's because of the dryness.
L:  Yes.  That probably has a lot to do with it too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Do you raise flowers?
L:  I wish I had room in the garden.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah? I didn't for years and years 'cause we gardened, but now the kids are all grown and away from home, so I do the flowers, hm, and just a little bit of gardening.
