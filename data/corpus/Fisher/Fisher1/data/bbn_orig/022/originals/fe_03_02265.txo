R:  Hi --
L:  Hi --
R:  -- I'm Freda.
L:  Hi, I'm Carolyn.  How are you [SIGH]?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good [SIGH].
R:  Good, Carolyn.
L:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about illness, huh?
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Um, let's see.  Ah, are you sick or are you well?
R:  Well, I'm well right now.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  I am too.
R:  Good.  Um, I have, um, I do have some arthritis problems.  I do have rheumatoid arthritis.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but right now, I'm fairly healthy.  Um, when I lived up north, 'cause I'm Florida now, I did have problems with, um, asthma and allergies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So when the seasons changed, I did have, you know, the problems with the colds and --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- flus.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Did you ever deal with anything like that?
L:  Ah, every year, I -- I usually have a cold [SIGH] where my nose is stuffed up for what seems like from November to May.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I just have terrible sinuses.  Ah, this year I did -- I had, you know, sinuses, but they didn't ever get the full blown flu.
R:  Okay.
L:  Or -- or, ah, a really -- a big, bad cold.  I would say --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- with the work through the --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- through the winter [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, I had sinus troubles really bad, too.  Um, for a while there, they got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so bad I ended up having, um, two sinus surgeries.
L:  Oh, you had surgeries for sinus problems?
R:  Right.  Because, um, I thought what I had for the longest time was just a really bad cold.  The coughing was so bad and, um, the doctors kept prescribing, you know, an, ah, um, antibiotics and all that kind of stuff.  It would never go away, never get any better, and finally they did, um, the full body scan and found out that I had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, sinuses so badly so I had to have reconstructive surgery.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, and ever since that was done --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- then I would get sinus infections, um, but there was really nothing I could do to stop the sinuses or the sinusitis from happening because there's nothing you could take to stop it.
L:  So do you still get sinus infections or not?
R:  No, not now.  Um --
L:  But because of this surgery or because you moved to Florida?
R:  I think because of the surgeries.  Mostly they reconstructed my sinuses --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then I was able to properly drain, so if I did have, um, if my allergies were acting up, you know, from the pollen would get in the air or if I'd catch a cold or whatever, meant I could drain properly so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I didn't get the sinus infections.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] Well, my son just, um -- excuse me a minute.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Somebody's at the [NOISE] -- at the door and I --
R:  Okay.
L:  Wes, I can't talk right now.  Can I talk to you in a few minutes?  Thank you.  Um, my son went to, ah, the hospital for -- to get stitches.
R:  Right.
L:  And they -- they did a CAT scan while he was there and then they said, um, you know, his eye was fine where he had a cut, but they said his sinuses were terrible and they gave him some Flonaze[?], which is a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- steroid thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he starts taking that and he's been so much better.
R:  Better, yeah.
L:  Since he --
R:  That's --
L:  -- started taking that.
R:  good stuff.
L:  He didn't, um -- you know, we didn't know that he needed that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he's had -- just has a really runny nose and cough symptoms and cold all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- winter.
R:  Yeah.  Whenever you find that, um, if you get this really bad cough and a cough just lasts and lasts, it tends to be from a postnasal drip.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I never realised that until I started having my sinus problems.  So I -- whenever my kids get a real bad cough, I always tell 'em first off, "Start blowing your nose, you know, blow your nose, blow your nose" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- or, "Suck on like a hard piece of candy --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that'll stop the irritation.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And, um, that always seems to help and, ah, will keep the sinus infection from coming on.  And that Flonaze is really good stuff and it's better to do the steroid that way, versus taking it orally --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or through injections.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause flare up is so bad for you otherwise.
L:  I find it's that if I feel like I'm getting a cold, I just have to make sure I get, ah, extra sleep.
R:  Extra sleep, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And that makes -- if I can possibly do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That -- that makes a big difference is --
R:  It does.  It does.
L:  Being able to at least one day a week sleep in --
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  -- and really get the rest that my body seems --
R:  It does.
L:  -- to need.
R:  That was a lot --
L:  But you can't always --
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  do that [LAUGH].
R:  -- I know.  I know.  I find if I can drink some hot tea, um, and get the rest, like you said, that, um, that will help and sometimes a Tylenol for the aches.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, something like that will help, um, because the cold will make you so miserable, the aches and pains from it, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I don't usually take Tylenol.
R:  Okay.
L:  I usually take ibuprofen instead.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I guess because it does -- it also takes, ah, reduces some inflammation.
R:  Exactly.  See, I can't take Ibuprofen 'cause I'm allergic to it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It brings on my asthma.
L:  Well, good reason not to take it, then.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I used to li -- I used to love that stuff but then I'd take it and I'd start wheezing.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so then the doctors told me that I was allergic to it and I was like, "Okay, well, that'll tell and I'll do that" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, um, you're right that Advil or -- or Motris[?], stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it does.  It does works a lot.  To me, it does work better than the Tylenol.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And it lasts longer --
L:  Yeah, it definitely does.
R:  -- because of that anti inflammatory that's in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, ah, unfortunately I can't take it.
L:  Do you ever try --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- echinacea?
R:  No.
L:  I --
R:  That good?
L:  -- I -- I tried it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't really vouch for it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and say that it really works.
R:  Right.
L:  My mom thinks it works wonders and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she takes it in pill form.
R:  Okay.
L:  I have echinacea tea and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- drink it sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know drinking tea is good when I have sort of a scratchy throat, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know if it really [LAUGH] does anything to prevent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the colds or not.
R:  Okay.  Now, the echinacea, that's like you get the health food, where you take it in tablet form or something?
L:  I guess that's where you'd get it in the pill form.  J- in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the grocery store, they just have it in tea boxes.
R:  Okay, oaky.
L:  I mean boxes like regular tea.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'll have to try that in a tea form then because, um, I've had heard somebody else mention that that's good, um, but I had never tried it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I thought I'd give that a try, because, um, you know, 'cause with -- here in Florida now, we're gonna be starting the rainy season pretty soon.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, you know, we'll test -- you know, a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- couple of -- of those summer or springtime colds.
L:  So do you really have --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- kind of like tropical seasons, like the rainy season and a dry season?
R:  Um, not -- we don't get too much dry.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Um, you know, we'll get the real rainy and I guess it's kinda a dry, ah -- but it's humid.  You know, we get really hot and humid.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I guess the lawn probably considers it dry.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but your body doesn't [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Because it's so humid.  Um, but I'm in south Florida so it's like hot, hot --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- hot --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- you know?  Hot and humid all the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but yes, we're getting ready to start that, ah, the rainy season.  We had a couple days just past with it, so it's like dark and gloomy and rainy and so you could feel your nose wanted you to sniff --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [inaudible] so you could feel the cold kinda want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to come on.  And, um, but --
L:  We just had started to have good weather.  We've had cold and rainy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and cold and rainy and kinda miserable.  And finally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're having good weather and --
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, that's where we moved from.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Small world.
L:  So, I feel like, you know, the cold season is past --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and now that we've --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- reached the spring weather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we should be able to stay healthy --
R:  Stay, mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, not have any more colds come attacking --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- us until next fall [LAUGH].
R:  That's right.  That's right.  So, um, yeah, so, but, um, do you do anything in particular to try to stay healthy and away from the colds?  I guess the echinacea, vitamin C., stuff like that?
L:  Um --
R:  Do you do vitamins?
L:  Well, I -- yeah, I do -- sometimes take vitamins.  I have vitamin C.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I used to take a lot of vitamin C. --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I took the chewable kind and it can hurt your -- the enamel in your teeth.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I take, um, I try to drink orange juice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and eat fruits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I try to have a really healthy diet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, sleep is the other thing that I -- I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  You know, see, I'm --
L:  -- to stay healthy.
R:  -- not a big vegetable eater, but I do do the fruits and I try to do the orange juice, like you said.  And, um, I'd, um, I'd buy the vitamins but then I forget to take 'em.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I'm one of those how I have the jar sitting in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the [inaudible] [LAUGH] and I feel like, "Oh, man, I forgot to take 'em", so I need to do better with that.  Um, I -- I've never done the chewables or anything.  Um --
L:  Um, my --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- kids both the chewable vitamin Cs --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um you know, when they start to sniff or -- or cough --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just say, "Here take one --"
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- with breakfast" and, you know, they -- they like it.  It's kind of like candy so --"
R:  Right.  Yeah, well, we have our kids --
L:  Really good.
R:  -- on the gummy vitamins.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they really love those and I have to remind them, "It's not candy, you know --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- you're just getting one a day".
L:  Right, yeah. Well --
R:  So they get they're -- they've got this -- they're starting doing their gummy ones and then I would be fine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I end up on -- with the rheumatoid arthritis and stuff, I'm on so much medication to try and keep that in remission --
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  -- I got to take all of that [NOISE] I forget [NOISE].
L:  What's that noise?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Ah --
R:  Roger?  Hey, Roger.  I'm on the phone.  Yeah, you guys have to get off.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, okay, it's not --
R:  Hang up.
L:  -- our ten minutes yet [LAUGH].
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  I thought maybe it was the ten minutes to go.
R:  I know.  It's my kids.  They just pick up and start dialing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he has his own line in his room.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I guess they don't wanna hear that on the recording.
L:  Well, right, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, um, let's see.  Oh, yes.  So with all that that I'm on, I always tend to forget my vitamins.  I guess I need to do
