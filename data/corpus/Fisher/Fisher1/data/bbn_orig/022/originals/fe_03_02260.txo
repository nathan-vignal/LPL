R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Joe.
L:  Hello, I'm Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about illness.
R:  I guess so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Um, do you have any initial comments?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I don't get into illness too much.  I, um, I try to avoid it [LAUGH].
L:  Good.  How do you avoid it?
R:  Mostly I ignore it, actually [LAUGH].
L:  They say men tend to do that [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, ah, that's what I've heard.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- I tend to, um, take precautions --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I -- I wash my hands very frequently.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And always before meals and, um, I take vitamin C. when I think I'm getting a cold.
R:  I try and do that when I remember to. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?  Uh-huh.  And, um, if I'm -- if I'm in a closed space like, um, a -- an airport or -- or not an airport but an airplane, I try to, um, take special precautions.  I try to drink a lot before I get on and, um, I always want a front seat rather than a back seat because of the air blowing back by the -- I don't know where you succeed in that.  What other precautions do you take?
R:  Um [SIGH], [NOISE] not very many.  I've just, um ... no, pretty much s- like I said, if something comes up, I just pretty much ignore it until it goes away.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it doesn't always work.  I've had this infection in my chest for about a month now.
L:  Have you?
R:  It's what I keep saying I gotta go to the doctor for.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  I don't --
L:  Well --
R:  -- know where it came from, but ...
L:  Well --
R:  I --
L:  -- I think it's a good idea to go if it's not getting better.  It, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes it j- -- sometimes we tend to get there too soon.
R:  I -- I try and use homeopathic remedies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than going to a medical doctor right away.
L:  Uh-huh.  And what do you -- what do you take?
R:  I -- if -- well, I had a sore throat, ah, a couple months ago.  My brother whipped up some concoction of warm water and lemon juice and chili powder and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, salt and I don't know, I [several inaudible words] --
L:  You know, I don't think that's a bad idea.
R:  And then I gargled with it.
L:  Did it help?
R:  [LAUGH] He said drink it, but I gargled with it and it, yeah, it, it's pretty much cleared it up pretty quick.
L:  They say the old days they used to, um, they used to use salt water all the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But now the chili pepper, ah, they even use that for, ah, arthritic pain, you know, they use it with, um, um --
R:  Yeah, you can get -- get pills at the health food store, the chili powder pills.
L:  Can ya?
R:  And you get -- so you can take them without having to taste it [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  How 'bout that?  I like --
R:  I --
L:  -- the taste of it anyway, though [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I also take -- there's some, um, black cherry pills that I take.
L:  Oh.
R:  That, um, help my feet.  I get --
L:  They do?
R:  My -- my feet ache too much sometimes.  They say it's plantar[?] fasceitis[?] or something.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  But, um, I --
L:  And you take --
R:  -- just take -- I take --
L:  -- black --
R:  -- black cherry pills and that seems to --
L:  -- black cherry pills.
R:  -- fix, fix that.
L:  Do you get them in a health food store?
R:  Uh-huh, I get 'em at GMC.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well that's nice to know.  Well, um, with all this SARS business, ah, I guess it's, ah, an important topic to keep in mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I -- I don't get too frightened about it but I guess, ah, we do have to be on the alert.
R:  Well, my daughter was in China, um --
L:  She was?
R:  -- for six months.  She came home just before that outbreak happened.
L:  Oh?
R:  She was there teaching English, but, um, there was another guy from our town that was there to keep -- teaching English, that died last month.
L:  Ah!  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Ah, it's kind of a scary thing.
L:  Yeah, it sure is.
R:  But they're taking care of it.  I -- they say in Vietnam that it's already come and gone there.  They're not worried about it there anymore and --
L:  That's what --
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  -- I heard recently, yes.
R:  But, ah ...
L:  Well, it's interesting because they say Japan has very few cases and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's probably they think because of their care and, uh, hygiene.  You know, they're very clean and they -- they don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- shake hands [LAUGH].  They bow.  And, ah, they teach the little tiny children -- did ya see that on television?
R:  I -- I didn't.
L:  They -- they had little tiny children, two years old, and they're [NOISE] washing their hands very thoroughly, you know, just automatically.  So it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- wonderful that they teach them that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Good thing.  But then, uh, sometimes people go overboard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with that too and ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  If you --
L:  Obsessive --
R:  -- if you --
L:  -- compulsive.
R:  -- yeah, I think if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you don't have any immunity to anything then you're gonna catch everything that comes by so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it seems like the people that are the most careful are the ones that are gonna catch things.
L:  Sometimes yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I remember a doctor saying that, ah, the -- the -- the, ah, American children are far too clean because they don't develop enough antibodies [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] [MN]
R:  You know, that's -- that can be a problem that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I remember --
R:  But I -- I guess --
L:  -- ah --
R:  -- something in the middle's good, but if you go to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- extreme either way --
L:  That's right.
R:  As in most things.
L:  Ah, that's right.  The moderation is, is a good, ah, choice.  I always remember, um, being in New York on a subway and a little child had a sauced pretzel.  Are you familiar with sauced pretzels?
R:  Yes.
L:  And, ah, he had mustard all over it and he dropped it on the floor and you know [LAUGH] the --
R:  The, ah --
L:  -- floor of a New York subway --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I was sitting right across from him and he reached to get it and I was all ready to jump outta my seat and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just, jeez, his mother never even blinked an eye! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I thought I guess he has more antibodies than I have! [LAUGH]
R:  I guess [LAUGH]. I don't know.  Well, they say there's a -- that ten second rule.  If it isn't on the ground for ten seconds then it's safe, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I don't know, I've seen some floors that I wouldn't pick it up off of [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] No.  But anyway, it's interesting that, um, [LIPSMACK] we, eh, got put into this conversation here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah, this is mine too.
R:  You -- your pers- yeah, I just heard about this couple days ago.
L:  Yeah, it's fun.  Mhm.  But anyway, I hope they learn something from us by answering --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what they're trying to learn, so --
L:  I don't know either.  Maybe the differences in, ah, the, ah, the way we speak.  We're from -- we're from -- whatever we're -- we're from.
R:  All right.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia.  And you?
R:  I'm -- I'm in California.
L:  Oh, my goodness [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout that.
R:  I -- my, ah -- I've got a -- what is it -- my -- my wife's sister, my sister in law --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] is in Philly.
L:  Is that right?  Mhm.  Well, are you from out there all the time?  Are you -- you were --
R:  Ah, um, I live in Utah.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'm back and forth between Utah and California.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think the address I put for this was in Utah [LAUGH].
L:  I don't -- I don't notice any accent, so --
R:  Well, that's because Californians don't have accents.
L:  Yeah?  I don't think you do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But they say that's -- that's the -- because of Hollywood and everything that that's become like the official accent of the --
L:  Oh, it might --
R:  -- country --
L:  -- be.
R:  -- or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How 'bout that.  Well, I hope you, um, are able to, ah, stay well and I hope I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- will too.  I don't know whether they tell us when the ten minutes is up.
R:  They said they would [SIGH].
L:  Oh, did they?
R:  It's probably -- probably getting close.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But, um --
R:  [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH]
L:  -- California should be a healthy place to live with all the sunshine.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, ah, beautiful flowers to keep you upbeat, um, and d- --
R:  Yeah.  And the beach, the oceans, that's the --
L:  Yes.  During the winter, we had a terrible time.  Everybody was getting depressed because it was so --
R:  Wow.  Th- you had a rough winter?
L:  -- cold and dismal, yes.  But --
R:  I try and stay out of Utah in the winter.  It, it --
L:  Oh, do you have it too?
R:  And even -- even there it's -- it's not -- it's not as bad as some places.  It --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But still, it's not, it's not California [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no.  Everybody that goes out there wants to stay there, yeah.
R:  Um, I've been thinking maybe I should go to Australia for the winters.  That'd be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a healthy thing to do.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, anything would be better than Philadelphia this past winter.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We had to [MN] --
R:  I was in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in Maine last summer and, um, it wasn't too bad in the summer, it rained a lot, but -- but they were saying, "You don't wanna be here in the winter" [LAUGH].
L:  How 'bout that.  Yeah, they're -- they're up the too far for my comfort, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Although --
R:  A friend of mine was running for governor there.  I went to help him out.
L:  Oh, that was nice.
R:  He lost.  Came in --
L:  Did he?
R:  -- fourth [LAUGH].
L:  Did he?  Well, at least he tried.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm, that was nice.  Very good.
R:  Well, we're staying -- we're not staying on our topic very well, but --
L:  No, we're not.
R:  We kinda, yeah --
L:  I don't know whether they judge that or not but, at any rate, um --
R:  Yeah, we'll see if they call us back [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] But to get back to our topic, I think the best thing is moderation, as you say, and taking normal precautions for, avoiding contact with, um, others that have colds or whatever.   But I do think if you -- if you, um --
R:  Daily vitamins are good.  I -- I haven't done that like I should, but, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they say that's good for ya.
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  And I've been reading about antioxidants and things and it's supposed to be good for ya.
L:  Yes.
R:  I guess it keeps you from rusting inside.
L:  But --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- I think
