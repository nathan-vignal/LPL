R:  Hi, my name is Tania.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Hi, Tania, my name is Chloe. I'm doing well.  How are you today?
R:  I'm wonderful.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I'm excited that we have such an interesting medium of uh, um, of communication and ah, such an interesting subject matter [LAUGH] to discuss.
L:  Yeah.  Food is a good topic.
R:  Right.  Fabulous.  I actually prefer, um, eating at a restaurant but, um, whenever, um, my family is around, I definitely enjoy eating at home.  So, but ah, definitely the restaurant gig is -- is always --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --always cool.  
L:  I -- I would say enjoy the restaurant more because it's more of a -- it's more entertaining.  It's more of a.-- like, there's a whole ritual that goes involved.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  It -- it's more of an event.
R:  The whole atmosphere, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's wonderful.  So, what is your favorite, ah, favorite menu be, for -- or your favorite cuisine or --?
L:  Well, I -- um, I'm a foodie.  I just -- if something tastes great, I -- I go for it.  I love Indian and Ethiopian.
R:  I hear you.
L:  Middle Eastern.  You know, as long as it's prepared with good ingredients.
R:  Right.
L:  I like it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, I'll eat anything, from like, sushi to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, American.
R:  Very eclectic.  Exactly.  Same here.  I -- I love Mediterranean pretty much.  It's kinda like the top of my list is Mediterranean, then like all sorts of oriental, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I love Thai, Vietnamese.  Just totally dig that.  But, um, other than that, I just, you know, pretty much -- Indian is -- is awesome too, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I love Indian food.  The look of the spices and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- side dishes that go along with it.  I'm not so big on Vietnamese, though.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I think it was just because when I was in college there was a Vietnamese restaurant across from --
R:  So, you're kind of burnt out on that?
L:  -- of -- from it.
R:  [LAUGH]  A little bit, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I just had -- I had too much, though.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  Too much noodle soup.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  But I -- I used to get it every day.
R:  Yeah.  I actually -- you see, I li- I kinda just, um, I don't know.  I just -- I -- I like the, the part that is just a clear, um, I think it's like clear rolls or something like that.  So, I love those things.  Not, not in the soup necessarily, the noodle soup, but kinda you get burnt on that.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, that's kinda cool.  .
L:  Yeah.  They used to have -- well, they have so many varieties.  I don't know, I just kinda ate my way through the whole menu.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, but, um, what about Japanese?  Do you like, like pretty much everything, sushi and -- and all sorts of stuff?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm bigger -- I like sashimi more.
R:  Uh-hum.  
L:  I don't know.  Do you don't -- 
R:  Do you like -- like, California rolls or stuff like that?
L:  California rolls are okay, but there's so much more interesting stuff, when it comes to like --
R:  [LAUGH].  You're right.  Yep, yep.
L:  Yeah.  You get, like, an avocado and that little piece of crab in the California roll, but I like, um, I know it's endangered now, so it's not -- it's not really that great to eat any more, but blue fin tuna?
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.  I love it.
L:  It's like -- it's so smooth and it just melts in your mouth.  I think that's a very important part of food for me, is the texture as well.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I've, um, yeah, discovered the -- the Thai restaurant that serves, um, I think it's the, um, Chilean sea bass and they steam it and it's just so completely out of this world.  It's -- it's terrific.
L:   Oh, yeah.  I know that Chilean sea bass is on the over farmed list and that's a shame because it's such a good fish.
R:  I know.  Yeah, exactly.  But all that stuff, you know, with the mercury these days.  It's kinda like you're -- it's crazy.  You don't know --
L:  Ah
R:  -- what to eat and stuff like that.
L:  Ah, I know.  Fish is supposed to be better for you because it has, like, the better fatty acids and stuff.
R:  Mhm, sure.
L:  But then it -- it takes up all that ocean pollution.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  It becomes just as dangerous as, like --
R:  Yeah, I've been reading --
L:  -- commercially produced fish.  
R:  -- a lot of like Doctor Whyle[?] and all that stuff and so they're kinda just even -- even there saying, like you know, be moderate with like all the mercury consumption that you can get, you know, from all the fish you're gonna eat, so.  But again, you know, salmon.  I -- they -- they still say that salmon and trout are pretty much the best in terms of, like, they're the cleanest.
L:  Because they're farmed and not out in the ocean.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because they are from fisheries, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That makes more sense.
R:  Yeah.  I kinda -- I actually like the taste of catfish, but it's so completely, like, full of steroids and all the crap you really should not ever --
L:  I heard that catfish is really bad for you because they're bottom feeders, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they pick up everything that [LAUGH] on the bottom.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  What about, like, macrobiotics you know teachers?  Have you, um, heard of their, like, way of, uh, you know, pretty much eating, like, all sorts of like seaweed and like, you know, meats or soups and all that sort of stuff?
L:  Yeah.  I'd heard about, like, you just, like, eat most of the stuff raw to get the best food enzymes and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Like nothing should be cooked over a hundred and fifteen degrees.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kinda like anti cancer, you know, treatment basically, for, you know, people who -- who are either survivors or just, you know, trying to, prev- you know, eating preventative, ah, foods and stuff like that, but at the same time, it's just healthy eating and ah, just basic principles, that they're cool, so -- 
L:  Yeah
R:  -- I enjoy that once in a while [LAUGH] as well.
L:  It seems like it would be, you know, a great healthy way to live.  But I don't know, it's so hard.  [LAUGH].  And I don't have the budget for it, you know?
R:  Right.  You know, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- it's funny that it's, um -- but for example, like in New York, um, you know, like, uh, the Healthy ah Pleasures, um, store and it's like a large, you know, organic store and stuff?  But, um, it's been under the in- investigation that it's not really organic --
L:  [MN]
R:  That's organic?  All that packaged stuff.  It's not really that good, but geez.  But it's still -- I mean, it makes sense.  It's like, you know, it's nice and -- and beautifully wrapped and you always think that it's the best and then they like, you know -- it's a ripoff.
L:  [LAUGH].  It's not really organic.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That -- that's sad though, you know?  But, um, you know, speaking of, like, eating at home, that's kinda like ah -- it's -- it's so expensive, you know, to buy like good food and organic food, but --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- it's the best, you know?   Definitely the best.
L:  Sometimes I find that it's cheaper to eat out than it is to eat at home 'cause I only cook for myself.
R:  Right.
L:  So I always have so much food left over, it's hard to cook one portion of things so sometimes it is just easier to eat out as well --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than staying home and cooking.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which State are you in?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, cool.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm in the Los Angeles area.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's terrific.  I just --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I don't really, you know -- I mean, like, I like cooking.  Do you personally like cooking a lot or, ah, just --?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, I like creating.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, dishes.  And I am really proud of myself when something tastes good, but when it's bad it's so terrible. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, I spent all this time trying to make something --
R:  All right?
L:  -- and it's no good.
R:  I know.  Well --
L:  It's just a disappointment.
R:  You gotta -- you gotta create and, you know, gotta just do a -- sacrifice certain things, right?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just one in a while.  That's cool.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Interesting.  But, um, yeah, there's also -- let's see.  What about, um -- do you like, like Mexican food and that sort of stuff like [inaudible]?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, California's a great area for Mexican food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, and especially since I'm -- I'm in LA.  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  What area are you in?
R:  I'm actually in New York, but I, um, I am in Georgia occasionally as well, so we get all sorts of, like, fabulous, uh, Mexican restaurants there too.  And a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just that -- the re- the good stuff, the real stuff.  I love, like, in you know, like green burritos and all that, so.
L:  Oh, yeah.  There's a fantastic Mexican restaurant near where I am and it's genuine.  It's authentic, you know, because it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you go at ten o'clock night, there's just, like, lines of Mexicans hanging out outside, so you know it's the real thing.
R:  Yeah, that's cool. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  That's how I determine, too.  Yeah, just, you know, if you know that -- if the locals are going, that's, you know, that's the good stuff.
L:  That's right.  That's how I knew it was a good place when I moved here 'cause there was a line of people at like at ten o'clock at night.
R:  Yeah.  That's right.  
L:  So, it's, like, oh, that must be good.
R:  [LAUGH].  That's terrific, yes.  Yeah, in New York, it's kinda, um, you know, it's almost like when I moved here.  It's like, you know, it's pretty much, um, um, I kinda like, you know, I travelled and -- and I went to Europe and all that, so it's kinda-- I compare, you know, I compare basically like what you get there and what you get here, so.  Like in Aus- in --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Austria, you know, you can get, like, all sorts of stuff for like dirt cheap and then [LAUGH] in the same, like you know, German restaurant here, you get -- you pay, like, you know seventy bucks for like what, for something that doesn't even taste authentic and stuff, so.
L:  Yeah, I've done travelling -- a lot of travelling too, and I notice the same thing.  You compare.  You get it really cheap.  You can get it on the street, you know, like a little roadside stand or something --
R:  I know.  Yeah.
L:  -- in Germany, and in here you have to go to a specialty restaurant.  And it's so much more expensive and it doesn't taste as good.
R:  Right, and then they play this, you know, awful like national music and stuff that's supposed to, like, make you feel at home. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  And it's like [LAUGH] it's like mostly overdone and it's just not really, um, not really doing for it, but especially if you've been to the real, you know, to the real, um, country or like, um, you have eaten the real cuisine and stuff, so.  But it's still, I mean, like, they're trying, so we should give them that, right?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Really.  At least they're trying.  You know, to try and broaden your scope of foods that you can get. 
R:  Right.
L:  But that's what I like about, you know, California, and I'm sure New York too -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is we have such a variety --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to choose from.
R:  I mean, that part is -- is just fantastic.  New York is just unbelievable in that respect.  And stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And of course, you know, that you can actually find like, you know, totally cheap places in Chinatown and stuff?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You can actually.  Yes.
L:  Same here.
R:  Same there?
L:  I live near a -- yeah, I live near a Chinatown and uh, you can get dim sum for really cheap.  They have, like, lunch specials all over the place.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  I mean, like those so- sorts of things are kinda just nice, because in Atlanta, you -- you just really don't get that sort of stuff.  So, like --
L:  No.
R:  -- no -- no Chinatowns, no nothing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And in New York, you get, like, all sorts of good stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you kinda like, come, you know, to like one of the most expensive cities and stuff, but you -- you find, like, really good deals an- and everything, so.
L:  You just have to know where to look.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  But actually just, ah, some, ah --
