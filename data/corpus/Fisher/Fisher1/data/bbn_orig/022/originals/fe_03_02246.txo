L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm David.
L:  David?  My name's Lane.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  You too.  So, the first question ... um ... can you recall?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I think it was, ah, do you agree with the fact that people get ill when the seasons change?  I think that was what it started with.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.  So, do you agree with that?
R:  Um, I don't think I -- I agree with that one hundred percent, but I think that a lot of people do get sick when it's -- when the seasons change because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their bodies are reacting to different weather.  But I don't think it happens to everybody.
L:  Right.  I agree too.  I, um, [SIGH] have been around a lot of people lately that have been [SIGH] feeling very lethargic and very down and I think it has a lot to do with -- with the weather, actually, 'cause, um, with all that we've been through this -- this season with the cold and the rain and now it's getting warm and everything, that your body is just constantly trying to like, find balance in.  Ah, I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that your body is, you know, trying to find that balance and that -- and people react different ways to it, um.  I myself, it -- it's hard when it starts getting, um, sunny and warm outside 'cause I love it, but in the same hand, it -- it exhausts me because my body's just not used to that -- that energy, you know, that, um, the -- and the warmth and just being in that, um -- after a while, you know, it's great because then you're used to it but, um ...
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think someone once told me that, uh, your body has a lot to deal with, uh, like, the, ah, the barometric pressure and stuff.  So if it's raining a lot, like it tends to cause more depression.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if it's not -- when it's not raining, the pressure's higher, so then it causes you to be, ah, at a higher emotional plateau or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... but I found that interesting 'cause it -- it is kind of true.  You get more depressed and kind of, ah -- I mean, just today it was sunny and now it's -- it's raining where I am, so, ah, I, ah, I was like, happy before.  I was going to go out and now it's raining, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um --
L:  Definitely understand that.  And it -- it's definitely -- it affects your mood, at least my mood too, because, you know, it was sunny this morning and then it got cloud, I was like, "Oh, man".  But -- and then it got sunny again so it was like, "Oh, great, now it's sunny!" and it's just like constantly ah da da da.  Um, but okay.  So, also, I guess does your -- what was it?  Like do you have aller- allergies or like, is your body influenced by, um --
R:  Yeah, d- definitely.  W- in the spr- I get, ah, allergies to -- a lot of times to the pollen although I haven't really had it that much this year so far, knock on wood.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [LAUGH], um, you know, I, yeah, it d- it definitely affects me when the pollen and stuff is flying around in the air.  I think it usually happens in May, though.  Um, it makes me real sniffly and sneezy and stuff.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I, um, I've never been diagnosed with anything but, um, just the change in temperature affects, um, like my head and just, um, like I -- I do, I get sniffly too and -- but there's noth- -- I've never, you know, my mom always thought she'd go get like, um, just checked out and stuff to see if I was, you know, prone to whatever, but I never did, so I [MN] -- I don't think it's that severe that, you know.  Obviously it's not so severe so I don't really do anything.
R:  Yeah.  I've never -- I've never actually gone and had it checked out.  Actually, my dad has the exact same thing.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, ah, yeah.  Well, I -- I never -- I never used to have that, but then maybe like, three or four years ago I started having it and, ah, yeah.  But m- my dad was like, "That's exactly what I have" so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I knew that it was just, yeah.  There's not really much you can do about it, 'cause, uh, most of the -- you can take allergy medications but they make you incredibly exhausted, um, 'cause they're so, ah, like, ah, they're all like depressants and stuff like that, so --
L:  Mhm.
R: Um, yeah.  I think another one of the questions that they asked was, ah, "What do you do to keep yourself healthy when --"
L:  Oh, right.
R:  "-- the weather changes?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I take vitamin C. every day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Me too!
R:  I don't know that -- know that -- I don't know that it works!  But [LAUGH] ...
L:  I do too!  I was thinking about it this morning.  I was like, "Shit, did I take my vitamin C.?" [LAUGH], even though --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you usually think wintertime, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is when you should be taking your vitamin C, but it's really like, all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I think -- I think it -- it works to some degree.  I think like, if you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick, but I think that, ah, it -- it mu- [MN] -- it's gotta help in some --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in some fashion, you know?
L:  But I think there's a lot more than just vitamins that has to play into getting sick, you know.  Stress, la- lack of sleep, um, just being open to, um, to illnesses, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not -- it's -- I mean, health is -- you know, eating habits play a big role in it, just keeping your body healthy and stuff, but I think there's a lot of other things that stem into illness and, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, do you agree with, you know, the whole sleep thing and everything and [MN] do you think that that affects ... affects w- wellness, basically, like, getting sick and stuff or do you think that it's mostly, um, you know, your eating habits or whatever, vitamins?
R:  Um, I -- I definitely think that getting good sleep is a -- is a good way to prevent getting ill.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I think -- oh, an interesting thing that, ah, a friend of mine had -- at least, he sent me an email about it or something -- it was, ah, this interesting study that was done on, ah, how people get, um, tend to get ill not so much, uh, when they're really in, ah, a period of really being stressed out but right immediately after, because your body --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is so -- when you're -- when you're, you know, built up all that stress, your body feels that it needs to -- to defend itself.  But right after you -- once you've told your body, okay, now it's time to relax --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's the time that you tend to be most vulnerable and I -- and, ah, um, I'm a gra- -- I'm a graduate student, so, ah, she sent this out like right before our semester ended and -- and lo and behold, I got sick, like, right when, ah, when I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I -- like, I removed myself from the academic pressures and stuff like that.  So, um, ah, I think there's something very true to that.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I mean, in college, it was always like that.  You know, I'd go home and I'd be like, "Oh, I can relax".  And then it was like, boom, you're hit with sickness and you've no choice but to relax and -- and just like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be in your sickness and let it just, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- live itself out.
R:  And it -- how many times have you talked to someone and they've said, you know, "I'm going to go on vacation now" or "I'm, you know, I'm on my break" or whatever.  And then they say, oh, no, I just go sick and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's the one time that you really want to enjoy that time off that you have or that whatever you planned.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you hear that the person's sick and you say, "Oh, no".  You know, you're like, "Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish you could enjoy the time that you've had planned to take off".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so, maybe it's --
L:  Definitely.
R:  You need to beef up your vitamin C. before that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  My, um, my brother's getting married this weekend and he w- just graduated from Officer Candidate School, um, with the Navy, like last week.  And then he gets married this week and I know he's been under an incredible amount of stress and just, like, it's my prayer that he just can release that -- this stress.  Like, my whole family -- just release the stress of the wedding and everything that's been going on, so, so --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- that they can enjoy their time, you know, enjoy their wedding day.  And it's just like, [LIPSMACK] it -- it's amazing how -- how, like, our emotional state and everything affects, um, our bodies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's so, like, it's just -- it's thrilling also to know that, like, our bodies, the way we are created was just amazing, you know, and just how everything's connected and, like, it's just, I don't know.  It's --
R:  Yeah, between the physical and the mental and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spiritual and everyth- -- yeah, everything is -- is connected.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah.  And then nowadays with, you know, SARS is constantly in the news and that's a whole new scare.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, ah, how people are dealing with that, you know, you're hoping and praying that that doesn't come here and affect us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, 'cause it's -- it just seems like you don't really know how you keep yourself immune from something like that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  There was, um, I saw in the paper -- was recently there's this picture of this Chinese woman or Asian woman, covering her face with, um, a cloth and it was like, people in Chinatown are scared of SARS and blah, blah, blah, and who knows if this is, like, actually true.  I mean they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just put this woman up on the front page like, y- you don't know where that picture came from, you know?  You don't know how -- you don't know how that was manipulated but just the fact that like, that hype is being spread and like, I don't know.  It's just interesting how -- how even the media plays into the whole health scare and [LIPSMACK] it's like, can you just help us by not, you know, hyping this up and like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- making it --
R:  And causing everybody to be overly panicked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before it really is a- anything to be panicked about.
L:  Right.  And in that -- in the same vein, like, you are making yourself less resistant to -- to the disease
