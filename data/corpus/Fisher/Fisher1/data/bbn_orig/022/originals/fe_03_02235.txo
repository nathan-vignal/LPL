R:  My name is Corinne.
L:  My name is Janet.
R:  Mhm.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  Thanks.  How are you this evening?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  Is this your first time doing the Fisher study or?
R:  Is this the thing that comes out of Pennsylvania?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.  Well, yeah, it's the first time.  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  Okay.  I've done it a few times now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  We're supposed to talk about food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which isn't too much of a problem for me.  I love food.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I prefer to eat in a restaurant.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Mhm.  Instead of cooking.  Yeah.  I don't enjoy cooking.
R:  Oh well, I like to cook so I -- I really prefer eating at home.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you like to cook?
R:  What do I like to cook?  I cook some of everything.  I mean, you know, just everything.  I like vegetables and I like meat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't eat a lot -- a lot of it though but, I mean I do eat it but I'm just not like somebody.  They don't have it.  You know, they just don't feel like they're eating, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I like vegetables, salads, fruit.  You know, I like just about everything except asparagus and I'm not crazy about -- I hate oatmeal but I have to eat it because my cholesterol is high.
L:  [LAUGH].  It's not exactly a fun food but I don't mind oatmeal so much.  I -- I like to eat most everything but oysters, clams and mushrooms, I think.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, well I like mushrooms too.
L:  [LAUGH].  Uh-huh.
R:  But clams -- oysters are okay but they taste like they're poison --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- in a way.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah, they do.  [LAUGH].
R:  So --
L:  They're -- they're really big where I live.  I'm in -- I'm in the Puget Sound area of Washington State.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Mhm.  Where are you at?
R:  Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um, so oysters and clams are a huge deal up here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're everywhere and I can't stand them.  They look disgusting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They taste poison.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  They smell horrible when they're cooking.  I don't know if you've ever cooked them or not, but --
R:  I was trying to figure out, you know, um, I, um, not signed up but I did a phone interview to participate in interviews of this nature and it was done by the University of Pennsylvania, I think?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's this one.
R:  And I was wondering how come they didn't say nothing.  They said something about we had a -- a pin number or something like that they were going to use.  And -- and this is the first time I've been on.  They've been calling here, um, that automated, ah, you know, format or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've been calling here for about maybe three or four weeks and I thought maybe they -- but tonight is Monday night, right?  Yeah, the night's Monday night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I'm just -- I -- I wasn't even thinking about it and then I'm actually at home which is good.  Well, we're talking about food so I guess I'd better get back to that.
L:  Oh, no.  That's -- that's okay.  If you have questions about the Fisher project --
R:  Well, are you?
L:  This is the fourth -- this is the fourth call I've participated in.
R:  So are you just a regular participant or are you -- are you with the university or what?
L:  No, I'm not with the university.  I signed up to do it because I learned that you'd get paid ten dollars a call.
R:  Yeah, right [inaudible].
L:  And, um -- and, for some reason, they keep calling me after I've completed three calls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I was wondering if one of them didn't take or something.  This is my fourth.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.
R:  Well, I haven't been home.  This is the first one.
L:  Yeah.  They -- they -- they've gone really well and if they call you and you don't feel like talking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you just press nine and they'll hang up.
R:  Oh, I don't mind talking if I'm at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, about like restaurants?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I used to go out and eat at restaurants, um, not as much as some people who really like it but I always used to do -- you know, I used to do it, but out of all the times -- I'm sixty years old and out of all the times I've eaten in restaurants, I can count the times I've been satisfied.  I would imagine.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Maybe -- maybe not actually.  You know, not the total times but most of the time I'm not satisfied when I eat in the restaurant.
L:  You have really high standards, huh?
R:  I don't -- well, no, I -- I don't  -- I don't even think that's it.  I just think that if something looks like it just happens to food when they -- I guess probably because they use a lot of processed things and -- and, I -- you know, I haven't seen many restaurants that I've eaten in that I really liked their food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I went to -- have you ever heard of Home Town Buffet?
L:  Um, it's probably a lot -- we have Old Country Buffet up here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It's probably like that.  Mhm.
R:  Well, Home Town Buffet, out here in California, I ate there up in Sacramento about two months -- two months ago.  And I really liked their food.  I thought it was really good.  The meatloaf tasted almost better than mine.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Which was a shock, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you know, they had really good food but most of the time they use these old frozen french fries and I just cannot abide those things.  I can't stand them.  I like --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, they've been using them for years 'cause when I was a -- remember I said I'm sixty and when I was fourteen I remember they had them then.  But, I don't like them.
L:  No, I don't like them either, no.
R:  Yeah.  Th- th- there's no potato taste in them.
L:  If -- if I go out to dinner.  I- if I'm going to go to the trouble, I'll go out for something good like a good steak --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and potatoes.  Something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I prefer, if I'm going to eat out in a restaurant, I prefer to have something that I don't usually fix for myself at home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, you know, I can't eat out all the time.  Certainly don't.  Can't afford it.  But --
R:  What -- what did you say your name is?
L:  Janet.
R:  Oh, Janet.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  But, so when I -- when I do go out, I try and find a -- a ni- nicer place that'll serve a good, ah, piece of fish or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- steak or something that I just might not normally serve myself.
R:  Well, there -- one -- one time I ate in Chicago.  You know, that's where I'm from?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I ate at this place called Don's Fish Market.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It was around nineteen eighty one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, two things I remember.  The first, I ate -- that was my first time having a caesar salad.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I really liked it and I went home and tried to make one, right after that.  'Cause I had a friend who called himself a cook, a chef or something.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And he -- I guess he thought he was telling me how to make it but it didn't taste like that one and I've never since tasted one like that.  And then they had, ah, some fresh bread.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, it was really good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I had this piece of fish called Haddock Louisanne and I said to myself, this is pitiful [inaudible].  I think the fish cost nine dollars -- just the piece of fish.  And it had like a couple of baby mushrooms on top of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I didn't see anything special about it.  Like you know, it just kind of -- I mean why would you want to eat -- eat something like that?  I mean, I could just go get -- my favorite fish is buffalo anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you ever had any buffalo fish?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, it's good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it's got a lot of bones in it.  And so a lot of people don't -- some people like it but they don't want to eat it 'cause it -- the bones.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that.
R:  But, those little -- really thin bones but what I do is kind of bite down into it and then kind of sift it around in my mouth --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  --and so I got my own little process separating it, you know?
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  So what are your favorite foods?
L:  Well, I love -- I love a good piece of prime rib.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or a steak, you know.  Those -- those are always really good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I tell you what?  My -- I think my all time favorites are the comfort foods that you can really only make at home.  My mom's macaroni and cheese  --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I make with -- and, ah -- and just -- just little -- little things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A fried egg sandwich.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Fried egg sandwich.  That don't sound too exciting.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  It does it for me everytime, though.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But -- but -- but I like an egg -- I remember when I was a kid, you know, my foster mother used to let us take a lunch to school sometimes.  We didn't have a cafeteria.
L:  Mhm.  Okay.
R:  So, um, the classroom always served as the cafeteria and like they would appoint a different teacher each week, you know, and we just sit in the classrooms and eat.  If you bring your own lunch but my foster mother wouldn't let us take lunch, only in the winter when it was really cold and like, you know, a lot of snow on the ground.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She used to fry eggs and but, of course, we were so, you know, there wasn't really a lot of -- an abundance of food in maybe most of the households I know back at that time and so you more or less ate what you could get and you'd be glad to get it.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I remember we had fried egg sandwiches and I mean, they would be cold but I would eat them.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And whatever and I like eggs a lot but you know?  I got this problem, like I say, with cholesterol.
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, you got to stay away from them if you have a problem with cholesterol.
R:  Now -- what -- what else do you like?  I mean, what -- what kind of desserts do you like?
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Oh jeez, you name it.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].  I love a -- I love lemon cake and coconut cake.
R:  Oh, me too.  Wow.
L:  I love cake, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Those are my favorites and I love cake too.
L:  Who am I kidding?  I like them all.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, I heard you.  Now that's -- that's -- you know, I don't like brownies though.  
L:  They're --
R:  I never ever liked brownies.
L:  -- they're okay.  I mean, I won't turn one down but boy, if I'm given a choice --
