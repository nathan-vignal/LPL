L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, ah, my name is David.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Hi, I'm Adriana.  I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh.  So what would you prefer?  Eating at home or going to dinner?
L:  Ah, New York is definitely going out.  [LAUGH].
R:  I-- I bet.  I'd rather go to dinner.
L:  Because everything here is so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- and we have small apartments with small kitchens so --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- no time, fast paced so you just -- it's much -- it's much more enjoyable to go out and have someone else do the dishes.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  And well, that has a little [inaudible] but I mean, I'd still rather go out anyday than stay at home and eat.
L:  Yeah.  What part of Florida?
R:  Tampa.  Central.
L:  Oh, Tampa?
R:  So.
L:  Well, you got a little bit of variety in food there.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Seafood, too, so that's great.
L:  Mhm.  Well, what -- 
R:  So, what's your favorite food?
L:  Um.  Between Italian and French.
R:  Really?
L:  That -- that kind of covers all the bases for me.  I mean, that's my favorite, but I, I eat all kinds of food when I go out.  You know, we usually just pick as a group. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Some -- not too big on Asian, but you know once in a blue moon.
R:  Yeah.  Same here.  I'm not really big on Asian foods also.  Now, Italian I really like and seafood I love also.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But not too big on the Asian food.
L:  Yeah.  And then sometimes I -- I'm Latin background, so sometimes go to a Latin restaurant but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that's not so much as being for being special, but just having like home -- home cooked food, since my family's not here.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So.
R:  Well -- 
L:  Um.  Do you normally go out to like -- what kind of restaurants?  Like high level or just, you know, moderate, quick, easy, casual?
R:  Well, it all depends on whatever, you know, the mood in for.  Normally, I mean, if it's just a normal family outing we'll just go somewhere like, um, like Cracker Barrel or somewhere just nice and simple.
L:  [LAUGH], yeah.
R:  If it's the case of, like, it's a special occasion, then of course we'll go somewhere like -- I don't know, we'll pick some place that's a little nicer.  I mean, I don't know, we like uh, we like, uh, Outback or -- there's one down here called --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- called -- what's it called?  The Italian Grill or something.  I don't think it's very, um, I don't think it's stuff like --
L:  It's like Olive Garden maybe or something?
R:  Yeah.  You know?.  I don't think it's a widespread chain but it -- it's very, very good and it's very smart.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so.  We love going there.  And Corrobos[?] too.  We love Corrobos, so.
L:  What type of food is at -- is it Corrobos?
R:  Oh, you don't have -- it's like -- that's right, that's also a family -- uh, it's in Tampa, in St Pete's[?].  Yeah, I see the commercials on TV and I think maybe everybody else knows what Corrobos is.  Um.
L:  Oh, no.  I haven't heart that. 
R:  No, it's -- yeah, it's, like, it has seafood, it has a mixture.  You know, it has like meat and it has a mixture of things.  It's really, really good.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the atmosphere is great, I mean, so.  Can't beat it.
L:  Yeah, wow.
R:  What are some places that -- I mean, do you know of any places up there that they don't have down here?
L:  Um. A million.  [LAUGH].
R:  Franchise wise?  Oh, really?  Have you ever been to Tampa?
L:  I can tell you the ones that -- that -- that are national that we have here.  We have the Olive Garden.  Um, we have GIF[?].  Um, you know, a lot of those types, but those aren't the ones that are really popular.  It is usually the ones that are [inaudible] individual restaurant.  It's like New York City's ever been here.  It's every block of the entire city that it is just restaurants next to each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like most --
R:  Never been there, so.
L:  Ninety per cent of the restaurants I think, they're like just the one here in New York and it's family owned.  You know, it's passed on through generations. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you have a few celebrity chefs that have several restaurants in the city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's pretty much where -- people either eat in their neighborhood, to their little [inaudible] places, or there's like the really popular places that are very trendy and people flock all over to go there.  And Manhattan is so small and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything's a subway ride or a taxi ride away.  No one really drives so --
R:  Yeah.  So would you --
L:  --  you know, you just kind of scour the city and explore.
R:  Would you say fast food's more popular than say sitting down eating over there?  [NOISE] 
L:  No, here it's sit eating.
R:  Wow.
L:  I've lived in California and it [NOISE] was more like fast food and take out.
R:  That's how it is here.  Everything's fast food.
L:  Yeah.  Here it's like -- it's such -- [NOISE] it's so fast paced and [NOISE] uh oh, my dog's going crazy.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's so fast paced that at the end of the day you just sit down because you usually are on the run with lunch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you usually skip breakfast so.  [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Dinner [NOISE] is the time when you just [NOISE] come sit with your friends [NOISE] and your family.  [NOISE] The only time of the day that you can kind of like unwind [NOISE] and so you [NOISE] definitely sit down environment.
R:  Yeah.  That's understandable.  Everything here is just, I mean, fast food.  I mean, I don't every day eat fast food.  I mean, that's -- that's part of like -- like the culture down here. 
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Like, that's what you do and -- 
L:  [NOISE].  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  It's fast, it's quick and it gets things done and, I don't know, I -- I guess, I guess we can appreciate it more when you sit down, I guess, down here, but, I don't 
L:  [NOISE].  
R:  -- know, I wouldn't like sitting down every time.  I would- I wouldn't mind sitting --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- down at a restaurant every time I went out to eat and stuff.  That would be nice.
L:  Yeah, you gotta come to New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I -- I 
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- I eventually will some day. 
L:  [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH].  I love Florida, though.  Would you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you -- did you like California more than Florida?
L:  [NOISE]. Um, I love [NOISE] California, the weather.  [NOISE]. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um, [NOISE], and the fact that you could drive [NOISE].  I don't know, it's just like this laid back, casual experience, but then it gets [NOISE] -- I don't know, it got a little boring for me.  [NOISE].  Kind of outgrew it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I love [NOISE] New York because it's just very international, it's fast and there's so many types of restaurants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's -- you know, it's no wonder the UN is here because it's -- really is a small world.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, within [NOISE] every neighborhood, you can have food from all over the world.  You know?.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, at a little restaurant.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So --
R:  What would you say was more --
L:  -- food that I never would have tried.  Huh?
R:  What would you say was more dominating type food like, ah?
L:  Definitely Italian I would think is the most popular.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Followed by French rest- well maybe not, maybe French and like Nouveau American.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe there's a lot of those.  There's a lot of bistros here.  So, you have that, be Italian, Patayria[?] is how -- is -- is the equivalent to the French bistro and then there's a lot of American bistros where you just have like you know hamburger, fries, like very gourmet [LAUGH] like --
R:  Yeah ...
L:  you know, hand packed, half -- you know, steak and that kind of stuff?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so those, like, would have -- be in the top three and then also Asian is like huge up here.  Everyone's, like, into fish here.
R:  Wow.  So it's not very --
L:  So there's a lot of --
R:  Go ahead?
L:  No, I said it's at lot of -- there's a lot of -- a lot of Asian from like Thai through Chinese and, you know, Japanese and sushi.  There's -- there's a lot of that as well.
R:  Yeah.  It's not -- it's not as evident down here, the Asian.  I mean, Italian is evident, um, but that's, I mean, there's -- there's -- everywhere there's like a place that's like, you know, has Italian food, but Asian food's not as evident down here.  I mean, they have the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- little shops here and there.  They're not really -- I mean, I don't know if there is, like, is there chains up there of -- of Asian type food?
L:  There's a few.  Yeah.  Especially for lunchtime.  There's a lot of, like, little small --  you know, like the typical Chinese restaurant that, like, is just for take out, it's a little small --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- space.  There's a lot of those.  
R:  Well, most of them are like family owned -- I'm sorry?
L:  Oh, go ahead.  So most of them are what?
R:  I said most of them are like family owned, you know?.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Same thing up here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But some of them have chains.  I mean, they're family owned but they have their own locations.
R:  Yeah.  So -- yeah.
L:  So, you know, they're very successful.
R:  What's your -- what's your favorite Italian food, then?
L:  Ah.
R:  Pizza?  No, I'm joking.  
L:  I -- I don't know.  [LAUGH].  I -- I -- pastas.  I mean, I love pastas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, us- usually with a -- like, either a cream sauce, like a white cream sauce like alf-
R:  Alfredo, yeah.
L:  Alfredo which is technically is not Italian as my Italian friends tell me.  It's something with Amer- invented in the US.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But um, so just so you can tell your friends in Florida.  But Italian alfredo and pinella vodka[?] are both American inventions.
R:  Wow.
L:  They are not Italian.  [LAUGH].
R:  I will spread the word.  Wow.  Well, scrimp -- shrimp --
L:  [NOISE]. 
R:  -- is my favorite.
L:  Um, that's regional.  But yeah, yeah, anything pasta [inaudible].
R:  Hello?  Hello?
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah.  I- my phone is going dead.  Are you on the cellphone?
L:  Okay.  I don't want to lose the call.  Can you hear me now?
R:  Yes.  Good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Fine now?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  But anyway, yeah.
L:  And you, you're favorite um Italian?
R:  Seafood um, is my favorite --
L:  I don't think it's going to -- 
R:  Scampi.  Anything to do with shrimp.  I love shrimps.  Shrimp pasta.  Anything of that sort.  I -- I'm --
L:  Oh, so you are really a big seafood fan.
R:  Yeah.  Any of the little side dishes, like, you know, lobster or anything like that.  I -- I'm not -- lobster is not my biggest [inaudible] to me.  It's -- especially when I get a good sauce with it or something.  So.
L:  [inaudible] you're near the sea, that's why there's a lot of seafood restaurants?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Especially over at St Pete.  You go over to St Pete --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- they're everywhere.  The Pier --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- at St Pete, it's a -- oh, it's delicious, the food they have there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Again, I know it's fresh.  I mean, it's just -- it's just delicious.  I ate there probably about a week ago, on a field trip I went to.  It was great.
L:  Mhm.  Well, it's definitely healthy to eat a lot seafood, but --
R:  Really?.  
L:  I'm just -- I'm just not a big fan [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't think I could eat as -- like, shrimp.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, or even deep fried.  I can't eat it like scampi or anything like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Shrimp and sometimes catfish.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For some reason, 'cause they -- they taste the least fishy to me and of course, you know, like tuna out of the can, I can make like a tuna salad and that's --
R:  That's good, too.
L:  -- otherwise I -- I can't eat.  I've tried salmon and I've tried lobster.  I've tried all those other types of foods.  You know, prepared a million different ways.  My friend's got a restaurant, you know, I always take a piece of theirs and I can never eat it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's too fishy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's good for you, though.  So good for you.
R: Yeah, perfect, yeah --
