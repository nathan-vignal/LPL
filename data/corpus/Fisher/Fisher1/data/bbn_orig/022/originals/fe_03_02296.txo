L:  Hi, I'm Charlie.
R:  Hi, I'm Maryanne.  So, the seasons change, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't really necessarily get sick when the seasons change.  It feels like I'm sick all the time.
R:  Oh, the -- feel sick --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Where -- where are you -- um, where are you about in the world?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What part?
L:  Uh, Los Angeles.  
R:  Okay.  And you still get sick all the time, with the beautiful weather out there?
L:  Yeah.  Kinda weird, I guess.
R:  And there's probably the smog.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Where are you?
R:  I am in Philadelphia.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  So we're having -- I'm getting a little bit of [inaudible] um, as the seasons start changing, but uh --
L:  Mm.  How's the smog in Philadelphia?
R:  Not so bad.  Not so bad.  There's a lot of, uh, yeah, there's a lot of air movement.  And we're not in -- down in a valley, so that helps a little bit, but --
L:  Oh well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, the -- I think wha- what was the other topic?   If you go to the doctor, you -- last seven days, but if you don't, it lasts a week, or --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I missed that call thing, but I think it was implying that the doctor will find something wrong with you if you go.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I guess.  I don't know.  It's kinda we- it sounded kinda weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't necessarily go to the doctor when I have the flu.
R:  No, I don't either.  I only go to the doctor, like -- only when I do my yearly checkup and then, uh, um, you know, only go if I absolutely have to.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  That was --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  I respect doctors, but --
L:  Yeah, I go to the -- I don't know, I go to the doctor's when something's hurting, but for the most part --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'll just go to -- I don't know, buy medicine, but I don't like buying painkillers or things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hold on a second?
R:  Sure. 
L:  [NOISE].  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I -- I don't know.  I don't, like, the -- they're -- they're just weird to me.  Like, you know, they fix your head if your head hurts, they fix your arm if your arm hurts, that seems kinda of a not very specific or centralized --
R:  [LAUGH].  I guess it depends on who you go to.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I don't know.  Wonder drugs that fix everything are just -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, like, drugs are -- like, wonder drugs are a little bit silly, I think.  I mean, obviously there are certain things that have been shown to work.  Well like, I mean, definitely -- I -- I -- I would not, um, fault anybody for, you know, taking their AZT cocktail, um, but um, I -- I don't know.  I think, you know, if I can -- if I can, um, avoid taking things, but you know, if I don't need to, I won't.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, I'm sure that antibiotics sure have kept me, um, healthy on many an occasion, so --
L:  Yeah.  I'm not necessarily -- I don't -- I don't know which antibiotics I take. I know I can't take anything with 'cillin at the end of it.
R:  Yeah.  My sister has the other -- has that problem, too.  You probably can take some 'micins, [inaudible].  Those --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Maybe.  I don't know.  Some people are allergic to both.  
L:  Ooh, that must not be fun.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  They have like these new souped up ones so that you can take anyway, so you could -- definitely got something for everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  I'm not -- I don't know what I'm allergic to, with things like every spring I get sick.   I don't get -- I get the -- the basic allergies.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And then I know people that are allergic to everything.  Like, a friend of mine's allergic to dust and not only dust, but she's allergic to grass.  That just seems like it wouldn't be very much fun to me.  
R:  I knew someone when I was little who was allergic to all diary products and all wheat products.
L:  All of them?
R:  All of them.  She was allergic to milk --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she was allergic to milk and she was allergic to wheat, so she couldn't --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- like, eat, like she'd eat like peanut butter on rye bread.  [LAUGH].
L:  How can you be allergic to wheat?
R:  She was allergic to wheat.  I don't know.  But the funny thing was, the area that they were on [inaudible] is that she lived on a -- her family owned a dairy farm, so here she was, allergic to milk and her family owned a dairy farm.
L:  That's just a bad combination.
R:  It was.  It was.  It was pretty ironic.  Mm, but --
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's just irony.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it was, yeah, interesting.  
L:  So, is it still snowing in Philadelphia?
R:  Oh actually, it's um -- oh, it's seventy five degrees.  It got up to, um, eighty today. 
L:  Really?  See, I thought the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- east coast was having an unusually late winter this year for some reason?
R:  Well, we did have some wintry weather over the last couple of weeks.  There was some fairly cold weather, um, but then --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- you know, we're getting some nice warm days now.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which is -- I like that.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's probably warmer there than it was here, then.
R:  Seriously?  Huh.  I lived in San --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- Francisco for a year.  Hated the weather up there.  Hated it.  Everything about it.  'Cause it was just like -- it was like a bad fall or a spring day all the time.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, isn't Philadelphia right on the coast, too?
R:  Not so much.  It's not that far from the coast, but it's totally different.  Like, San Francisco has its own, like, weather system and -- as I'm sure you um, you've been made aware --
L:  Yeah, I -- I got a -- I -- I used to live right by there so I go there all the time.
R:  Oh, right.  Then you know.
L:  It's my favorite city.  
R:  I -- I liked the city.  It was just the weather that drove me nuts, 'cause like, I love -- I love the change of seasons and it was really just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like kinda felt dreary fall or spring day almost the whole time I was there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we don't believe in season changes out here.  
R:  Yeah.  I got that sense.  Nobody seemed to be bothered by it except me.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Everyone was like, "Yeah, just the way it is", and I was, like, "Yeah, but it's gross".  Maybe like -- not the way it -- but --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Oh well.  Let's see.  What else is there?  I don't know what else to talk about but the seasons.  I think we covered the topics.
R:  I think we did.  What are you doing at now then?
L:  I -- I go to school.
R:  Oh, cool.  Where do you go to school?
L:  I go to USC.
R:  Nice.  Are you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm?
R:  You like it?
L:  What did you -- yeah, it's fun.  
R:  Cool.
L:  Have a good time.  What do you do in Philadelphia?
R:  Go to law school.
L:  Ooh.  Which one?
R:  Oh, University of Pennsylvania.  
L:  Nice.
R:  Yeah.  I like it pretty well.
L:  That's a --
R:  Actually,  I like it a lot.  Particularly since I just turned in my last paper of the semester today, so --
L:  You get papers in law school?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it depends on what classes you take.  You can either do exams -- classes you have exams, and some of your seminar classes you have papers.
L:  Really?  'Cause my aunt was telling me that she was in law school [inaudible] 'cause I thought she'd have a lot of paper and she said when she was in law school, there were never any papers.  All there were was the tests, which you had to know everything for the tests.  And so it was pretty much, you know, there was no other assignment except to study an inhumanly amount of --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- stuff every night.
R:  They're recently extended it also a little bit, but um, you do still have to do a lot of reading and a lot of cramming for the exams.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't -- I mean, it's not so different from anything else.  I think it's just a matter of kinda learning the style and the approach and the language of the -- of the subject matter.
L:  Mm.  
R:  What do you study?
L:  Uh, I'm -- I'm in the communications school.  I'm trying to get into educational school.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know -- do you know what age you want to teach?
L:  Um, preferably younger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do younger kids.  I don't really like high school kids and I don't like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- junior high school kids, so --
R:  Yeah.  I think my little sister, she's at Lee High University, and I think she's looking to becoming, uh, a teacher for younger elementary school students.
L:  An art teacher for elementary school?
R:  Um, no -- and, uh, she's uh looking to be a teacher for elementary school.
L:  Oh, I thought --
R:  I think.
L:  -- you said she was looking to be an art teacher for elementary school?
R:  No.  Interestingly enough, my other sister is an artist, but uh, yeah --
L:  How many sisters do you have?
R:  Just two.
L:  Are they both older or younger?
R:  Both younger.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yep.
L:  Nice.
R:  How about you?  Any siblings?
L:  I'm an only child.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Got stepbrothers.
R:  Do you like it or not?  Yeah?
L:  I guess.  I've got stepbrothers, but --
R:  Well, see, that's kinda nice.  At least you have family around and -- but not uh -- you get spoiled, fair enough.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Pretty much.  It was cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't have to worry about sharing.
R:  Right.  Right.  Had to learn that --
L:  Everything was mine.
R:  That's great.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.  No, I, uh, I actually enjoyed having sisters.  Or I do now, even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, then it was kind of a pain in my butt.  Pardon my language.  I'm sorry.  I don't usually -- so crass.  Um, but um --
L:  Then again, they always end up getting -- these things I -- from my understanding, end up getting better as you get older?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I really -- I mean, we're -- we're definitely, as we're all becoming adults, beginning to like each other a lot more.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So.
L:  I know my mom and I get along a lot better now that I'm grown than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we did when I was younger.
R:  That is definitely true.  That is definitely true.  My mom is like -- my mom was fairly young when she got married, so she's uh, not that much older.  I mean, like, I should say, like, we're sort of all moving to a phase where she has -- some of her friends are younger than she is and some of my friends are older than I am, so we both know a lot --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- of people who are getting married and having babies.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which is kinda funny because, you know, we're sort of moving into the same peer group in some ways.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know what?  You like, like, it's like my mom and I have similar friends.  This is odd.  But --
L:  I don't want to ever have similar friends to my mother.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  
L:  Wow.
R:  I'm kind of in a unique situation now 'cause my mom had me when she was twenty three, so you know, it's not like -- it -- when -- when you get to, you know, the part where we are now, we really are very much in the same -- in a similar peer group, so --
L:  Mhm.  I think as I can understand that.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, yeah, my mom, uh, I don't know, she's -- all our friends are older.  They seem like they're older than she is, but I'm not sure.  
R:  I can see that.  
L:  Some of them. 
R:  Sometimes --
