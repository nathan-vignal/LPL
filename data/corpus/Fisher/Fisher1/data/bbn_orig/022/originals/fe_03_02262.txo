L:  Hello, my name is Roy, calling, ah, from New York with the, ah, U- UPEN Fisher, ah, project, ah --
R:  Yes, ah, my name's Ed and I'm calling from Dallas, Texas, a former New Yorker.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah --
L:  Okay.  Ah, I guess -- I guess our topic today is illness, sir.
R:  Uh, illness and how the seasons change and --
L:  And how they affect us.
R:  Well, yeah, ah, summertimes, allergies, ah, I would -- down here in Texas, we have a lot a rag dust, ah, dust pollen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, so open spaces, yeah, there's a tendency to, um [COUGH], get ill and therefore allergy medicines, antihistamines, etcetera.  Ah, having been a New Yorker, I'm sure you have a problem with colds.
L:  I do.  I do at the change of the season, ah, right on time almost, every April.  Just got through last week with my usual seasonal two week cold and, ah, you know, it's -- it's the slightest change of temperature that affects me, although I'm not asthmatic so, ah, ah, it's just one of those strange things.  Ah, maybe my own problem is I tend to dress a little bit too lightly sooner in anticipation of the spring.
R:  [COUGH] Yes, that's, that's true.  I remember in the wintertime not feeling it was gonna be a -- a blustery day.  You would normally put on the lighter jacket and, lo and behold, ah, be affected by a change in temperature, which we get a lot down here in Texas, so, ah, we get used to it.  Most of the time it's heat, but when it's heat you normally need air conditioning and if that is one of the areas that can bring you dust, it -- it is a problem.
L:  Do you find that the sudden change going, ah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- from inside air conditioning to, ah, outside heat, ah, exasperates the --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- problem?
R:  -- yeah, well, yes, because, ah, especially when you get into a car, you put the air conditioning on, there's a tendency to get, um, [LIPSMACK] the eyes get, ah, teary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sometimes, ah, the, ah, staleness of the car's, uh, interior, you -- you can tell a lot by that.
L:  You -- w- well, you, ah, certainly have a pretty good observation of the whole situation.  Ah, are you affected by allergies at all and are you taking any medicines --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for them?
R:  Yeah.  I, ah, do take, ah, um, Claritin.  Ah, that does help me and, ah, the doctor switched me to Allegra and, ah, that's -- that's been a Godsend.  And if you see those commercials on television, dog, um, ah, or, ah, cat, ah, [LIPSMACK] allergies, well, I've got a little toy chihuahua and he's not a problem.
L:  Oh, I, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my vet tells me that -- or my cat's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- vet tells me that the, ah, these things aren't transposed between people and -- and, ah, humans [SIGH] --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- between people and animals, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, I know that a lot of people are allergic to animals.
R:  Yeah, but, ah --
L:  Especially to the dandruff from a cat.
R:  Yeah, that hasn't been a problem and, ah [COUGH], but right now, I'm outside, it's eighty five degrees, nice little breeze and, um, occasionally you might hear me clearing my throat, and, ah, that's something that with the medicine I -- I -- I manage --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with, ah, in the summertime.
L:  Are -- are you retired and do you have a computer?
R:  Ah, yes, I do.
L:  Ok- --
R:  And that's why -- I -- actually, my wife got involved with this and she, ah, is not a talker as much as I am, so, ah, she got me involved in this and, ah, we do a lot a studies like this.  We do a lot of, ah -- 
L:  Because I know on the computer you can find an awful lot, as you -- as you -- well, as you probably well know [COUGH] through the search sites --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like Looksmart dot com and Google dot com.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [COUGH] And, um --
R:  Well, also, the, ah, the Med dot com where you can, ah, look up different medicines and all that, but, ah, ah, as I say, usually we can tell by, you know, we check with the radio, check with the television --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- what the allergy level's going to be.  And if it's in the ozone, ah, high ozone level, then basically --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that's something that, ah, you know, ah, one has to be careful of, but being a -- a young retiree, [NOISE] then, ah, it's -- it hasn't been a problem and I do a lot of camping.  We're out in --
L:  You know?  Excuse me.  Ah, one you mentioned ozone levels are up.  I did find an excellent site.  Um, ah, believe or not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a real estate search site, but if you click on neighborhood statistics, they enter into all of those things like, ah, pollutants and ozone levels and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you might want to look at City Search dot com and, um, pretend you're looking for a house in your neighborhood, okay, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  in -- and in your town --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and then click on, um, the keyword neighborhood there, find a neighborhood or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, get as close to your, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- town or your part of town as you can on that site, ah, within the Texas, um, you know, ah, area and, ah, you might find some interesting health --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- statistics there.
R:  Well, ah, because of the open spaces and the [NOISE] -- the different, ah, conditions that we have down here, that's broadcast on a day to day basis.
L:  Oh, well, okay.
R:  And --
L:  We don't have that here.
R:  Oh.  We get -- that's true.  Ah, I used to live in the city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Long Island --
L:  Oh my --
R:  -- Astoria --
L:  -- gosh.
R:  -- Queens, and, ah --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- originally, ah, started out in Brooklyn, so --
L:  Well --
R:  -- ah --
L:  -- I'll tell ya, sir.  I give ya credit. I really don't know how people can live down here.  I live upstate in Orange County near West Point and, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yet I wouldn't go to New York City even to go to the airport.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, my daughter's living in Buffalo, and speaking of colds and allergies and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- w- with two story high snowfalls and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that and she moved away and she moved right back there.  She said she loves the area.  She feels --
L:  What area is that?
R:  Ah, Williamsville, Buffalo, New York.
L:  Oh, sure, sure.
R:  She says, "It's clear, it's clean" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um --
L:  And life is, ah, much less of a hassle.
R:  Yeah.  yeah, it's, well, as you say, not being in the city per se --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- it can be hectic.
L:  Ok- --
R:  We lived in West Chester County --
L:  Yeah, I grew up in --
R:  -- b --
L:  -- Yonkers.
R:  Yeah, bef- well, we were, ah, Ossining, Queens --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- Ossining and Croton[?] on Harman --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before we moved down to Texas and, ah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we just love it down here.  Ah, for one, ah, lack of the cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had our ice storm and all that.
L:  No --
R:  But --
L:  -- state taxes.
R:  -- again [COUGH], but again, ah, bundling up, ah, watching, ah, what you wear, um, you know, [MN] very few colds during -- during the winter.
L:  You know you might try your local library for some, ah, health related books, ah --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- ah, I don't know what series they are under, but s- I'm sure the librarian would help -- will help you look for, preferably new health related books because they only -- they usually give the latest spin on, ah, allergies and colds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and illness.
R:  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- that --
L:  -- but you take vitamins.  Do you feel multi -- ah, vita- --
R:  Yeah, I take multivitamins.  Ah, I take an aspirin a day and --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- ah, that -- that does help and, ah, just, you know, makes you feel good and, ah [COUGH], as I say, having consistently cleaner weather, God bless you.  You -- you folks up there had your winter.  I mean, I --
L:  It was a rough one.
R:  -- oh.  God.
L:  Well, I'm moving to Alabama in a -- in a -- in a few months, so, ah --
R:  Oh, okay.  Ah --
L:  I'm getting out of this area, ah, far away from every influence from New York City that I can find anywhere.
R:  Whereabouts in Alabama.
L:  Ah, I'd rather not say.  I don't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- want any --
R:  Well, no, no, no, no.  But there's, ah, we visited a couple of restaurants in the Mobile area --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, ah, liked that area very much.  Well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good.  Well, and j- come --
L:  But anyway, sir, I j- I did too wanna suggest in -- in addition to the, um, to the computer site and the -- and the books, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you might find something health related, um, on the wonderful website Retirement living dot com.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, that's one word, Retirement living dot com.
R:  Retirement living dot com.
L:  I know they do a fantastic job of, ah, of -- of the tax, um, ratings by state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, pension exemptions and so on, but I do wanna, ah, stay on --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- on topic with this and, um, ah, on the, um, on just, um, on the manner of, um, eating right.  Do you eat certain foods that, ah, you feel --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- ah, help you?
R:  -- [COUGH] as a matter of fact, I've lessened my intake of chocolates and a lot of dairy products, ah, because I feel that with the asthma, ah, it -- it does make, um, [LIPSMACK] my system, ah, not shut down, but not -- not act as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I stay away from more of the chocolates, etcetera, eat a lot of greens.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, down here we drink a lot of iced tea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, and of course, ah, in the south, we use a lot of, ah, tomatoes --
L:  You know what?
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Tomatoes are --
R:  And --
L:  -- excellent and I'd also suggest --
R:  They're low [inaudible].
L:  -- kale.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've heard kale, ah, it may not have the greatest taste, but I hear, ah, it's the best possible vegetable --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- for, ah, or green vegetable for antioxidant activity.
R:  Well, as a matter of fact, that's something that I've tried and, ah, as you say, the -- the taste has to be acquired and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not anything I can acquire.  But avocados I've gotten used to
