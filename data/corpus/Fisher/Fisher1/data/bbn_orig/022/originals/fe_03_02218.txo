R:  Hi, my name is Victoria Breckon[?].
L:  Hi, uh, my name is James Hyberg.  Do you --
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah, do you understand what we're doing here?
R: Yes, I believe I do.
L:  I think I do too.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  I think I -- I do, too.  I mean, we just talk about food, right?  We have to talk about our favorite meal?
R:  Um, our favorite meal and --
L:  What we --
R:  -- and we, we also have to talk about whether we prefer eating at home or in a restaurant.
L:  Right.  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  What do you -- which -- which do you prefer?  Why don't you go -- 
R:  I have to say, um, I don't know.  I prefer -- I guess I prefer eating at home.  It's convenient to eat at a restaurant.  Um, for the most part, just 'cause I don't have to cook or -- and I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- definitely don't have to do -- have anything to do with the dishes.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, um, but I like eating at home more, 'cause you know what you put into your food and you know?
L:  Sure.  Yeah.
R:  You have more control over what you can -- what you do and don't eat.  So.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's -- well, just being at home, I mean, if you like your home, you know, then it's nice to be there and eating what you want to eat and stuff and preparing it like you want, but I don't know.  I think I'd have to say going out, myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, just 'cause, well, like you said, you don't have to prepare the food yourself and um, I kinda like, you know, people watching when I am eating stuff like that, so, I'd have to say that I prefer going out.
R:  Mm.  I definitely don't like people watching me when I eat, so that's probably a reason --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- another reason why I like eating at home.
L:  Right.  Right. 
R:  Um.
L:  I don't -- I have to say my favorite meals, though, may have -- may have been at home, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I mean, like terrific, you know, big spreads like Thanksgiving or other holidays --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  --and with uh, you know, your family and maybe some friends around or something like that.  That's -- nothing beats that.
R:  That's tr- that -- -- that -- that's true.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but as far as my favorite foods.  I don't actually know.  I like so many different foods [LAUGH] that it's like, um, it's hard to -- to pick just, like, one.
R:  Yeah.
L:   I guess my favorite fruit would be a mango.
L:  Mm.
R:  That would be the closest thing I could, like, narrow down.  
L:  Okay.
R:  I can definitely say, but it -- it was, but um --
L:  How about a favorite vegetable?
R:  Um.  A tie between spinach and kale at the moment.
L:  Huh.  Tayol?
R:  Yeah.
L:  T.A.Y.O.L.
R:  K.A.L.E.
L:  K.A.L.E.  Kale, huh.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's like a green.  It's very -- it's very, um, coarse.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's -- it's -- the first time I had it I was, like, mm, not really for me, but a friend of mine taught me how to cook it like, um, this one way which is amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just really good for you.  It speeds up your metabolism.  It's, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's good, um.  It's very fibrous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and you know, I used to be really into carrots and I just OD'd on them.
L: Yeah, carrots.
R:  And now it's kale.
L:  Huh.  What's the best way to cook kale?
R:  Um, put a little bit of water in the pan --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and um, just like literally just coating the bottom of the pan and then put the kale in there.  Turn it on a low light and cover it.  And allow it to steam.
L:  Huh.
R:  Um, and I usually put a um, teaspoon of minced garlic in it and then, um, once it's done, just sprinkle a little olive oil on it.  
L:  Interesting.
R:  And that's the best way.
L:  Huh.
R:  And if -- if you want, um, you can also squeeze lemon over it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's nice too, sometimes.  But, um, if you're squeezing lemon over it, you have to, like, eat it immediately because it -- it turns it this weird color.
L:  Huh.  Wow.  Um, what was the other vegetable that you mentioned?
R:  Spinach.
L:  Spinach.  [LAUGH].  Wow.
R:  I love spinach.
L:  I like that on pizzas.  Um.
R:  It is bomb on pizzas too.
L:  What's that?
R:  Spinach.
L:  It is the bomb?
R:  Yeah.  On pizzas.
L:  Yes, it is indeed. Um, well, that's cool.  Are you a vegetarian?
R:  Um, no. 
L:  No?
R:   I don't eat um, beef but um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm not a vegetarian.  I guess my -- I like -- chicken is, like, my everyday staple and ah --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I guess pork would be my favorite meat, if I had to pick one.
L:  Pork is good.
R:  But I don't eat beef or lamb.  I think lamb's disgusting.
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah, I never liked the taste of lamb.  I --
R:  It's actually probably not the taste of lamb that you don't like, it's probably the smell of lamb that you don't like.
L:  It could be.
R:  'Cause that's my -- my big beef.  It, like, smells so bad that, like, I can't even get down with the taste of it.
L:  Yeah.  It's been so long since I tried it, but I do remember eating it and I was glad because I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, who wants to eat a lamb, it's bad enough eating a cow, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  They're so nice, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].  They're so -- 
L:  Um.  [COUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Excuse me.  But, I'm -- I'm eating less, um, meat as I get older, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  It's very hard to digest.  It's -- it's tough on the -- the digestive system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For sure.
L:  And also I'm getting bad meat sometimes, you know, like --
R:  Yeah, it's very hard to find good meat.
L:  It really is.
R:  It's very difficult.
L:  I mean, they have, like, some big expose on one of those news magazine shows a couple of months ago about all these grocery stores, like, you know not pulling their meat when it was past expiration and, like, putting new -- new, um labels on it.  And putting it back out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like, my God.  I think they're still doing it, too.  I got a really bad piece of meat at -- in Albertson's, near -- near my house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not so long ago.  But, anyway.
R:  That's -- that's -- yeah, I know.  Um, it, I mean, I don't really buy a lot of meat per se, but um, that is, ah -- that is, um -- I've had -- but I've had instances where I've bought chicken or chicken pieces and it's just, like, I've opened it, it looks fine on the outside and I've opened it and it has a funny smell and I'm just, like, okay but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not even risking it.  I'm just throwing it away.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like with this -- with this, um, steak, it looked fine.  It was red and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but when I put it on the grill or I actually, I -- I had -- just have a um, um -- I'm in a cottage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have, like, ah, just a stove top for cooking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I put it in a pan, and like, it didn't, like, really, like, cook and turn into a natural color.  It immediately turned, like, grey --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just like, just grey.  It was like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really -- and -- and no blood coming out of it, you know?
R:  Yeah.  They probably colored it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's gross.  It's like um, did you see, ah, the, um, dirtiest restaurants in --
L:  Oh, are you in LA too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um, no, I wanted to catch that, actually, but I did not.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It was on that -- that, um news show, right?
R:  Yeah.  Um, Fox Eleven had it.  I don't know.  Like, I think they -- it -- I don't -- I think this was the Fox Eleven's one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but like, it was someplace in Glendale.  And --
L:  Uh, uh, a restaurant in Glendale?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was, like, the worst or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?  'Cause I -- I don't live too far from there.  I'm in Eagle Rock.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it was one of the worst.  Like it -- it -- he didn't say, like, this was the absolute worst, but --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- at least the one in Glendale, they -- they said that they, um, they said that they, um, they called him up and they called the Health Inspector up and they were, like, "How can we improve?" blah, blah, blah.  "Will you help us?"
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, like, they -- at least they got help, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a lot people, like, kicked them out, wouldn't let them in, wouldn't, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wouldn't take any advice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I remember last year, it was -- I have been in West Hollywood which I have been to once that year, so I was gagging.
L:  Mhm?
R:  But, um --
L:  Do you remember which restaurant it was?
R:  The Toasted Bun, I think it was called.
L:  The Toasted Bun.  Really.  Oh, shit, I think I've -- I think I've driven past that and thought, "Oh, that sounds like a really nice". you know, uh -- 
R:  Yeah, it had um --
L:  -- or at least like a tasty sort of little, you know, hole in the wall or something?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a greasy spoon.  It's like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It looks like it's a little diner, but was, like, rat -- roach infested.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, I don't think it was the Toasted Bun.  I think it was an Asian restaurant, but somebody had a live rabbit --
L:  Wow
R:  -- in their kitchen.
L:  In the kitchen?
R:  And somebody else had, like, duck on the -- I think it was the same place.  Duck on the floor.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Like, cooked duck on the floor.  And somebody else had, like, shrimps frying outside --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- the kitchen, the back kitchen door, on the ground.
L:  Ooh, gooby.
R:  I was, like, um, no.
L:  Wow.  Wow.
R:  Never.
L:  Yeah.  I think some people figure, like, if -- if they can just stand upright and read, you know, um, ah ingredients and stuff, that they can be a -- be like restaurant owners or something.  That's really scary.
R:  It is terrifying.
L:  [LAUGH].  Um.
R:  It is terrifying.
L:  Yeah.  I'm glad they have that ratings thing because I don't know -- I was going to this -- this place nearby to get tacos when I first got out here from Minneapolis --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and --
