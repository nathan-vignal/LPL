R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How's it going? [LAUGH].
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Um.  Do you prefer eating in a restaurant or at home?
R:  Um, I like both for different reasons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]. I like, um, I guess mostly, I prefer to eat at home, but that makes me appreciate eating at a restaurant even more.
L:  Oh, that's a good point.  Um.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  I -- I think I do enjoy eating at home more un- unless it's a very special occasion.  But, um, I just enjoy being, being able to have a more relaxed atmosphere and being able to wear what I want and take as much time as I want --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and -- and ah, yeah, you know, being able to get up and do something that might be distracting me around the house, as long as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my dining partners don't mind.
R:  Multi task while you eat?
L:  Right.  Exactly.  And, um, I tend to do that a lot, too, to probably save time.  Um, but then again, there are probably, like, I wouldn't want to cook for myself on my birthday or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since I'm the one who does the majority of the cooking in my house, it would fall to me, so.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think also, another thing is, about eating at home is eating with other people when everyone's, like, helping to make it or whatever and it becomes like a social event and everyone's, like, doing their own part to, like, put their hands and energy into the food or whatever and put it on the table and like, take the time to go through it instead of being rushed at a restaurant which I guess, like, you can take your time there, too, but just like, you go there, you get the menu, you sit down, you read it, you know?  Whatever.  It's just, like, very routine, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  Whereas like, if you can hang out at home with friends or family or whatever and everyone, like, takes part in it and makes it like a really -- like a valuable experience that I guess I could take for granted, but I don't know, I think, that like, a lot of people don't interact as much as they could over food.  And it's such a cultural thing.
L:  That's very true.  I can't say I've been successful in getting others to participate with me, but on the --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- rare occasions that has, um, yeah, that's -- that's really an excellent point.  And it's a community venture.
R:  Yeah.  And I think there a lot of other cultures take, you know, the preparation of food, um, it's like, such a -- a normal daily thing that you know, a lot of other people interact with each other so much more over that.  And, like, in the kitchen and it's like a so- social environment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whereas eating in a restaurant, I mean, I just love eating in a restaurant and having someone else do it for me and have them make things that I've no idea how to do. [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Right.  That's -- that's a good point, too.  I always think, wow, I would really love to do that, but I could never, never pull it off.  Or wanting to know how they do it.  I, ah, like -- like the food network in awe for reasons like that. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Um, uh, I guess the other part of the question was, describe your perfect meal.  I've been trying to think about that in the back of my mind and I'm having trouble coming up with, ah, what that might be.
R:  A perfect meal?
L:  A perfect meal.  Um.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  What you said about having people around, I mean, that would, you know, that would be part of it, certainly.  Um.  Without even identifying what the particular food items might be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess --
R:  I guess --
L:  I'm sorry, please go ahead?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Um, I guess, ah, a close to perfect meal for me would definitely be, um, daytime, bunch of people participating and making the food, lots of good produce happening and um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like salads and vegetables and whatnot and um, eating outside and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, definitely a really exciting dessert.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I would -- I would choose part of that, the opposite.  Um, I really dislike eating outside.  
R:  Really?
L:  So mine would definitely take place indoors. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:   I just don't want any wind or bugs or anything in my way, so.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Even when I -- I barbecue outside, I often bring the food inside to eat it [LAUGH], which probably defeats the purpose a little bit, but um, yeah, I hadn't really thought about location.  Um, yeah, for me, the perfect meal would definitely be inside, but most likely in, in my house, as opposed to a restaurant.
R:  What about, like, what's a favorite meal?
L:  Um, I don't know if I have a particular dish, but um, anything with -- with cheese and sauce, whether that be Italian or other Mediterranean, will always work for me.
R:  Really good.
L:  Um, you mentioned ah, finishing things off with a perfect dessert.  Do you have a favorite one in mind?
R:  [LAUGH].  A favorite dessert?
L:  Mhm?
R:  Um, anything involving chocolate.
L:  Yeah, that always works out pretty well.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, and uh, with cherries or strawberries, makes it even better.
R:  Yeah, my friend used to have something against, um, eating something with fruit in it, for dessert, because she says it doesn't count as dessert.  But, I don't know, if you do it right, I think it can.
L:  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um.  Goodness, I thought this topic would be very easy to talk about.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- since I love food so much.  [LAUGH].
R:  My attitude, definitely.  [LAUGH].
L:  And, um, people ask, you know, you know, what's your -- what's your, you know, what's your favorite food, what do you like?  My answer is, you know, "food".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't really think of anything I -- I won't eat.
R:  I don't have a -- like one favorite, but on my, um, top favorites is definitely -- carrots are in there.  I have a really big thing for carrots and um, a big thing for Indian food, and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- um, what else?  Definitely like salads and such, are my tops.
L:  You don't hear many people say that, I bet?
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, I'm from California.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, maybe you do. [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, um, I mean, that's all great stuff.  I'm not a big fan of meat, myself, but ah --
R:  Yeah, I haven't eaten meat in a long time, but I'm sure that if I started again, that would definitely be on my top list.  But it's been so long, so.
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  So.  Uh, what other part of the question was there?  Or was it just do you like eating at a restaurant or at home?  
L:  Right.
R:  Or -- and what's your perfect meal? 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:   Was that the only two?
L:  I think those were the -- the only two.  Um.
R:  Um.  We can talk about, um, what -- I don't know.
L:  Um.
R:  Thinking.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um.  What was the last restaurant experience you had that was nice?
L:  Oh, that's a good one, question.  Um.  That was nice?  Oh, I gotta -- I guess it's just good to go to a place that would be far more expensive than I would ever choose on my own.  And ah, while it was not an environment I was accustomed to and therefore not particularly comfortable in, it was just a really nice experience to have that.  'Cause- probably it may be once every ten years would be able to afford something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that nice.  And, um, it was just that everything was perfect from start to finish.  From when, you know -- just the atmosphere and the food and the waiters.
R:  What made the atmosphere good?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  What made the atmosphere good?
L:  Um, it was elegant without being pretentious.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  The -- the staff were attentive without being in your face.  [LAUGH].  That's what I often find at --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- expensive restaurants.  I don't like if they're there too much to clean the crumbs off your table.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Or they're always on your-- your back like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as soon as you've finished your last drink of water, they're filling it again, which is really nice, but it's kinda too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  It was a little more laid back than that, so, I really enjoyed that.  Um.
R:  Was that for your birthday or something?
L:  Um, actually it was kind of a random act of kindness, so that made it even more special that it ah, it wasn't necessarily for a particular event.  Just kind of a "just because" kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  That's nice.
L:  Um.  Did you have one in mind as well?
R:  Um.  I'm trying to think of when my last really good restaurant experience was.  I think it was, I had a friend visiting in town and we were trying to figure out where we should eat and we thought we should eat at a restaurant that we'd never eaten at before and so we picked one.  We picked a Thai restaurant called Yum Yum Bangkok just because it was called Yum Yum Bangkok.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  We thought that was funny.  And so when we got there, I really thought I'd actually already eaten at that restaurant and there's an Indonesian restaurant across the street, so we spontaneously went from our -- what we thought was a spontaneous decision to the restaurant across the street.
L:  That's great.
R:  The Indonesian place and it was really, really, really good.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Like, the food was excellent and it was like kind of service where it's not too much in your face and not too unattentive and, um, I don't know that I'd ever eaten Indonesian fo- food before, but everything I ate was so good.
L:  Wow.  I- I'm pretty sure I -- I haven't eaten that cuisine before but, um, Thai food, um, is very good.  I enjoy --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- Thai food very much.
R:  -- it was almost -- it was close to Thai food.  It wasn't anything like shocking, oh my God, I've never had this before.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was kind of a fusion of various other, you know, Asian foods, but I'd definitely recommend it.  It was really good.  And I ate at a French cafe recently that was surprisingly really, really, really good, too.
L:  Why was it surprising?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I thought it was going to be kind of like posh, like too posh and too expensive and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like one of those places where they give you a giant plate with a tiny piece of food on it.  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  And it costs like fifteen dollars. 
L:  Right.
R:  But um, it was -- it wasn't over priced for what it was, at all, and it was just like, everything about it was just -- like, you could tell that they took a lot of care developing, you know, their foods and stuff and they used like really like --
