R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Laura.
R:  This is Maryanne.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  How ya doing?
L:  Oh, not too bad.
R:  You know, this is --
L:  Spring cle- --
R:  I'm sorry, [LAUGH].
L:  Spring cleaning [LAUGH].
R:  You doing -- oh, spring cleaning?
L:  Spring cleaning.
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  We finally got some warm weather here.
R:  Exac- well, where are you calling from?
L:  New Brunswick.
R:  Oh, I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh, yes [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Nice and warm down there [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, it's wonderful.  I got up and did my yard this morning.
L:  [LAUGH] yes, I have a friend down there who, ah, who j- put -- planted t- tomatoes last month. I'm going, "Oh, my goodness" [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, my husband has a small garden.  He just did tomatoes and -- oh, you know what?  We can't get off the subject! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  I wasn't even thinking -- my daughter got me into this and she said we have to talk at least eight minutes on the subject, so [SIGH] and I know they tape us, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the thing was about illness and they specified colds.  I w- I could have talked plenty about just j- illness in general, but colds --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I don't know about [LAUGH].
L:  -- I find if you get outside at least once a day, especially during the winter, because you're closed up in the house all the time.  Everything's closed down, okay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you're not getting your change of fresh air.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And if you have people coming in and out of your home, you get more exposed to the germs.  So by getting outside for at least twenty minutes, no matter how cold it is out, 'cause you can always dress warm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right?
R:  That's true.
L:  And get that fresh air into your lungs and that makes a big difference.  And I take vitamins.
R:  Oh, now, see I started vitamins, oh, a few years back and I'm so bad about taking medicine for a while and then I just give up on it, so ...
L:  Well you see, what I do is I take our vitamins at supper time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So this way we sit down to supper, 'cause we always have a sit down meal --
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  -- and the vitamins sitting right there beside your glass.  So it's ... [LAUGH] 
R:  But, now that works.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you know.  And I always did that with the kids and, um --
R:  How many children do you have?
L:  Five.
R:  Oh, really?  We've got four.
L:  P- plus I've been a foster h- ah, um, a foster home for teens and young ones and, ah, this is my first break, [SIGH] ah, this year in, well, since I started having kids [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I babysat for twenty nine years and I just quit last year --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at the end of last year.
L:  Well, yeah, it's funny 'cause I -- I've been looking after two boys.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and they stay a lot for supper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I got them started on vitamins and the mom was saying that last year her boys missed so much school because they constantly had colds or whatever was going around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I put 'em on the vitamins and I picked up her so that we'd both be doing the same thing, and they had one cold all winter.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, so she was going, "Well, okay" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, see, my family is as bad as I am.  They'll start something and then not complete it, so even if I laid vitamins out for my two boys that are still here at home, they would just -- after a while I'd probably find them out there the next day, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause everybody's so active here that we don't really have a sit down meal that often.
L:  Yeah.  You see, that's -- see, that was one of my -- my old fashioned things.  My grandmother taught me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is [COUGH] unless it's really, really important, that everybody should be home to have a sit down meal so --
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  -- ev- the family gets together once a day.
R:  Yeah.  Because growing up there were ten kids in my family and we always had sit down meals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yep.  But I guess we just got caught up in the rat race and everybody went --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- their separate ways.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we -- we're up here in Canada.  Over there in Ontario they're dealing with that SARS problem.
R:  Oh, exactly, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, you know?  So it's sort of like --
R:  That's real scare.
L:  -- it's not -- yeah.  It's -- it's, ah, we haven't had it luckily in New Brunswick, but, ah, [LIPSMACK] you know.  It's -- it's [LAUGH] a -- it's a scary thing, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah --
R:  But you know what?  Your vitamin thing, maybe that's helping people if you're really [SIGH] religious about taking your vitamins then --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- maybe it would help.
L:  Yep, I -- I -- I -- every day my husband and I and it's -- it's, ah, it's just sort of a -- an automatic now.  We go in the fridge, we get our milk [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to put on the table and the vitamins -- we keep them in the fridge, right, because of change of temperature.
R:  Oh, now, see, I never thought about that.  I'm so bad about keeping all my medication in that cabinet.  And they say a lot of it should go in the refrigerator.
L:  Mm, 'cause I keep it on --
R:  Just to preserve it.
L:  -- the little -- on the door.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know you always have that little space there on the door and that's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, where we keep our -- our, ah, our -- our vitamins and that because we heat with wood so the house gets very dry in the winter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right?  And then it gets very humid in the summer.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Right?  So this way, it's kept -- the pills are always kept at a constant temperature.
R:  That's true.  See, I just don't think things through like that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's the advantage of having the internet because, you know, there's always -- you know, you're all -- ah, you're always wandering around, um, especially for me, and I run across on this and that in the strangest of places.  You know?  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We also -- we try to have at least one glass of orange juice a day.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  You know, so to get at least -- at least, ah, our vitamin C. that way, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, ah, we live way out in the country, so the corner store is like, not around the corner.
R:  Oh, exactly.  Yeah.  [SIGH] Now, I grew up in the country and then we moved into town when I was in the fourth grade and of course, I lived in Kansas.  I was raised in Kansas [SIGH] and then my husband and I moved to Texas about two years after we got married and we've been here ever since.
L:  Well, I grew up in Montreal for forty -- for the -- for twenty years, when I got pregnant with my first child, I said, "Get up, I'm not raising my children [SIGH] in this pollution".  You know?
R:  Uh huh.
L:  And I moved out and I got moved to New Brunswick here five years ago and, yeah, the con- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- we're close to Fredericton and the city is so small it's like our suburb from Montreal, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really.
L:  So when you -- when you -- like, [LIPSMACK] five minutes either way you're out in the country.
R:  Oh.  Oh --
L:  So --
R:  That'd be wonderful.  I'd love to be in the country.
L:  I'd -- I'd, ah -- I just -- I just love it, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can -- I mean, we just walk across the highway and there's a big road all the way through, all through the woods and, ah, 'cause I think it -- fresh air is one of the most important things, you know, that, ah, to -- to -- to keep you healthy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, to keep the lungs healthy, to k- you know, to get all that stale air, uh, outta ya -- outta ya, you know.  I think that's the best.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, ah, and the exercise too [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah, that's true.  And I don't get either of them [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause like today we -- we were -- we're getting up to about seventy degrees, so, ah, we finally have like -- 'cause we plastic our windows because we get a lot of, ah, very strong, ah, winds here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay?  'Cause we're up, like, um, up from a valley so we really get very strong winds.  I mean, and maybe two days a year we don't get winds here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So we -- we plastic our windows.  So I'm just -- today, finally, we've had enough nice days that I just, ah, unplastic a few windows and I got doors open and I've washed curtains and [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, that sounds wonderful.  See, I just get set in my ways.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My blinds stay closed, my windows are closed, the air is running and -- I know that's not good.  I got my -- a little bit of fresh air this morning when I went out and mowed the yard and that's about it.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, ah, what's funny, I never get colds.  I'm about the only one in the family -- well, my husband and I.  The -- the kids get colds all the time and I've got a daughter with four children and they've all got asthma.  And I think part of that is they're stuck inside so much.  They don't r- -- they're not that active.  They don't get out a lot.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- it's -- it's -- there's a big change from when -- when I grew up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the kids today.  The kids today spend a lot of time in front of the -- the TV --
R:  TV and the internet.
L:  -- or the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or the Gameboys, and, ah, kids are just not getting enough exercise, they're not getting enough fresh air --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and they're -- so they're constantly stuck and -- and then they go to school and so they're stuck in environments where there's hundreds of kids and the -- the air's not changed, so you get w- when a bad cold or flu goes around, you f- you find half the school out.
R:  That's true and that happens here so much.
L:  [COUGH] They -- they -- they used to have -- we used to have recess, you know, twice a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we used to get outside.  We used to have gym.  That -- the schools don't have that any more.
R:  Now, here, I noticed that the elementary schools, they -- they're still out on the playground during recess, I mean, but then when they get into middle school and high school, they don't really offer that much, unless the kid's go out for sports.  They they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- outside for that.  Other than that, they're inside.  They have gym inside and -- yeah, so they're not getting out at all.  And then once they get home, most kids just go home to an empty house, they're gonna get in front of the TV or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're not going to get out and hang out with their friends outside.
L:  Well, when my kids were growing up, it was always they came in from school and, no matter how cold it was, I wanted them to go out and play for at least half an hour outside so to get their -- some fresh air, get the brain going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- again so, you know, and same thing growing -- my kids took vitamins growing up, ah, maybe one cold a year and that was it.
R:  You know, that [SIGH] and my kids, when they were little, they took vitamins and they didn't mind taking 'em.  As they get older, they kind of get away from all that.  They just -- they think they've got their own -- well --
L:  Well -- well -- I'm -- I'm --
R:  -- they have their own mind and --
L:  I'm -- I'm a -- I'm a tough lady.  You --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like [LAUGH] --
R:  But I guess I have --
L:  "I'm the boss of this house and Mommy says you take vitamins and that's it". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess I wasn't tough enough 'cause when --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I got started they were too old to do that so I didn't push it.
L:  [LAUGH] No, and then when they moved out, I gave 'em all the bottles I'd [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kept the regimen going, so -- and they -- and -- and because they got into such a routine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they do it automatic now.
R:  But that is good, yeah.  Once you get in a routine, then it's ki- uh, 'cause I'm that way about certain things.  You get in a routine and it's hard to get away from it, you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just feel guilty if you fall away from it.
L:  Yep, ah --
R:  But I haven't got that instilled in my kids yet, so --
L:  Well, another is -- is good sleep, you know, proper sleeping, ah, you
