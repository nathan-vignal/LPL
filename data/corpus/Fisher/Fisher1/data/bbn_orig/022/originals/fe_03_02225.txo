L:  Hello?  
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, there.
R:  Hello.  Okay.  Um.  Just a minute.  I'll pick up now.  Just a minute.  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH].  I waited so long and I interrupted a movie and then I decided to listen to the movie while I waited, and uh, goofed up.  Okay.
L:  Oh, well.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  What's your name?
R:  Oh, it's, ah, Bob.
L:  And my name is Beatrice.  And what city are you in?
R:  I'm in Fort Lauderdale, Florida --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- Beatrice.
L:  I'm in New York City.  I'm from Manhattan.
R:  I've heard of it.  Yes.
L:  Have you, now?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I used to have a shirt by that name.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That doesn't count.
R:  I see.  [LAUGH].  No, my home originally was Buffalo, New York.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I went to [inaudible] University --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I well know New York, yes.
L:  How did you find out about this study?
R:  Ah, somebody emailed me.
L:  Oh.  It sounds like great fun.  This is my first call.
R:  Yeah, I had one earlier today, but -- and so, this is my se-  -- well, then somebody else called and they couldn't do a match up.
L:  Oh.
R:  I see.  I guess it's always a man and a woman?
L:  I don't know.  It --
R:  I don't know, either.
L:  -- it was that way in the past?  
R:  Yeah --
L:  The prior one was a -- a woman?
R:  Oh, you had two women?
L:  No, no, no.  I've never -- I've never um, spoken to anyone before.
R:  Okay.  And the subject is food.
L:  Food and which do you -- each of us prefer, home or restaurant and describe the perfect meal.
R:  I see.  Well, I'll take the home cooked ah, meal.  What would -- would -- or would you rather have the rest- -- which would you rather have?
L:  Well, you know, I really enjoy eating at home.  I really limit my restaurant going to once or twice a week, but they're really health considerations.  It's not that I don't like the food.
R:  Yeah, now you see, you and I are on the same wavelength here. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we are not going to be able to debate the issue.  We are just going to be embellishing --
L:  [LAUGH]. Okay.
R:  -- each other's situation.  Yeah.  I -- I, like you, um, found ah -- ah -- that -- that eating is an enjoyable pastime and then it is sort of an entertainment sort of thing but, ah, the main purpose of eating is nutrition.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, if, um, you enjoy life and want to stay around here awhile, then you've got to dwell on the fact that ah, food isn't what it used to be.
L:  Yeah.  And one never knows what goes into it.
R:  Well, yeah, and there are so many things that ah -- fast cooked and ah -- you can't blame the restaurant owner.  He's out to make ah -- money.
L:  Sure.
R:  And so, um, I doubt if there's many times when you go out that things are slow cooked except at perhaps in big cities like where you are where the restaurant -- ah --prices can be exorbitantly high.
L:  This is -- this is very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, but I have found, in New York, some wonderful restaurants that I enjoy going to with friends and in fact, one of them is at NYU.   New York University --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- has a vegan meal once a month --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's in a different cafeteria each time.  It's a buffet.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it's really, really lovely.  There are no animal products of any sort.  Things are a bit excessively salty, but there are tons of salads and wonderful stir fries and even the desserts are -- are very natural things like tofu ice cream and things --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- like that.  And it's only eight dollars.  It's a really wonderful meal so I look upon that as not only nourishing, but a social occasion when I can gather my friends around me and we can sit for three hours and talk at leisure and eat all we want and it's great fun.
R:  [LAUGH].  I love that all -- all -- all you want.  And also, um, it -- I eat when I am with -- being a bachelor, ah -- when I'm with people, I have a tendency to eat even more slowly than I do at home as I watch television.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, therefore, ah -- ah -- I only cook one meal a day.  Two meals a day I eat ah -- uncooked food.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So the third meal of the day I normally do in a microwave which is still deleterious because of the fact that ah, the microwave has radiations that -- that change the molecular structure of the food.  So you're -- plus the temperature gets over a hundred and eighteen degrees which, again, changes all the -- the nutritional value and the content of the food.  And particularly the enzymes, but of course, you know all that, right?
L:  Well, I would be curious to know what kind of cooking you actually do in the microwave because I too, have a microwave, but I never, quote, cook in it.  The only thing I ever do is like, I'll make a baked potato --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or an ear of corn in the, ah, husk.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I even bake in -- ah -- with my microwave.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  See, I've never tried that.
R:  Yeah.  You don't -- you don't get a -- a high rising item.  Y- you just get -- but something very solid and consistent so, um, if -- if you like chewing on things and ah -- you know, it's -- it's a harder, more firmer thing because you don't have the, ah the rise in -- in the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the dough.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But um, the -- the thing I was getting to, is during the course of a meal, um, I like my things hot and so, ah, there's three or four times I go back to th- the microwave to get another portion which I keep, ah, warm.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, if you're out at a restaurant, when they serve the main entree and you're gonna chat with somebody, by the time you get to most of what's on yo- your plate, ah, the food is cool.
L:  Absolutely.  If you've ever eaten pizza in a restaurant, you know how gummy the -- the cheese gets before you've had the last slice?
R:  Yeah.  I remember once I was in, ah, oh, where was it?  New Orleans area, was it?  Yes.  And ah, they had a pizza -- we went for lunch at a pizza place and you only took your one little piece off the grill and they had every kind of pizza in the world there and it was a large sort of buffet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you just went up and chopped off a -- whatever kind of pizza you wanted, went back and sat down and -- and the pizza was kept warm on -- on a warming --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- grill, so to speak.
L:  Yeah.  But see, even in New York, when they keep food warm, like I've -- I've seen it, um, they will keep it warm under lights and I really wonder about the bacteria that must accumulate that way.
R:  Well --
L:  I don't -- it doesn't sound healthy.
R:  What about your -- your, um, at NYU and you had your buffet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wha- what about the -- let's say the -- the, um, contamination there, of hands and coughing and --
L:  Well, th -- all this is true.  This is true and now with SARS, it's especially scary, isn't it?
R:  Yes.  But --
L:  I love Chinese food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I adore Chinese food.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I do.  I do.  I love it.
R:  Yeah.  Everybody does, but the -- the thing.  No.  Let me just ask -- go back to the -- the buffet?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do they have sort of a window coming across the food so that it's --
L:  Well, ye- yes.  They have the so called --
R:  Protection.
L:  -- coughing -- cough screens or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- sneeze screens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then the things that are being prepared by the preparers, are behind glass.  You have no access to it.  You merely point at what you want and they put --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it together for you.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So it's fresh.  They do stirfries, they do sandwiches.
R:  Oh.
L:  And there are a few things that are already prepared --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like they do -- they do a mock chicken nugget kind of thing.  It's a -- a ah, I guess it's gluten -- gluten nuggets, which, by the way, are delicious 'cause I --I only have, like, one or two or them, just to taste, but they're very good.  And the funny thing is, you see the kids carrying their trays and they're eating the same crap, though it's not, as they would outside.  They're eating the mock hamburgers and the mock hotdogs and the french fries and the onion rings.
R:  Uh.
L:  It's just so funny that they -- they -- they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess they don't perceive that it's not the same thing, but in their minds they treat it as if it were.
R:  Mhm.  I was, um, waiting in a -- in a tailor shop today and th- there was a woman there with a child that was extremely developed for a two year old and I just said, "My goodness, two year old".  And she's talking intelligently and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very alert and so I said, "Do you give her vitamins?"  And the wo- -- the mother said, "No, she won't take them".  And I said, "What do you mean?"  And she said, "Well, she just spits them out".  And I said, "Even the liquid?"  "She knows what it is and doesn't take it."
L:  Mhm?
R:  And um, and I said, "Well, why don't you insist she take her vitamins or you don't feed her?"  She said, "Well, she'll sit there for two hours and not eat anyway."
L:  Oh.
R:  So she said, "That doesn't work".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I said, "Well, when I was very little, um, my mother got this Betty Crocker cookbook and there was a fandangled recipe in there and I noticed that as we were eating dinner that evening, my father wasn't relishing it, I could tell by the expression on his face, so I decided to mimic my father, but I mimicked him so -- so much, I got myself so upset that I had to excuse myself from the table and ah, go and throw up and --"
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because I had put myself into such a tantrum, don't you see, about -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- disliking the food.  And my parents were very helpful when I came back to the table.  There, indeed, was a clean plate with a fresh helping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I was told the -- to either finish the dinner, ah, or you would go to bed and miss dessert. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, from then on I never, ever, disliked --
