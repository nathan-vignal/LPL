R:  Hi, this is Jamie Free.
L:  Hi, this Randy.
R:  Hi, Randy.
L:  Hi.  Where are you at?
R:  Minnesota.
L:  Oh, I'm in Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh.  Wonderful.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].  Ah, so, are there allergies in Minnesota [SIGH]?
R:  Are they what?
L:  Allergies in Minnesota?
R:  Yes, very high pollen count.  Um, bare [NOISE] 'cause we haven't had any rain.  So it's very --
L:  Say it again?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Will you [inaudible] again?
R:  I still don't understand.
L:  Wa- you just said I didn't --
R:  Oh, you didn't understand what I said?
L:  No, no, no.  What we -- what was that?
R:  Oh, we have very high pollen count right now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it's very dry and we have very little rain.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yes, so the pollen count is very high.  There's a lot of, um, as the things are budding out the -- and, ah, all the leaves are dropping, there's a lot of pollen in the air.
L:  Right, right.  Well, that --
R:  So we --
L:  -- do you think that -- does that -- is that normal?  It's like will -- will there -- will it rain later in the summer or does it just not rain during the summer there?
R:  It just hasn't rained much this spring.  It's just been very dry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so maybe the end of the week we may get some, because things are slow greening up, and once things start greening up and the trees can bud out, then the pollen count will drop way down.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And if there's any weeds in the fields, there's still -- that makes it really bad for this time of the year.
L:  Yeah.  It's in -- it's been nice here for quite a while.  Um, it doesn't really get very smoggy but, um, it hasn't rained for a while so it's starting to build up.  So Seattle's in the middle of, like, of two mountain ranges.
R:  Oh --
L:  I- it's like --
R:  -- didn't realise that.
L:  -- in the middle of -- it's in the middle of a valley, kind of.  Well, it's -- there's like -- there's the Puget Sound and there's the mountains on one side of it and on the other, and Seattle's in the middle of that.  Um, and so, if there's no wind and no rain, the smog just kinda sits here and --
R:  But you have wet conditions there more, don't you?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- you -- it rains -- it rains probably five days a week, usually --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Oh, well, it depends on the -- it depends on the, um, the -- the s- and during the --during the su- spring, usually, something like that. Um, but when I say "rain", it's not like Minnesota rain where it's thunder and lightning and coming down.  It's -- it's cloudy and kind of misting --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- all the time.
R:  I think --
L:  It mists --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- a lot.
R:  -- does that help with your pollen, then?
L:  It does. It does.  It --
R:  It --
L:  -- keeps -- it -- it's actually -- I -- I like it, 'cause I have allergies, um.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it keeps it -- keeps the pollen and, um, and smog down, but it -- it also makes, um -- it makes the, um, ah, it makes mold.  So that's the --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- allergy that --
R:  The dampness.  The dampness --
L:  -- but, ah --
R:  -- that's another -- just another area.
L:  Right, right.  So it helps with some, but makes others worse.
R:  I have a son who, um, have -- as he got a little bit older -- he's twenty four now, and he's had a lot of problems with allergies.  He walks around with Kleenex all the time. So he left the state to go to New Mexico.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And -- and everything -- he said, as soon as he crosses the border, he can just throw his Kleenex in the back seat.  Doesn't need 'em anymore.
L:  Really.
R:  Mhm.  So it's always because there's so many trees.  I don't know if you've ever been to Minnesota.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the -- a lot of trees and a lot of -- of dry areas, ah, big open fields, so there's a lotta -- and it gets pretty windy, so there's a lot of it drifting around.
L:  Right.  My grandparents, um, they moved from western Washington to eastern Washington.  Have you ever been to Washington?
R:  No.
L:  Um, there's Seattle where it's -- there's a rainforest in west -- west of Seattle, um, where -- like, it's, ah, it's the only, um, temperate rainforest in the world.  Um, but -- and then, Seattle's really wet and then there's the Cascade mountain range and then, after that, it's desert because, ah, the, um, the clouds can't get over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, um, my grandparents and my -- a couple of my uncles moved to eastern Washington to get away from the mold and, um, so they live over there and they commute to -- over the mountains, um, prob- like, every other week for work.  So --
R:  And it makes that much difference, just living in a different part of the -- of Washington?
L:  Ye- yeah.  It's -- it's the difference of, um --
R:  +Elevations??
L:  No, no.  There's just no, ah -- their problem is mold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And since it very rarely rains in the east -- in eastern Washington, they -- they're -- like they don't have a mold problem at all.
R:  Oh, I didn't realise that, that there was that much difference just in that one state [SIGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eastern Washington's a -- is a -- is a desert.  There's -- it's always really hot.  It's either really hot or really cold and --
R:  I did not know that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  It --
L:  -- there's --
R:  -- surprises me.
L:  It's pretty surp- yeah, it surprises me too.  It's kinda -- it's weird, but, yeah.
R:  And what did she say about seeing the doctor in seven to ten days or something?
L:  Um, there was a -- a saying that said, um, if you have a cold and you go to the doctor, it'll be better in seven days.  Or if you -- if you have a cold and you don't go to the doctor, it'll be better in seven days, and if you go to the -- have a cold and go to the doctor, it'll be better in a week.
R:  Mhm, I've never heard that.
L:  I, ah --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- neither have I [LAUGH].
R:  It -- no [LAUGH], I treated or untreated, it's just gonna run it's course [SIGH]?
L:  Pretty much, I think that's what sh- they were getting at.
R:  I think so.  I -- I -- like I said, I -- I never heard that expression before.
L:  I think, when it comes to allergies, I think it's worth seeing the doctor because -- I don't know about you, but -- but allergy medicine is -- it helps me get through it.
R:  Yes, allergy, definitely -- the medication definitely makes a difference.  There's a lot of -- a lotta different meds and they don't work the same for everyone [SIGH].
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't know how well the -- the Benadryl, those over the counter type of things work.  I don't think real well for people that have a lot of allergies, like, to the pollen.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I have problems with, ah, fresh mown lawn.  If --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I'm driving -- yes.  If I -- if I am driving past someone that has -- is mowing their lawn, I have to shut my car windows and I'll immediately get all stuffy.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have -- I have a -- a problem with cigarette smoke.  When I -- like when I go out to a, um, to a restaurant where there's like the smoking section --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- right next to the non smoking section, I come home stuffy and I can't breathe and -- and like my -- my throat hurts.
R:  Hmm.  What --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- about if you're, like, in a -- in an atmosphere where there's a lot of it, like in a bar or someplace where there's a lot of it?  Do you just not go in those places or --
L:  Um, I mean I do, but I very rarely because of it.
R:  It's not so bad when you're in it.  It's more after you get out of it, right?
L:  Yeah, while I'm in it, like I can feel that it's getting bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when I leave is when I kind of notice that, like, my throat hurts and it's -- it's -- it's kinda delayed.  Luckily I --
R:  Does your nose run, your -- do you have a --
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  -- runny nose and your eyes water?
L:  And my eyes water and my throat hurts.  My throat gets --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kinda raw.
R:  What about -- what about animals like cat dander?
L:  Cat doesn't do me too bad.  Um, dogs a little worse.  Um, but luckily, I -- I take, um, medicine for it, so --
R:  Are you --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- prescription med?
L:  Yeah, I take, um, Nasenex[?].
R:  Mm, okay.  I -- I am familiar with it, but I don't know of anyone who's taken that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of people that I know, um [SIGH] -- the name escapes me right now.  Um, not Claritin.  It's the other kind of --
L:  Allegra?
R:  -- the main competitor.  Allegra.  That's the one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lotta people have good results with that.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've taken that.  Um, I found that Zertec[?] works better for me, though.
R:  A lot of the OTC drugs will make you sleepy.
L:  Yeah, yet --
R:  Like one reason --
L:  -- for --
R:  -- people try to stay away from them?
L:  I can't take -- I can't take Benadryl 'cause it knocks me out right away.
R:  Right.  And --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- they have some non drowsy stuff but it still makes you tired.
L:  Right.  It makes you tired --
R:  And I can't -- [SIGH] right.  And I take anything like that when I'm working because I -- I commute, like, forty five minutes away and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- um -- and I'm in [inaudible] so I need to have my wits about me, can't be tired and can't have my -- my -- you know, can't feel disoriented, so I don't take any kind of allergy meds.  I just kinda have to put up with it until I get back home.
L:  Right.  Ha.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- I -- I -- go ahead.
R:  Um, but there's also some of 'em that they say that is -- I like to go to like a twelve hour, um, decongestant or something like that, because -- obviously, because it's just longer lasting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And some of them, like Chlorotrymaton[?] is an OTC drug, but that -- that seems to help a lot in not -- and -- and goes the duration, pretty close to twelve hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm also not worth medicating if it's just things like -- like alfalfa and grass, certain things like that, it -- it's -- it's not that bothersome.  I'm not going to, you know, like people that have pollen in the air allergies or around cats, something, ah -- mine is -- is more sporadic, you know.  When I'm gonna come across somebody who's mowing their lawn.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So it's not -- it's almost not wo- medicating for.
L:  Right.  That --
R:  And the --
L:  -- makes sense.
R:  -- season -- the seasons haven't been like they used to be
