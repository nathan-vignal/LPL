R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Kena[?].  Who's this?
L:  This is Rachel.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Philadelphia.  What about you?
R:  I'm in Oxnard, California.
L:  Great. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what about the topic?  What -- what do you like better, the food -- eating at a restaurant or at home?
R:  Well, actually, I never cook.  So eating out --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- is the best thing for me.
L:  So you have no choice [LAUGH] at all in the matter.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't like to cook.  I mean, I have a husband, a roommate and they can tell you, I rarely cook.  Now, last night I did, but normally I don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you?
L:  Um, I guess I prefer a restaurant.  I don't have a lot of money, so whenever I do go --
R:  I don't either. [LAUGH].
L:  -- go to a restaurant, it's a big treat. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  What's your favorite kind of meal?
R:  Um, I'm pretty much open to a lot of different types of, um, food.  There's a particular --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- place here I prefer, it's called California Pizza Kitchen.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah, we have one of those too.
R:  But -- oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you go there, sometimes?
L:  Yeah.  I've been there.  It's pretty good.
R:  What -- what do you normally get there.
L:  They have this -- don't they have like, a pineapple pizza or something?
R:  A -- a Hawaiian pizza there.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I've had that.  That's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  I've had that.
L:  So, you like pizza the best?
R:  Actually, I go -- I like their pastas.
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  Their pasta's pretty good.  I've had, um, their Sicilian pizza there and, um, they have this Kung Pow[?] spaghetti, which is actually pretty good.  Kinda spice --
L:  Kung Pow spaghetti?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH].
L:  So it's like, Asian inspired?
R:  Yeah.  It's hot, it's spicy, it's got shrimp in it, peanuts, ginger, a lot of, um, hot chilies and other stuff in there as well.
L:  Wow.  Huh.  Um, where's Oxnard?  Is it by LA?
R:  Yeah, it's about a hour, um, north of LA.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you know where -- have you been to California?
L:  Yes, I've been to both LA and San Francisco.
R:  Oh, okay.  Like, that's not the only place there. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, Oxnard is, like I said, it's about a hour away from, um, Los Angles. If --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- you know where Malibu is, we're like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're the next city up from it.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  A little small -- well, not really small, it's about -- nearly a hundred and seventy thousand people here.
L:  Huh.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So I have --
L:  And you have a California Pizza Kitchen. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, of course. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We have a lot of -- ah, where I live -- this area's predominantly, um, Hispanic, so there's a lot of, um, Mexican restaurants --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- all over the place.
L:  Yeah.  That must be so good.  We don't have that many Mexican restaurants here.
R:  I can imagine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Actually in New York, there's quite a few, but for some reason there hasn't been a lot of -- I don't think there's a big Mexican population here.
R:  Mhm.  Here it's -- I mean, we're so close to Mexico --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the border is only like, three hours away from here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So there's a lot of people in th- this particular city where I live, there's so ma- -- so many things in Spanish, that if you don't speak it sometimes you're like, "Oh, uh -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  What's going on?"
L:  Huh.
R:  And like I say, there are plenty -- there are some Mexican restaurants pretty much on every corner.
L:  Really?
R:  There are all these bakeries, everything.  All over the place.
L:  Do you like Mexican?
R:  I do, but I mean, when you see it this much ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You get kinda sick of it.
R:  You don't -- you don't want it.
L:  I know.  For us it's a big treat, because I think there's only about two good restaurants in the city, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- whenever we go, it's -- I really look forward to it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's nothing like --
R:  So --
L:  -- nachos. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those are pretty good.  They have a place here that they make 'em kinda messy, but I mean, it's good.  It's like they dumped the kitchen sink on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- it's pretty good here.
L:  Huh.
R:  Since it's like, what, almost nine o'clock you guys' time?
L:  Yeah.  It's about --
R:  Did you cook tonight?  Or did you go out, or ...?
L:  Um, I cooked -- well, I had leftovers actually.  Pizza [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that I just heated up.  Yeah, um, I'm a student, so I didn't get home from school 'til really late --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'til like, a few minutes ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, what's your major?
L:  Well, I'm in law school, actually.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  My roommate's, um -- is waiting to pass the bar.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  She's actually --
L:  The California bar.
R:  Yeah, her [inaudible] --
L:  That's the hardest one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she will agree it's the hardest one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's crazy.  I don't -- I don't think I could ever pass that bar. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, other people here, they have trouble, ah, with the California bar, but I mean, you gotta do it.
L:  Yeah.  Is she practising law now?  Or ...?
R:  No, 'cause you can't do it until you pass that.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah, I -- I guess that's -- I don't know if that's the same in your state, or --
L:  I think it depends where you work.  I think some people will let you start and they -- you just won't be able to go to court, until you pass.
R:  Oh, okay.  Can they make -- I think that may be different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something tells me I'll have to ask her.  Um, are you originally from, um --
L:  Yeah.  I grew up -- my, um, parents live outside, in the suburbs of Philly, so I grew up here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, I've lived -- but I've lived in Denver and New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And North Carolina too, actually.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  I'm originally from Memphis, Tennessee, but I went to college in Saint Louis and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- after school I'm -- I actually moved here.
L:  Huh.  I've been through Memphis.  I love it there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's cool.
L:  It was really what I -- I went to school in -- in, um, North Carolina so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we drove around a bunch and I -- I mean, in Memphis it was just such a great city.
R:  Right.
L:  It was like, sma- -- not too big, but still had a lot of fun stuff to do, and great weather --
R:  And barbeque.
L:  Barbeque. [LAUGH] Good.  Graceland, we went to.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is pretty good.
L:  So, what do you do?
R:  I'm an engineer.  I work for the government.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So it's keeping me busy.
L:  Wow.
R:  Now.
L:  That's great.
R:  So when do you get out of school?
L:  Um, I have another year.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, I just finished up some final exams this week and, um, I'll have the summer to do an internship, and then another year of school and then I'll -- and then I'll be free. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good -- good.  That's good.
L:  Which will be good.  Yeah.
R:  And keep your options open for the, um -- for the summertime.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Well, then again, there some extra -- do you know, you know, what type of law you want to practice?
L:  Yeah, I think I'm -- I'm either thinking of civil rights law, or --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- um, kind of housing law, like landlord tennant stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but this -- this summer I'm doing the housing law, so I'm going to see what I -- what I like. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  And that may be good in California. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Seriously, I -- yeah.  You guys -- there's a lot going on. [LAUGH]
R:  There is a lot going on.  Here in California --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's so, um, not -- I don't -- [MN] the rent here is so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For what you get.  I mean, I sometimes wish I was back east.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The pressure living here -- I mean, I like living where -- a place where it's cool --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- in the summertime, and nice in the winter, but, oh, you pay for it.  That's the biggest killer to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Is this your first, um, phone call?
L:  Yeah, it i- -- it is.  Um --
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH].
L:  -- but -- y- -- it is? [LAUGH] I don't know if we're supposed to keep talking about the subject or ...? [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.  I know -- I think they're gonna beep us at ten minutes or so or ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I --
L:  Do you know how long it's been?
R:  Um, I have no idea. [LAUGH]  So --
L:  [LAUGH] So, how did you hear about this?
R:  Well, someone emailed me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about it.  Um, I'm actually a mystery shopper also.
L:  Oh.
R:  So that's why I know a lot about a lot of different, ah, restaurants.  You may want to think about trying it, um, in your area.
L:  Hm.
R:  But -- do you know much about mystery shopping?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  A mys- -- if you have free time, and if you like to go out to eat, it's basically -- you go to different restaurants, evaluate, um, their services, their food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the quality of the people that serve or -- generally you get paid for your meal plus, um, you get compensated for doing a -- a small report.
L:  Hm.
R:  Which is like -- pretty simple.  I mean, you don't -- can't get rich off of it, but if you don't like to cook ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH].
R:  Perfect thing to do.
L:  Huh.
R:  Perfect thing to do.  I mean when --
L:  Who runs it?  Who runs the program?
R:  Different types of, um, companies run it.  If you go to, um, Volition --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- dot com?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Click on, Get Paid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you will see a lot of different jobs.
L:  Oh.
R:  Also, mystery shop dot O.R.G.
L:  Hm.
R:  There're jobs all over the United States, in different parts of the world, different countries, all over.  And that's one reason I like to go out to eat, because I can do it for free.
L:  Right.  And where do the reviews go?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Go to the company.
L:  Oh, they do.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, they go to the companies to let them know how their people are doing, if they -- if they suck, or if they're not --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- living up to the quality of the claims they have, I don't know, ten shrimp in the salad and there's eight, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  They need to know there's two missing or, you know, whatever the case may be.
L:  Hm.
R:  So --
L:  Interesting.  Never heard of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I mean, it's -- a lot of people don't know about it.  A friend of mine in Milwaukee told me about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was like, well, let me try it out, and I've been hooked for almost a year.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH] Well, I'll definitely look into that.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's the --
L:  Um, do you know how long -- I think it's been, what like [SIGH] six minutes or so?  I don't know.
R:  Mm, I have no idea. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I don't know, maybe eight or so, I think, pretty soon they'll probably buzz in.
L:  Okay.  I think it [inaudible].
R:  You know, I can't really tell what they're trying to test.
L:  Yeah, I think it might be our speaking styles, or something like that.
R:  I -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I looked at the web site and I was trying to find out, you know, what exactly, you know, what are you actually testing?  Are you trying to see if a person is from a different place --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how are they speaking, versus, you know, what have you?  I mean, I'm from the south, but I've never sounded like a southerner, with a twang like --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- "How y'all -- how y'all doing", you know or -- [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Or whatever the case, you know, may be.  I don't know if they're testing that or --
L:  Yeah, maybe it's that.
R:  You know.
L:  Maybe they're trying to create kind of, you know those -- when you call in and they can recognize your voice, or they can, you know, you speak into the phone for the automated systems.
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe they're trying to create one of those and --
R:  Could be.
L:  -- um, just wanna hear how people pronounce different words, I guess.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that could be, especially for -- or on services like, um, like [inaudible].  I think when you call thier one eight hundred number, you can say, you know, "One --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- two", or things like that and -- trying to get a general, you know, what does it sound like for someone that's from, you know, Philadelphia or someone from Oxnard or ...  I'm probably not a good representation of Oxnard, but -- [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Huh.
R:  You know.  I guess that's -- I don't know.
