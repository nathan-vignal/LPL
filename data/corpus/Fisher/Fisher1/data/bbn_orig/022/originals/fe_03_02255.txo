L:  Hi, my name's Darlene.  I'm calling from Pennsylvania.
R:  Hi, I'm Leslie and I'm from Indiana.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  Did you understand everything that the topic's about today?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I kinda got that.  When I first called in, I couldn't understand a word it said, so this one I pretty much got.  Um, basically, how, um, [LIPSMACK] it seems like a lot of people get sick when the seasons change and [SIGH] [MN] just about illness in general, if you [MN] -- they kinda threw out, you know, do doctors do any good too and ... things like that as well, I guess.  Um, well, I -- I mean if I get sick it's usually in the first three months of the year, it seems like, head colds, kind of thing.  But, um, actually, I noticed the last [SIGH] two or three times I had gotten sick enough to actually go to the doctor, it was right after I went to the dentist, so we've kind of discovered I tend to get sick from that [LAUGH].
L:  That's kinda funny.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't really -- I -- I just -- so that I kinda got the same thing.  I wasn't sure of everything they said, but I kinda got it was just do you get sick during the change of seasons and stuff.  But I -- I know I don't.  I actually am a nurse and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I get a flu shot every year.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So if I get sick, it's usually after that, but this year, I didn't.  So, I don't really see a [LAUGH] change in seasons affecting me at all.
R:  Yeah, I'm, um, [MN] 'cause really like January, February is not a change that's kind of -- I mean, I guess it's when it gets its worst, but [MN] I mean, I guess that might have more to do with, ah, the dryness of the air.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, 'cause I definitely don't think -- you know, like my mom tells you, you go outside and get sick 'cause it's cold.  Well [LAUGH], it -- it might help -- help the virus a little more, but it doesn't make you sick by itself.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah, and I can't convince her of that, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They still swear, if you get cold, you get sick [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm -- I -- I don't think that I agree with that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but -- 'cause I know I was outside.  I don't know how your winter was, but we had a lot of snow, so I was out shoveling repeatedly and stuff and out for lengths of time and everything so ...
R:  Yeah, that wouldn't be fun.  Um, I have a husband who does that so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't get sick doing that.  Personally, I don't know why he does it either.  I'm like, "Get a" -- we -- we have a pretty big driveway --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like, either have somebody come through and take it out or get a snow blower, because it's just ridiculous to spend hours and hours and hours out [LAUGH] doing that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We -- my husband and I decided after -- we had like, I think it was like, twenty inches over President's Weekend.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  And we were both like, "What are we doing?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We were li- like I didn't called off of work until like seven thirty --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- that Monday morning and so we kinda like took advantage of it and went out a little bit later and we started shoveling and we're just like, "I wouldn't have been to work anyway, it was so much" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so we're like, "Let's get a snow blower" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but did you get sick from it [LAUGH]?
L:  No.
R:  No?  See, I know [LAUGH].
L:  No.  No. It --
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I -- 'cause I tend to have sinus problems anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So if I get something that's usually what it is, but, um, then the last time I'd went to the doctor, I said, "Is there X --" I was going to ask him if this could be connected to going to the dentist, 'cause I just thought it was weird.  Each time, it was right after I'd went to the dentist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] he -- before I even said that, he asked me, "You haven't been to the dentist, have you?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I said, "You're kidding me?"  He goes, "Yeah, I've been noticing that everybody who comes in with this has been to the dentist, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- apparently it's like one of the bacterias that are usually in your mouth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, something's getting happened whether they're cleaning your teeth or giving you the shot or it's -- but I went to the dentist last week and I used lots and lots of mouthwash during and after and before [LAUGH].
L:  Uh huh.
R:  So I haven't got sick, so apparently --
L:  That's really --
R:  -- that'll do it [LAUGH].
L:  -- yeah, I was gonna say, now I haven't actually heard anything about that, but I -- I guess that makes sense.  As you said -- 'cause I actually know my father had back problems and stuff and at the same time he was dealing with problems with his teeth.  And they're just like, "The best thing for you to do is get 'em all removed and just get dentures".  And he did that and his back problems went away.
R:  Hm.
L:  So I know your mouth --
R:  Strange.
L:  -- has a lot a bacteria.
R:  Well, I know.  They also think, um, like, the viruses and stuff may have to do with the heart problems and things like that, too, so who knows [LAUGH]?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But so far as seasons, I don't have that much.  I guess a lot of people also have like allergies.
L:  Well, that's what I was going to say.  Like a- I mean, I don't have any problems with allergies, but I know like, a lot of people I work with have 'em and like, right now, it's like, really bad from -- our pollen's really bad here, um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- in Pennsylvania.
R:  -- that's what -- since I do have a lot of sinus problems, I wonder if it's not maybe all- I've never really been tested or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- anything like that.  So I'm like, maybe it's allergies this whole time and I never knew it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm not really sure.  I guess I -- I don't know.  After you live with it so long, you kind of ignore it, but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LAUGH] at some point, maybe I'll be like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, here I probably coulda been taking something for this all this time.  But, um, yeah, because I remember one day in particular.  I thought, "Man, I can't believe how good I can breathe".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I thought, "You know, that's really pathetic when" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you breathe really easily one day and, like, "Boy, this is new" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah, I really probably ought to go --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- have it checked out, but ...
L:  But it's like one more thing, huh?
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's -- yeah, in between everything else we're doing.  We've been fortunate so far, nobody's been too ill --
L:  Yeah, well, that's -- ah, my husband --
R:  -- this season.
L:  -- like will -- will not go to the doctor for anything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't have a problem going --
R:  That's so funny.  He's married to a nurse [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, "I don't have a problem going, but it's like it's not my favorite place to go", you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I, ah ... yeah, I just, I usually wait is the little lo- -- that's what I was saying, the last time I got sick -- 'cause I hate when it gets like, into your throat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially if it's where it hurts to swallow kind.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can take it otherwise, but that I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's getting too ridiculous.  So, ah, I went right away, as soon as I started getting sick so they started me --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- on antibiotics and then I was fine and I'm like [LAUGH], "I'm gonna have to stop waiting until I'm completely miserable --" 
L:  And just go before, yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], because what's the point?  You know?  It's like by then, you're probably starting to get over it anyway so ...
L:  Right.  Yeah, well --
R:  -- and just being [inaudible].
L:  -- that's --  sometimes like, I've noticed stuff with my ears and I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- just kinda like ignore it, but it -- ah, sometimes I kinda correlate it with always having a stethoscope, you know, in 'em, stuff like that, you know, using that and stuff, but ...
R:  Mm.
L:  I --
R:  Yeah, it could be.
L:  -- it -- nurses are stubborn [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But so are other people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, do you work for a r- just a family physician or --
L:  I work for -- I actually work for a specialist, but I've done all different types.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I've been in hospitals and stuff like that, so now I work for an actual specialist, a gastro enterologist --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um --
R:  So you have to go see a family doctor if you're ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You couldn't just see the person in your office. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, sometime -- depending on what it is sometimes --
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  -- we can get by and all, you know, they'll write out a script for us and stuff like that.  But there's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some things.  It's like, really weird right now.  Like all of us -- we work ten hour days and all of us stand on our feet and like, every single one of us in the office are complaining of like, knee, hip, feet pain.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Well, gee, I wonder why [LAUGH]?
L:  And it's like all of us have done, you know, different sorts of jobs in the same area that we're working in and stuff and done the same kinda stuff, so we don't know if it's something with the structure or not.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, but it's kinda --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's --
R:  I see.  The way --
L:  -- it's very --
R:  -- it's set up --
L:  -- frustrating.
R:  -- you might -- yeah.  We're -- we -- we're lived in a really crammed area right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I can tell, um, my knees have been bothering me more, like when I have to like, turn around tight spots --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, like there's not much room to get around the edge of the bed and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dresser, so when I do that on that side, I can tell that it hurts my knees more.  And I'm like, you know [LAUGH], it's living in this cramped world and all the houses here.  It's like --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not good for you at all [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you -- have you guys decided to build?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's fun.  We just did that last year.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, was it really fun or, "Oh, yeah, that was fun?" [LAUGH]
L:  No, I enjoyed it.
R:  Oh, did ya, okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I just enjoy being at -- like, we looked at older homes and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like they were -- so many of 'em needed so much work that it was like, unbelievable.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, when we decided that we were gonna build, it was just so much fun being able to pick out what my kitchen would look like and what we'd do with our bathrooms and stuff.  And we went with a builder who has pretty much like just model homes they do, and we were happy with what they did.  We did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we didn't do any type of restructuring, but we know some of the people in our development have changed room structures around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- knocked out a wall here, you know, done something different like that with it and stuff.  But we were very happy with what, you know, they offered in that realms.  But then it was just fun to -- you know, picking out your carpet and -- we didn't do any type of upgrading on our painting or anything like that, that's something we'll do down the line, um, but it was just --
R:  Well, that's like --
L:  -- fun.
R:  -- we should have stuff already going and we don't at all.  It's just like, I can't believe it's May.
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what's --
R:  I just like, "What are we gonna do?  It's gonna end up being fall and we're not gonna have a thing done and we'll have to wait til next year or something".
L:  Oh, gosh.  Well, I gotta tell ya, I mean we -- we were like, one of the first ones in this development and it is amazing how much work they did over the winter with how bad a winter we had.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, and they're actually -- I mean it's -- it's like amazing.  It's -- I actually was with my mother today and I was telling her.  I said, "You're not gonna even to recognize the place".  I said, "There's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's like three houses under roof.  They're putting two sidings -- the sides up now and there's three other ones that are poured, and it's just like, amazing --
R:  Hm.
L:  "-- how fast they can put 'em up these days".
