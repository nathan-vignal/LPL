L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Linda.
R:  My name is Meredith.
L:  Hi, Meredith.  So we're supposed to talk about food.
R:  Right.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  I'm in Frisco, Colorado.
L:  Oh, okay.  Anyways, I love to eat in restaurants because that means I don't have to cook [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm the opposite.
L:  Oh, you like to eat at home?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.  What do you like to cook?
R:  Um, [inaudible] myself so we um, we like to cook, you know, soul food but um, we realise now that that's not the most healthiest way to eat. [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  So what do you do?
R:  So we do a lot of grilling, chicken, beef and ah, rice and I still like creamed potatoes and you know, things like that, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, we, ah, we generally eat at home, ninety nine percent of the time.
L:  Well, I can't say that I don't eat at home.  I do too.  I eat at home but I like eating out.  As a matter of fact, tonight -- I use the George -- you know, the George Forman grill?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the chicken turned out really good.  It turned out really good.
R:  We have one of those.  Yeah.
L:  And, I did, um, what did I do?  A lemon and rosemary chicken.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, surprisingly it was cooked perfect. [LAUGH].
R:  That's good.
L:  'Cause I'm not that great of a cook.  [LAUGH].
R:  I love to cook, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, my grandmother was a very good cook and she had some great recipes from Alabama and um, I love to cook and -- but I'm still learning.  I'm -- I guess you could say I'm newly wed so [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, I haven't been cooking that long but um, we both are very picky eaters so if we had a choice of eating out --
L:  It's easier --
R:  -- we would probably eat at home.
L:  -- when you're picky um, to eat at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because then you can get what you want.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It's just like -- we have our favorites like chilies.  Do you guys have chilies out there?
L:  Um, people do, yeah.
R:  Um, Chili's Restaurant?
L:  Oh, a Chili's?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's why --
L:  I've never eaten it at one.
R:  You haven't?
L:  Never.
R:  That is our -- if we eat out, that is where we'd like to eat out and we always get the same thing, though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Everytime, we get the same thing.
L:  What do you get?
R:  Um, it's called a ranch chicken sandwich.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like just a -- a chicken breast with -- and hot sauce, with ranch dressing on a bun.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you get french fries with it. [LAUGH].  It's not really good for you but --
L:  So it's tasty?
R:  My husband -- my husband and I get the same thing every time.
L:  Well, I like the commercial for Chili's, for their baby bang ribs.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH].  'Cause I love ribs and that's one thing I -- I'll eat out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's a restaurant that's fairly close to me that has the greatest ribs.  And you get a lot of them.  I'll go with two other people.  We'll split two dinners and there's plenty to take home for two -- you know, for both of us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like, it's usually like my mom and dad and myself and then I'll take half home and they'll half home.
R:  Right.
L:  Because they give you a large -- a large plate of food.
R:  Yeah, we like that when you can take some home. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  And I eat it for breakfast.
R:  Breakfast?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Ribs?
L:  Or sn- -- Oh, anything.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Anything.  I'm not crazy about breakfast foods.  So --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, yeah.  I -- milk doesn't agree with me, so, um, you know, there goes your cereal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Everything for breakfast is really unhealthy.
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  So --
R:  My husband though, he gets up every morning and eats -- um, fixes himself an omelet with those um, the healthy eggs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] with tomatoes and mushrooms and like fresh vegetables in it.  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and he's real -- he's a real health nut so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he gets up and eats that and a few slices of turkey bacon, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm too lazy to get up that early so I just a fruit and cereal bar.
L:  Right, right.  I --
R:  And orange juice or something.  But, um --
L:  I love fresh fruit.
R:  Yeah.  We do too.
L:  But, um --
R:  Where abouts -- we live right in the middle of the mountains so we're kind of at a dis- disadvantage for restaurants.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  It's a very resort area.  Have you ever heard of Brekenridge --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all those ski places?
L:  Sure.
R:  Well, we're like six miles from Brekenridge, so you don't have your normal chains here.
L:  Right.
R:  But all the restaurants are like super expensive.  You know, like gourmet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or they're just not very good.  So that's another reason we don't eat out a lot.  Just because --
L:  Right, right.  And we have -- I'm kind of in West Los Angeles so we have everything here.  [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  We have nothing.
L:  [LAUGH].  So, that's, um --
R:  That's another reason.
L:  -- so, whenever I get the opportunity to go out, I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But usually when -- if I -- I have a foreign student sometimes and I have to cook.  So I do the, you know, the chicken on the grill --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  --or I make good macaroni and cheese.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I love macaroni and cheese.
L:  Oh, I do too.  Um, and that's really good, cold, too.  [LAUGH].
R:  So what is your favorite meal?  
L:  My favorite?
R:  Is that a question they asked us?
L:  As far as um, favorite meal would be ah, probably chicken.  I just like chicken a lot.  Chicken and turkey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.  Salad.
R:  Salad?
L:  Gotta have salad with my -- with my meal.
R:  I love salad. Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah, I mean that can be it.  I'm not crazy about potatoes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I don't need -- sure, I eat french fries and I eat baked potatoes sometimes, depending what I'm eating.  Um, but I have to have my salad.
R:  Right.
L:  And I can make this salad.  As long as I have my salad.  So [inaudible] by the time I --  One reason when I go out at that restaurant I was telling you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I take half the ribs home?  Is because they give you a fairly decent size salad and you get it before your meal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, that's the beginning and so you know, it's so much chewing that by the time you get the meal, I'm kind of tired of chewing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, you know, I kind of slow down.
R:  Right.
L:  And [LAUGH] my -- my --
R:  And you can take it home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You take your ribs home?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But I love eating that -- the salad.  And there's --
R:  Yeah, I love a good salad, too.
L:  Yeah.  Matter of fact, today I went and bought um --  I didn't make a good salad tonight because I didn't have the space or the time to do it.  I kind of took a nap.  I um, you know, bought a bunch of stuff for the salad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went to a -- like a vegetable market and where the prices were really good [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  So I bought a bunch of stuff for to make really good salad.  I didn't even make it.  All I did for -- for the salad tonight, 'cause I made, um, Asparagus [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is just cut up tomato and cut up cucumber.  That was the kind of a salad.  I just didn't have the time to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but it was okay.  But I would have preferred having a bowl -- you know, a salad bowl.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, with mixed stuff in it.  What do you eat?  What do you like?  What's your favorite?
R:  I don't -- I have so many.
L:  When you're at home?
R:  When I'm at home?  Probably um, mashed potatoes and ah, maybe a roast.  Pot roast, beef roast.
L:  Oh?  Uh-huh.
R:  Mashed potatoes and I could live with just that if there was nothing else.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  Of course, salad goes with that too.  I love potatoes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But trying to cut back.  They're -- I'm not -- I mean I'm very small but you know, when I hit forty or something, my metabolism is going to go down the drain, so I'm trying to --
L:  And I've hit it already and it already has.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm trying to start now and learn how to do without.  You know, just have um, every once in a while, or --or whatnot.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And it's hard 'cause they are so satisfying.  Like I love a salad but it's just not -- when I'm really hungry, it's not satisfying like creamed potatoes are.  I mean --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- I just make creamed potatoes and eat those.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, if you had --
R:  They are so bad for you.
L:   -- half the creamed potatoes and then half the salad, you'd probably still feel satisfied.
R:  I would.  Yeah.  It's not good as -- it's not as good as not eating potatoes at all but -- [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But, so I'd say -- I would probably have to say pot roast and creamed potatoes are.  I don't know, my grandmother makes great chicken and dumplings.  If I could eat her chicken and dumplings, that would be--
L:  You'd be in heaven.
R:  -- be my favorite too.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, 'cause that's, you know?  She has -- you know what dumplings are, of course?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, they're just great, so.  [inaudible] dumplings.
L:  Right, right.  My sister in law's from Texas.  She --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  She makes -- I mean, I know food because of her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um, I was brought up eating kind of bland and my mom is not a great cook.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I kind of am like her.  [LAUGH]  Whereas my sister went -- she -- she can cook.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I grew up -- my family owned um, a restaurants and a ice cream plant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And a milk plant, so I was -- I have a big ice cream problem too.
L:  You know what is a necessity?  Dessert, for me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But not when I go to a restaurant.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't even think about it.  But we're brought up having dessert --
R:  Really?
L:  -- after every meal.
R:  See, I'm totally opposite.  Totally.
L:  And -- you're lucky.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But my parents have been fifty four -- married fifty four years because [LAUGH] of that.  Because of chocolate.
R:  Wow.
L:  Keeping chocolate.  I'm serious.
R:  Wow.
L:  So that's kind of how -- my friends of mine were brought up eating like fruit for dessert.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm okay with that now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except when I was growing up, it was always, you know, cookies or cake.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And ice cream or something like that.
R:  Well, we had that at my grandmother's house.  You know, especially, of course on holidays or like for Sunday.  Sunday, you know, dinner or Sunday --
