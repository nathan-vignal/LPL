R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, who's this?
L:  Howard.  Who's this?
R:  Andrew.
L:  How are ya?
R:  Good. How are you?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  All right.  So, today's topic, illness.  Um, I don't know.  Do you -- do you get ill when the seasons change?
L:  Um, occasionally I do, ah.  I try to take a lot of vitamins and, um, [LIPSMACK] dress appropriately.  You know, if, um, if they say it's gonna be a warm day, even though in the morning it's cold, you know, I still wear a coat or a jacket or something like that, um, because it really doesn't get warmer until like three or four o'clock in the afternoon.
R:  Yeah, later in the afternoon.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I, ah, I -- I typically don't get sick.  I -- I got sick once this year, um, I -- I do tend to get sick, uh, when I -- when I go to other countries.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I went to Brazil, you know, over our winter and it's summer there.
L:  Okay.
R:  And just the -- the, the dramatic, ah, change, ah, in weather, you know, just really got to me, I got extremely ill.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow, that's funny because, um, [LIPSMACK] when I -- I travelled last week I was in Vegas and, on the way back, ah, the plane and, you know, the plane was going up and then I never really get -- get sick or -- all of a sudden, you know, my head started to hurt and, and, um, for the next few days, um, when I got back here in New York, um, my head was like, ah, a little bit dizzy.  I -- I'd start walking and it'd feel like a -- like a motion sickness type thing.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think it's, you know, when you have these drastic, ah, weather changes, um, [LIPSMACK] okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Ah, I'm from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay, I'm from New York City.
R:  Oh, no.  [LIPSMACK] Um, and what do you do to keep yourself well?
L:  Um, oh, I take vitamins, I drink a lot of juice, I exercise, I get proper sleep, I try to get, uh, seven hours sleep each night.  Ah, rest is very important and I try and eat right, try and stay away from junk food and stuff like that.  Um, eat lots of fruits and, um, [LIPSMACK] just -- I don't over exert myself too much 'cause, if you do that, [LIPSMACK] you can run into some problems.
R:  I know.  Well, actually --
L:  What about you?
R:  Ah, I'm -- I'm actually the exact opposite.  I, ah, I eat nothing but junk food.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, um, I, um, I -- well, TV dinners, I eat.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I -- I eat it constantly, um, [LIPSMACK] and, ah, I stay up 'til three four o'clock in the morning.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] either just watching movies, you know, or -- or talk online.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, and I wake up early --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [NOISE], kind of [NOISE], um, I'm pretty careless.  I'm, ah, I'm surprised, you know, that, ah, I've been able to stay so healthy.
L:  Yeah, that's incredible.  What -- what do you do?
R:  What do you mean exactly?  Like --
L:  For a living?
R:  Oh.  I'm -- I'm a student.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, okay.  I'm actually in sales.  I sell office supplies so [SIGH] I mean I -- I walk around Manhattan all day so, um, this year I g- -- I only got sick once but, um, last couple of years I got sick maybe, ah, twice or three times.  Um, you know, not -- not drastically sick, but, you know, ah, just really, really bad colds and, ah, they kinda last -- they last for about a week at a time and they just, ah, they just take over your whole body and, uh, just shut you down.
R:  Yeah.  Speaking of that, um, [NOISE] that goes onto the next thing, then there's a saying, a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor and a week if you do.
L:  Right.
R:  Do you agree?  Ah --
L:  Ah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I, ah, I think whoever, ah, said that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- either they're trying to be funny or, like, ah, I -- I -- I don't know 'cause I thought a week was seven days, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, same with me and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I- I- I'll feel a cold coming on and, um, I'll drink more juice and d- -- and do more things to stop it, and, ah, you know, it doesn't go away and, um, 'bout three or four days into it, ah, I'll go see the doctor and he'll give me some, ah, you know, some medication, some sample stuff and, um, but, yeah, a cold lasts about a week or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seven days, so you know, whatever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it is, they're -- they're both the same thing.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  You gotta let it run its course, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Last time I had a cold, it actually, it did last me about a week.  Um, and I didn't go to the doctor,  I just, you know, I took some of that Nyquil --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, yeah, I just drugged myself up, you know.
L:  How is that stuff?  I've never taken that.
R:  Nyquil --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is great.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, I -- I took two Nyquil gel caps, um, [LIPSMACK] when I went back from Brazil.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, because I don't know if --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if you've ever had a cold and, and flown before?
L:  No.
R:  Um, the -- the -- the -- the cabin pressure --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, really gets to your sinuses --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if you have a cold and I'm telling you, you will have such a bad headache.  I felt like my head was going to explode.
L:  Really?
R:  Now, that stuff, um, I -- I actually got that stuff when I got into Miami.  I -- I had -- I had a connection, uh, from Miami to LaGuardia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And while I was waiting in Miami, I -- I bought some Nyquil.  I -- I took some of that stuff and it just knocked me out.  I -- I -- when I woke up, I didn't have a headache for a while, so --
L:  Good for you.
R:  -- you know.
L:  But it's, er, if you take Nyquil, it's only like, temporary, right?
R:  It is only temporary, yeah.
L:  Temporary blocks it, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, it just -- if you take it like, before you go to sleep, it just, ah, knocks you out?
R:  Yeah, basically.
L:  Yeah.  I gotta try that stuff.  Everybody I know tries it.  I have never tried it and, ah, I've heard good things [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I gotta check that out.  Next time I get, -- I get a cold I'm gonna use that stuff.
R:  Yeah, I highly recommend it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, do you, um, [LIPSMACK] do you get -- do you go to the doctor often?  Do you -- do you get like a yearly check up?
R:  Ah, I do get a yearly check up, um, but that's, that's about as far as it goes.  I -- I, ah, I typically don't go to the doctor unless it's, ah, it's like an emergency. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Okay, yeah.  I, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm in very good health and, ah, I usually don't go to the doctor, you know, unless I'm sick.  Um, but I really -- I know I really should go once a year to have a physical and have my blood work done and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my parents have been, ah, on me for that, um, just to go once a year and, ah, see that I'm okay and -- and just, you know, see the doctor.  So maybe I'll do that in the next, uh, few weeks.
R:  Yeah, I -- it's, it's pretty harmless, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  It doesn't hurt.  It can't hurt.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Right?
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So how old are you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm seventeen.
L:  Okay.  I'm, ah, I'm thirty two.
R:  Wow.
L:  Thirty two.  Um, this is my first call.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's actually my first call, too.
L:  Really?  I, I didn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know what to expect.  A friend told me about this and, ah, oh, that's interesting.  Very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- interesting.
R:  I actually just found out about it last night.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Ah, yeah, on the internet and, ah, I figure, well, hey, you know, it's ten dollars per call, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not bad.
R:  Nope.
L:  It's not bad.  And, ah, yeah, we can't get germs from talking to each other 'cause --
R:  No.
L:  -- it's over the phone, so that's good [LAUGH].
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  That's good.  You should always, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know if you ever, um, do you have a cellphone?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, yeah, that's good.
R:  I'm, I'm actually using it.  I'm on it.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  Yeah, 'cause, um, I'm in my office now and, ah, I always like, take these, ah, these alcoholic, ah, alcoholic -- alcohol pads and, you know, kinda wipe the receiver down like, ah, a couple times a week.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so they -- they -- they say in New York, you know, that you can get sick from using the pay phones and stuff a lot, [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pay phones are pretty gross.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm originally from New York and, um, I mean, I was born and raised there.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I've actually only been living here for a few years, and I actually, you know, I -- I -- I heard a lot about this stuff.  You know, they, they -- they're always telling me, "Oh, be careful when you use pay phones and" -- you know, I've -- I've used pay phones a lot and I never really got sick.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, me either, but, ah, they're -- they're pretty nasty.  I'm sure the pay phones out by you are much nicer.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  The pay phones in Manhattan are gross.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's -- that's where I was raised --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Manhattan.
L:  Manhattan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's where I am right now.  Do you know, um, Muenburg[?] College?
R:  No, I --
L:  Is that far from you?
R:  Ah, I have never heard of it.
L:  Oh, okay.  My sister's starting there in the fall.
R:  Hm.
L:  It's, ah, by Allentown.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Is that --
R:  I know where that is.
L:  -- is that far from you?
R:  It's about two hours.
L:  Yeah, oh, okay.  Yeah, 'cause it's about two hours from here also, so [LAUGH] ...  How 'bout that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout that.  You, ah, you like baseball?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, it's all right.  I prefer soccer.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Yeah, my Mets aren't doing so well ... and the Yankees just keep winning.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Just keep winning.  Unbelievable.  So, I don't know, is this thing over yet or what?
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't even know how much time we have left.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  It says, ah, ten minutes it's, uh, they're gonna let us know in ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's gonna beep or something.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  They'll, they'll let us know and then apparently we make our last comments and then we're done.
L:  Okay.  What else did they, ah, did they say for us to talk about?
R:  Ah, that was it.  That was today's topic.
L:  Okay.  Okay, so, I think we covered eight minutes.  "After the ten minutes has expired, you'll have the opportunity to leave feedback about the call".  Okay.  Your name is Andrew?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And you are Howard?
L:  Howard.
