L:  Uh, I couldn't hear you on that one.
R:  Oh.  What do you think?
L:  Well, I sometimes get sick when the seasons change.
R:  Yeah.  I'm pretty sick right now.  I think I like -- it's just hay fever or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  I was, like, sick a -- had a cold.
R:  Yeah.  Why do you think, uh, people get sick?
L:  Can you repeat that?
R:  Uh, why do you think people get sick?
L:  Uh, a lot of things that make a person sick, you know?  It's like, it could be what they eat or how they eat or uh, what they do and uh, I take every precaution not to get sick.  
R:  Yeah.  No, I was sick, like, twice this winter.
L:  Yeah.  I was sick a little more than that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  That like really bad flu that was going around.
R:  Yeah.  I think I caught it, like the same bug twice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Within a month.  I thought like, "What the hell?"
L:  Yeah.  Um, have you ever had a cold for, uh, seven days?
R:  A cold?
L:  Yeah?
R:  Like, they use- they usually go away after like five days for me.
L:  Yeah.  Me, too.  Mm.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Right.  Um, yeah.   Like, now that the weather's starting to get better, so I think the -- I think that I feel a lot better.
R:  Yeah, but then, like um, the beginning of April, right, the weather was like changing like crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One day was cold, then it was hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's what makes people sick also.
L:  Yeah.  It probably is.
R:  'Cause I know for, like personally myself, like, I couldn't -- I didn't know how to dress.  Like, you wear a lot and then you go outside, it's burning hot.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I usually wear shorts, even through the winter.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, I'm warm really easily, so --
R:  Yeah, I get cold easily. 
L:  So like, what's the longest you ever, uh, how long have you been sick for, you know, the longest?
R:  The longest, like, total?
L:  Mhm?
R:  About two weeks.
L:  Yeah.  I had, uh, I forget what it's called.  I was sick for like almost a month.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Now there's that SARS thing going around.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  That's kinda freaky.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, I read about that in the newspaper.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Where people in Canada got it.
R:  Yeah.  I think like two people have it in New York, but like, but like, uh, I don't think any of them died yet.
L:  Yeah.  I heard that, uh, mostly kids were getting it 'cause it adopted them from China, or wherever.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't know how that came about.
L:  Yeah.  One bad apple spoils the bunch.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Hear in China they have, like, quarantines for like the whole building.  If you like, if one person has SARS --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that [inaudible].
R:  Kinda scary.  Imagine it happening here?
L:  Yeah.  You have to wear face masks and uh, like, China and Asia and all those places.
R:  Yeah.  Heard they, like, check your temperature at the airports.  That's so you don't, like, bring it into other countries.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what else about illness?  Um, yeah, my -- my family, lot of illness runs through my family but I seem to not have gotten any, um, I'm practically perfectly healthy.
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty healthy, too.
L:  I'm a little overweight, but healthy.  Uh --
R:  I think I'm underweight.
L:  Huh.  Yeah.  Like my brother.  He has Lime disease and he's practically bones.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Weighs like sixty five pounds.
R:  Damn.  Lime disease?  You get that from like beetles or stuff, right?  From, like --
L:  Uh, ticks.
R:  Ticks?  Oh, yes.  Right.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Is it, like, terrible, or is it like -- does it stay with you?
L:  Does it what?
R:  Do -- does it stay with you, or what?  Like --
L:  Well, they have medicine for it, so you know --
R:  Mhm?
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Hope he -- hope he feels better.
L:  Thank you.  Uh, um, what else?  Uh [NOISE].  Yeah.  My brother just walked in, the one that has Lime disease.
R:  Mhm?
L:  They had to -- [NOISE].  Yeah.
R:  Hey.  What's up?
L:  [NOISE].  Shut up [inaudible].  My -- my mom has, uh, diabetes, so --
R:  [inaudible].  Oh yeah, my dad has that, too.
L:  Yeah.  My mom's, like, it's usually something, diabetes.
R:  Yeah.  My dad's like fifty some -- um, but then they caught it early, though, 'cause like he responded to the medicine and stuff.
L:  They say that, uh, I may have it, but I don't believe that.
R:  Yeah.  When my dad caught it, like my mom took the whole family out to get checked.
L:  Yeah.  That's what happens.
R:  Yeah.  Good thing I didn't get it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so -- my grandmother, well, both my grandmothers are really sick.  One of them's almost dying.  And uh, one of them has, like, heart disease.  Lung cancer -- not lung cancer, but something wrong with her lungs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She can't really breathe.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my grandfather died of a stroke like a couple of years back.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it happens.
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you think about, like, uh mental illnesses?
L:  Yeah.  You have -- do you have allergies?  
R:  Allergies?  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah, definitely.  You?
L:  Uh, I -- not really.  I mean, sometimes when I go outside, I may get a snuffy nose.  Yeah.  Maybe the pollen and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Today for me was really bad.
L:  Right.
R:  I was sitting in a park and just couldn't, like, breathe.  Sneezing my face out.
L:  Yeah.  My -- uh, I don't like to take medicine, so yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  I can't swallow pills for some reason.  I don't know.
L:  Mm.
R:  Have a phobia.
L:  What?
R:  Have a phobia.
L:  Oh.  Uh.  Uh, uh -- uh, let's see. Man, there's not a lot to talk about.
R:  Yeah, I know.  
L:  You think of anything?
R:  Yeah, I have like -- illness prevention, I guess if you exercise more, probably won't get sick that much.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I exercise.  I work out.
R:  Yeah, so do I.
L:  Work out --
R:  Probably down at the park.
L:  Yeah.  I run sometimes.  I go biking with my friends and I got my, uh, weight bench. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  All that good stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I go to a park.  Uh, I -- I was on a track team, so that probably, like, kept me healthy for a while.
L:  Yeah.  Well, a lot of my friends run on the track team.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, they're skinny now.
R:  I know.
L:  Uh, mm.  Uh, trying to think of anything I read in the newspaper lately, about illnesses, but mainly it's about that SARS.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Uh --
R:  I think I read somewhere, that like people are taking too many vitamins nowadays.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Like, hell scared of disease.
L:  Like, wh- when uh, when -- when -- um, I'm a -- I'm a teacher, so that one of my triple -- my students, like, students were taking so many, uh, pills.  I thought -- at first, I thought they were drugs and I had a look at them and --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- uh, and I saw they were just, like, vitamins and I'm like, "Do you need those?"  I told them to chew -- to eat -- to eat orange and there was some --
R:  Yeah, I really don't understand like why people love taking vitamins and pills so much.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure the natural thing is, like, better for you anyways.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, a lot of kids in my, uh, school, uh, they -- they come in when they're sick.  Like, and it's usually the kids that, like, have a bad family, like you know, they neglect them and they're, like, always coming in sick and they're getting everybody sick.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And, uh, they get me sick.
R:  Mm.  One of the occupational hazards, being a teacher?
L:  Yeah.  Never thought of it that way.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'm a student myself, so when I'm sick, not going to school --
