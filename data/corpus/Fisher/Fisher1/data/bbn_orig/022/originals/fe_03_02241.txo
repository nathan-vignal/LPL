L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Logan.
R:  Hi, I'm Rena.
L:  Hi Rena.  How are you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good, thank you.  So, illness.  Ah.  I actually don't get sick when the seasons change.  I rarely get sick.
R:  Yeah, I'm very lucky that way too.  I take a lot of vitamins.  Apparently it works.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes a little cold.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, aft- -- when weather changes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- drastically, you know?
L:  Right, right.  Um, I don't know.  I think -- I think of it is also psychosomatic.
R:  Right.
L:  I think people expect to get the flu or expect to get cold -- a cold or --
R:  Yeah, because that's all you hear.  Did you get the flu shot?
L:  Right.
R:  And so it's in your head.  [LAUGH].
L:  I actually haven't had a flu shot [inaudible] in about twelve years.  Um.
R:  Oh gosh.  I haven't had one since I was a kid, which was many --
L:  Since I left college.
R:  -- many more years ago.  [LAUGH].
L:  Until it -- it was last mandated.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right, right.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And so I think that has a lot to do with it.  I think people who do actually get the flu shot, tend to get sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least a lot of --
R:  And I don't.  I don't get the shot.
L:  Mhm.  So that's something I've found.
R:  And if I get sick it's usually for twenty four hours and that's it.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, something you eat.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, I actually do agree with the seven day, ah, thing about getting a cold.  Um, if it, you know, it'll only last for a few days but if you go to a Doctor, it'll last longer.  Um, I found that -- that when I have gotten sick, if it's like something flu-ish, it's usually three days up and three days down.  So, after three days, it's at the very worst --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and three days of recuperating and then you're done.  So.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, I don't know.  I think a lot of my friends -- friends that I know tend to run to the doctor every time they get sick and I think that kind of makes it worse.
R:  I don't have the time to run to the doctor.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Unless I absolutely have to.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I just dose myself.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I think maybe some people.  I mean, it's funny, 'cause you know you turn on the TV and, ah, every other commercial's for a prescription drug.
R:  I know.
L:  And it didn't used to be that way.
R:  No.  No.
L:  Now heartburn is a disease.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].
L:  All these really mundane things are now diseases.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, so I think people are kind of playing into that which doesn't really help your body heal naturally.
R:  No.  No, I just take my vitamins.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, what kind of climate are you in?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, it -- it's some-  somewhat temperate?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, I was born and raised in New York.  Brooklyn.
L:  That's funny.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Manhattan.  So --
R:  So, yeah, we had a really strange, ah, change.  It was cold.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then Sunday morning, I was washing the floor and I felt so hot and it was.  It was like ninety degrees out.
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  And now it's cold again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we have the real drastic changes.
L:  Yeah, we've had some similar changes so I think that might also be affecting people --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know.  Um, but --
R:  Yeah, it -- it's hard not to get sick because of the way you dress.
L:  True.
R:  You don't expect, you know, such a drastic change.
L:  Yeah.  What I find, I wash my hands a lot and I think that also makes a difference.  You know, tra- travelling on the subway.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].
L:  I find that if you're not -- if you're not careful that way, you know you can probably pick up a lot of stuff.  But um --
R:  Sure.
L:  I don't know.  I think, ah, for the most part, pretty healthy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know what ev- everybody else is doing [LAUGH] that makes them unhealthy but I think --
R:  I used to have allergies really bad --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but not good.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, and I've actually never --
R:  You know, maybe a little, here and there, you know?
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  But, if there's somebody's strong perfume or something, you know.  [LAUGH].
L:  Interesting.
R:  But, ah, weather wise, no, I- I've been very fortunate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just this past year I think, just.  I have two jobs, morning and afternoon and I just had to miss an afternoon job.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  To knock it out of me.  That was it, done.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And you know, other people, oh gosh, they miss like, you know, two, three days, maybe a week.
L:  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know, I, um, I mean I've -- I tend not to work when I'm sick but --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- then again, since I rarely get sick, it's not --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- it's usually not a big deal.  But, ah, and I'm lucky in that, I -- I'm self employed so if I need to take a few hours off, I can just lay down and not worry about it too bad.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, but a, yeah, I don't know, I think -- I think getting sleep is also a factor.  And not getting sleep.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and your environment and you know, whether you -- you convince yourself or not that you have to get sick that year.  [LAUGH].  I think that may play a part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I agree with you.  [LAUGH].  You hear people, "Oh now I'm going to get sick".
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And sure enough, a few days later [LAUGH].
L:  They get sick.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  [inaudible] someone says, "Oh man, you don't look well."  And I'm thinking, "I don't look well?"  "Yeah, you feeling okay?"  And you know, maybe we're feeling fine.  Maybe just a little tired and next thing you know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- "Oh god, I don't feel good."  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So I think there -- there's a lot to that.  Um.  And, you know, I think if you go to the Doctors it doesn't really make that aspect any better.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  No.  I us-  usually just one dose of Nyquil[?].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Does it and for, ah, you know when you get the -- you know, when your throat hurts when you swallow?
L:  Right.
R:  I have tried Chloroseptic[?] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and gargling with the salt water.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The only thing that works is Aspragum[?].
L:  Really?  Interesting.
R:  And that knocks it right out.  Yeah.
L:  You know, I also, ah, make this drink called, um, oh, Honegar[?] which is, um, like fresh water, like either distilled or bottled water --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- or filtered.  Um, apple cider vinegar, raw, like from the health food store and ah, really good organic honey.  And you make the -- you make the water and you take like a glass of water.  You add enough vinegar in to make it undrinkable and then you add enough honey to make it drinkable.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's ver- -- it's antibacterial.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it works really well.  Especially for sore throats or anything like that.  Yeah, colds.  I find I take that and it pretty much helps me clear out whatever I'm dealing with.  'Cause it's usually bacterial.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So.  Plus, I think it tastes good now.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's kind of like -- like lemonade but you know, a little different.  [LAUGH].
R:  Gosh.  That's good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, we've got tons in California.  Of course there's health food stores.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Out here.
L:  What part -- what part of California?
R:  The San Fernando Valley.
L:  Okay.  I'm not too f- -- I've been to LA once, [inaudible].  Ah, but yeah, I hear it's beautiful out there.
R:  Um, I'm moving.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, are you?  Where?
R:  Yeah, I'm tired of California.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  It's not what it used to be.
L:  Okay.
R:  I've been looking for homes in Vegas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  They're really, really reasonable there.
L:  Mhm.  I've never been to Vegas.  Oh yeah and I -- I just actually came back from Michigan so I'm starting to -- to see a little bit more of the US.  [LAUGH],
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And not just, you know, put, you know, New York on a pedestal all the time.  [LAUGH].
R:  Now what part of New York?
L:  Um, Manhattan.
R:  I used to work for American Express on Thirty Fourth.
L:  Okay.
R:  Thirty Second.  I'm thinking of Macy's on Thirty Fourth.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I'm up in -- I'm actually up in Harlem.  Ah, so that's kind of different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But hey, great rent deals.
R:  Right.  Where else are you going to?  Exactly.  I'm in the San Fernando Valley and we're gang infested here, you know?
L:  Oh yes.  So that's -- that'll do it.  Especially if you have kids.  You don't really want --
R:  But -- but in Vegas, I mean, you can get a -- a home for like a hundred and fifty that would be worth four fifty here, easy.
L:  Oh yeah.  I was looking --
R:  Two storey, absolutely gorgeous.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I saw some houses in Michigan that go -- like the really super nice ones?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like five hundred thousand but here they'd be like two million.
R:  Oh yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And that's like wow.
R:  [LAUGH].  Amazing.
L:  If that was in New York.  Oh my God.  [LAUGH].
R:  And I'm very fortunate because where I work -- well, the day job, which is the main source of income, they have an office there.  [LAUGH].  I mean, boy, did I luck out.
L:  That's brilliant.  Wow.  I wish you the very best on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Great.  But yeah, I don't know how much more can we talk about this topic?  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  I mean we don't really have anything to disagree on.  [LAUGH].
R:  I think, are they supposed to cut in?
L:  They will.
R:  After the --
L:  They're going to give you a little -- they are going to cut us off, let us know that we've got like thirty seconds to say goodbye and then, even if we're in the middle of our goodbyes, they'll cut us off again.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty -- it's pretty to the minute.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But, ah, I don't know, I think, um, I have a lot of disrespect, unfortunately, for the medical community.  Ah, because they're so money driven.  And they're so drug driven.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Me too.
L:  And I think it really does the American people a serious disservice, especially since we don't have, you know, unified health care across the board.
R:  And that's another issue.  The -- the health care.  I have to get a better -- I'm paying three hundred and fifteen a month --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is outrageous.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And, as you well know, when you go to a doctor and they see you have insurance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they scare you because they're going to put you through the tests to get the money, right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Meantime, you're like, why do I have to have the ultrasound?  What's wrong?
L:  Right.
R:  And all it is, is like you said, they are making money.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  It -- it's really not about -- unfortunately -- I mean, maybe I don't want to say across the board, I don't know every single doctor in the country but it seems to be, you know, again, more of business and less of, you know, hippocratic oath which was, you know, let's take care of people.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That -- that's supposed to be the top priority and, ah, it doesn't seem to be, anymore, which is a real shame.
R:  I have a really good doctor and he -- he was pretty much upfront about what he was doing, at least, so that I didn't have to, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause one medical was ending --
