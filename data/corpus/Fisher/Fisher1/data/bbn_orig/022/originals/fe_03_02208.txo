R:  Stephanie.
L:  Brenda.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, Stephanie.
R:  Yeah, th- -- yeah, this is Stephanie.  'Cause --
L:  This is Brenda.
R:  H- hi [LAUGH].
L:  How are you?
R:  Good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  This is the first time I've ever done this, so I was kinda -- [LAUGH].
L:  Me, too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's gonna --
L:  Me, too, so [LAUGH] I'm like, "Okay, now what?" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so I guess we're supposed to talk about eating, in a restaurant versus home?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  So -- [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, go ahead.  Go ahead.
R:  Um, well, I prefer eating at a restaurant.  [NOISE].
L:  Why?
R:  I like -- oh, I prefer eating at a restaurant 'cause there's more of a selection, and you don't have to clean up the mess.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You don't have to -- well, you know, if you screw something up, you could send it back.  Um, I don't know.  More selection, I always, you know, like selection.  I don't -- I don't eat meat, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going to a restaurant, you can get, you know, all different things.  When I -- when I'm at home, if someone's eating dinner and I have to cook something special for me, it's kind of a pain.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, um, I guess it really depends.  I -- I kind of -- I -- I like to cook, so I -- I like to eat at home because, you know, I know what's in the food, and who's prepared it, and --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- things like that.  Um --
R:  Yeah, that makes sense.  I didn't even think about that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  You know, an- and then I sometimes get nervous when I send things back, you know --
R:  Whether they'll spit in it.
L:  -- whether they're mad.  What they're gonna put in it.  Or are they gonna do something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that does make a lot of sense.  I -- I should have thought of that, 'cause for a while I wouldn't eat out, because, ah, I knew there were, ah, hepatitis scares at certain restaurants --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's kind of scary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So at least you know you're -- what you're -- what you're doing and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you cook it, you know you're going to be clean about it.  So it makes a lot of sense.
L:  Yeah.  So, ah, okay, so you say you're a vegetarian.  I have a friend who's a vegetarian, too, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I ki- --
R:  I --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I would say, it's sometimes a pain to eat at restaurants, because they don't offer vegetarian food.  Like, I -- I've been a vegetarian since I was like, eight years old.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's s- sometimes also [inaudible] either.  Sometimes it's a pain to go out and then there's like, two things on the menu which -- one includes salad.
L:  Right.
R:  The other one's usually some gross dish.  Depends where you go.
L:  Right.
R:  There's not that variety.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, um, my friend, who's a vegetarian -- she's, you know, sh- she became a vegetarian late in life.  Um, I guess when she turned thirty five or something like that.  And, um -- but she's been one for the last three or four years, now, so, um -- but she's -- sh- she -- she get's around it a lot, you know, especially at home -- and that's another reason why, you know, cooking at home is a little bit better.  But even at restaurants, you know, um, she -- she doesn't seem to have too much problems, you know, I don't know why.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She --
R:  There's always usually salad or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Arou- around wh- -- I -- I live, ah, I go to col- -- I'm an, um, in college, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wh- -- around my -- my college there's a lot of different restaurants, I can eat at.  So, that -- you know.
L:  Mm.  Oh, okay.
R:  It's not really a problem.  We always go to the same places, but, um, you know, like regular restaurants, they have as their m- -- their main focus is on like, you know, a meat dish --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you can always order salad or something on the side.  So --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that's -- that's not bad.  There's usually something to order.  But, you know, yeah, I -- I eat at home.  I like to cook too.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, ah, I don't like cleaning up.  That's the --
L:  Mm, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, when I cook, while I'm cooking, I clean so that -- 'cause I don't like work, after I'm done the c- cooking, I want the kitchen to be clean, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it just makes the meal more appealing and more appetizing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that if it --
R:  I always --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I always clean before I eat, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- once you eat, you feel tired, you wanna relax --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, mhm.
R:  -- when -- you know, it's a pain.  So --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Hm.
L:  So -- so what's your favorite vegetarian dish, then?
R:  Well, I like Indian food.  Vegetable curry.
L:  Oh, uh-huh?  Oh, okay.
R:  And it's really -- I don't know, I -- I was addicted to it and there are lots of restaurants around here like that.  So I go to all the different restaurants around here.  And there's like, different types of Indian food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like they have like, different parts of the country, and I don't know, I was really into that for a while, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, well, no I -- I'm not really into tofu and stuff.  I mean, you can go and cook that anyway you want, but I don't like eating it plain.  It's kinda gross.
L:  Ooh, ooh.
R:  A- and too many car- -- I eat too many carbs, though [LAUGH].  That's the only problem.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Especially if you like pasta.
R:  Yeah, that's my problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, people s- -- 'cause I -- I was like, "Oh --", I mean I -- I gained like -- when I -- when I was in -- first started college -- which I'm almost a graduate now, but, um, I started eating so many carbs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I gained like, fifteen pounds and like, oh, my god -- just from eating at, you know -- 'cause there's not much to eat around here at first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, but, yeah, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:   -- that freshman fifteen, they call it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what state are you in?
R:  Oh, Florida.
L:  Florida, okay.  I'm in Cal- --
R:  How about you?
L:  California.  There's a funny state [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been out for a while [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I will -- I might graduate next semester [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, congratulations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I -- I -- I love pastas, and --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- my favorite is like, alfredo fettuccine.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that -- that's really good, yeah.  I -- I was on a alfredo kick for a while.  I ate so much alfredo sauce and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's so good.  It's like, addicting.
L:  Yeah, but -- and then I learned how to make it, my-, ah, myself, and oh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- my gosh.  Mhm.  It's like, ah, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- this could get me in trouble [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I love alfredo.  Vegetable alfredo, everything.  But yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so -- that -- so that's probably one of my favorite dishes, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be the alfredo, um, fettuccine alfredo.  Oh, I'm ju- -- oh, now I wanna go.
R:  Go, c- cook?
L:  Tina.  Go get my room mate, "We need to go get something to eat, now" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  Yeah, but, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I don't -- I don't know, I, you know, I -- I -- I like going out, you know --
R:  Yeah, I guess it's good o- on occasion, but it does get costly after a while.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, my credit card bill this month is highest than it's ever been.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause I've been working on my finals and [LAUGH] going out to eat all the time.
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  And it adds up.  And then, I guess you can cook the same meal you can eat, at home --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, you can eat the same meal at home as you would go out, and then spend, like, half the money --
L:  Mm.
R:  Not even, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  It's costly, after a while, so --
L:  And then -- and then you have --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- stuff left over for the [LAUGH] next couple of days, too.
R:  Y- yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's usually good, too.
L:  That's what my, um, my boyfriend does, you know, when he'll, um -- like, once or twice a month or so, he'll make different dishes, and, you know, and, you know, the pasta, the vegetables and meat, and different meats and stuff.  And he'll --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he'll -- he'll make what I -- I call 'em TV dinners [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, you have it all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ready.
L:  Yeah, so he makes, like, thirty or forty of these and stuff 'em in the freezer, so -- and they're -- he mixes and matches them, the foods and stuff.  So that, um, you know, you know -- he's busy a lot, so just pulls one of those out and microwaves it and, you know, he has a nice dinner or lunch or whatever.
R:  That is -- that's a --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- very good idea.
L:  Mhm.  So, like, hm, I need to incorporate that into my schedule [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I think --
L:  Well, when you --
R:  -- to have something pre made and you don't have to eat the same thing over and over.  'Cause people usually, when they have nothing, they'll, "Oh, I'll [several inaudible words]", dinner, eat the same thing over and over, but you have something you pre made, that's even better.
L:  Right, yeah.  And like I said, he -- he'll do like, chicken, and then the -- the beef and pork and stuff, and then, you know, the -- the rice and -- or some other pasta.  And then different vegetables, broccoli -- you know, we both love spinach and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- and he'll put the different types of meals like that, so I'm like, "Oh, okay, I like this" [LAUGH], so --
R:  He thinks ahead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's how my -- my last boyfriend was like that.  He used to always cook in advance, and plan things out and do all the stuff and I'm like, "Oh, huh, I've got all these classes and stuff", and it would be nice just to go home and have, you know, dinner ready.
L:  Mm, right, right, yeah.
R:  I was like, going out to a restaurant, but you know --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- it -- who the person is.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Mm.
L:  What -- what -- what are you majoring in?
R:  Oh, graphic design.
L:  Graphic design.  Mm --
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  -- okay.  Far from food, huh? [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I -- you know, I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about, food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.  Ah, ah, is this the first time you -- you've done this too?  Or --
L:  Mhm.  This is my first time.  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool -- that's cool.
L:  So, I'm like, "Oh, my g- -- okay".  And my room mate -- she -- she did her first one today, and, um, she was like, "Why they haven't called, huh", and I go, "No, it's about six o'clock.  They'll be calling me" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, and -- and sure enough, here they go.  So -- but yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I'm like, and so they're taping this, right?  So, I'm like --
R:  Yeah, I think so [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, so I'm like, "Okay, how does this work?" [SIGH].  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and I'm -- I guess it's supposed to be like ten minutes long.  I don't even know how long we've been talking.  I wonder.
L:  Oh, I -- I don't know either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they said they'd signal, so -- I don't know how they signal.  Beep.  They'll cut you -- [LAUGH] cut you off [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Okay, time's up.
R:  Yeah, becau- -- [several inaudible words].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I --
R:  But, um, I don't know, what else about food?  Ah, [LAUGH] ah --
L:  Um, how do you -- do you like vegetables, or any --
R:  Yeah.  I like --
L:  Well, you have to, you know. [LAUGH].
R:  All the -- yeah, I'll eat any vegetable.  Like, I like all vegetables.  Mushrooms, everything, and, um, I love pastas, lot of, you know, beans and rice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, I don't know, um, hm.
L:  Yeah, I probably would make -- I like more vegetables than fruit.  There's only a certain amount of fruits that I like.  I, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I'll the grapes, the pears, you know.  I don't like bananas and apples and, you know, strawberries --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I don't like strawberries.  We're in the strawberry capital of the world, and I don't like strawberries [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  You know, so it's, you know -- so I -- I lo- love veg- --
