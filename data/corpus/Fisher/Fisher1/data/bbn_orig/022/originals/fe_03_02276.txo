R:  Hi, I'm Val.
L:  Hi, I'm Theresa.
R:  Hi, Theresa.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you doing today?
L:  Oh, I'm pretty good.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about allergies and things --
L:  Yeah, I gu- --
R:  -- like that, huh?
L:  I guess so.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I've never done -- this is my first call.  Ho- how about you?
R:  Well, yes, it's the first one for me, too, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this is going to be an interesting situation.
L:  Yeah.  I don- I wasn't sure how it worked.
R:  Um, well, I know that, um, a lot of times I get allergies in the fall, rather than in the spring.
L:  Yeah.  Well, with me, I'm kind of the opposite.  I usually get 'em in the spring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Early -- just the early spring.  After that --
R:  Early spring?
L:  -- I'm usually fine.
R:  Yeah.  So um, well, I'm in North Carolina, so we have -- we're in full fledged into the -- the season that people are having problems with their eyes and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm not far, I'm in Kentucky.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Actually, I just had my first bout with allergies a couple of weeks ago.  We went -- me and my son went camping --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and just all of a sudden, like a ton of bricks, I just started, uh, my throat was hurting, my -- like, I had the sinus pressure, you know?  My head was --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- hurting real bad and, you know, I thought I was coming down, you know, with a virus or something and then uh, my mom said, "Yeah, I think it's probably allergies".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And 'cause -- bu- but the next day, I was fine.
R:  Oh.  Well, it takes one day.  Do you ha- do you generally have to take medicine for it, or --
L:  No, I mean, usually I just -- uh, every now and then I'll just take some over the counter stuff.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, I'm not -- I don't see a doctor for my allergies or anything like that, because it's not that severe.

R:  Well, I was taking, um, Allegra for mine.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  It seemed to help because, well, one of the problems that I have is, when I -- when I do have the allergies at the strange time, then I end up with a sinus infection.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then after the sinus infection, I end up with bronchitis, so I end up with major problems and have to go to the doctor.
L:  Yeah.  Sounds bad.
R:  But he gave me Allegra, but now I don't have insurance, so I'm not taking that any more.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I know how that is, too, without insurance.
R:  My husband generally takes, as far as the um, uh allergies are concerned, he generally takes Benadryl and he seems to be okay on that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  This is really strange, talking about this kind of stuff, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, especially --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- with a party that you've never spoken to in your whole entire life.  [LAUGH].  It's weird.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, it is kinda strange, but um, we, uh --
L:  Yeah, I actually -- I fo- I totally forgot about it.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know, I -- I was signed up for it on the internet earlier today --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, um, I went to the grocery and I just got back from the grocery and the phone rang, and I looked at caller ID, I was, like, "Mm" and then when I had answered it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then it -- I was like, oh yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I didn't even get to the phone in time, so then they had -- so then I called and they're, like, "No, you need to call the computer", so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I find out today earlier, too, and I was, like, damn, this happened really quick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was kinda surprised.  But, um, generally the fall.  Let's see.  If I have to take something in the fall, I generally take the over the counter stuff because I just started taking the Allegra.  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Now, working in the yard yesterday, I had really bad swollen eyes --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- but sleeping seemed to help that, so I really didn't have to go to the doctor or do anything with that.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  That --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  That always helps.  Yest[?] always seems to help me a lot more than other things do.
L:  Uh, I always, um --
R:  But --
L:  -- I got a six year old little boy and I worry about him, 'cause he's -- he's had, like, off and on problems with allergies and --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- they have -- you know, when he was younger they said, "Well, you know what, when he's so little, it's really hard for us to tell anything", you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  "You just have to wait till he grows and see if he grows out of it" or -- 'cause he used to have to take, um, a breathing treatment, on a breathing machine.
R:  Oh, my.  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  He used to have to do that, and um, he hasn't had to do any of that lately, but when it gets real, real hot --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- I notice he has a little bit difficulty breathing, and you know, that co- that could even be asthma.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, so that's still something -- we -- we keep battling with and we're not really sure because it's just so sporadic.  It's nothing --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- you know, consistent, so we don't know what to do.
R:  Well, m- my, um, nephew, he's six, and he's had problems with everything and he had to have allergy tests done.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And he's allergic to all trees except Carolina pine trees.
L:  Goodness.
R:  He's in North Carolina.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's the only tree he's not allergic to.  Now, a long time ago, when I was a kid, I had allergy shots, but --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- I seem to be allergic to molds and things like that, rather than -- well, at that time anyway.  Rather than the, um, you know, the trees and all those kinds of things.  One of the things that -- that the doctor told me to take is Echinacea.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah. But it seemed to help --
L:  I've heard of that --
R: -- and it did help.
L:  -- for so many other things, but not for, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- allergies.
R:  It helps -- will boost your immune system for everything.
L:  Mhm?
R:  So it helps, and he even gave me that when I had a virus one time, so I was, like, "Okay", so --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- I take that.  Oh, the other thing that's really good for allergies is -- what is it called?  Oh, now, it's something "Seal".  Um, Golden Seal.  
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Golden Seal helps with allergies.  It gets rid of all the mucus and stuff.
L:  Is -- what is --
R:  And --
L:  What is Golden Seal?
R:  It's, um, it's an herb.
L:  Okay.  See, I'm all in, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever I can do naturally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause I don't have health insurance either right now and it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if I can do it cheaper.  [LAUGH].
R:  And it doesn't make you sick, either.
L:  Yeah, that's what I like --
R:  Which is really nice.
L:  -- about natural stuff, is yo- you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't have to worry about side effects and --
R:  And after you take it for about two weeks --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- it helps to make everything -- you -- you feel better.  I don't have -- I don't end up with the sinus strains.  I always have this little [COUGH] in my throat all the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from allergies, no matter what time of the year it is.  And that seems to help that a little bit, so I -- I generally try to do that.  My doctor, for some reason, he just started doing this, where he would say, "Okay, why don't you try taking some kind of herbs instead of other things and that way, maybe that'll help you a little bit?" and then of course, that was before he knew that I lost my insurance, so --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I lost my job, so my husband couldn't pay for the insurance any more.
L:  [COUGH].
R:  So.
L:  Yeah, they -- yeah, they need to have a, um, topic next on -- on insurance, 'cause I could talk forever about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Who knows -- I don't even know how the -- you know, as far as how many topics they end up with.  I was surprised I was called so fast.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  But, um, I don't know what else I would do for allergies.  I usually -- I usually do that -- oh, I know what my mom does, and you're probably going to be grossed out by this, but --
L:  What?
R:  -- she -- she, um, takes salt water, warm.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  She warms it and she puts salt in it so that it, you know, just tastes salty?
L:  Yeah?
R:  And she sniffs it up her nose.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  She -- it -- she says it works.  She can breathe --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's great, cleans out all -- it's kinda gross 'cause, you know, kinda all that water and gro- gross stuff goes down in your throat and you gotta --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spit it out in droplets.
L:  Well, we haven't been able to -- you know the -- the inhalers that you -- you know, the stuff that you sniff up your nose, that you go at the store and get?
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the nasal sprays?
R:  Yeah, and all that stuff --
L:  I guess that's, um, a good idea probably.  It's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I never -- I would never even think of.
R:  Well, it's warmer, which you know, rather than the stuff you get at the store?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know that one stuff that you get at the store can be, um, you can, uh, get addicted to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Again, you know, the other stuff is just saline solution --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the doctor said, "Well, if you're going to use saline solution, just use water 'cause it's cheaper".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the saline solution burns, whereas the water with the -- just the -- like I said, just a little bit of salt?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You just -- so it tastes, it doesn't burn your nose or anything.
L:  Yeah.  That'd probably be better --
R:  Which is, like --
L:  'cause I know I've had to take that stuff before and -- and when it does start dripping back down your throat, it's just -- it -- it tastes nasty.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But salt --
R:  It does.
L:  -- water, you know, it really don't taste all that bad.
R:  Yeah.  No, the salt water -- it's actually -- yeah, that being pretty good.  It's not too shabby.  And she -- she does that every morning.  She says, "I can breathe 'cause I do that every morning".
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, well, I don't do it every morning, so sometimes I still can't breathe, but it seems like I just have all kinds of sinus problems more than I have the acute allergy type things when the seasons change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, my husband has problems with them, but only when the seasons change.  And then he also has a problem where he has to take things that are not, uh, drying.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Because he doesn't have any saliva glands.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  'Cause he got his saliva glands burnt by, um, radiation, so if he takes something -- you know, it dries out mouth out?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things like, ugh, paste.  Well, his is worse than that, because he doesn't have anything --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  He doesn't have anything to wet his throat at all or his mouth at all, so he gets really upset with me 'cause I tell him to take stuff and he's just like, "I don't know what to take".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So.  But that's about all I do, I guess. 
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I try to do all of those different kinds of things.
L:  Yeah.  Have you ever thought about a, um, which I don't know if -- if this has anything to do with seasonal allergies or not, just depending I guess maybe with the molt and the pollens getting in your house, but um, oh, what am I thinking, those, um, air purifiers or whatever they have?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- my mom has one of those because, um, my dad smokes and she's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- allergic to that, so she ta- she uses one of those.  That would probably be good, if you kept everything, um, closed up.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't know whether it work if you had the windows open and things like that?
L:  I don't know, 'cause when it's -- the um -- actually, today's the first day I've turned my air conditioner on.  Up until now, I've had the windows open and everything and --
R:  Is it warm there?
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's about -- well, in -- in the house it was almost eighty degrees.  That's why I turned the air on.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But up until now --
R:  That's a little stuffy.
L:  -- it's been kind of like inbetween.  It's been a little cool, a little warm, and um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just -- I just love the -- the natural -- the -- the smell coming through the house.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Me, too.
L:  So, so -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, when you turn your air conditioner on, I guess that probably would help --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a little bit.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah --
R:  An air purifier would probably help.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said, yeah, an air purifier probably would help.
L:  Yeah, that's it.  Ah, it's something I always had in the back of my mind, that I thought about getting, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just never have gotten one.
R:  Yeah.  My mom has one, uh, uh, in her house because of my dad smoking, but --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- not for anything else, but I guess it would -- I guess it helps with everything else, too, but --
