R:  Good, thanks.
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  [NOISE] Food --
L:  -- restaurant or home cooking?
R:  I actually like both of them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't have a preference.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I eat out on special occasions --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- but I l- like to eat home also, because I love to cook.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yes.
L:  I [SIGH] -- I'm single so I eat out a lot.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE].
L:  And I like it, but it gets very expensive.
R:  Yeah, it does.
L:  But I do enjoy -- today, I just had like lunch with a co-worker, and I definitely enjoy the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Spending with my friends --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- at the restaurant.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the cost -- it's more cost effective --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to [SIGH] buy and cook.
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  So -- [LAUGH].
R:  I like to cook, so I like eating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I have a family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's too expensive to eat out [LAUGH] very regularly.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's just like, on special, special occasions that we do eat out.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know?
L:  -- gosh.  I ate out [LIPSMACK] Saturday night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Friday night, and today. [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really.
L:  [SIGH].
R:  I ate out Friday night, 'cause my husband and I had an -- a night out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we ate out then.  Um, last week, I did a lot of it 'cause we were out of town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On vacation for a spring break.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we did a lot of eating out.  My son loves to eat out.  He loves, like, McDonalds and all these things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I'm tired of that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I prefer the sit down dinners.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH].
L:  What foods do you like to cook?
R:  I do a lot of -- starting to cook a lot of gourmet foods.
L:  Wow.
R:  Now learning. [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's great.
R:  You know.  I -- I cook a lot of, um -- well, I'm from the -- the -- the islands --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so I like to cook like, pilau, which is rice and peas and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some meat --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in it.  I love to cook lots of curry --
L:  Oh, I love curry.
R:  Yeah, I love that --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- and, ah, we do what is called roti.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE].
R:  It's a like a pita bread --
L:  Oh, I love that, too.
R:  -- with curried meats and potatoes and [NOISE] g- gubunga[?] beans in, but we call it tena[?].  And I love to eat -- to make that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my family love that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that three weeks we were -- when we went away, my relatives wanted me to cook, so I had to cook pilau for them. [LAUGH].
L:  Wow, that sounds good, though.
R:  And, ah, 'cause we had like, a family gathering and everyone was there, and they all wanted me to make all the foods 'cause they haven't had it for a long time, and I'm the best, they say, cook, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  So I -- I did that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I like doing it.  You know, I love -- I love eating home.  It's more comfortable.
L:  Yeah, I do, I mean --
R:  You know?
L:  -- yeah.
R:  'Cause I also have a baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's really difficult to eat out with him.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH].
R:  You know?  If he's fall -- if he'll fall asleep, that's fine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but when he's awake, he dabbles a little bit, but he, you know, he hasn't really given me that much trouble, but it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a little bit inconvenient 'cause he's not in a regular chair yet.
L:  Right.
R:  But he can sit quiet if I want him to sit, so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Eating at -- eat in home is like, most preferably for me. [NOISE].
L:  That's nice.
R:  You know.
L:  Like, on Friday we did --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- take out and we ate it at home, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would like to cook.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  My boyfriend's a vegetarian --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I try to think of meals to cook for him that --
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  -- don't have meat, and it's just harder for me, 'cause I'm used to --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- cooking with meat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've been trying to find some good vegetable meals to cook.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause my family -- they don't like vegetables.
L:  They don't?
R:  They don't.  My husband would not eat vegetables.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So that's why the kids do not eat vegetables.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and I'm trying --
L:  Mm [LIPSMACK].
R:  -- to get them to eat, you know, right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [NOISE] he's not there making a good example. [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And so, my eldest son, he would eat like, I can give him broccoli.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But my husband doesn't like to see it, so I hardly ever cook it.  He'll eat corn --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- every day.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's the only vegetable he'll -- he'll eat.
L:  Is corn?
R:  Yeah, and if I make like, stir fry --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I have to put the carrots and stuff in it, he'd --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eat it then, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he would not eat carrots.
L:  Wow.
R:  Anything like that without meat.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH].  He's like a child, too, so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- so food wise, ah, [NOISE] really hard for me.  I'm just trying to find things that they all would like and it's nutritious and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  That's what's tough.
R:  That's my problem.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Give them junk food, they'll have that all the time.
L:  Right.  Of course.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying to get them to have like, fish and things like that.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I like some fish --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not all.  I like -- the only fish that I would -- that I see in the store that I really, really like, is salmon.
L:  Oh, I like salmon.
R:  You know, but they don't like it.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH].
R:  My husband doesn't like it.  [LAUGH].
L:  I've been making a lot of like, pastas lately.
R:  Pastas?  [NOISE].
L:  Like fettuccine and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just different things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I know, like, my boyfriend will eat that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I like anything.
R:  Uh-huh.  So do I [several inaudible words].  He's a pasta lover, too.  He'll eat past every day.
L:  Pasta and bread.
R:  Yes.
L:  I love that.
R:  Every day.  [LAUGH].
L:  I could eat bread every meal.
R:  You know, but I get tired.  Yeah, I get tired of that, sometimes, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I made, um, what was it call- -- manically[?] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and baked pasta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the, um, ricotta cheese and all that stuff stuffed in it.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And I made that last -- week before --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and it was good, my very first time doing it, and it was -- it came out really good.
L:  Do you bake that?
R:  Yeah, you have to bake it.
L:  How do you cook it?
R:  I [inaudible] -- well, you boil the pasta --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you get the -- cut the ri- ri- ricotta cheese --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have, um, mozzarella, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have parmesan and you mix it all together and you put some spices in there, like Italian seasoning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You season it up and you stuff it into the shells --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you put it in your pan, you put, um, pasta sauce over that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you sprinkle some cheese on that, so you bake it covered with foil, for like, forty -- thirty five minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then you uncover it, and you sprinkle the rest of the cheese on there, and it be good for another ten to fifteen minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then it's done.
L:  That sounds delicious.
R:  Yeah, it is, it's great [LAUGH].

R:  You know.  I -- I love cooking, so I'm just starting getting all these cookbooks and --

R:  You know, so I -- I made plait bread last week, you know, the braided breads.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was great.  It came out soft --
L:  Oh, that sounds good.
R:  -- and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, ah, I was never really good at baking bread.  I was, you know, I could -- the only thing I could tell everyone, I cannot make bread.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then all of a sudden, you know, I'm making bread, so that it looks -- it tastes -- it's better than the store bread.

R:  And I'm like, "Come on, people" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, 'cause it started to get expensive. [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  So I started to -- I -- I got a recipe, and I started making it, and they're like, "Wow, mommy, this is so good".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It tastes like the store.
L:  And it saves you, huh?
R:  Yes.  It does.
L:  Saves money, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  'Cause a pack of flour's what, a dollar and something?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just to get -- and cinnamon isn't expensive, 'cause you always have that on hand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you just make the things up, and it's good to go.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [NOISE] I -- I like food.  [LAUGH].
