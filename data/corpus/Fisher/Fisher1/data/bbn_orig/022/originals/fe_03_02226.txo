L:  Hi, I'm Ed.  I'm from Kokomo, Indiana.  I'm a self-employed computer consultant guy and ah -- I have two little girls.
R:  I'm Mary Gardiner.  I live in Evansdale, Iowa.  I'm retired.  I, um, love computers.  I'm on mine all the time.
L:  [LAUGH]. I'm on --
R:  But I love to cook too.
L:  Yeah?  I'm -- I'm a -- like I said, I'm a computer consultant so I'm pretty much on mine all the time too but ah -- ah, I don't get a chance to cook a whole lot but I -- ah -- ah, got a little bit of an interest in developing -- I've got an idea for a diet fudge which, ah, some of the people I work with are pretty interested in.
R:  In diet what?
L:  Diet fudge.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I wonder how you do that?
L:  Um, there's a- an artificial sweetener -- sweetener called splendor.  It's a lot like sugar but it's not exactly the same and it's not working out so well yet but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm work- -- I'm working on that.  I --
R:  I cooked for a di- -- a lady that's a diabetic and I always make her regular sugar products.  So, I was thinking, you know, what could I use as a substitute that would be as good?
L:  Yeah?  It's pretty good.  Um, it comes in a yellow box that's the same size as like the two pound boxes of sugar.  It's real expensive though and it -- it -- it's okay for sweetening.  Ah, for sweetening it's pretty close to sugar but if you cook with it, it -- it doesn't match. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't do the same thing.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  So we're supposed to talk about ah -- whether we like to go out to eat or to eat at home?  Is that what the thing said?
R:  Yeah.  that's it.  What would be our ideal meal if we went out, after that?
L:  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear it.  I couldn't hear clearly.
R:  I think.  I'm pretty sure that's [inaudible].
L:  Okay.  Um.  Where do you like to go to eat?
R:  I would quite like to go to like home style cooking.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Like those kind of buffets.  Like -- I just like a roast beef dinner, mashed potatoes and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  I like ah -- my ah -- favorite restaurant right now -- I -- I have two kids.  A six year old and a two year old.  So, w- what works real well for us right now is ah -- buffets because like they can -- like the six year old is old enough that she can -- we can take her up there and she can pick out what she wants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so we can get her to eat something.  She's a real picky eater.  A two year old you can basically set anything in front of him and it's -- it'll get going but --
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard when they are more picky eaters.
L:  Yeah.
R:  None of mine were.  I was fortunate.  Not too bad.
L:  Yeah.  How m- many have you got?
R:  I had three girls.
L:  Three girls?
R:  But they're all raised now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And have kids of their own.
L:  Yeah.  I've got two little ones but I don't know.  They're not allowed to grow up. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I have a lot of those little ones around.  My grandchildren.
L:  Yeah?  Some day, I suppose.
R:  I like -- we go out for breakfast a lot too.
L:  I think we -- we -- we never wake up in time for breakfast.  A- all of us are pretty much evening ah -- evening people.  I think I've made it to breakfast like twice in the last year.
R:  Well, we go at noon sometimes.  Sometimes it's suppertime.  Just because we like to get it.
L:  Yeah.  I think McDonald's should serve breakfast like all day.
R:  That would be nice.  They sh- should, at least till noon.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Li- like on the weekends, especially.
R:  For sure.  [LAUGH].  The biggest treat of my family is to go to Texas Roadhouse.  We all love it.
L:  Yeah?  Tex -- I like Texas Roadhouse.  We have that here.  They used to have really good ribs but ah -- I don't think they're as good as they used to be.
R:  They're pretty good here 'cause my family that's got them, really like them but I haven't tried them.  I have the steak.
L:  Yeah?  W- we went there a couple of weeks ago.  I think -- oh, I had -- had the ribs then and um, but yeah, I think I'm gonna stick to steak there.
R:  I think it all depends on the cook.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  How good they cook it.
L:  Yeah.  That's another good reason --
R:  They probably have recipes.
L:  What's that?
R:  They probably make them follow a recipe.
L:  Yeah.  That's another good reason to go to like Golden Coral 'cause if you don't like your steak you can, you know, like, eat half of it and go up and get a different one.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never been there.  We don't have one here.
L:  Oh, really.  Oh, they -- they have a -- it's all over like a ranch steakhouse or a -- what's it called?  Um, um, shoot.  What's that other big -- ah -- all you can eat with takeaways?
R:  We don't hardly have any here.  Bishops?
L:  No, we don't have any of them around here.  I can't think of the name of the place.  Um, I used to travel, um, for my job and oh -- shoot -- what's that place called?
R:  Your job sounds interesting.
L:  Oh, it -- it was -- that --that was two jobs ago.  Um, like I said I'm a computer guy.  We don't stay at the same job a whole -- a whole lot.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I used to travel all over the US.  Um.  [inaudible] sell software for banks.
R:  Oh.  That sounds like -- well, if you were single [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun at first but, um, I don't know, it gets old after a while and you get --
R:  You won't get old [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  But you're right.  For a, um, for a single person, it'd be great.  One guy that I worked with, he was there for, I don't know, like four years or so and ah, you know, a single guy had an apartment with like a TV and a bed.  He was on the road most of the other -- most of the rest of the time.
R:  Oh, I would -- I wouldn't want to come home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that -- it's -- the job is challenging, that's what I like about it.  It sounded interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I didn't know what a computer consultant was, for sure.
L:  Yes.  It's a kind of a catchall thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yeah, it was -- was fun.  We got to see a lot of the country and meet new people all the time and --
R:  Eat a lot of places?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Anything that stuck in your mind that you liked?
L:  Say again?
R:  A special place to eat?
L:  Um.  Let's see.  Um.  I used to -- there was this ah, ah, pub in Indianapolis when I worked down there that I ate at almost every day for lunch.  Um.
R:  It was really good, huh?
L:  Yes, it was really -- it had really good food and they also had, ah, pool tables and we got to play pool during lunch for -- it was like -- it wasn't extra.  It was like, with your food.  Um, so we basically went over there and ate and shot pool every day for lunch, so.
R:  Well, it must have been good.
L:  Yeah, it was fun while it lasted but, um, it was a dot com company and like everyone else, you know, they found out exactly how fast they could burn through.  I think it was thirty five million dollars.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It took them about a year and they blew through it and that was it.
R:  My gosh.  What kind of -- what's your favorite meal at home?
L:  At home?  Um.  Ah.  I like to cook on the grill.
R:  Oh, that sounds delicious.
L:  Yeah.  Steak or barbecued chicken, an --
R:  I live in an apartment.  There isn't really a place for a grill.
L:  Oh.  Can't you grill on the balcony?
R:  It's a downstairs apartment but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I probably could go outside with some kind of a grill if I got one but I'd have to haul it in and out and it's more fun to go to my kids.  They have them.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I used to have a, a charcoal grill but um, after it broke, I we- -- I broke down and got a gas one.  It's easier.
R:  That's what my -- one of my children has.  They like it.
L:  Yeah --
