R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Theresa.
R:  I'm Jennifer.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, Jennifer.  How you doing?
R:  Good, how you doing?  This is kind of weird, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Act- actually, it's fun.  This is my second call and it -- it's really kind of fun and interesting.
R:  Oh, cool.  Yeah, this is my first one. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I just got home from work and saw this ad and I thought, wow, okay.  Ten minutes, cool.  
L:  You know, it never hurts.  [LAUGH].
R:  Great.
L:  Aha.
R:  So, how does it work?  We basically chat for, like, another minute and we have eight minutes to talk about this thing, or --
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're supposed to talk about the topic of the day.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, illness.
R:  All right.
L:  Um, well, I'll tell you what -- what I've done to try to stay better and --
R:  O- okay.
L:  -- um [inaudible] the Atkins diet.
R:  Oh.  Now, tell me about that?
L:  Okay, it --
R:  How does that work?
L:  It -- it's pretty much a low carb thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, um, I'm thirty five, and since I was thirteen, I've had problems with insomnia.
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.,
L:  And I -- I don't like to take pharmaceuticals.  
R:  Mhm?
L:  I've tried meditation, exercise.  I've tried taking mild, you know, things that make me sleep or whatever.  I -- I have a little bit of wacky blood sugar, but nothing --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that I have to be on a controlled diet for or anything like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I started doing this just, you know, to feel healthy.  I heard it give you energy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It took rid -- it got rid of my insomnia.
R:  Well, hey, that's amazing.
L:  I have, like, more energy during the day than you can imagine and --
R:  Right.  See, that's fascinating, because I'm -- I tend not -- stop eating carbohydrates.  I'm a carbohydrate complete addict.  It's just like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I was just thinking about that, as I -- as -- as I was walking home today, because the bulk of what I eat is carbohydrates and I wonder, I mean, I'm twenty four, why at the end of the work day I feel like I have to come home and have a nap.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  You know, and I'm thinking, I'm twenty four, I'm healthy, there's no reason why I should feel like I need to have a nap at the end of my work day, because it really wasn't that -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's probably why, 'cause I'm just not giving myself the right fuel.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But you know, because I -- I don't have the mid afternoon fatigue.
R:  Now, do you crave carbohydrates?
L:  Oh, man.  The first week, I wanted a bowl of pasta and a side --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- of french fries.  
R:  So do they allow you any -- I mean, can you have a piece of toast ever, or is it just really like totally gone?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It -- it's just kinda like you start off, and -- and a lot of it is dependent on whether or not you want to lose weight.  You know, I have my three to five pounds that I gained over Christmas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of all the treats and goodies, but --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I don't, like, need to lose a lot of weight, but I was doing it more because I heard that people who do it feel so good.
R:  Great.  All right.
L:  You know, and -- and yeah, I lost a little bit of weight, you know, my three to five pounds or whatever.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Um, and then you gradually start building up your carbs, but yeah, and also it -- it just depends on what you're eating.
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  Like, if you stay away from starch, that's your big thing.
R:  Sure.
L:  Your potatoes, pasta, rice, which is pretty much all I've ever eaten, um --
R:  Ye- yeah, 'cause I'm afraid I'd stop eating the potatoes and starch and just replace it with, like, ice cream and [LAUGH] just something worse, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  But you know, eating a big fat rib eye doesn't suck.
R:  Yeah, I ca- I can imagine having some nice, like, red wine sauce on it or something?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, and you like, oh, don't drink beer, but have wine and alcohol.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm like, well, you know, I think I can switch to that.
R:  Yeah, doesn't sound so bad.  
L:  I'll have a martini instead of a beer.
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  But, you know, just all these other side things that I didn't really expect.  You know, it wasn't my purpose, but here I've had insomnia for years and I sleep like a baby.
R:  Wow.  Now, does the Atkins diet, like, proclaim to help insomnia?  Is it just --
L:  No.
R:  -- that you found it was hell better?
L:  Maybe it was my blood sugar that --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- gave me insomnia?  I don't -- it -- it's a total fluke, but --
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  -- on top of having more energy, I actually have gone two weeks without insomnia, which for me is a record.
R:  I know.
L:  So --
R:  Wow.  That's wonderful.
L:  -- you know, the health benefits are -- are really pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know --
R:  Well, maybe this is a blessing in disguise that I found an ad for this [LAUGH] [inaudible] damage I'll have to try the Atkins diet.  Who knows?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm a health freak anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think that if you take care of yourself, you know, it's so much better for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I -- I try to eat healthy, eat soy, you know and --
R:  Good.
L:  -- do all the right things.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I think -- I mean, jus- just like speaking about illness, I think so many people wonder, just on a global scale, especially Western, how come --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I feel sick, how come I don't have energy, how come I have these symptoms of --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- whatever, but it's like the things that we put in our body --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- are astonishing and the level of processing -- I mean, I'm -- I'm the worst.  I mean, I'll have like these, um -- what you call -- those, like, instant Japanese noodles.  I mean, they're like --
L:  Oh, oh, Ramen noodles and --
R:  I don't like --
L:  I don't -- I couldn't -- if I had a dollar for every box of macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  in my life or other, you know, hamburger helper --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or other processed --
R:  But it's like the -- I -- I work every morning at the Cattering Cancer Center and um --
L:  Oh wow.  Cool.
R:  Yeah, it's um -- I don't -- I'm not actually involved in cancer research per se, but it's just interesting because um --
L:  I bet you get a lot of just information about nutrition as far as like --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- how to avoid cancer?
R:  Well, definitely and I mean, the rates of cancer have skyrocketed and, you know, for all the advances we've made in medicine, I mean, I mean, there are some diseases that have been around, okay, but I mean, people are getting sicker --
L:  But um, well, I mean, look at Americans overall.  We eat crap --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- we lead a high stress life, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're -- we're obsessive compulsive workaholics.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  But, like, I -- I'd sit around and I'd look at people who are like French or Japanese, who like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- culturally smoke like fiends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they [LAUGH] they have, like, lung -- lung cancer, of course, they're --
R:  Yeah.  It's really weird, isn't it.
L:  -- not smoking -- you know, these horrible cigarettes with all the additives that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that are put in here, but I would sit around and wonder, I'm like, how can these people living in the Ukraine who just sit there and eat sausage and smoke cigarettes --
R:  Yeah, and sauerkraut and --
L:  -- live so -- yeah.  
R:  So true.
L:  I think the low stress, like, lifestyle thing is important, too, I think.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it reminds me of this thing that the phone system said, of like your cold's gonna last a day whether you go to a doctor or not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I mean, I don't -- I mean, a cold is a virus and the doctors love to prescribe antibac- um, sorry, antibiotics which --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- are useless.
L:  That just helps for bacteria, doesn't it?
R:  Absolutely, and you mu- I -- I mean, I suppose you might get a secondary bacterial infection, I -- I guess, but the real thing is that the antivacs do nothing for the virus, and so all you do is you feel better that you've gone along to the doctor and, like, you -- he's saw you for five minutes --
L:  But you're just building up your resistance --
R:  -- and -- yeah, and he gives you --
L:  -- to antibiotics, really.
R:  Absolutely.  And then it's just that you get -- you know, you're more prone to yeast infections, urinary tract infections, etcetera.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, but it's just like, I guess people feel like they need to go because they need to be sort of a bit proactive in fighting the cold --
L:  You know, I think that it --
R:  -- but I mean, it -- it's a [inaudible] they're not ready to do the things that would actually improve their lifestyle, you know?  It takes a --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I have a lot of friends who are, like, into so much holistic stuff, like --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- I remember -- um, I'm from the north and I moved to Nashville and started having, like, not really bad but just, like, seasonal allergy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And a friend of mine was, like, take a cayenne pepper tablet.
R:  Really?
L:  It worked.
R:  Because I have allergies right now.  They're killing me.
L:  And I'm -- I'm sitting here going, "I hate Benadryl because I feel speedy".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was just like, "Cayenne pepper tablet?" and she was --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like, "Or you can mix it in hot water".  I'm like, "Hell, no".
R:  Oh no, I'm not that brave.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I went to the health food store and took it and yeah, like, I was having like sinus blockage and headaches.
R:  Wow.
L:  And it -- yeah, I got rid of it.  It -- it would only last a couple hours.  It wasn't, like, twelve hour pain relief, but --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I also knew I wasn't like take any -- a natural crap and I didn't get, you know, the speedy --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- feeling?
R:  Well, that's really interesting.  I wonder if I should just include more of it in my diet, just -- I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- aside from actually having the pill quite yet, just like putting it on my food or something?
L:  Oh, no.  Yeah, but -- yeah, like, nothing's better than a cold than, like, Thai food.
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  [LAUGH].
L:  More like getting hot --
R:  They're really spicy.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from New York.  Where you at?
L:  Oh, New York?  I'm in Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  You know, I was just going to say, I -- I was going to guess that you were from Nashville.
L:  Yeah?  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's where I'm living now.  I'm originally from Chicago, but I live here now.
R:  Oh, interesting, great.
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- and -- and how do you like it there?  It's a good place to live?
L:  Uh, it's a very complacent place to live.
R:  Okay?
L:  The -- because it's so comfortable, the cost of living's low, the crime is low, the traffic isn't bad, the climate's not bad.  But when it comes to, like, the arts or um, intellectual conversation with people, you know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- it goes to the wayside.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's the -- the best thing about New York, I suppose, is you -- there's never a dull moment and there's always somebody to --
L:  Do you -- do you like living -- are you from the city?
R:  No.  I'm from a small town in Western Canada.  
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  And I don't like --
L:  How cool.
R:  -- most of New York.  I mean, like I could go on forever, but I -- the -- um, the amazing parts like the museums and I love music, I go to the jazz --
L:  I love Moma.  
R:  It's amazing.  Absolutely wonderful stuff, but you have to get through a lot of crap to -- to get there.  You have to be able to have the --
L:  See --
R:  -- time and afford it, which most people can't do.  They move here, and they find themselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like me, just living in a small apartment and going on the subway and just sort of time passes and you think, "Like, what am I doing here?" and I go --
L:  See, I don't miss the stress of living back in Chicago.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- it takes a lot of energy.  Like, just think of grocery shopping.  You got to walk up the flights of stairs --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in your apartment, then you gotta -- and -- and, like, no one has a car of course, so you -- you spend hours and you came home and you feel exhausted, like all you did was go grocery shopping.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, like, I have something now that I couldn't have before.  A dog.
R:  Yes.  See, I miss my animals.  See, I've always had a dog and a cat.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And the people that keep pets here I think are very annoying because these poor animals are living in these tiny little apartments --
L:  That's -- see, that's not right.
R:  -- and it's like --
L:  You know, and animals are supposed to be, like a stress reducer, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you got to go down twelve flights --
R:  Yeah, and when you got to hire someone to walk your dog.
L:  And the poor dogs never get to play on grass.  [LAUGH].  I mean, that's --
R:  Yeah, I know, like walking around --
L:  -- just wrong.
R:  -- on cement.  Man, I wouldn't want to be a dog in New York, especially like it's very trendy to have a big dog like a Dalmatian or a --
L:  Well, I know this guy from New York, he was down here for some work thing --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and he owned a -- a Great Dane and I'm thinking, one, how can you afford an apartment big enough for a Dane?
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  And God help you if you don't, and what --
R:  Yeah --
