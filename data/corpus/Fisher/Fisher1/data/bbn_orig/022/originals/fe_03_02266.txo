R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  [LAUGH] My name's Janelle.
L:  Hi, Janelle.  I'm Sheryl.
R:  Hi, Sheryl.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good [LAUGH].
L:  Good.
R:  Um, where are you from?
L:  Ah, I am in southern California, in Anaheim.
R:  Oh, wow.  I'm in, um, Dubuque, Iowa.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow [LAUGH].
R:  Um, so, illness.
L:  Illness [LAUGH], well, um, let's see.  I'm not one to get ill very often, so, um, I guess I do believe the -- the saying, you know, if you're ill seven days with or without going to the doctor [LAUGH].
R:  I think that's really true too, but living in Iowa, we have such, ah, extreme temperature changes that we do get more colds, flus, things like that.
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Out ehre the -- the weathers, ah, more consistent so we don't experience that much -- ah, that as much.  But I do notice when the, um, seasons change and -- and allergies.  I have a big problem with that.
R:  We had, ah, one week this year that we had a snowstorm on Monday and on Saturday we were going out without a coat.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You see, it's really drastic [LAUGH].
L:  Extreme changes in weather, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Mhm.  But, ah, no, I usually -- usually people don't go to, you know, people in our area do not go to the doctor for a cold.  One --
L:  No.
R:  -- of those things you just have to wait out.
L:  Exactly.  Same here.
R:  But, um, I really feel like if you have a fever for more than three days, you should go to the doctor.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I know I was, um -- gosh, I guess it's been about a month, but I was the sickest I have ever been.  I was off work for a week, which is really, really unusual for me.  I have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like never experienced that and, um, I'm not sure.  I think it was just a bad flu bug that was going around.  I -- I finally went to an urgent care just to get some antibiotics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, oh, I was down.  I wasn't feeling any better, but that was the worst I have -- I think I have ever experienced.  And I mean I was taking over the counter drugs.  Nothing seemed to help.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, my husband had pneumonia in December right before Christmas.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  He was in the hospital, yeah, for twelve days.
L:  [SIGH] Twelve days, wow.  Oh, my --
R:  But we had gone to an acute care center and they had given antibiotics.  They diagnosed him and everything.  Gave him an antibiotic.  After about a week, he was, um, worse.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And ended up getting dehydrated and everything.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Took him to the doctor.  He couldn't even hardly walk.  I had a take him round in a wheelchair and he's not old [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, ended up in hospital, so --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- you just don't know.
L:  -- gosh.  For -- for twelve days, that's very serious.
R:  Yeah.  They --
L:  Um --
R:  -- said that if he had waited a couple more days, that they would have -- he'd have been in intensive care with a respirator.
L:  Ah, oh, wow.
R:  Yeah [LIPSMACK].
L:  Oh, that's so scary.  Now do you --
R:  It is.
L:  -- think, um, it is -- do you think that's weather related or just, ah --
R:  I --
L:  -- what do you think caused that?
R:  They say it's -- they say it's viral.
L:  Is it?  Yeah.
R:  You know, but, um, you know, I -- I didn't -- I thought once we went to the acute care doctor, you know, you would think that he would --
L:  You'd think --
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, diagnose that.
R:  Give us the right -- yeah, and give us the right, ah --
L:  R-
R:  -- road to take.
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  But it just ended up [LAUGH] getting worse.  It was horrible.
L:  I know.  I -- I know.  I think sometimes those urgent care places, it's, ah, you know, it's sort of hit or miss with them [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  Yeah, well, our mistake was not calling our regular doctor --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, 'cause this was on a weekend so that's --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- where you go.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Calling him Monday morning but, oh, well.
L:  I know.  I know.  It's -- in fact, I just got some sad news today that my -- one of my best friends, ah, her father just passed away yesterday --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- afternoon, and very young man.  Um, he was fifty seven years old and had just been in ill health for a couple of years, just basically his body was, ah, shutting down.  His liver and -- and lungs and -- and that and he had been, ah, ah, I guess very sick since Easter and had been in the hospital and -- and they had told him -- told her that, you know,  it was just really a matter of days.  He was in a coma --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- recognizing anybody but, oh, I know.  It's just horrible.  Horrible to -- to watch somebody, you know, so full of life and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that go through that.  And, ah, to top it off, she's getting married, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in a few months too -- yeah.  So --
R:  I have a wedding in -- in a week and a half.
L:  Really?
R:  My daughter's getting married [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  Oh, how wonderful.
R:  I guess we shouldn't get into that subject but yeah [LAUGH].
L:  No, I guess not.
R:  So we don't wanna get sick for that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'll add that part [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  And now, with the new, the SARS virus --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is that anything that you've heard, ah --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- much in California?
L:  -- what -- yeah.  Um, we get -- we hear about that a lot just because we have so many, you know, international travellers and a lot of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that do travel from Asia and I guess Canada it's really affecting, ah, Toronto -- the Toronto area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as well.  But, no, when I was, ah -- when I was sick for, ah, you know last month for that, I really thought, "My goodness --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- do I have this?" [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] yeah.
L:  I felt -- yeah, I mean, I had a fever.  I -- I seemed to have all the symptoms.  You know, I went from chills to, um, you know, the sweats and all that and I thought, "Oh, my goodness," you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's no way of -- of really knowing.  It's, you know, you could walk some -- you know, walk next to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody who's been there and back and may have it and, you know, how could you really know.  But, um, yeah, I -- it -- it -- it really has affected, I think, a lot of people out here, although I don't think anybody has died from it but, you know, I -- I feel bad for business travellers and whatnot.  That's really scary.
R:  Have there been cases in California or not?
L:  I -- well, I -- I think so.  It -- it's certainly been diagnosed.  It's been, um, I know it's been diagnosed in Los Angeles County and Orange County --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- where, um, I work as well, so, yeah.  I mean we do -- we -- there's a high Asian population out here too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, um, yeah, it's very scary and, ah --
R:  Well, I have a -- I used to work for an import company years ago and [COUGH] my boss went to China or Hong Kong four times a year.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they're scheduled to go on a trip and be on a trip right now and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the salesman that was going to go with him, ah, cancelled out.  He said, "I'm -- I'm not going, you know, because of that," and then I don't know if the boss actually ended up going or not, but I'm -- I'll find out tomorrow 'cause I'm having lunch with the gentleman so [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- scary.  I don't blame him for not wanting to go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, ah, it -- it's, you know -- the symptoms are so serious.  I don't -- you know, I don't think -- well, I mean obviously there's been a lot of deaths from it.  I don't think it's fatal when you catch it, but, um, I do remember I think the doctor who discovered it, he, um, he was an Italian doctor and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think he died from it.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, um, yeah, it's -- it is.  It's very scary and you see all these pictures in the news of people wearing their, you know, their masks, the surgical masks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and whatnot.  Yeah.  I -- I -- if I lived out there, I would be terrified.
R:  Well, I don't think -- I mean I -- it wouldn't be worth it to me to go --
L:  No.
R:  -- and they say now that it's dying down in Hong Kong, but going --
L:  It -- it's spreading other places?
R:  -- spreading more in, um, China.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I think in Hong Kong they -- I think they finally, you know, took some steps to prevent it from spreading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, I -- and I think there's a big convention or something that goes on out there.  I'm sure they have a lot of conventions but, um, um, one that I guess they're well known for and there was talk of them actually cancelling that which, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was a big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- moneymaker for them, so I don't know.
R:  That could almost be what my boss goes to because he's --
L:  Maybe --
R:  -- it's an --
L:  -- it's the same thing.
R:  -- import, ah, it was an import business.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Um --
L:  And, um, so I guess they were still having it, but he chose not to go, or you don't know if he went --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- or not?
R:  -- know for sure if he went.  I know the -- the salesman that was going to go with him --
L:  Said no [LAUGH].
R:  -- but, "I'm not going".
L:  I --
R:  So --
L:  -- know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It is very, very scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  What else?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, do you notice that you get maybe more colds or sickness with the cold weather or -- or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think it's because you're indoors all the time.
L:  Yeah.  And you don't have --
R:  I mean that's what they say, yeah.
L:  -- the germs don't have a chance to escape maybe, is that --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they say and I mean it really -- to get sick in the summer here is rare.  Ah, you know, even to get a cold or anything. But in the winter, ah, you know, especially if you have a family get together --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there's always somebody that's got a cold or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I -- and I noticed, um, when I was in college, I tended to get sick right at -- stress really played a -- a major factor in when I got sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, after finals or -- or during --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a particularly stressful time.  Even after the holidays, I noticed that I'll -- I'll usually get some sort of cold or sickness --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in January.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It seems to just kinda affect me that it once, you know, the holidays are over and then boom, you know, you have a chance to kinda catch up or take a deep breath and then it -- it hits ya then.
R:  What is your temperature in, ah, like January and February?
L:  Well, it -- it varies, but, ah, it's prob- it's usually in -- in the sixties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Fifties or sixties, which isn't too bad at all.
R:  No.
L:  Um, yeah --
R:  That's about what it is here right now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Let me look at my thermometer.  Fifty six.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, see that would be considered a cold day out here [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, but I --
R:  I've a sister in Seattle and they have a lot of rain and -- and they kinda get the cold and --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that.
L:  -- I wonder if -- if rain affects it very much.  Um, that might -- I don't know. Maybe that --
R:  You'd think --
L:  -- has more --
R:  -- that would clean --
L:  -- to do with allergies.
R:  -- the air, though, wouldn't ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would rain clear the air --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, you would think, although, um, I -- I mean, like I said, I've got allergies and those are year round.  I certainly don't see them as being seasonal even though I -- I guess, you know, maybe I do get them more -- I seem to get 'em more in the fall than in the spring.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah, and less maybe in the winter and the summer.  I'm not sure why that is.
R:  They do say here that
