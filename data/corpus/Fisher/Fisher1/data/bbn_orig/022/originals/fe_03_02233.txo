L:  Hi, my name is Shaun.
R:  Hi, my name is Taylor.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  I'm all right.  [LAUGH].  I've been waiting for like ten minutes, so.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH].  This is my first call too, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah, same here.  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm new to this.  So, I think we're supposed to talk about food?
R:  Yes.  Ah, I can guarantee that mine's in a restaurant rather than being at home but --
L:  At a restaurant you like people serving you?
R:  Well, the fact that the only thing I can cook -- I -- I'm a whiz with the George Forman but that's about it.
L:  A whiz on the George Forman?
R:  Yeah.
L:  A barbecue grill?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you from Texas?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  No, no.  But everyone should have one.  It changes your life.  [LAUGH].
L:  I would say home because I don't  like -- I don't like having to be hassled having to be at a restaurant and not being able to get up and go and come -- come as I please.  I feel a little bit trapped inside of them but -- but of course, for date or, or um, finer meals, going out is nice.
R:  I think -- I think actually home delivery is [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  There you go, there you go.  A combination of both, right?
R:  So I can eat whatever I want in my house and have their food without having to cook it, then I -- I would have to say, that would probably be my dream meal, yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  When did you sign up for the phone service?
R:  Ah, I signed up, ah, a few days ago.
L:  Two days ago?  Okay.  I just called today and then they say it will take twenty four hours but I'd already gotten one call so I was just kind of curious about the whole -- the whole programme.  Um.  So what kind of food do you like?
R:  Well, if -- if I my last meal --
L:  Yeah, yeah, your last  -- your death row last meal?
R:  I'll go with that.  You know, if I -- if I were going to prison for my serial killing then I think that I would, um, I would do -- like a prime rib with bearnaise sauce.
L:  A prime rib with bearnaise sauce?
R:  And au gratin potatoes.
L:  That sounds lovely.  You're -- you're -- you're a meat and potatoes kind of girl?
R:  Not in general but that -- if that was my last -- last meal --
L:  Well, if your George --
R:  -- that's what I'd have.
L:  -- George Forman, you can't exactly do vegetables on that.
R:  Yeah, you can.
L:  Can you?
R:  Yes, you can.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You can grill -- grill vegetables all the time.
L:  Uh.
R:  Mostly I usually, actually you do it for poultry.  [inaudible] and fish.
L:  I'm a master chef at Top Roman and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And everything comes in a can.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I can't -- I can't do a lot.  I don't really do much pasta anymore.  If I'm out at a restaurant, maybe, but a good Italian restaurant, but --
L:  Italian?  I like Italian food.
R:  Yeah, the only thing I hate -- I only hate two things.  I have Thai and I hate Vietnamese.
L:  You hate Chinese and Vietnamese food?
R:  No, I like Chinese.
L:  Oh, you like Chinese?
R:  Yeah.  I hate Thai.
L:  You hate Thai?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How can you hate Thai food?  Thai food is gr- wonderful.
R:  No, everything has a tree in it.  They have like branches and leaves and everything.  I can't stand it.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was never a problem until it became in vogue to have Thai food.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, you just kind of -- kind of know what to order.  I mean food's food.  It's either -- all food's either chicken, beef, fish, shrimp.  You know, it's like one version of that either on noodles, rice with vegetables.  I mean there's only so many foods in the world.  And they just kind a --
R:  The way that they do it for each country's culture is very different.  You know?
L:  Like Italian pasta.  You know, there's seventeen kinds of pasta but it's all the exact same thing in a different shape.
R:  No.  They all taste different.  They taste the sauce differently.  [inaudible].
L:  The spices, yeah, but like spaghetti and -- and -- and bows and ribbons and --
R:  I know, but like I can't stand spaghetti and I don't like bow ties.  But I love like [inaudible] and um, penne and things like that.  Like, I don't like anything, spaghetti, linguini, any of that.  I don't like -- and definitely not angel hair.  I don't like how it tastes with the sauce.
L:  Yeah.  And, um.  Wh- what city are you in?
R:  Ah, I was -- I live in Los Angeles now but I was born and bred in Atlanta.
L:  In Atlanta.  An Atlanta girl?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  And where are you calling from?
L:  Uh, California.  From Hollywood.
R:  [LAUGH].  Okay.  Probably not far from here.
L:  I've got lots of -- when you go to the restaurants here they are all like real trendy.
R:  Well, the restaurants here --
L:  Trendy, hippie, you know?
R:  -- all taste the same ...  Maybe --
L:  Fifteen dollar cups of -- you know, cups of coffee.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know.  And every waiter is -- is an actor, actress wannabe, so, you know, they all serve you with an attitude and, and a --  It's kind of funny.  Everywhere I live there -- I don't know if there's a place called Pinks Hotdogs?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And it's just for frigging hot dog but every time you go by the place there's a line going around the corner.  There's at least fifty people standing there.
R:  Well, that's two reasons, you know.  One, because it supposed to be the best hotdogs in the city and two -- well, three reasons.  Two, it's open so late which not a lot in LA is and three, you get all the people with the munchies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about three o'clock in the morning [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- around there because that's when --
L:  Well, it's just like the one out here.  There's like a [COUGH] a Tommy's and a Taco Bill are great, across the street and they were probably like ghost towned and the Pinks is just -- just jam-packed and it's only a hotdog.  I mean, I don't know how -- I can't imagine it being the ultimate experience, but --
R:  I don't like hotdogs.  I've never gone, but you know?  But all my friends seem to like the ones there, so.
L:  Yeah.  Have you eaten there?  Other things?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I got -- I used to live in Denmark and we had [inaudible] stands but [inaudible] Danish for sausage and so that -- I think I got like sausaged out at that point [LAUGH] because they were open twenty four hours.  It was the only thing open twenty four hours.
L:  In Denmark, huh?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Ver you on holiday?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Were you in Copenhagen?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I've been.
L:    Are we allowed to talk like personal stuff or do we have to talk about food?  I'm not sure --
R:  I guess we should keep to food.  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know what -- So what's Danish food like?
R:  Um, it's very -- well, it depends.  Some of it's very bland.  Um, a lot of it's pork.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, 'cause they do a lot of exporting for their fish.  Their fish is amazing.  And I love skate.  That was my favorite thing I had there --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and during the day they have a lot of open face sandwiches called um, ah, oh my God, I'm forgetting the names of everything and I speak fluent Danish but [LAUGH].
L:  You speak fluent Danish?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  [Danish phrase].
R:  [Danish phrase].
L:  Yeah, not everybody knows that you know.
R:  Yeah.  That's the um, that's the formal way to say it.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  The normal way to say it is [Danish phrase].
L:  We have to talk about f- -- how would you say "I'm hungry" in Danish?
R:  Oh God. Um.  They don't really --
L:  They don't get hungry?  [LAUGH].
R:  They don't say it like that.  They just don't say it like that.
L:  Time to eat. [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, that's it.  They have -- they have a weird way of expressing like certain things.  Like they have no word for "please".  They only have a word for "thank you".
L:  Yeah.
R:  So things are kind of opposite and -- like nothing is -- you can never exaggerate.  Danes never exaggerate so it's kind of -- like to say "I'm hungry" is very exaggerated.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Have you ever read  "A familiar sense of smell[?]"?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Have you?
R:  I give it out to people all the time, actually.
L:  There you go.  And I'm saying that because there is food in that book.
R:  Yes, there's lots of food in that book.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Smorgasbord.  Smorgasbord is the name of open faced sandwiches.
L:  [inaudible] was a very bad cook.  She couldn't cook well.
R:  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  I am showing one or two to the mechanics and let him cook and he always --
R:  So what would your perfect meal be?
L:  My perfect meal would be anything with a lovely woman as a company.  No, that's sounds corny.  [LAUGH].  Um, I like the typicals, ah -- I do like spaghetti.  Um, hamburgers.  Um, I'm not a vegetarian or anything like that but I'm kind of a light eater.  I'm definitely not the typical fat American like you know, triple burg- -- triple cheeseburger with bacon and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- all that kind of stuff on it.  I just kind a -- I don't -- I find -- I find that people put a lot of -- a lot of ah, a lot of their day goes into their food like my parents are like, while they're eating breakfast they are talking about what they should have for dinner.  And for me, it's more like I'm hungry, I just want something in my stomach right now.  So I don't really kind of put too much -- too much [inaudible] into it because I guess if I was on death row and it was my last meal, I'd go for a lobster.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yes, a lobster or you know, lampton[?] king crab.
R:  I had lobster -- I like lobster meat but I had lobster in Maine when I was visiting a friend there and ah, [LAUGH] it was too traumatic for me, like break open a lobster so I don't think I could do that again.
L:  Yeah, it's kind -- I don't know why they did it.  You know, that's what the funny thing is.  You know, like, a lot of other -- other countries -- I've travelled a lot -- they just -- you eat the lobster tail.
R:  Right, which I prefer, actually, the lobster tail.
L:  Instead of bringing you the whole entire frigging lobster and you've got to look at what you're eating.
R:  I know.  It's scary.  I just --
L:  The poor thing's face while you're looking at -- all the grilled stuff that's on the inside is -- like, it's a little [inaudible] for me.  I just want the lobster tail.
R:  Yeah, it's too traumatic.
L:  Or crab legs.  Crab legs and shrimp.  Shrimps --
R:  Yeah, I'm a big seafood fan.
L:  Shrimp scampi.
R:  It was nice to live up north.  I -- I lived in New York for six years so it was nice to -- to be -- after being in Atlanta, which is totally landlocked, to be around seafood was nice.
L:  Yeah.  I hear you there.  Um, yeah, fish and chips are --
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a little [LAUGH].  Not my cup of tea.  [inaudible].  That kind of thing.
L:  Does food cover drink too do you think?
R:  Oh, I think so, definitely.
L:  So, do you like wine, soft drinks?
R:  I actually don't eat alcohol so I don't drink --
L:  Are -- are you a water drinker?
R:  I'm a big water drinker.  And I am like a water, lemon person.  I like water and lime actually, better.
L:  Water and lime.
R:  I think it tastes better.  But, I'm a big Doctor Pepper fan.  [LAUGH].
L:  Very good.  I like Doctor Pepper.
R:  And diet Doctor Pepper is my favorite out of the diet drinks.
L:  Diet.
R:  But ah, yeah, now, I don't do the wine thing.  I don't know anything about it.  I only know what I learned when I went to Napa[?] but I've never tasted -- I -- I've had one sip of it my whole life, so.
L:  You sound like you've travelled quite a lot so you've had quite a lot of international cuisines?
R:  Yeah.  I guess I have.  And I actually have travelled a lot 'cause I love to travel.  Um, but yeah, no, I mean, especially after --
