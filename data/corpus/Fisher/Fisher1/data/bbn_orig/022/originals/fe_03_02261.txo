L:  Hi, I'm Evie.
R:  Hi, I'm Toni.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  This is pretty weird [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh, yeah [LAUGH].  Is this your first one [LAUGH]?
R:  This is my first one --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- same here [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah?
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  All right.
L:  Okay.
R:  So I guess the topic is, the change in weather brings on sickness?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't believe that.  Do you?
L:  Um, I -- I think it does sometimes, you know, the change of weather, you know, especially in those transition periods where it's cold, you know, when it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- starts getting warmer and then goes back to getting cold and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that's -- at least in my case, you know, that's where I get --
R:  Yeah.  I used to think that and then, you know, I would watch as the seasons changed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that a lot of it might be allergies instead of sicknesses.
L:  Oh, well, you're right.  That's a good point.  Yeah, I guess in my case it's mostly allergies.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, they're really bad right now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] My grandpa and I used to argue about that 'cause he told me that, um, it was not the change of weather because it's, ah, an airborne virus that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- makes you sick, that gives you a cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I didn't believe that for a long time [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, but it -- it -- it -- you're right.  I mean, I know that when you're -- when -- I do know that when the ch- when the weather is changing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that has some effect on your body, right --
R:  And it does.
L:  -- 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause, you know, you might not get dressed as well or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and you might --
R:  Right, and you don't wanna go, you know, you -- you don't wanna go out and be too cold but you don't wanna go out and be too hot either.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH].
R:  And so you're either over or under protecting.
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, that might get a -- might -- that might have some effect on getting sick --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, it's not -- I mean, I guess that then the issue is how do you protect yourself, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Rather than just a change of the weather per se.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like, eat good.
L:  Say that again?
R:  Get a -- you know, have a healthy lifestyle.
L:  Uh-huh.  Exactly, yeah.  'Cause that's another thing, you know, that when you're in good shape and you're eating well and resting well then your immune system, it's better.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm, you have to --
R:  Take vitamins.
L:  Mhm, exactly.
R:  My family starts taking vitamin C. the minute they start getting the sniffles.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we load 'em up with vitamin C.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, you see, I try to have vitamins every day so I can already have that boost there.
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't wait until I'm getting sick.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do, but I forget to take 'em every day.
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I mean to take 'em every day.  I just don't [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, yeah, I try -- I -- I pretty much take them every day.  Actually, I've run out of pills so I need to [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [inaudible] really good.  I -- I don't get sick very often.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But when I get sick, I get really sick.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The same with my husband.  He gets really sick too. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I don't get sick --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that much.  It's just, you know, I -- I haven't since I moved to -- to where I live now.  I've been getting allergies and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- think it's the -- just, you know, it's so different, the -- the environment here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I never had allergies before all my life, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then to my thirties I'm starting to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- allergies [LAUGH].
R:  And I'm sorry, where do you live now?
L:  In Philly.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And you?
R:  I live in New Mexico.
L:  Oh, do you, really [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where we have warm weather most of the time [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  What do you say -- I'm from Puerto Rico so I come from very warm weather.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, and then you moved over there where it's cold.
L:  Yeah, and just with all the different kind of vegetation, and flowers and stuff, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I started to get allergies for the first time ever since I moved here.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's affecting s- when it starts getting colder, you know, everything seems to die off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, people end up getting sick --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, you know, that's hard to fall back on and say, "Well, it's allergies".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they're frozen, there shouldn't be any allergies when it's cold [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  No, but you do get 'em 'cause I mean it's not only the pollen ones --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then there's all the dust in the house and the ...
R:  Right, mold and --
L:  The mold and like, and everything in the house.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and that -- you know, I -- I believe like you, just the best way to protect yourself is vitamins and a healthy lifestyle.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  Do you --
R:  It's hard to do.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exactly.  [LAUGH] Did you remember any of the other questions?
R:  Um ...
L:  Something about the --
R:  I think it just asked us, um --
L:  About --
R:  -- you know, what -- how we felt about it and what we did to protect ourselves.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  And the -- did they say something about going to the doctor?  I don't know.
R:  Um --
L:  Or I'm making that up.
R:  You know, I, I don't --
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  -- I didn't know if I heard it or not [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  I was -- it was real soft and I was trying real hard to listen.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe we should --
R:  But --
L:  -- say that in our c --
R:  -- I do, you know.  I go to the doctor if I'm sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If it lasts, you know, longer than a few days then, yeah, I feel that I should go and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- make sure that there's nothing else wrong.
L:  Yeah.  And for me with colds, I usually, you know, just take care of them myself.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, you know, I -- I make teas or I m- you know, made 'em -- I -- I like to, when I get a cold or a sore throat, I usually make just home [LIPSMACK] remedies, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, and I try to sleep more, drink lots of water.
R:  Right.
L:  So for that kind of thing I don't go to the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doctor.
R:  Yeah, me either, but if it lasts for a long time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it feels like maybe it's a sinus infection --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, then I'll go and have it checked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm the world's worst about going to the doctor's.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But my family, if they're sick, like my kids, I take 'em right away.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's another story.
R:  No ifs, ands or buts, we just go [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Yeah, it's another story with the kids.  But, ah, yeah, I don't have to go to the doctor, ah, ah, that much.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- I don't either --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not for sicknesses.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, just for your regular checkup.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and it's really weird how colds happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How they spread so quickly.
L:  Yeah.  And, um --
R:  And it's hard, especially for kids 'cause they're in school all day with other kids who are spreading the germs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's really hard to say, you know, to tell, "Well, my kid's not running a fever so it might be allergies --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- but it might not be".
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's hard, you know, for -- as parents, to decide if we should send our kids to school or not.
L:  Exactly.  And they can't tell you, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as well, 'cause, you know, when you're older, after going through so many colds [LAUGH] in your life or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- allergies, you -- you can distinguish the symptoms with -- with the kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's a different story.  Are they very young, your kids?
R:  Um, I have an eleven year old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I have, um, a nine year old.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  So yeah, they're -- they're fairly young.  We've been through our --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- our colds and flus and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  Did you get flu shots as a prevention?
R:  I do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They don't.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, the doctor hasn't recommended it for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If she ever did, I -- you know, I would probably get them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's kinda scary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they, um, they say that you have to, um, get 'em every year if you start getting 'em once.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you should get 'em every year.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they're so young --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I don't know if they wanna go the rest of their lives getting shots.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, that's the thing that you have to ... you have to then get them every year.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my doctor's recommended them for me because I have other problems and she recommended it for me.  She basically told me I was doing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't have a choice [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And you know I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I haven't got sick since she made me take one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I haven't even had a cold or anything.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  And I'm not, you know, I'm not a healthy person --
L:  You're not --
R:  -- 'cause I --
L:  -- or you're --
R:  -- no.
L:  No.
R:  I'm not, 'cause I have some other problems.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I got fibromyalgia and --
L:  What -- what's that?
R:  Fibromyalgia?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- chronic pain, chronic fatigue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I'm really impressed that I don't get colds very often --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I have so much else going on with my body.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Ah, but --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- th- -- yeah, this year I've -- I've been very lucky. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I  [MN] --
R:  And I think the flu shot helped.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's good.  Yeah, I don't really, you know, I don't know.  I guess, you know, I work out a lot and I eat very well and I try to take care --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the best, you know, care of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my health as possible.  I quit smoking last year.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  Congratulations. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you.  It's gonna be a year in June and --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  -- and it's been a big change in my -- just in everything, like how my body feels and just the kind of things that I can do, you know --
R:  So --
L:  -- without --
R:  -- you're trying to stay healthier.
L:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.
R:  That's good.
L:  And, ah, and then before that I was coughing a lot.  That's what scared me.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  Just like how my throat was feeling.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, and since then, I -- I can never recall having gotten all this -- all year long.
R:  Since you've quit smoking?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's good.  And --
L:  Actually, I've -- for now that, you know, I got some allergies but they're not really that bad, you know, after I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- eat, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I ha- -- I took allergy medicine for maybe three days and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they were gone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, like I don't have to take them every day.
R:  Right.
L:  I think it's just, I don't know.  There are some moments where maybe there's more pollen outside [LAUGH] or something.
R:  Right.
L:  It's like a burst of pollen [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and i- it's hard to determine if it's allergies or a cold and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you take the allergy medicine; sometimes it doesn't work because it is a cold.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And sometimes you take a cold medicine and it doesn't work 'cause it's allergies.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, but in this case, I've been lucky and I don't recall having gotten sick.  I -- I had a -- a small accident in January and, you know, I had to go to the doctor for that, but in terms of colds or any kinds of infection
