R:  I say, we're supposed to just start talking about this right away [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, what did you have for supper?
L:   What did I have for supper?  Raviolis, ah [SIGH], cheese raviolis with, ah, Italian bread, apple sauce -- what else?  Um, oh, and melon, for dessert.  What about you?

L:  [SIGH] Ah --
R:  Macaroni.
L:  Very good [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so, um -- the topic is food.  What -- what are you, um --
L:  Yeah, they said something about, do you prefer to eat out or at home?
R:  Yeah, I like restaurants.  What about you?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Well, I like both.
L:  -- I much prefer to eat out [LAUGH].  It's --
R:  Well, yeah, I think it's -- it's [inaudible].  I think, ah, probably anybody does.  It's a -- you don't have to cook, you know.
L:  Sure, let somebody else do the cooking.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's also nice for the variety.
R:  It is.  It is --
L:  It --
R:  You can have -- yeah, and you can just have samplers and, you know, appetizers and etcetera.  Where do you like to eat out at?
L:  Oh, a cross section of restaurants, but I like to eat out because I work all day, and it's a nice way --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of s- -- [inaudible] are you there?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.  Are you there?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm here, are you there?  Are you there?
L:  Hello?
R:  I'm here, are you there?
L:  I can't hear [LAUGH].
R:  Hang on [NOISE].  Are you there?
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH].
R:  Hello, hello, are you there?
L:  [COUGH].
R:  Hello?  What's going on?
L:  [NOISE] Hello?  Can you hear me now?
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi.  Ah, something happened.  Are you there?
R:  I'm here.
L:  Yeah, I got -- my phone cut out.
R:  Oh, okay, I thought -- are you there?
L:  Yeah, now I'm here.
R:  Okay.  I thought it was my phone and I just got it --
L:  Oh, maybe it is.  I thought it was my --
R:  No, well, I -- I didn't -- I don't know, I just got a new phone and I don't know how to transfer the call, but, ah, we're connected, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  -- maybe it was yours.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.  So, anyways, you were saying, you work all day and then, what?
L:  I -- it's nice to socialize --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- over food, you know.  The -- I don't -- here we tend to do a lot of -- use eating out as a means of socialization.
R:  Right, yeah.  Where did you say you're from?  Connecticut?
L:  Connecticut.
R:  Oh, okay.  I've been over there once.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I was in, ah, Newark.  But --
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Um, what -- what restaurants do you go to?  Or, where do you like to go?
L:  Oh, a cross section of restaurants, such as, you know, the standard mid- middle America type restaurants --
R:  Like Appleby --
L:  -- sort of TGIF and Applebee's.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, Applebee's --
L:  What about you?
R:  Ah, Applebee's is just my favorite, actually.  I, um, I like to go -- I -- yeah, I like -- well, yeah.  'Bout the same as you.  Appleby's and, um --
L:  I was just at Ruby Tuesday's the other night.
R:  Yeah, you know, I've never been there, actually.
L:  Oh.
R:  Is that good?
L:  Yeah, I like theirs.  It comes alo- -- it's the same kinda concept as, um, Ru- --
R:  Applebee's?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you ever been to Doolittle's?  Do you even have Doolittle's?
L:  No, we don't even have a Do- Doolittle's.
R:  Oh, it's bad.  It's terrible [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It is.
L:  Hm.
R:  It is.  I don't like it at all, but, ah, yeah, i- it reminded me of that because they're right next to Applebee's.  And I thought, "How dare these people even open, whatever they call this restaurant or whatever, here because they're gonna go out of the business".  That's what I -- you know, but anyways --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um --
L:  What kinda food do you like to eat?
R:  I like ea- -- ah, well, the only -- actually I [NOISE] -- I love seafood.  But, that's kind of expensive, so [NOISE] -- American, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Fish and cheeseburgers, whatever.  Anything.  It's all good.
L:  Ah.
R:  As long as I'm not cooking it [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  I'm a vegetarian, but I do --
R:  You are?
L:  -- eat some seafood, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so I don't eat the chops or the meats or anything else, strictly.
R:  Ah, has that been like, for ever, or --
L:  Oh, I guess about fifteen, twenty years, now.
R:  How did -- how did you become a -- that's a good topic for this [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  How did you become a vegetarian?
L:  Yeah, I'm a moral vegetarian.  I -- when I found out what the -- how they treated the animals that they prepare for --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I decided I co- -- you know, I just couldn't eat --
R:  And -- and you just gave it up one day, and -- and that -- and --
L:  Yeah.  When I read this thing about how they treated the animals that they prepared, I just -- I couldn't -- after that, I couldn't eat meat or chicken --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or anything anymore.
R:  Really?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  How about -- well, how about like -- that's the -- I've n- -- guess I've never really talking to a vegetarian.  How about like, eggs and stuff like that?
L:  No.  No eggs.
R:  No eggs, no fish, no nothing?
L:  I eat fish.  I'll eat, um -- I don't eat lobster.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I'll eat -- I'll eat scallops and clams.
R:  Oh, that sounds good, right now [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Actually, ah, we went down to New York --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- yesterday, to Chinatown.  We did have scallops and clams [LAUGH], when we were there.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gosh, I haven't been on [NOISE] -- I haven't been to a restaurant -- oh, it's actually, honestly, probably been a- about [NOISE] three months [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Yeah, so you don't go out that --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- often, to eat?
R:  Well, I u- -- we used to all the -- I mean, we used to like, three, four times a week.
L:  Right.
R:  It seems like, but now I -- I, ah -- whole 'nother topic here, but I filled my house with stuff in August and just kind of went blah, for the winter, you know, got real cold and just kinda sat in the house.  Then I just recently moved again, three weeks ago, so [NOISE] I actually, asked my husband if he wanted to go to the Olive Garden tonight [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And we did not end up going.  So, I'm making velveeta and hopefully tomorrow we'll go [LAUGH].
L:  Did you say, the Olive Garden?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I like the Olive Garden.  They have --
R:  Oh, they have the best pasta.  Seafood pasta.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, they make -- yeah.  They --
R:  What do you eat there?
L:  I eat the seafood pasta.  I just love it.
R:  [LAUGH] The alfred- -- the -- the same one I do, probably [LAUGH].
L:  Probably, 'cause I think they're pretty standard across the country.
R:  Right, yeah, well, there's -- I think there's two kinds.  The one that you get just plain shrimp in 'em, and you -- the other one you get, ah, shrimp and, ah -- what are those little things that are kinda ch- -- hard and chewy?  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L:  Um, I'm trying to think.  Ah --
R:  What -- what's in the -- the entree that you get?
L:  Um, normally just the, you know, some type of shrimp or, you know, it's -- it's that, um --
R:  Seafood alfredo.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Yes.
L:  You've just got it.  Yes, that's the one.
R:  Same here, that's [LAUGH] the one I get too.
L:  Yeah.  I -- you also get that ki- -- that, um, alfredo type stuff in the, you know, the frozen food that you can just nuke.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- oh, yeah?
L:  But -- but -- yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Is that good?
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And if I can nuke it, I'm much happier.
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  I th- -- I think, um -- I -- I never really nuke things.  I don't know.  I just -- I don't know, I -- I don't even really -- I honestly don't eat that much.  I just kinda took a disliking to food for a while, and now I'm just kinda getting -- that's probably why I haven't gone out to restaurants in so long.  I just --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that would be a reason.
R:  Really.  I -- I lost some weight, and I just kinda went blah, for quite a while.  And, yeah, and now I just want to eat, eat, eat, everything I see.  And I'm a huge sweet eater.  Sweets.  Oh, I just love chocolate. [NOISE].
L:  Oh.  Oh, so you -- yeah.  No, I don't like sweets.  It's fun- --
R:  No --
L:  If -- the sw- -- the type of sweet food I like are, um, like melons or bananas or what have you.
R:  So that, ah, um --
L:  You know, it's more fruit, strawberries.
R:  Right, yeah, that is good stuff.  And I -- I [NOISE] actually really like -- have you ever had -- dipped your fruit in, um, that marshmallow cream?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, you know [NOISE] what -- do you know what the stuff I'm talking about -- it's in a glass jar, at the grocery store, and I --
L:  Yeah.  We use it in hot cocoa.  So I know what you're talking about.
R:  Oh, you've got to try and dip your veget- -- your fruit in there.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I tried that at my husband's wedding and oh, it was just awesome.  I -- I gained so much weight that year.
L:  Oh.  I bet [LAUGH].
R:  Because that stuff is --
L:  That'll do it.
R:  Yeah, it -- well, you know, you don't even have -- you don't dilute or just dip it in, like that, and oh, it's so good.
L:  Mm. 
R:  Yeah.  I wanna track this calls.  I forgot to -- I forgot what your name was.  'Cause when they do cut us off, they just -- bam, your -- it's over, we gotta stop right --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's really weird, and you don't even get to the chance to talk longer if you want.
L:  Do they, ah -- do they hook you -- did you -- they hook you up with somebody from another part of the country, the last time?
R:  No, no.  I talked to somebody from California.
L:  Yeah, that's what I mean, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just called in and just, hopefully, and there she came, and then this now, you came.  This is like --
L:  Yeah, I didn't call in, I -- you know, they called me.
R:  Oh, they did?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  See I called them.
L:  Oh, you can --
R:  I called in the first time, too.
L:  Oh, really?  You can call in?
R:  Yeah, and get your phone calls out of the way [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many -- what's it, two or three or something --
R:  Three, three, three, yep.
L:  Three.
R:  Yep, so this is my second one.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, what's your name, now?
L:  Robbie.  So when did you do calls before?  L- -- another night?  Or --
R:  Yeah, it was -- it was like, four or five days ago.
L:  Oh, that's good to know.
R:  Yeah, so you can just call if you want.  It's right in your email that you got.
L:  Yeah, I know there was a phone number there.  I didn't realize that was why.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I was -- I was worried, ah, that I wasn't gonna get it.  The phone call if it came, you know.
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] right.
R:  So -- so, okay.  So that's how that works.  I called them and then they wanted to see if there was somebody available and there you were.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  They --
L:  -- I got a phone call, and, you know, it's a machine.
R:  Right, right.  Okay.
L:  And they set the topic of food, so --
R:  Okay.  Okay and you're Robbie and I'm Lisa.
L:  Right.
R:  And you're in Connecticut?
L:  Right.
R:  Yep.  Um, yeah, so the, um, speaking of food, [LAUGH] my velveeta, it's done, but I -- I'll wait 'til this phone call's over, obviously.
L:  Yeah, we've only got about two minutes left.
R:  Do we?
L:  Yeah.  I think so.
R:  Um --
L:  I'm watching -- I t- -- I time everything, so --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, um -- so do you stock up on groceries, or not, no?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I used to for my son, but no, not really, I mean, canned food and stuff like that, um, you know, more meats, your red -- you're a vegetarian, but [inaudible]
