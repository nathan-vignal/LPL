R:  Hello [LAUGH].  I'm Ree --
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm Rita [LAUGH].
L:  Hi, I'm Diana.
R:  Hi, Diana [LAUGH].
L:  How are you doing today?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  How 'bout you [LAUGH]?
L:  Good.  You're not ill, are you?
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.
R:  How 'bout you [LAUGH]?
L:  We are pretty healthy.  I have two little boys and, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they've both been sick last week, so I completely relate to this topic [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they get it from school?
L:  Well, my little boys are, um, two and four so I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- don't know where they got it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it was just a seasonal thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  They're home with me all day, so I don't think they could have gotten it from other children, but I'm not quite sure.
R:  What -- what state are you in?
L:  We're in Kansas.  Where are you?
R:  Okay, I'm in Michigan [LAUGH].
L:  Little bit different there.
R:  Yeah. 'Cause I was gonna say, it could be the hot and cold, hot and cold, you know?
L:  Right, and we have had hot and cold.
R:  So, yeah.  You get the weather before I get it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we just -- we get --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it all [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right now, it's beautiful, but it's very muggy.
R:  Yeah, it's nice out right now, but it's going to be raining, they said, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- late tonight or tomorrow.
L:  I think we're getting it, um, tomorrow as well.
R:  Okay.
L:  So that, I -- I might have sick kids again.  Who knows?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  As long as I can stay healthy.
R:  Yeah, to take of them [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, kids get, um, what they call acute illnesses.  That means that it's just short duration.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where chronic is long duration. That's the difference between acute and --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  -- I didn't --
R:  -- chronic.
L:  -- know that.  Thank you.
R:  I -- I didn't know it either for the longest time.  I had seven children.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  They're all grown now.  Now I have twenty one grandchildren [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And they're not --
L:  That's fabulous.
R:  -- all finished [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Well, the older ones are finished, but the younger ones are just starting, so --
L:  Do they live close to you?
R:  Oh, they're all over the place [LAUGH].  In Texas, in Missouri, I have some that are close to me, but most of 'em are in other states so [SIGH] I don't get to see 'em too often [LAUGH].
L:  That's hard.
R:  But they send a lot of pictures and they always call, so --
L:  And you -- between twenty one of 'em I'm sure everyone's sick sometime.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  At any given time, you have at least one ill grandchild, probably.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right now, ah, my son that's in Missouri, him, his wife and his two children are all sick in different ways.
L:  Oh, that's not good.
R:  No. And I don't know if it is 'cause of the seasons or not, but I know my son's isn't.  His is, ah, ah, stones or something he has --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to pass.  But, um, his wife gets these ear infections.
L:  Oh, that's terrible m- terribly miserable for an adult.
R:  Yeah.  And I forget what it was his oldest daughter has but she can't be bouncing around or anything.  Oh, an enlarged liver.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  And she's so active and so rambunctious, she's, ah, five years old.
L:  Of course.  You can't really --
R:  So [LAUGH].
L:  -- tell them to lay still.
R:  Right, but she understands that she can't be doing a whole lot.  You know, they --
L:  Where are --
R:  -- explained it.
L:  -- they from in Missouri?
R:  Um, let me think.  Wright[?] City.
L:  Okay.  I've seen it on the map.  It says --
R:  It's by St Louis [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  That's --
R:  It's a --
L:  -- great.
R:  I don't know what direction from there [LAUGH].  I -- I could if I looked at a map.
L:  Around St Louis somewhere?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah [SIGH].
L:  Quite a drive for me.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  We're in Kansas --
R:  Me too.
L:  --City.
R:  [LAUGH] We went down for Christmas, so --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Um, and the younger one, she just went in, um -- as a matter of fact, when he called me, they'd just got back from the emergency room with her.  I forget what --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was with her too, to tell you the truth [LAUGH], but there's [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they seem to always be getting sick.  Um, I -- I didn't usually get sick from the, ah, seasons, but my children did, um.  Once in a while, I will, you know, but it's not like -- well, I'm older too, so when you're older, you have more chronic illnesses than acute illnesses.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I heard the strangest thing the other day, that one of the theories -- in Prevention magazine, one of the theories about the allergies and things right now, how they're so rampant, is that, um, because so many people now are living in cities and landscaping their hybrid -- raising trees, all of the male trees, because they don't want -- um, female trees drop -- it's either males or --
R:  The --
L:  -- females.
R:  -- pollen?
L:  Drop, um --
R:  [inaudible] or whatever?
L:  -- seeds, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so people don't wanna clean up their yards so they're +hydrating trees so that they don't -- aren't as messy so therefore there aren't the female and the male trees to counterbalance one another, so the p- the pollen they produce is just enormous.  And so, so many more people are having pollen difficulties.
R:  That -- that's possible.  Another thing is -- actually, we have it so much easier than our ancestors did.  Okay, so our immune systems aren't built up.
L:  That's probably true as well.
R:  You know, I mean, when our ancestors, they had to get out and do things.
L:  And we have recycled air and --
R:  Yeah, we have everything.
L:  Right.
R:  We have --
L:  It's a --
R:  -- everything like that.
L:  If you have hay fever, you can lock yourself in the, ah, house and turn on the air conditioner and stay out of the -- the outdoors.
R:  Right.  But, see, the thing is if you were out from a very young age, where you had to be out, my theory is is that you probably wouldn't have the allergies because your body would be used to it.
L:  That may be true.
R:  You know, I mean, it may -- may or may not.  I mean I'm sure some of it is hereditary.
L:  But that -- that really makes sense, because you think about all of our, you know, travelling in a covered wagon with all the dust around you, you would have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to become immune in order to survive.
R:  Right, exactly.  And not only that, you know, the work everybody was doing back then, you know, their bodies --
L:  Made them stronger.
R:  -- were stronger.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, there was a lot of disease, but that was because they didn't have the medicines and stuff that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for those particular ones, but if we had the medicines for those and we worked like we did then, I don't think there'd be that much illness.
L:  That's probably true.
R:  You know?
L:  D- how do you feel about going to the doctor?  Do you run to the doctor or do you --
R:  No.
L:  -- wait?
R:  I wait.  I do.  I really do.  I -- it's like it's not that I have a thing against doctors.  It's just that I don't wanna bother them if it's something I can deal with myself.
L:  I agree.  And it seems like your choices are get an antibiotic or stay home [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  And --
L:  -- what can they do if it's a virus?
R:  Right.
L:  You just go in there and pay your money for them to tell you, "Get some rest" [LAUGH].
R:  And they also found that the antibiotics, you can become immune to those too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so then if you really need 'em, they're not gonna do any good.
L:  Right.  And my -- my two year old is already immune to two forms of antibiotics.  He's had -- I guess you would call him a chronically ill child.  He has been, um -- he's -- he's twenty two months and he's been on twenty three antibiotics.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Round the antibiotics.  So they've already found three that don't work for him anymore, so --
R:  Oh, goodness [LAUGH].
L:  -- we're getting ready to get his adenoids removed and -- and his, ah, sinuses blown out and -- and tubes put in his ears, and then we're gonna try to stay off of all medication --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- after that.
R:  -- so he -- he can build up.  Now, the tubes in his ears, um, I have a theory about that too, but anyhow [LAUGH] --
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  I'm open to anything.  I don't know what to do with this child [LAUGH].
R:  Well, see, I -- I don't know because I don't know your child and I'm not a doctor, okay.  But the thing that got me is back when my, ah, oldest son -- I have seven, okay?
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's, ah, four girls, three boys.  Um --
L:  Oh, wow [LAUGH].  You were tired.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I didn't think about it then, but I'll tell ya -- no, actually, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- had a lotta help from the kids.  The older ones -- when they were little, of course I did everything.  But when they were older and the younger ones were there, they helped me tremendously.
L:  That's fabulous.
R:  So I can't really say I did it all because they definitely helped me.  Um, but when he was about fifteen or sixteen, okay, there was the new rage of putting tubes in the ears --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- okay?  Well, he had an ear infection, and it was the second one in his whole life, okay?  I would not say that's whole lot.
L:  I don't either.
R:  Well, this doctor wanted to put tubes in his ears.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And I told him, "No way".  It was the new thing to be doing.  Everybody had tubes in their ears.  And I says, "You're not touching my son" [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  After two infections?
R:  Yeah.  He said, "Well, he's had it too much," and he just -- I don't think he even thought about that I would know what I'm talking about, you know, because here's a woman with seven kids, she doesn't know nothing, you know?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  All of the respect we housewives get.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But a lot of times, they just, um, they do it and it's not necessary, okay?  It sounds like your son might be different though, 'cause he's sick a lot.
L:  I'm -- I'm hoping it -- I don't know.  We have another ENT appointment.  I've -- I'm getting my second opinion.  So we go again next week to a different ENT to find out what he says, but I figure [LIPSMACK], his pediatrician, um, has suggested this surgery and then we went to an allergist and now we've been to an ENT and we're going to another ENT.
R:  Yeah, it sounds pretty much like he might need it.
L:  So [SIGH] --
R:  Does he get a lot of ear infections?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, that would be --
L:  A lot of ear infections, a lot of sinus infections and --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  -- respiratory infections.
