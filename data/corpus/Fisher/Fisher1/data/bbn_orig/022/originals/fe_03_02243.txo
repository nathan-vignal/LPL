L:  Angelique Coleman.
R:  Hi.  [COUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Roy.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.  So --
L:  So --
R:  Heh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is an odd topic for me.
L:  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, I'm here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was picking up the phone.  I -- I was saying that this is a -- a very odd topic.
L:  Yes.  It is.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  This is the --
R:  Do you get sick when the seasons change?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Really?
L:  Sinuses, you know, hay fever, you know.  Bloody nose --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  It's dealing with all the pollen, [COUGH] the weather change ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sore throat.  Do you?
R:  No, not just because of the seasons changing, uh, [MN] I don't.  I -- I do have, um, hay fever and sinus problems as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, it's not necessarily when the seasons are changing.  It's usually in spring.
L:  Oh.
R:  Sometimes in the fall, but normally in the spring.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I -- I don't -- I don't have that problem.  Now, people do say that -- a lot of people say that, um, during this -- the winter, um, well, during the winter, people, you know, when it starts to get co- get cold, people get colds more and all of that, but I was reading an article that says that the reason people kind of get more colds during the winter is because everybody is in closer proximity to everybody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're closed up inside for a longer period of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As opposed to during the warmer months.  So I don't know if that's true or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I, um, I don't have a problem with getting sick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when the seasons change.  And, well, what do you do to keep yourself well?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, sinus pills, going to the doctor ... that's all I can do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that sounds pretty good to me.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I generally, um, well, I exercise, try to eat right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I wash my hands a lot, I mean --
L:  Yeah, of course.  I do that too, you know.
R:  I'm not -- I'm not addicted to that, but I'm more conscious of that now.  I -- I remember hearing a st- -- about a study that was done a couple of years ago about hand washing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they confirmed that by washing your hands, you reduce your chances of catching colds and other, uh, communicable diseases.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Significantly.  So I started, you know, like for instance if I go out to eat --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  The first thing I do is wash my hands --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before I eat or at lunch, you know, before I have lunch when I'm at work, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wash my hands.  So, I'm -- and I'm more conscious of that.  I haven't always done that.  Like when I would go out to eat, it -- to me, seems like a lot of people just go ahead and just start eating.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I always wash my hands.
L:  I know.
R:  And sometimes I use that, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I use, oh --
R:  Hand sanitizer.
L:  Oh, I use a anti-bacterial soap.  I even wash dishes with, uh, it's anti-bacterial.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Soap for our dishes --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So I do that too, and wash 'em in hot water, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That kills pretty much all the germs.
R:  Yeah.  Well that works too.  I mean that -- that works for me as well.  That's what I do, 'cause -- but in terms of, um, of taking a lot of stuff -- now I have taken vitamin C. on occasion --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, because it's supposed to help keep your b- immune system strong and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --fight off colds and all that.  I have done that, but I don't do it on a regu- regular basis.
L:  Me either.
R:  Heh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I drink orange juice, though.
L:  I d- you know, I drink juice --
R:  A lot.
L: -- with vitamin C. or calcium in it.
R:  But the --
L:  Every --
R:  I don't do it just -- I drink orange juice becau- -- well, for one thing, 'cause I know I need the vitamin C. but primarily I drink it because I like it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Not so much because it's healthy, although it is healthy too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's kind of ... my, my r- line of reasoning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, now what was the other question that they asked?
L:  Um, I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I don't remember.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well --
L:  Oh, well.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  This is --
R:  Maybe it'll come to us in a minute.
L:  Yeah.  This is totally weird.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think so too.  And a- as a matter of fact, I really kind of think that they could have come up with a better topic to discuss than this.
L:  I know.
R:  I think this is s- -- there's not the so much to say about it.
L:  I know.
R:  As far as I'm concerned.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So where you --
R:  And we've both kind of stated our opinions.
L:  Yeah.  So, uh, where you live?
R:  I live in Atlanta.
L:  Oh.  I live in Florida.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What part of Florida are you at?
L:  Palm Coast, Florida.
R:  Which one?
L:  Palm Coast, Florida.
R:  Palm Coast.  What is that close to?
L:  Um, you know where Jacksonville is?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know where Flagger[?] County is?
R:  No, but I know where Jacksonville is.
L:  Um, it's -- it's forty five min- uh, forty five minutes, uh, south.  It's like, in between Daytona Beach.
R:  Oh, okay.  [COUGH].
L:  It's [MN] -- it's pretty f- it's, [MN] it's not even on the, um, it's on the map now, Palm Coast there, but it used to -- it never used to be, 'til they claimed this as a city.
R:  So it's a -- is it a town?
L:  It used to be a town, now it's a city.
R:  How many people live there?
L:  Oh, boy, a lot.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Fifty thousand?
L:  I think a little bit more than that now.
R:  Mm.
L:  It changes, eh, to month to month, you know.  People move here, like, uh, for retirement and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's sort of like, uh, it's a retirement state but it's turned to a city.  Got library, got shopping center and everything else.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  [MN]
L:  It used -- it, uh, the s- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, City Hall just, uh, turned into a city now.  About, uh, about last year.
R:  Mm.  So are -- are you an internet buff?
L:  Yeah, I'm an internetaholic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that how you found out about this?
L:  Yes.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Surfing the web.  [LAUGH]
R:  So what sites do you -- do you do -- you go to a lot of the deal sites, like Fat Wallet and --
L:  Yeah.  It's -- I do shopping, my emails, you know, to find ways to try to make money, you know.
R:  Yeah.  So what -- what ways of -- have you found to make money on the -- on the -- that have really worked well?
L:  [SIGH].  You can get paid to read email programs have really worked well.  I've been using that for a very long time.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And they really -- I have been paid a few times.  And --
R:  How much money have you made?
L:  Uh, depends.  If you want a -- like a free account, you get about pocket change amount.  But if you're to pay the service, you get about -- depending on how much you want to make for the maximum.  It's the maximum you can make and they will [SIGH] send you a check or, um, do the Pay Pal Eagle[?] account.
R:  So how much have you made doing that, would you say?
L:  [LAUGH]  I have a free account.  I'd say about twenty five to thirty dollars --
R:  Okay.
L:  That's it.  That's it.  That's, you know, pocket change, like.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what other things have you done?
L:  Uh, surveys ... get paid to read surveys.  That's -- that's once in a while, they give you money, about four bucks each survey.
R:  You're talking about Go Zing and Zoomerang and all those?
L: Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I've done those.  I don't really -- I'm not really impressed with those.
L:  I know.  You don't really make any money.
R:  'cause you've spent twenty and thirty minutes doing a survey and get four dollars.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  For me, that's not worth it.
L:  I know.
R:  And then you have to go and cash the check and, you know, y- you have a check for four dollars and [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ... so have you -- now, some of 'em, like the, ah, Survey Savvy and there are some others that are pretty good too.
L:  Yeah.  Get paid to, uh, I used to the -- I'd get paid to surf, but that messed up the computer.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  It slowed the computer speed down, then it started affecting the modem, then and everything else.  Had to restore the computer.
R:  Mm.
L:  'cause it -- it went to, uh, maximum overdrive on the hardware.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Had to take it down to Best Buy to have it fixed --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And they charged thirty five dollars f- just for that.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I don't do those any more.
R:  Well, I knew somebody who was doing quite a few -- quite a few of those surveys.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She was making, [MN] like, fifty dollars, sixty five, seventy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Now, to me, that's pretty good money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can deal with that.  [NOISE]  But I can't deal with four dollars.
L:  I know!  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not going to do a survey for four dollars, heh.
L:  [LAUGH]  I done it.  It's -- it's okay.  You know, I get it through Pay Pal and they, you know, pay me.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It's just four bucks, within three weeks, three to four weeks.
R:  But when you d- -- now, does that go into your checking account or do -- how do you get your money through Pay Pal?
L:  Um, you had to sign up for a Pay Pal account and then you can use a credit card to get the money out or they will send you a check and they will take a fee.  It's a dollar fifty fee --
R:  Oh, my [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  Or they can do a free of charge trans
