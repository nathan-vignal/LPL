R:  Hi, my name's Jerry.
L:  I'm Christine.
R:  Hi, Christine, how you doing today?
L:  Just fine.
R:  Topic of the day is illness, huh?
L:  Correct.  Colds.
R:  Ah, colds and specifically, I guess.  Um, I have a tendency to take, uh, I don't know if you've ever heard of Cold Ease?
L:  Um --
R:  Kind of like zinc tablets.
L:  Yes, I've heard of those.
R:  And, uh, I find that, uh, they certainly take the duration of the cold out of it and the severity of it, and it's kinda hard to judge, I guess, if you don't have the full cold, but I -- once I start taking those, I really never get a -- a really bad cold, where I have to call in sick to work or anything like that.  About you?
L:  I start taking vitamin C every two hours.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And then I also put Menthylatim[?] in my nose.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  For the sinus.
R:  How many milligrams of vitamin C do you try to average on a day where you're feeling sick?
L:  Um, that -- goes, what, it's five hundred milligrams and I take, like, two every two hours.  So it's --
R:  Well, I guess, uh, the --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- body can't store it, certainly doesn't manufacture it, but if it gets, uh, an ample supply, I guess it certainly help you.
L:  I've just noticed that it helps me whenever -- I take it every two hours.
R:  Mm.  That's interesting.  I gotta give that a shot, I think.  
L:  And I'm not into, like, really knowing the milligr- or, you know, how much my body can take or whatever.  I just don't get ill from it.
R:  I'm -- I'm not a -- as far as I know, I don't think you can take too much of it.  I mean, especially in pill form.  I -- I have to question how much is actually absorbed into the body once, uh, once it's taken.  Uh, I know, uh, that it can't be all of it, but um, I guess the body uses what it needs, but uh, vitamin C is definitely -- my mother always told me that as well.  I do notice, though, when the seasons change, I do uh -- once in a while, that's -- that's when I have the tendency to get more sick.
L:  To me, I sometimes feel that a cold is also allergies. 
R:  It could be.
L:  If --
R:  Um, I don't suffer from allergies, I'm fortunate.   Do you?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, okay.  So --
L:  And I live in an area where there are a lot of allergies.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A lot of pollen.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  You're talking to me in New York.
L:  Ah.
R:  Long Island specifically.
L:  I been there.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] and we get -- we get the full, uh, the full swing of it, that's for sure, but um, my wife's the same way.  She gets, um -- well, she has allergies as well, but they're not, uh, not anywhere as near severe.
L:  Right. Well, sometimes allergies and colds, they mimic each other --
R:  And --
L:  -- in the symptoms.
R:  Yeah, and it seems difficult to, uh, to differentiate where it came from.
L:  Right.  The sneezing and the fever and the lethargic feeling and everything.
R:  Mm, right.  I'm fortunate where -- like I say, when I take the zincs, I -- I really don't feel it that bad.  And my job is pretty -- pretty on the move all the time, so I really have to have my energy and everything, and I find those certainly help me.  But uh, vitamin C, I think I'll give that, uh -- I take a daily vitamin, but I guess it can't hurt to be taking those in addition to it.
L:  [NOISE] hello?
R:  Yes, I'm still here.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um [COUGH] I've never had a problem with it and I am real susceptible to medication.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If I take any over the counter cold medication, it puts me right to sleep.
R:  Yeah, I have the same reaction to it.  I really don't care to do that.
L:  And even on the -- now I'm drowsy, I go right to sleep with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It makes me real lethargic.
R:  I can't be that way because I mean, we have -- you know, we have a child in the house and it's, like, you know, you gotta have your wits about you and stuff and can't go to sleep until basically he's asleep, so [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] correct.  [LAUGH].  
R:  But, uh --
L:  That is correct.
R:  Uh, I also have -- would suffer from, um, uh, from headaches in the early spring and the early fall, the cold, that are cluster headaches, and that comes from the change of the seasons as well.  They don't know what causes them.  They last for, like, two weeks.  They're severe migraines where you -- they usually occur in the evening, and when you come home, um, you just -- you gotta go to bed.  There's nothing you can do.  You can't -- they're very light sensitive and noise sensitive --
L:  Do you have the symptoms of cold when you have that?
R:  No.  No, not at all.
L:  No?  
R:  Interestingly enough.  And then two weeks and then they're gone.
L:  That's more allergy, I think, than cold.
R:  I've been to a neurologist for it and um --
L:  Mm.
R:  I actually been to two and that's what they both diagnosed, so -- I did some research on the internet for it as well, and uh, they don't know what causes it.  They have no idea.  But, uh, it just goes away, and it does.  Some years I don't get them and some years I get them one season and -- and sometimes I get them both seasons.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  It's really weird.  And usually in March and usually October and uh --
L:  To me, that's the change of seasons --
R:  It is, it is.
L:  -- where there's a lot of pollen.
R:  Um, it -- but you know, oddly enough, I'm not -- I'm not allergic to anything during the rest of the year.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Go out and cut the --
L:  Mm.  [NOISE].
R:  Cut the grass and everything, and --
L:  Sorry.  [NOISE].
R:  And it's no problem.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I don't take, uh --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- you know, Allegra or anything like that --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- Claritin's or, you name it, I -- I don't feel the need for it.
L:  So have you ever taken anything besides, um, the zinc for your colds, or --
R:  Um, no, not really.  I mean, I'll just -- you know, I'll drink -- I'll have a tendency to drink more, uh, orange juice.
L:  [NOISE].  Which is vitamin C.
R:  Oh, vitamin C.  Also, um, cranberry juice I'll drink, too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, cranberry juice is, uh, good for cleaning the blood.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  And, um, I feel that uh I guess it takes uh maybe some of the toxins that may accelerate the cold out and kinda weans down the acceleration of the cold as well. 
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Um, but that's about it.  Do you do anything that preventive? 
L:  For a cold --
R:  Besides the vitamin C?  Yeah?
L:  Um --
R:  Anything you can think of, anyway.
L:  What I ha- do is Menthylatim, in the nasal, every night.
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  And I started that in September because at the time it's going from -- well, where I live it's very high humidity, very hot and you're in refrigerated air all the time, so you do --
R:  So it's very dry?
L:  -- not know if you have your allergies or if you have a cold.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, because you're going between different weather cond- you know, different weather types.
R:  Yeah, you're going in from one extreme to another, basically?
L:  Right.  Right.  And so, um, I just -- it just dawned on me that I've always used, you know, Menthylatim to cure everything, whenever I'm ill, or you know, bad sinus.
R:  Right.
L:  And so -- or nasal congestion, whether it's cold or allergies, and so I just kept it up --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ever since September.
R:  That's a good idea.  I gotta --
L:  And the one week that I didn't do it, then I started sneezing and feeling ill.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then our weather's been kinda sunny, very hot and humid and then it goes very extreme cold.
R:  What is it like right now?
L:  Um, it's about eighty five degrees, but then --
R:  Oh, it is very warm, then?
L:  -- you have refrigerated air and everything.
R:  Right.  Uh --
L:  But then there is a lot of pollen and there are a lot of colds and a lot of sinus going around.
R:  And another thing is, uh, my job I get uh -- I get exposed to a lot of different illnesses as well.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, I think uh, that's part of the reason that I keep up on, uh, like my daily vitamins and stuff like that, but uh, on top of that, I think actually my body's built somewhat of an immunity.  It's been a little bit of um, say a plus, if you would look at it that way, um, that [COUGH] uh, when I first started out, I would, you know, get sick more often more a -- as I used -- but I notice that I don't.  Um -- I'm -- I'm a little less susceptible every year to -- to catching something or uh getting, uh, getting sick.
L:  You've built your immunity up to it.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  You've built your immunity up to it?  [LAUGH].
R:  I believe I have, yeah.  I really do.  
L:  By being around it all the time.
R:  Yeah.  And uh, we get -- we get a whole bunch of different illnesses so [LAUGH] but I mean, the common cold and everything like that, you know, it's uh whatever flu strain is, uh, popular.  Um, and uh I think it's er certainly helped me build up my immunity.
L:  I'm also a habitual hand cleaner and --
R:  I am, too.
L:  -- and arm cleaner.
R:  I am, too.  My hands are --
L:  Anti bacterial soap and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I've read too where that's not as good for you, because then you're doing away with germs that you can be getting -- you know, that you're getting accustomed to.
R:  True.  Uh, I think the worst part of it is I always have chapped hands as a result of using the alcohol based and -- and uh various products, the puerile[?] to -- to just clean my hands from time to time.  So, I come in contact with, uh, people and it's like, all right, let me just -- I act- every time I come home, obviously, I'm washing up and everything I try to do so before leaving work, and uh, just to keep it out of my own home.  So, if my immunities are being built up, that's great, but that doesn't necessarily mean everybody that's here has got the same results.
L:  Right, for your family?
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Well, then too, you have your germs on your clothing.
R:  Right.  Well, I --
L:  That just -- you know?
R:  -- make it -- for- fortunately, I wear a uniform so generally when I'm done with my shift, I just, uh, change back into my regular clothes --
L:  Change --
R:  -- and I come back home, so most of that is --
L:  Sounds like you're in the medical field?
R:  I'm not, actually.
L:  Ah.
R:  [LAUGH].  I'm in the law enforcement field.
L:  Ah.  Yes, so then you are -- you are --
R:  And -- and it's not such a sterile environment on a regular basis, so --
L:  No, it's not.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No, it is not.
R:  No.  Um, and most of the time, I work in a closed environment and I do -- I don't think, uh, Nasser County's ventilation system is very good, so -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, they have -- and germs have a tendency to --
