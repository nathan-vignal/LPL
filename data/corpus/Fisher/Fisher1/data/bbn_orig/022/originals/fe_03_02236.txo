L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Denise.
L:  I'm Sara.  Sorry.  I'm fiddling with my headset here, trying to get it to --
R:  That -- that's okay.  It's nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah.  Um, so I -- I heard most of what you were -- what it said.  Something about whether we'd like to eat in a restaurant or at home?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Okay.  Well, you know, I pref-  I'm not -- I don't like to cook.  I have to cook because I've got two small kids and a husband but, um, I -- I'd usually rather eat out than cook but I know when I go on vacation, I get really really sick of eating out and I just kind of want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a home cooked meal.  [LAUGH].  So, what's your opinion?
R:  My opinion is, I'm a little bit older than you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I love to cook but I agree with you totally.  Um, if I go on vacation or something and I have like a -- a ki- kitchen in the suite.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And someone comes in and cleans up after me, then --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I -- I am like the master chef [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  So --
R:  But, um, also at home, I love to cook at home but when I cook at home, don't be around me because I clean as I cook.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And most people don't do that.
L:  Yeah, I try to.  My husband's really bad about it.  He's a -- when he was, um, younger, ah, he was a breakfast cook at Denny's and so he's just -- he makes omelets, he makes -- you know, he'll do breakfast, that's his meal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, at weekends and he just trashes the place.  [LAUGH].
R:  My old man too.  See, that's my main complaint because you know, breakfast is the egg meal.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And eggs are the hardest to clean up after.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?  And my old man says, "Well, that's clean."  And I'm like, "Put on your glasses, it's not clean."  You know?  I have this old egg crust all over the kitchen.  That is not clean.
L:  That's pancake batter.  You would think, you know, pancake, you could batter, you could clean up, right then when it's still wet but he'll -- I'll wander in and it's dry and you -- it won't wash off and you have to try and chip it off.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's the deal.  You have to honest to goodness, you have to actually chip it off and they don't get that part of it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they don't get the part that the eggs and the -- the oatmeal and like my sinks.  I -- I -- we have stainless steels sinks and I wish to go-  -- to goodness we hadn't never done that.
L:  Oh, really?  You don't like yours?
R:  No, because they show every little piece of oatmeal.  This man -- this man loves oatmeal every morning.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And -- but then when he, you know, he quote, unquote, cleans his bowl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's all in my stainless steel sink.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I don't know, it sounds like you've seen those oatmeal traces that get like glued onto my stainless steel sink.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, you know, it's kind of like all you have to do is put on your glasses.  We've got this little sprayer thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Why don't you use it and spray that little oatmeal off?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But -- but the problem is, we are so old.  He doesn't see his little remnants.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, when, you know, when I go into the kitchen and I see his little remnants, then that makes me a little angry.
L:  Right, right.  So, what's your, um, what's your idea of a perfect meal?  What kind of -- what do you like to cook or what do you like to have out at a restaurant, when -- when you go out to somewhere nice?
R:  Um, perfect meal, whether cooked or in a restaurant is the steak done just the way I like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Plus seafood, whether it be shrimp or -- or um, lobster.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, I love --
R:  Wonderful baked potato, a wonderful serving person who is just, you know, somebody that you can become friends with?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And an excellent, very rich, have to take half of it home, dessert.
L:  Oh, dessert.  I hadn't even thought of that.  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  What kind of --
R:  I always save room for dessert because I'm from a cheesecake family.
L:  Oh, I was going to say cheesecake is my favorite.  [LAUGH].  I love cheesecake especially if it's got any kind of chocolate -- chocolate --
R:  Oh, me too.  And berries.  But you know what I found?  One of the odd things I've found, being from a cheesecake family, is I have found that --  Um, can we mention restaurant names?
L:  Oh, I imagine so.  They're doing -- this is for a, um, voice recognition software type, ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Voice recognition system.  It's not like a marketing thing, I think.  A college is --
R:  Oh, good.  Okay.
L:  I haven't seen anything where they care.  I think they're just trying to get different dialects from different parts of the country.
R:  Uh.  Oh, well.  They're going to be fooled by me because I 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was born and raised in the Midwest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- spent most of my adult life in Southern California and now live in Denver for the last five years.
L:  [LAUGH].  So.  Well, that's good because --
R:  So, good luck to them, huh?
L:  That's probably really what's going on with most people.  They're, you know, they're born in some place around here and then they, ah, move somewhere else and they're -- their dialect changes.  They've got to have great things that, um, that can recognize people's voices and what's actual -- what they're saying.  You know, the different accents, I'm trying to say.  [LAUGH].  But, um, I think my, ah, my dinner is actually very similar to yours.  It's funny, when I was -- when I was in High School, I -- I was a vegetarian 'cause my sister was a vegetarian and she --
R:  Were you really?
L:  -- cooked.  She cooked so we just -- we ate lots and lots of stir fries.
R:  Oh, I do a lot of stir fries.
L:  So, um, we were -- and now, um, you know, I ate a lot more vegetables and then I got married and my husband is a bit meat eater and so I -- I'd compromise and we -- we'd eat lots of chicken and turkey and things like and when we went out, he'd get steak and, um, just like in the last couple of years, I don't know if was from having babies or what?  And needing extra protein.  But, I really, I started eating beef and so he makes us -- he's like experimenting to how to marinate steak and he's been coming up with some really -- using whiskey and all sorts of stuff.  And, it's been really, really good.  And I've been doing a little bit of a more low carb diet so I've been trying to eat more protein.
R:  See the carbs --
L:  My blood sugar level -- keep my blood sugar level right and, um, so eating more meat is healthy, so.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  So, steak.  I've been becoming very fond of steak.  I used to just go out and get -- if we went out to dinner, it would be pasta and fish and, you know, fish and chips or chicken or shrimp or things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, it's like, okay, I'll try steak.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, as I like -- ah -- ah -- several restaurants, major restaurant chains are now doing the, um, steak salad.  You know?  Or the chicken salad.
L:  Oh, yeah.  You know, I had one at McDonald's the other day.  Their new chicken salads are really good.
R:  They are very good.
L:  I know.
R:  The only thing -- the only thing that upsets me about this -- they don't have blue cheese dressing --
L:  Oh, no, no, no.
R:  -- and I'm --
L:  With the Newman's dressing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, sorry [inaudible].
R:  I'm a blue cheese person.
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh, I --
R:  So, I --
L:  I love blue cheese too but ranch is my favorite.  I looked in -- I think I might -- if I get McDonalds, I might have to use no dressing or bring my own 'cause it's [inaudible]--
R:  No, they have Newman's Own Ranch.
L:  Yeah.  Now, I looked at the -- I've only had one of the salads and -- but I looked at the -- at the, um, package.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It had like five hundred calories or something, just in that one package of Ranch.  [LAUGH].  [inaudible].
R:  Well, that's the Newman's own though, because he does -- he doesn't do anything light, you know?  Everything that is Newman's is full flavor.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So he doesn't do --
L:  I love his sauces -- marinara sauce and stuff, though.
R:  Right.  So, he doesn't have the light kind of stuff.  It's all full flavor which is great.  But, you know what I've done here, is, I have taken his dressing and all that and actually watered it down by like a third.
L:  With what?
R:  Um, just water.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Just straight -- just straight water and if you shake it up, just make sure you shake it up enough.  Like, the dressing?  Um, it does cut calories.  I -- I can't tell you how much it does.
L:  Right, but --
R:  But it does.  I mean, adding a third water is going to cut the -- the fat content.  And, if you're like me, you watch fat contents and
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that -- that's important.  So.
L:  Yeah, I've been trying to eat a lot more salad lately and adding spinach and stuff and I been, um -- the -- and my husband's really picky too, about, um, salad dressing and that sort of thing and we found -- I think it's Kraft.  It's light done right.  That -- it's been, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the closest.  It's not nonfat but --
