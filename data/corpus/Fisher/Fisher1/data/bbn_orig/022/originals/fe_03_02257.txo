R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Marie.
L:  Hi, I'm Carol.
R:  Hi, Carol.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  That's good.
R:  I [LAUGH] I'm a little confused.  A cold lasts as long as [SIGH] seven --
L:  A cold --
R:  -- days --
L:  -- last seven days.
R:  -- or a week.  They're both [LAUGH] seven days.
L:  Exactly.  That's --
R:  I guess we're [NOISE] --
L:  -- what they're saying.  They're saying --
R:  -- we're stupid.
L:  -- you don't have to go to the doctor.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, in my case, I do because sometimes a cold will last three to four [NOISE] weeks for me.
L:  Yeah, I usually wind up with bronchitis if I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have a cold so [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [NOISE] So it's not that -- it doesn't -- I guess it doesn't matter where you live.  You get sick anytime of year.
L:  I get -- I don't get normal colds [LAUGH] like --
R:  No, me either.
L:  -- real people [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I can't buy over the counter medicine.  It just doesn't work. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  New Jersey.
R:  New Jersey.  I'm from Allentown, Pennsylvania. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I've been there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know.  I just -- I -- I just seem to be -- when I catch something, [NOISE] I catch something good.
R:  Me too.  And I don't know if everybody's like that but [NOISE] I know I am and it just -- sometimes I think to myself, "Is it worse having a sore throat and a runny nose or is it worse to be vomiting and have diarrhea?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No matter what [LAUGH], you know, it's --
L:  I'll take the sore throat, thank you.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's [LAUGH] -- it's hard to fall asleep when you're sick and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't wanna eat right or you just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- feel horrible and, I don't know.  If you have kids and I have kids and they're sick all the time.
L:  Well, mine are grown, but they're sick all the time too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, I -- I passed my allergies on to them and now I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't have em as bad as they do, but --
L:  Yeah, that's funny 'cause mine too.  My oldest daughter, she goes for allergy shots twice a week.  She's been going for a year and they're still not helping her.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's horrible [MN].
R:  And my son has gone [NOISE], gee, probably since [NOISE] he's four or five and he's twelve now, so it is getting better, but not better to the point where he can't have anything.  He still needs medicine 'cause he's sick a lot.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, my daughter's constantly getting, um --
R:  In fact, he was home --
L:  -- sinus infections.
R:  -- yeah.  He was home from school today and I just feel horrible and, well, the pollen count's pretty high.  That might --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be a reason why [SIGH].  Watery eyes, you know, and everything.  Plus, it's -- it's harder -- I don't know about you, but it's hard for us to always run to the doctor every time we're sick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because even though we have a co pay, medicine is really, really expensive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my husband lost his job in January so we've been --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- without insurance until --
L:  That's a shame.
R:  -- he starts the new job tomorrow, but I'm sure benefits don't kick in for thirty to ninety days.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And I went to the doctor 'cause I have poison ivy head to toe, and I --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- was gonna let it go and -- but it was so bad.  Eighty --
L:  You finally had to --
R:  -- two dollars just to --
L:  Did you n- --
R:  -- see the doctor.
L:  Did you take Benadryl to try --
R:  I took everything --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I still have the itching.  I have it for a week and a half.  It's -- it was so bad it turned to cellulitis.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Which, if you left that untreated for seven days, you get gangrene and then they have to cut out all the bad [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- patches of gangrene, so I -- I was glad I went.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I wasn't glad about the eighty two dollar bill, you know, for --
L:  Couldn't you get any kind of coverage through the state while you were --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- on unemployment?
R:  We make too much money.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That makes no sense if you have no job though.
R:  I know, but he -- they go by what you previously made, so [SIGH] ...  They will, they're in the process of insuring my kids, but I'm sure 'til that goes through, my husband's benefits will have kicked in, so --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- sort of a catch twenty two there.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know --
R:  But --
L:  -- my older -- my younger daughter just graduated from grad school and she couldn't get a job so we were paying Cobra[?] for her --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because I didn't want her without insurance that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And she wound up -- she's in Calagard[?] and she wound up hurting herself, so she needed an MRI of her knee and that.  The Cobra, you know, would have --
R:  Thank goodness --
L:  What we paid --
R:  -- you have --
L:  -- would've, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  We would have really been in big trouble if we hadn't paid.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, scary to think about people that say they don't have insurance and --
L:  Oh, I know and a lot of people don't.
R:  You just never know, you know.  It can happen today and tomorrow and --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- being sick is no picnic or fun.  [MN]
L:  No, but, like I said, I never just get a cold.  I don't think I've ever had just a cold.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Old [LAUGH].
R:  How old?
L:  Fifty four.
R:  Um, I'm forty five and I have been that way since I'm little.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  You know?  I just -- it can't come and go in two or three days.  It's -- it wipes me out.  It's --
L:  Other people get colds, I get pneumonia [LAUGH].
R:  Y- yeah, you know?
L:  Other people get --
R:  And I think too --
L:  -- colds.  I get bronchitis.
R:  I think for the past ten years, that's it.  If I don't get a cold treated with a antibiotic, it turns to bronchitis too.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, where I'm really need something strong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  That's how I am.  And both my children are like that.
R:  So ...
L:  I don't know.
R:  I guess --
L:  It's strange.
R:  -- it doesn't matter where you live, then, that --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, nice weather, bad weather, because we've been sick in the summer, we've been sick in the winter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and most people say, "Summer?  That's a strange time to get sick", but ...
L:  No, we've had bad c- -- well the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know they say when you have allergies that you're, um, resistance is lower.
R:  I believe it.
L:  And I think that's really true.
R:  I -- I believe that.  My husband is rarely ever sick, maybe --
L:  No, mine -- mine either.
R:  Maybe once in the last twenty years.
L:  Yeah, that's how my husband is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if he gets sick, he gets really sick.  He doesn't get colds, either [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  But --
R:  My husband's --
L:  -- I don't know.  Like I said, I don't know anybody that gets just a plain cold.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  It's -- my mother too.  She's like, eighty four and when she gets a cold too, she needs an antibiotic because she'll try to fight it off for about three weeks and I'm like, "Okay, do you want to go to the doctor now?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Yeah".
L:  I guess so --
R:  You know.
L:  -- after three weeks.
R:  And then she thinks, "Next time, gee, I'd better go right away because I don't wanna make it wait so long", and then usually, if she does go to the doctor, they say, "Ah, right now it's viral.  There's nothing we can do --
L:  Oh --
R:  "-- for ya".
L:  -- I know.  That's -- I just went two weeks ago I went --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they told me that and now my mucus --
R:  And then it --
L:  -- is starting to turn --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- color, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, so then once it's colored --
L:  -- I know --
R:  -- then --
L:  -- I have to go back.
R:  -- "Okay, here.  Here's the antibiotic" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it eventually turns to that.
L:  If [MN] there's a virus that's going around and it's three weeks, it'll take three weeks to get rid of it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I, I knew that it wasn't gonna go [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- away by itself.
R:  Yeah, it's [NOISE] -- my husband weed whacking so I'm moving to a different phone.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I told him, "Don't, don't do that until ten minutes are up", but [NOISE] ...
L:  Oh, it's raining here, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it's a --
L:  It just started.
R:  -- beautiful sunny, sunny day now. It rained all morning.
L:  Oh, see, now we had the sunny day 'til about an hour ago --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it started raining.
R:  And, and my mother says, "Don't go out in the rain.  You'll get sick".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I say, "Mom" --
L:  That's an old wives' tale.
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't have anything to do with it.  Germs cause illness, not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wetness or cold or [NOISE] ...
L:  'Cause I used to yell at my girls, they used to go to high school with their hair wet.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I used to say, "Don't go out".  They said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --"That's not gonna make us sick".
R:  Yeah.  or the doctor will say -- people say, "Don't go out in the winter without a coat -- winter coat on" and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no, that has nothing to do with it.  [NOISE] If you don't wanna wear a coat, then don't wear one.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But you won't get sick. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  But, like, well, I don't know.  To me, like the -- what they just told us to discuss is ridiculous because if I don't go to the doctor, my cold's gonna last a lot longer than seven days [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  You know, I don't know very -- well, I guess I do know some people that it's only three or four days and sometimes they don't need medicine.  But I don't know.  Have you tried over the counter things, 'cause they don't work for me?
L:  Well, my daughter was big on Vitamin C. and echinacea.
R:  And ...?
L:  And she said it was working for --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- a while, but --
R:  For a while.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I, I think vitamins help too but to an extent.  Um, I -- I- I don't know.  You can eat as healthy as you want.  My sister's a dance teacher.  She's fifty seven or fifty eight years old.  She's thin, she works out every day, eats healthy, and she has colon cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I mean, [NOISE] I'm overweight and I don't eat healthy and I don't have anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I've been tested and it's negative, so I guess it really doesn't matter how you eat or how well you rest or, [NOISE] or what --
L:  I don't --
R:  you do.
L:  -- 'cause I have two --
R:  If you're gonna get sick, you're gonna get it regardless.
L:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's true, but I, I don't know.   I, I think that allergies really, ah, do play havoc with your resistance.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I seem to think that --
L:  And everybody I know --
R:  -- now that you --
L:  -- has allergies.
R:  -- mentioned it, yeah.
L:  I -- I don't know anybody who doesn't have allergies --
R:  I --
L:  -- at this point, so ...
R:  -- I don't either, so don't think.
L:  I think that the, um, it's just a, of, um, because of our environment.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I know it wasn't as bad years ago when I was a kid and it -- [NOISE] and it is now.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  People --
L:  'Cause my li- -- my nephew's two years old and he just started allergy shots.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  Because it's --
R:  I --
L:  -- he get so many --
R:  Sad. [NOISE]
L:  -- sinus infections.
R:  Seeing such a little one sick like that. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm, mhm. But there's nothing they can do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to -- they say that's the reason he gets all the sinus infections.
R:  From all the [NOISE] --
L:  From having --
R:  -- allergies.
L:  -- the allergies and the allergies brings your resistance down and then you can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fight it off.
R:  Yeah, things people weren't allergic to years ago, if they are now allergic to them.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I really believe that if they could do something to t- take care of allergies, that maybe people wouldn't be as sick.
R:  They'd have pretty much, yeah, cover.  And now this new SARS scare --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- everybody seems to be getting [NOISE] or hearing about it, getting, ah, [NOISE] information in the paper or the mail and [NOISE] they die of this and don't travel here, don't travel there and it's probably only a matter of time until it's gonna [NOISE] be around local.
L:  Well, they say it's ba- well, it is.  It is in New York.
R:  It is already.
L:  And, um, Connecticut and New York, they said.
R:  Wow. [NOISE]
L:  But what they're saying is that, um, that it's just another thing like pneumonia.  More people die of pneumonia than have died of that.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I don't know.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as many more germs become resistant to antibiotics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're gonna see more and more different things.
R:  That's true and I always hear a commercial on the radio every day about AIDS. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Do you know how much medicine costs for AIDS?  Blah, blah, blah  If you can't afford your medicine, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah".  And I'm thinking, "How 'bout the people that are needing medicine every day for other things besides AIDS?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't think [NOISE] it's expensive for them to afford it? [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it is expensive.  [NOISE] It's expensive for everybody.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'm lucky.  I haven't
