R:  Hi, this is Crystal.
L:  Hi, Crystal.  This is Ralph.  How are you?
R:  Oh, good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  Um, so I guess we're supposed to be speaking on the topic of illness --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and what was the last thing she said --
L:  I --
R:  -- about the seven days?
L:  I was -- I -- I was hoping you'd caught the whole thing.  It sounded to me like she was talking about, ah, if you're ill for more than seven days you go to the hospital.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right.  Okay, that makes sense.  Um, I guess you could go ahead and start if, if you get -- if you get sick during the season change and then I'll --
L:  Okay, ah --
R:  -- go after that.
L:  -- I don't really notice it too much.  Ah, I live in Florida so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we don't -- we don't get the drastic changes that some people do.
R:  Oh, yeah, wow.  Yeah --
L:  Where are you --
R:  -- Florida --
L:  -- from?
R:  -- is warm.  Washington State.  So --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- we actually do get the seasonal, um, stuff that's going around.  It's kinda damp, uh, where -- I'm in w- western Washington so it's kinda damp and, um, we get the flu season that goes around and couple years ago, our family -- and we had a little one year old at the time.  We got the, the flu that was going around.  There was respiratory, high fever, it was really bad [LAUGH].  It was just kinda knocked us all -- I think we spent, I don't know, two to four hundred dollars going to the doctor and that's after insurance and everything.  So it can get really bad over here.  We just -- we had to go get antibiotics and it was just -- you know, it seems like the flu season is like February.  March is the worst when, when we get it.
L:  Yeah, we, ah -- well, you know, we obviously get sick down here in Florida.  It may not be so much, you know, climate related but, you know, we have flu bugs that come through and with a much older population than probably the state of Washington, yeah, we seem to notice more sick people in Florida.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, um --
L:  I -- I think a lot more than -- of them tend to, ah, go to the hospital --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- maybe sooner than, than you or I would.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't really go to the hospital too much.  We usually tend to go to the doctor first and then, if it's really bad, then, well, it's not really the hospital too much.
L:  I guess it depends on what kind of insurance some -- you know, when the older folks have Medicare and such that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe they have a little better coverage than we do [LAUGH].
R:  Right, that's true.  It's, ah, it's a factor and if whether you have insurance coverage.  We have insurance but it didn't seem to, um, I don't know.  They weren't covering it, ah, ah, some of it so that's why we end up paying so much.  But it just seems like once, you know, February hits, it's like it's flu season.  Everybody knows it [LAUGH].  But year -- this year, it wasn't the respiratory flu.  It's more like the, the stomach flu that was going round so --
L:  Oh, even worse [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that, that can be really bad, so we kinda dodge -- we try to dodge people, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who are sick.  If we know someone's sick, we go, "Oh, no, we're not coming" [LAUGH].  So --
L:  I think people notice allergies down here.  I don't think that qualifies as a sickness.  I've never heard of anyone go to the emergency room for an allergy attack but --
R:  Oh.  What kinda allergy attacks?  Just like, um, just --
L:  Well, we have, ah, you know, the mold spores down here because of the dampness.  You may experience that up where you are too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, some people are just allergic to mold.  Others are, ah -- obviously, the pollen.  We -- certain times of the year, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  We don't have a really identifiable, you know, four seasons.  They just kinda flow back and forth.
R:  Yeah, really warm down there then?
L:  Well, most of the time.  Ah [COUGH], you know, we get nervous if it ever hits forty.
R:  Oh [LAUGH], yeah, I can imagine.  I -- I can see what you --
L:  Today is eighty two.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  I don't -- I don't know.  We don't usually get really warm weather in -- usually in June or July, it's -- well, July is when we get the warm weather.  So basically the sickness is like gone by July.  We just -- we have that -- those few months before, like the, you know, February, March, April, lots of cold, it, it starts.  They a- a- say we can get flu shots like in -- I -- they usually try to give us all flu shots in October.  So I don't know if they give a lot of flu shots down there since you don't have a lot of sickness then?
L:  Well, they have the -- the flu shots.  They give them primarily for the elderly because they're the most vulnerable to, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the slightest thing that, you know, something that, you know, we may laugh off in a day, it may, you know, be a death, you know, life threatening for someone who's in their eighties.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Do they g- give it to infants and babies too or is it just basically the elderly?
L:  I think it's, it's the elderly.  It's available for other people but, ah, you know, they -- you know, some -- sometimes they just put on a push and if you're over sixty five they give it to you for free.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  What, does the state do that or --
L:  It's probably somehow cook -- you know, hooked up with Medicare and the state.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Mm.  Well, yeah, we just -- we don't really -- but, ah, they don't really give it to people who are like middle aged.  I guess I'd be classified as, you know, middle aged, but it's mostly for infants and, and the elderly.  Um --
L:  And I try to avoid shots whenever possible.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Shots for little kids aren't exactly fun, either [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, do you have a bunch of 'em [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah, we have three little kids --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- that's enough [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  So, but they're, they're pretty healthy.  They don't get too sick too often.  It's basically just colds and stuff.  Do you -- do you yourself get sick a lot or --
L:  No, I don't.  Ah, I'm in my mid fifties so I, you know, I'm kind of in the middle down here in Florida.  I'm not quite, you know, ready for the, the hospital but, you know [LAUGH], not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exactly young, either.  But no, I don't find, ah, you know, people that I know in my age group seem to be pretty healthy.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, ah, then you're kind of past the point where -- 'cause I know that colds, if you get a certain -- there's like six hundred different kinds of cold, I think?  And if once you get one cold, you can't get it for the rest of your life 'cause of the antibodies.  So I just -- I know that once you're, you know, older than twenty five or so, you've basically had all the colds when you were kids.
L:  Yeah, let's hope I got rid of [LAUGH], you know, of all that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Number five ninety nine isn't waiting for me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So it's kinda nice to, to be over that, but with little kids, it's like you pick up everything that's around, so [SIGH], so anyway, we just --
L:  I guess, yeah, schools and, ah, airplanes were big.  I think every time I go on a plane, I wind up coming off with some kind of a cold because you're, you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- essentially when you're on a plane, you're breathing everybody else's air too.
R:  Yes, and isn't the ventilation, is it not that --
L:  It, it --
R:  -- good?
L:  -- it's not that good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, like I can't imagine.  I wonder to take a survey of a bunch of people who just got the -- get -- gets off a plane and discover how many people [LAUGH], ah, got the person that was sick, whatever they had, got this illness.
L:  Yeah, well, that's a big concern with -- what is it?  SARS?
R:  Oh, yes.  Yep.  That, that would be a -- a -- that's a big thing.  Um, I don't know.  Even avoiding the airport, it's not very practical, but I've heard that, um, they're doing a lot of precautions for that, especially, you know, over where it started.
L:  Well, you know, it's, ah, in -- I guess I have quite a bit in -- well, by comparison to us, quite a bit in Canada and Toronto.
R:  Yeah.  Hmm.
L:  And we have a large population of people from Canada come down here for the winter.  I'm on the west coast of Florida. That seems to attract 'em.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  So it's a, you know, it -- it's a topic of conversation more down here, perhaps, than it is in, you know, Kentucky [LAUGH].
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Where there aren't any cases.  We got about fourteen or fifteen cases.
R:  Oh, in, in the, in the United States --
L:  Er --
R:  -- or in the state?
L:  -- in, in Florida.
R:  Oh, you do?  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is a lot, because I know in Washington, I don't think they [SIGH] -- I think they had seven at one point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think they're stabilized and it's not spread also, so it's not spreading any more.  I don't know.  I know that I have heard in Toronto, though, it's get -- it's pretty bad.  But that -- that's too bad, but I've -- I also heard, I think it was this morning on the news, that it was starting to [SIGH], um, not spread.  I think they're starting to get over it and it's contained or something, so that would be good.
L:  Yeah, I -- I guess I, you know, I -- I'd rather be in Toronto than Peking [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.  Yeah, if you had an option of the two places, oh.  But generally, I guess it's not that much percentage.  Only it's because we've -- you know.
L:  Well, I think we're so conscious of, ah, of anything to do with diseases that we're not quite sure where they came from.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  And it -- if it's hard to prevent, then it's kinda tricky.  I know some ill -- illnesses, you have incubation period, um, is -- you basically -- you can give someone something even before you get sick.  Like I know the chicken pox.  We went through that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you can give the person the chicken pox before you actually get it, so it's -- you know, whether SARS is something like that, it's, it's -- some things are just really hard to contain.
L:  Yeah, that's true, if there's no visible sign.
R:  Right.
L:  And all they can do now is say, you know [COUGH], "Where have you been?"  Because I know down here they're [COUGH], you know, the cruise ships are screening passengers and they're a little reluctant to let anybody on the ships that have travelled in, ah, the Far East or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in -- or in Toronto very recently.
R:  Right.  So what do they do to screen it?  Just, ah, wear masks and stuff and give everyone a thermometer [LAUGH]?
L:  No, I -- I think, you know, they -- they're -- I think they're relying on people telling the truth that they haven't been there before they let 'em on the ship.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it's -- you know, if there were danger of -- you know, I mean talk about a -- a captive audience for disease, you know, a cruise ship with a thousand people on it [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH], yes.  That --
L:  No place to escape [LAUGH].
R:  It could spread very easily on a cruise ship then, yeah.
