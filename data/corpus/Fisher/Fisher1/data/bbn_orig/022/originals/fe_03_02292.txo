R:  Hi, I'm Mea.
L:  Hi.  My name is Lois.
R:  Uh, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  So, do you get ill often?  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't get ill too often, but --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- um, I do think -- I mean, I heard that -- I remember my mother always saying, you know, "Put on a sweater or you'll get a cold" or something like that, and I remember once reading that it -- that even if you get chilled, that doesn't mean you're going to get sick.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Um, but sometimes, I don't know, it seems like -- there's more people sick when it -- the weather changes, for some reason.
R:  Yeah, always during the winter, it seems like you're -- what part --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the country are you in?  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm on the west coast.  I'm in California.
R:  Oh.  East coast, from Virginia.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, yeah, lots of illness goes on around here.  Lots of allergies, too.
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, here too actually, because like in the spring, a lot of the trees are blooming and --
R:  Yes, huge pollen --
L:  -- all the pollen comes down and --
R:  Oh, it's so much right now.  The cars are all green and [LAUGH]. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my son has bad allergies.
L:  Oh.  Does he bring home -- is he of school age?
R:  Yeah, he's seven.
L:  Uh-huh.  Actually, I have a seven year old daughter.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I think -- she brings home a cold every few weeks.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, my son was in day care so he used to bring [LAUGH] brought everything home the first year.  Yes, so he's been sick a lot, but he's a lot better now, now that he's on Claritin and whatnot.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know, she is too.  And um --
R:  Yeah, and it's helpful, uh --
L:  -- it seems like it really helps.
R:  Yeah, he lost his hearing in kindergarten 'cause of it.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I know.  We didn't know he had it and we couldn't figure out what was wrong.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So, he was ill.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, so --
L:  So is there anything you do to help prevent colds?
R:  Um, vitamin C and zinc.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What do you do?
L:  Well, you know, we try to take, like, a multiple vitamin, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've also that -- have you tried that Vicam?
R:  No, I haven't tried that, I haven't heard of it.
L:  It's like a nasal spray and it has zinc in it and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- some people think it works and some don't, but I really think it works, if you catch the cold right at the beginning.
R:  Yeah.  If you catch it right away.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what my grandma says with the zinc.  You have to take it first day.  [LAUGH].
L:  Do you think it makes a difference if you take it right at the beginning?
R:  I'm not sure if it really does, but um, vitamin C I think works pretty well.  Yeah.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  If you take it on a regular basis.  You know?  But other than that, um, I don't know --
L:  I think drinking lots of water and getting enough rest makes a difference, too.
R:  Yeah, it really does.  If you don't get enough sleep, you get sick a lot easier, I think.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I find when I work a lot of hours and you know, don't get enough rest, then I end up getting sick. 
R:  Yeah.  What do you do?  [LAUGH].
L:  Huh?  Oh, um, I work parttime out of my --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- house, um, like typing reports.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  And um, it's good be -- you know, it's like, for with the kids, for that --
R:  Yeah, I do mystery shopping.  It just -- flexible --
L:  Yeah.  You know, I've done that, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Lot of -- lot of good shops.
R:  Yes.
L:  But you know, sometimes I feel like the more you're out in public places, the more you're exposed to the germs, too.
R:  Exactly.  Handling money and --
L:  You know --
R:  I know, it's true.  That's very true.
L:  Where especially, you know, you hear everybody coughing around you or whatever.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I know.  My son comes home with something every other day.  Oh, he's always sick from school.  It seems like they're just little germ passers at that age.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  I think they are.  And so many people send their kids sick to school.
R:  I know.  It's crazy, because they can't do the child care or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, yeah, I've seen tons because I go and read and I see sick kids there almost every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's insane.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's too bad.   But --
L:  It is.  You know.  
R:  -- what can they do, I guess?  There's not a lot of options --
L:  Yeah, I try -- you know --
R:  -- for sick kids.
L:  -- sometimes I'll send her to school with a little bit of a runny nose, but if she has a fever, I'll keep her home.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  I mean, it -- last year, I had to send him a lot when he was sick just because, like, he just had the allergy, so it wasn't, like, contagious --
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  -- but he had missed so much [LAUGH] that he had to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you really have no option sometimes when you're sick.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But it's nice to be home and have flexible --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- hours.  [LAUGH].  So you just --
L:  Yeah, it really is.  I really -- I don't take it for granted.  I used to work full time when my other two were older and there were times, you know, I'd call into work and say I was sick instead of my kids are sick, you know?
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Because they frown --
R:  Because they --
L:  -- upon that, you know?
R:  Oh, they really do.  It's unfair how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're -- treats people about their children being sick, you know?  I don't see how they can get away with that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  But you know, sometimes you just can't help your kids not getting sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  
L:  So, did you take flu shots or anything?
R:  Um, he does, but I don't.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- but it's a good idea.  If you have a young child, to do it.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you guys get them?
L:  No, we didn't.  I think my mom discouraged me.  She said she had gotten one and then gotten sick.
R:  Sick from it?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  So I kinda felt --
R:  I know that --
L:  -- like -- and I don't know, they were kinda pushing it, you know?  Like at the doctor's office and I didn't know -- you know?
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's weird how you can get sick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from a vaccination.  Same thing with that smallpox vaccination.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] people get sick from it.  It's crazy.  
L:  What wa the rest of our topic supposed to be?  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I don't remember.  [LAUGH].  I know -- this is my first one of these.
L:  This is a hard one to talk about.  [LAUGH].
R:  I haven't done them before.  I'm just like, okay, mm.  Um, I forget what it was.  It was something -- nope.
L:  I think about how the seasons affect being sick, too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, they do.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  
R:  And the summer is usually the safest time of the year, isn't it?
L:  Mhm.  I think even just being outside in the fresh air and --
R:  Really affects you.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And your health.
L:  You know?  It affects your health and it affects your mood and your endorphins and --
R:  Yeah, some people use those, um, sun lamps in the winter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just so they are healthier.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I know if -- I feel like if I sit at the computer too long --
R:  Oh, I know.  Mm.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, I start to feel blah.
R:  I know.  You really need to get out at least for a little while.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Each day.
L:  And just get some sun --
R:  Even in the winter.
L:  -- and light and fresh air and you know?
R:  Yeah, it's a pretty -- it -- winter's pretty hard.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's not too bad here usually, but a lot of sickness always goes around here, for some reason. 
L:  Mhm.  Have a lot of kids had the flu this year?
R:  Yeah.  A lot of kids have had chicken pox this year, too.  Like crazy.
L:  Really?
R:  My son never got it, so he had a vaccination for that.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So hopefully he won't get it, but lots of them have it this year.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, my daughter did, too.  We got her the chicken pox vaccine, you know, when she was like three or four or something, she was little.
R:  Yeah.  He had to get it before he went to kindergarten.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he keeps coming home telling me how many kids -- and I'm like, "Oh, no, I hope that thing works".  
L:  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  Because they do say some of them --
R:  Because I guess it's harder --
L:  -- can get it.
R:  -- when the get older.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But that would be rough if he got it now.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, hopefully [LAUGH] cross your fingers.  But -- so your daughter never got chicken pox either?
L:  No, she didn't.  Uh-huh.  But I know a --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- couple of people there, their kids still got it, they got mild cases --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even though they got the vaccine.
R:  Oh, geeze.
L:  You know?  So --
R:  My son had his tonsils out and they grew back.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  You know, that happened to me.
R:  It did?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  As an adult.  I mean --
R:  I've never heard of it.
L:  -- no, I -- when I was little, I don't know how old I was, I had my tonsils taken out and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- then one time the doctor said like, "Wow, you got like half tonsils" and I was like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, I had a really bad sore throat and he said, "It's your tonsils" and I went, "No, no, no, you know, I had them taken out".
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  I can't believe that.
L:  And --
R:  I was shocked, because he had sleep apnea and it came right back [LAUGH] and I was, like, what's going on?
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And they're like, "Oh, his tonsils grew back".  I'm like, "It's been seven months".  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  But, no.
L:  Now, what -- what is that?  Was sleep apnea?  Is it brought on by different times of the year or anything or --
R:  Um, no.  It's, um, pretty much due to the allergies, I think.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Um, he just doesn't breather for, like, twenty five seconds at a time.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, God.
R:  Which is --
L:  That's scary.  As a parent?
R:  Yeah, it's terrible because he tries to, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's just hard to watch, you know?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we brought him in and they said that would solve everything, but [LAUGH] he got --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- both his tonsils and his adenoids out, but didn't work out.
L:  Mm.
R:  It still happens, but not as bad.
L:  So is he on a monitor or anything?
R:  No, he's not on a monitor.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  He just, uh, you're just supposed to watch him and if it goes over twenty five, he has to go back in and get them out again, but it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's pretty much under twenty now.  So it's monitored -- or like managed both, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But it's a weird little sickness.  My mom --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has it.  I wonder if it's hereditary?  [LAUGH].
L:  I wonder.  
R:  It could be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you never know.  My mom's got all kinds of stuff.  [LAUGH].  So hopefully --
L:  I had heard of it, but I didn't really know what it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, if there's certain things that cause it or --
R:  I'm pretty sure it's allergies because he gets just --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- so stuffed up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's there's really nothing you can do.  I mean, he takes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every medicine for it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's gotten better this year actually.
L:  Well, I know my daughter has, you know, a sniffy nose all the time, so we took her in for the allergy testing and everything and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- it actually found out that probably the only really allergy she has is she's allergic to milk.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  And --
R:  That's -- well, they were thinking that with him, but he got --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- over it somehow.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So it's -- and it's hard with the kids to have -- I mean, she just doesn't like the soy milk stuff, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- but then everybody at -- when, you know, would look at her and say, "Oh, what's the dark circles?  Are you sick?" or something, you know?  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And so she --
R:  Oh, I hate that kind of thing.
L:  Or is she anemic or you know, something like that?
R:  Yeah.  My son was, um, allergic to milk when he was a baby, too, and he was on soy  formula and stuff.  But that only lasted until he was two, and then it came back for -- I don't know, when he was, like, five, but then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it went away again.  [LAUGH].  So now he can drink milk, thank goodness.  It's hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, it is, and especially when you go out somewhere, you know?
R:  Because everything has milk in it, you know?
L:  Everything does.  Exactly.
R:  There's a child in my son's class that's allergic to peanuts and strawberries.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Which makes little parties hard.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  'Cause everything has peanuts either -- or like has been made by peanuts.  But he has a very severe allergic reaction, so --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I know.  I don't know how you would deal with that.  All the time.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Strawberries are my daughter's favorite, so --
R:  I know, that --
