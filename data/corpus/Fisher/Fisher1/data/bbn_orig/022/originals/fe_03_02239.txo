R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  To whom am I speaking?
R:  Um.  My name's Lisa Klaren[?].
L:  Oh, where are you from?
R:  Apple Valley, California.
L:  Oh, I'm in California, too.
R:  What's your name?
L:  I'm Laura.
R:  And where are you from?
L:  I'm in Signal Hill.
R:  Oh, okay.  You're by the beach, uh?
L:  Kind of, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I have friends who were from Signal Hill.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, so it's talking -- we're talking about food?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do we like to eat at home or?
L:  I like both.  It's like, I don't know which I prefer more.  Um, I guess, I don't know.  That's kind of funny.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I mean, you would think, as a mom, it's nice having to go out 'cause then you don't have to cook, you don't have to clean and all that other kind of stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  What's your favorite kind of food?  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, potatoes or ice cream, I guess.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind -- what, like what nationality do you like when you go out to eat?
L:  Oh, Italian, American.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, gosh.  I can't --
R:  I like to -- I like, um -- I like to eat out.  I'd rather eat out every day.  [LAUGH].  But I can't afford it.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Um, I love Chinese food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love to eat Chinese food.  Um, I like fried food but I try not to eat it because I try -- I try to watch my health.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But every now and then I like to cheat and eat it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just ate there a couple of days ago.  I had Chinese food.  I had, um, Crab Rangoon.  Oh, it's so good.  It's like a cream cheese crab.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And a -- and a wonton.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that was good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um.
L:  Wow.
R:  But I can't afford to eat out all the time.
L:  I know.  That's the problem.
R:  Yeah.  So you're a mom.  How many children?
L:  I have three teenagers.
R:  Oh.
L:  And none of us all like the same thing.  It's like maybe four things that all of us like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so it's a pain.  So going out is nice.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I have teenagers too, so I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, when you go out, they can eat what -- what, um, they like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but when you're home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my kids, whenever I cook, they complain about ah, what I make.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they're really picky.
L:  Right.  Yeah, someone always seems to go hungry or something.
R:  Yeah, and then that's so annoying.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I made spaghetti tonight and they, um, my oldest son wouldn't eat it, so I just --
L:  How many kids?
R:  -- whatever, I made dinner.
L:  How many kids do you have?
R:  Three, too.
L:  You have three, too?
R:  Yeah, I have a seventeen and a fifteen year old.  Both boys and then I have an eleven year old girl.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So you have a lot of restaurants in Signal Hill, huh?
L:  Yeah, well, we -- I certainly do around in our area, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But how did you hear about this study?
R:  Um, on the Internet with the um, home shopping thing or mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, oh okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I do that too.
R:  Do you do the mystery shopping?
L:  Yeah.  So I mean, that's the only way I can afford to eat out. [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  I haven't done it.  I haven't done the mystery shopping 'cause where I live -- I live in the high desert and um, it's kind of a rural area.
L:  I -- I do things like just around this area, though.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's a lot of restaurants in [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I like to try different restaurants.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah and that's nice too because, yeah, I agree.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So.
R:  They're opening -- well, they're opening more in Apple Valley but they have a lot in Victero[?] which is about ten miles away, so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So on a special occasion we like to go out to eat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we don't go out all the time.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  I -- we go, I mean, not -- well, I don't know, we're like half and half.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Eating here and eating out and it's eating out from assignments or um, someone's taking us out or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  You probably get a lot of assignments there, huh?
L:  Me?  Um .
R:  Down there?
L:  Well, I don't know if I'd say a lot.  A- at least one nice restaurant a week and then --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- then, you know, I have fast food ones that I'm kind of picky on -- the fast foods ones.  Like you said, I'm concerned about my health.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't to do, um, certain ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless, I mean, they have to pay quite a bit -- a bit, because I'm going to waste the food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, but, um, you the know the ones that charbroil the chicken, I think is pretty good but --
R:  Oh yeah.  I like charbroiled chicken too.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the fast food places like um --
R:  McDonalds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  And not only that but they tell you what you have to order and stuff.
R:  Yeah, their food, I'd hardly put that in the food category.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I -- I like a Carl's[?] for fast food, I guess.  I like their spicy chickens but --
L:  Oh, I guess so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My son likes --
R:  I don't like to eat them all the time, of course but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I hate McDonalds.  I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eat there if I get a free coupon.  [LAUGH].  Otherwise I don't like it there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I notice they're awfully busy there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So.  Good marketing I guess.  I don't know.
L:  I guess.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Huh, so -- so how many Fisher Price calls have you had? or?
L:  This is my fourth.
R:  [LAUGH].  Fisher Price, is that what they're called?
L:  I -- I know what you meant, though.  [LAUGH].  It is the study, yeah.
R:  It's what my son said.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When he says "Come to the phone" he goes "Fisher Price is on the phone."  It think it's -- Fisher study.  [LAUGH].
L:  Fisher Price.  Are you in Leila's forum?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Are -- are -- did you find out about it from the forum?
R:  No, um.
L:  Leila's forum?  [inaudible].
R:  What's the forum called?
L:  Leila's Lounge.
R:  Leila's Lounge.
L:  Yeah.  Her group forum?
R:  No.  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't even -- I don't even have the paperwork from this.  I don't even know --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- how to contact them or anything.
L:  Everyone's saying, "When do we get paid?  Has anyone been paid?"
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was wondering about that because I lost the information on it, so.
L:  Oh yes, I did.
R:  Oh.
L:  But [inaudible] some of them say that though.
R:  Yeah.  They had -- they've had -- well, like, the last three nights I haven't even been able to talk because they haven't found somebody to talk to.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  That's, um -- seems like they would have been harder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Let's see.  For eating at home.  When I eat at home, I like to, um, make the crock pot.  I like to get things cooking all day, like I usually I just throw budget chicken in the crock pot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And have it, um, I usually have dinner right when my boys get home from school at two 'cause they're usually starving to death.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, I try to have dinner early.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, but, um, I would eat out all the time if I could.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well, like you said, 'cause it's expensive, that's for sure.
R:  I can't afford it.  So, so you -- what kind of work do you do?
L:  Oh, I'm self employed so that -- I mean, doing the mystery shopping's one thing and merchandising but I have other clients too.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  And I'm single, um, so --
R:  Oh, you're a single mom.
L:  Yeah, so um, I get invited out to eat by someone.  It seems like at least once a week.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  So you -- you're in sales?
L:  In sales?
R:  Oh, you said, what do you do for a living?  I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, I'm just self employed.
R:  Oh.
L:  I just do different things --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you know, besides -- besides mystery shopping, I have a couple of other -- other things that I do.
R:  You just do whatever you can find, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm recovering from an auto accident and I'm only supposed to work four hours a day and it doesn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that doesn't work.
R:  Oh, so you're probably on disability?
L:  No, I don't do anything.  I was unemployed when I had my accident.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh gee.
L:  With no health insurance.  [LAUGH].
R:  My -- my husband's on disability.
L:  Oh.
R:  I do daycare.
L:  Oh, oh.  That would be so hard.
R:  No.  It -- it's rewarding at times.  [LAUGH].  It's hard sometimes though.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I enjoy it, so.
L:  Yeah.  So yeah, going out to eat.  It used to be -- I mean, it used to be very, very rare and now some of the assignments --
R:  Mhm.  That's a good thing.
L:  -- they are not just -- not just for two, but for all three kids and me.  I had one the other night that paid for all three kids and me.
R:  Oh, that's cool, yeah.
L:  So.  Yeah and part -- part --
R:  Yeah, I -- I signed up for it but they didn't have anything in this area, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  So I wonder?  Yeah.  So you're in Signal Hill then, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  I wonder if I did a long distance charge?
L:  Who, for what?
R:  I wonder if they charge us for long distance on these calls?
L:  Oh, did you initiate the call?
R:  No.
L:  No, they call us, so.
R:  Oh, okay, that's true.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  That's true.  I have a cellphone, so.
L:  And I've talked to people all over.  Alaska was the first one.  Washington and then someone that was back east and I'm thinking, what are they doing up this way?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I was signed in the morning but I -- I was gone all the time so I changed it to nights, so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So you're a single mom, huh?  That's hard.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Everybody I babysit is single.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  It's very difficult.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very, um, it's hard enough for two people.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  To make a living.
L:  My kids are pretty neat kids though.  My -- yeah.  But yeah --
R:  They help you?
L:  --that's not --  What?
R:  They help you?
L:  Well, I wouldn't say they help me --
R:  But they are just good kids.
L:  -- but they -- they just don't get into trouble or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they don't stay out late.  They -- they do their -- they all do well in school and --
R:  Oh good.
L:  -- and they bring their friends home so I know who they're hanging out with.  I mean.
R:  Yeah, that's really important.  You need --
L:  They're pretty open about things.
R:  -- to know what your kids are doing nowadays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nowadays kids are bad.  I mean, the world is bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You got to keep an eagle eye out on your children.  That's for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my kids eat a lot of food.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, tell me about it.
R:  Teenagers.
L:  Oh my gosh.  And they're the skinniest things you've ever seen.
R:  Yeah.  Their metabolism's high.
L:  Oh god.
R:  You'd think they would eat anything but they don't.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't understand how come they all freak out on the same thing though.
R:  I know.  I know --
