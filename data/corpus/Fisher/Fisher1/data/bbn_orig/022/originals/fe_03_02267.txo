L:  Hi, I'm Pat.
R:  Pat?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hello, I'm Bill.  I'm in southern California.  Where are you?
L:  Hi, Bill.  I'm in southern California as well.
R:  Oh, what do you know?  I'm in Hammett[?].
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in, ah, I'm in Hollywood.
R:  In Hollywood.  'Bout --
L:  Yeah.
R:  About ninety miles away.
L:  Right on.  I'm -- I'm pretty new to California so [LAUGH] I actually do appreciate the, ah --
R:  Anyway, ah, the p- the topic is illness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And or, you know, what kind of, ah, how we feel about, ah, getting a cold, whether it lasts seven --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- days or a week [LAUGH], etc.
L:  Do you tend to get ill when it, ah, when the seasons change?
R:  I don't have any problems with season changes.
L:  Really?
R:  None at all.  I'm sixty seven and I'm a --
L:  Really?
R:  -- pretty healthy guy.  Har --
L:  Fabulous.
R:  Hardly ever get sick and I had -- ah, one time this winter, I started coming down with a flu 'bout midafternoon, achy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- body aches and stuff and -- and another time I started to come down with a cold and I can fight off a cold in about, ah, or the flu in about, ah, twenty -- twelve to twenty four hours.
L:  Oh, right on.  That's gotta be nice.
R:  Um, I have my own, ah, regimen which --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- includes, ah, I -- I don't -- I -- would I bore you [LAUGH]?
L:  No, no, go ahead.
R:  Ah, I use oregano oil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I use grape --
L:  That's one I've never heard before.
R:  Oh, oregano oil is one of the most potent anti viral, anti fungus, anti bacterial, anti parasitic, ah, ah, substances -- natural substances known to man.
L:  My God.
R:  Yeah, you buy it in a one ounce bottle.  In fact, I've even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've even put my own, um, formula for how to take it.  I've put it in a document so when I talk with people that are interested I can send it to 'em.  And --
L:  [LAUGH] That's cool.
R:  -- and I, um, yeah -- and that with other things, ah, goes -- 'cause -- well, I say that because taking oregano oil is so potent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to be careful how you take it.
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Such as?
R:  Um, well, I -- you -- I put about five to seven drops in about six to eight ounces of a heavier type juice like V8.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you sip it slowly and if you need to take something else in between.  You don't want to take it too fast, induce any coughing or choking 'cause it's powerful.  And then you can -- you can -- you know, eat food in between, ah, it sips or whatever or some -- or some other drink.
L:  Sure.
R:  Ah, just to get it down.  And then you do that about every -- 'bout every four hours and you won't have to do that more than about twelve hours and you'll knock out a cold or --
L:  Really?
R:  -- or flu, oh, yeah.   But I take other things too and I think that's the most --
L:  That's awesome.
R:  -- that's the most potent thing.  Um, also I take grapefruit seed extract.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can buy that in one or two ounce bottles, um, and, ah, wait a minute.  In fact, it's -- it's either four or eight.  Just a second.  I'm looking at the bottle here.  This is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- four ounce but it's two or four ounce bottles.  And that's a liquid and that, you take about once and it comes out in small drops. You put, ah, about one drop for each ten pounds of body weight in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to -- in fact, I put it in the same V8 juice.  And mix --
L:  At both the same time is okay or --
R:  Yeah, you can take it at the same time, yeah.  So those are two -- those are two liquid things and other things I take are such things as astralagus[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is an immune support thing.  And of course, thousands of units of vitamin C.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then I take olive leaf extract, which is very potent as well, and then I take --
L:  You can just get that at any health food store, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, health food store would have all this stuff.  The oregano oil might be hard to find.  It's a product, ah, from a company called Now, N.O.W.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's available on the internet, ah, too if, ah, someone wants to get a can but -- but mo- most -- if you tell 'em it's a Now product, that's pretty c- oh, you know, if they have a whole --
L:  Pretty common --
R:  -- line --
L:  -- brand?
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's a not uncommon, put it that way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then of course there's golden seal and echinacea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and those will be coming, you know, pretty more -- pretty well known.  And, ah, why -- what do they say in vitamin C?  That's -- that's a pretty good, ah, listing of 'em.  Well, I'm doing all the talking here.  Tell me what you do when you get --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sick or [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] A friend of mine actually, um, said she's been taking pignogenol[?].  She hasn't gotten sick at all and -- and her attention span has gotten a lot, ah, sharper.
R:  Ah, that's another --
L:  She --
R:  -- great one and also grape seed extract.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, now, ah, grape seed extract [SIGH] -- pignogenol comes from a, um -- if I remember, it comes from pine bark?
L:  Really?
R:  And, ah, grape seed extract, of course, from, obviously, from gra- extract of grape seeds and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's differences of opinion as to which one is really better.  Um, but in case of doubt, take both of 'em or something [LAUGH].
L:  You never know.  You never know what's gonna help.
R:  Yeah.  And you know, one of the things --
L:  I actually don't get ill very often.  Um, I -- I got really sick last year, um, er, I'll even -- I'll go to work with a cold.  I'll go to work sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't really care.  I can usually shake it off.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But this particular cold, like, I was on the couch for a week.  That doesn't happen to me.
R:  Right.
L:  So that's, ah --
R:  That's happening more and more --
L:  Actually --
R:  -- often.
L:  -- I'm feeling like I've been sick in the last five years, come to think of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like knock me on my ass kinda sick.
R:  Yeah.  Well, this -- you know how, ah, the viruses mutate?
L:  Yeah, from person to person.
R:  Like the fl- flu virus --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can mutate, that's why they have to have a different combination each year for flu shots?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I imagine cold viruses maybe do the same thing.
L:  I would imagine.
R:  And so some of 'em are probably more potent than others, but, ah, yeah, next time you --
L:  I try a little of that Theraflu and I do a lot of tea and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I try to take my vitamins every day, but sometimes I don't succeed [LAUGH].
R:  So you are a vitamin taker?
L:  On occasion, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  What do you do in Hollywood?
L:  Especially when I get run down.  I'm an electrician, actually.
R:  Electrician?
L:  Yeah.  You don't --
R:  Fantastic.
L:  -- see many chick electricians.
R:  A female electrician.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And how --
L:  You seem to be sur-
R:  -- how come you're not working today?
L:  Ah, no, today I have, ah, off 'cause I'm moving next week so I'm packing up some boxes.
R:  Oh, I see.  Good.
L:  What are you doing today?
R:  Well, actually, I'm, ah, I make money on the internet and with investment stuff.
L:  Perfect.
R:  And so I'm here, ah, too much of the time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been a widower for a few years and I live alone.   I have three grown daughters.
L:  Oh, do you?  Fantastic.
R:  Ah, they're --
L:  Where are they now?
R:  They're ages, ah, twenty eight and thirty one and thirty two.  The oldest one's the only married one, provided one grandchild, so one of the reasons --
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  -- for staying healthy is I gotta live a long time if I'm gonna be able to enjoy my grandkids 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my girls are sure slow at getting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My mother has the same, ah, same problem with us, actually.
R:  Yeah.  I have the -- my two single daughters -- my -- my married one lives in Torrance.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  And she's the wife of an associate pastor there.  And then the other two are single gals.  One works for Oracle --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- software company, and the other, ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- works for a fairly new biotechnology company that supplies, ah, ah, well, make -- yeah, provides supplies for all kinds of experiments and so on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for biotechnology.  So she's an outside field rep for that company.
L:  Oh, wonderful.  They make --
R:  Great gals.
L:  -- a lot of money actually.
R:  I'm a very proud father.
L:  I bet you are.
R:  Oh, yeah, and they're great.
L:  That's fantastic.
R:  So, yeah, we took the time to do the things to raise 'em right and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I sometimes brag on 'em and say that, ah, they never caused me a lost night's sleep [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's a rare parent that can say that.
R:  In fact, the three daughters came to us together one time when they were about range of ten to fourteen.  They said, "Hey --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- you know, Mom and Dad, we don't think you appreciate us enough for being such good girls".
L:  [LAUGH] So what did you do?  Did you take her out for ice cream or something?
R:  I can't remember what we did [LAUGH] but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that was, ah --
L:  [LAUGH] I think that's hilarious [LAUGH].  You thought that --
R:  I thought that's --
L:  -- you appreciate us and all.
R:  -- that's the rarity for parents to hear, I'm sure.
L:  No kidding.
R:  Well, do you know, and I'm -- I'm not, um, pushing anything over on you, but, ah --
L:  No, please.
R:  -- any -- anyway, you know, it all goes back to some really strong spiritual roots in the family.
L:  Oh, fantastic.
R:  Oh, that help retain the moral values and perspectives and keep things in balance and -- and I had a wife that was really a supermom.  She was a great gal. Lost her to cancer six years ago.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, no.
R:  But she was a great partner in raising kids, yep.  Kids just adored her.  Everybody loved her, in fact.  Have you ever heard the phrase, nobody doesn't love Sara -- Sara Lee?
L:  Yes.
R:  Are you old enough --
L:  Nobody didn't love your wife, yeah?
R:  You're old enough to remember that one?
L:  I sure do.
R:  You must be over thirty five [LAUGH].
L:  No, I'm not.
R:  You're not?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  I'm twenty five.
R:  You're twenty five?
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  Well, I can't -- that -- that seems so long ago when that was around.  No --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nobody does love --
L:  No, nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.  That was -- no, that was on when I was a kid.
R:  You remember that happen -- yeah, well --
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  I say that would -- in regard to my wife, I could say nobody doesn't love Linda, 'cause she's just such a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- lovable, outgoing gal.  Well, boy, our time's gonna be --
L:  I'm sorry --
R:  -- brought up in a moment.
L:  -- that you, ah -- I'm sorry that you -- that's she's not here, so --
R:  Oh [SIGH], yeah, for sure.
