R:  Hi, I'm Donna in Saint Paul.
L:  Hi, is it Donna?
R:  Yes, Donna.
L:  Hi, Donna, my name's Tom, from Lyndville[?].
R:  Where's Windville?
L:  Iowa.
R:  Oh, Iowa.  We're not that far apart then.
L:  No, we're not.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Good, good.  We're moving kinda close to you in about a month.  We're going to La Crosse.
L:  Oh, I see.  La Crosse, that's where the big six packs are.
R:  Yes, that's exactly right.  But that's not a food, is it?
L:  No, well --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's a, ah -- I think it might be classified as food.
R:  Oh, I don't know, well --
L:  It has barley and hops.  It's a grain --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  More on the liquid type.
R:  Yeah.  I guess.
L:  But --
R:  I don't think that's what they had in mind though.
L:  Right.
R:  Anyway, I don't know about you, but I like kind of a combination of the both, either eating in, or eating at home.  I like carry out.  You know, like -- like, um, going to the Outback Steak house, or Chilies or something like that.  Carrying out and bring it home.
L:  I didn't know they had carry out.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  And -- and just about every place has it.  [NOISE] And it's usually, um, no more expensive.  They put all the silverware, if you want to take it to a park, and eat it, or if you want to bring it home, a lot of times my husband and I will bring something home, and pop in a good movie.
L:  I s- --
R:  And that way we can eat, and relax and watch the movie.
L:  Huh.  I see.
R:  What about --
L:  I tend to, ah, I tend to enjoy buffets.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, I take the kids out to eat, ah, once a month and, ah, Ryan's steak house really has a wonderful buffet.
R:  Okay, I've never even heard of that.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's, ah, it's like a steak house -- it's sorta like, ah, [LIPSMACK] I'm trying to think, ah, ah, cafiter- what's the, Country --
R:  Oh, Country --
L:  -- Buffet or s- --
R:  -- Buffet, yeah.
L:  It's similar to that, but much better food.
R:  Well, the only thing that I have against that is that I have seen people use their hands, you know, like t- to pick up -- say if you go for a breakfast or brunch, and they pick -- sometimes, instead of using tongs, I have seen, like, them pick up the sausages or what have you with -- with their fingers, and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know where your hands have been".
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  You know, I'm like, "Buh". [NOISE].
L:  Well, i- i- -- sometimes that might be safer than what's done back in the kitchen, too.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I've -- we've -- I've done my share of restaurants when I was younger.
L:  Yeah.  Ah --
R:  Let's see, they wanted us to -- to talk about an ideal meal.  What's your idea of an ideal meal?
L:  Oh, gosh, ideal meal would be, ah, well someone to prepare it at home --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and clean it up --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- and there's an ideal meal.
R:  [LAUGH].  That -- that's the best part of it.
L:  Ah, no I -- I'm not sure.  An ideal meal would be, ah, oh something that, ah, that the family would enjoy.  Cooked at home.  Ah, you know, where it's a -- it's a full course, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- healthy.  Ah, if you eat out, I suppose, again, the same thing.  When you go to a place like Chili's or what -- I mean, you've got the menu --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then it's like, sometimes you just don't know what you have a mood for, and you --
R:  Yes.
L:  You know --
R:  Yes.  We --
L:  Well, that's where a buffet really does come in handy.
R:  Well, you always -- sure --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- you could try a little bit of everything, and then -- and then the women have to bring a big purse though.
L:  Well, actually, I was suprised --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I was just there, ah, when did I go?  Last Saturday, and they have cameras now, at this buffet.
R:  For -- were -- what were people doing?
L:  Little cameras like at Walmart, in the ceiling.
R:  Yeah, why?  Or --
L:  Because people take stuff.
R:  I don't -- I don't see a problem, personally, with -- if you've paid for a meal, to bring a cookie home for -- for on your way home, or what have you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know what I mean.
L:  Well, I can see a cookie, or, yes, if they give you rolls --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because that -- they -- I think, normally just throw those away.
R:  Well, yeah.  I think they have to.
L:  Ah, but I guess these people were actually taking stuff --
R:  Oh, no, that's wrong.
L:  -- and filling -- yeah.
R:  No, you know, I -- I would take a cookie, probably even two, and wrap it up in a napkin, and bring it home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, my ideal of a perfect meal, of course, like you said, is somebody to prepare it and clean it up.  But starting out with a nice salad.  I like salads, my husband doesn't.
L:  Well, salads are delicious and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and th- that's where buffets really come in handy, because --
R:  Yeah, but I want a mix of all the different ingredients.
L:  -- if you were to buy everything that came on a salad bar --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  I mean, you -- you would go broke, and -- and the price is reasonable.
R:  Well, I wish my husband liked salad bars because I just -- I -- well I could eat at a salad bar every day, but see, I like a good mix of the -- of the, um, of the salad greens.  I like, you know, more the bitter greens and the sweet greens, and even down to just the plain, like, iceberg lettuce, put that on some endive and little this, little that, but it --
L:  Well, that sounds like a McDonalds commercial, because what they're -- they claiming --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have fifteen -- fifteen kinds of lettuce?
R:  Yeah, I like that, but I've never had one of theirs.
L:  I've never did ei- -- I didn't know there were fifteen types of lettuce.
R:  Well, I -- I used to buy theirs.  They used to make a very good, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, it was like the --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- chefs salad.  Um, and then they had great -- I like the fattening ranch dressing.  You know, and I knew -- but it used to be very good -- a lot of meat, and a lot of cheese and a lot of the bacon bits and croutons and all that in there.
L:  Right.
R:  But then -- then they stopped making it, so I don't know.
L:  I like, sort of the wacky dressings.  The red vinegar, the, ah --
R:  Sort of the Catalina[?]?
L:  What?  No, that's too sweet.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, this is the red vinaigrette --
R:  Okay.
L:  It's like a, ah, a -- well, I guess it's like Italian, but it's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's red and it's -- it's sorta tangy --
R:  Where they use the red vinegar, right.
L:  And --
R:  Sort of like a Greek dressing.
L:  Well, that-- that is good.  And also the sun dried tomato.  Man that t- --
R:  Yeah, that's very good.
L:  Oh, that is awesome stuff.
R:  Yes.  Now, what about a delicious, nice, thick steak, that melts in your mouth?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Absolut- -- the kind that -- the kind that you can cut with a fork.
L:  Actually, now I don't know if they have 'em up there in Minneapolis, or Saint P- -- yeah --
R:  Saint Paul.
L:  Ah, [NOISE] down here, a big thing is --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- a grill your own steak place.
R:  Oh, see I wouldn't like that, because I never know when it's done or not.
L:  Oh, well, see, I'm a pro at the grill.
R:  Well, then you're welcome up here anytime.
L:  I -- I always try and keep two or three grills on hand --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- of -- of the old fashioned grill, with the spit you can put on, the motor --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, y- you can't really find those at, you know -- a round Weber, is a round Weber.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you can smoke with it, but, ah, I do enjoy cooking on a grill, ah -- fact that --
R:  Yep, I like both charcoal and gas.
L:  Well, I -- I just prefer charcoal.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know why it is.  Gas, if I wanted to use gas I cook on the stove.
R:  Yeah, but it gets too hot to cook, sometimes. [LAUGH].  So I'd rather --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- go outside and cook.  Even in the wintertime, I'd rather grill out  -- throw a couple of either burgers, that are juicy --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  I don't like these dried out things.  Juicy burgers or a nice thick steak, right on the grill --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- with a baked potato, with sour cream, some chives [NOISE] and butter and pepper.
L:  Well, how do you do potatoes, though, on the grill?
R:  I nuke them first, each --
L:  Oh.
R:  You -- you poke 'em with a -- with a fork, and, um, I nuke them for, if they're lar- larger potatoes, for about four minutes each.  So, you know --
L:  Have you ever done potatoes on the grill in the foil?
R:  I have, but they take too long.  That's why I nuke them first and then I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- do the rest of the way -- I put -- I -- I take the tin foil and I either spray like, pam[?], like butter flavored pr- -- pam --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or put a little bit of butter in there.  Same way as corn on the cob --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and wrap it up and put it on the grill and it sort of bakes into the skin.
L:  Oh, yeah, corn on the cob.  My uncle used [NOISE] to do corn on the cob, ah, ah, on the husks --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and roast it.  Oh, is that good?  I mean --
R:  Oh, that's delicious.
L:  -- we -- you'd pull back the, ah, husk, pull the silk out, wrap it back up with the husks --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then grill it that way.  For some reason it just -- oh, it tastes so good.
R:  Mm.  That really does sound good, and that's part of a perfect meal, too.
L:  Oh, that is.
R:  As long as I don't rip any teeth out, trying to do it.
L:  You bet ya.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I guess the perfect meal, you know, and -- and -- and now that we're talking on food.  'Course I'm not that, ah, full, I mean hungry, 'cause I -- I did just eat, ah --
R:  Same here.
L:  -- but, ah, a pot luck is always excellent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go to.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, church pot -- pot luck is always -- I mean, because there's just so many different varieties of food, that it's like, "Oh, wow, where'd you get this at?" and "How do you make this?"
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Ah.
R:  As long as people are assigned to make different types of dishes [NOISE], like I'll a main course, I'll make a dessert, I'll make a salad, you know, or like a -- either a jello or a regular salad or a taco salad or something, because otherwise you end up with -- with, you know, ten cakes or something. [LAUGH].
L:  I hear a siren.
R:  Oh, there's always sirens.  There's a -- there's a fire house down the road from us.
L:  Oh, bummer.
R:  Time to -- time for me to say a little prayer for them.  I say a prayer everytime one goes by.
L:  Ah.
R:  They get there and back safe, and help whoever needs help.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH].  It's my little thing.
L:  Yeah, I sorta got used to, ah, country living.  I'm -- my town --
R:  Love it.
L:  -- doesn't even have a street light.
R:  Oh, my -- and that's -- and that's --
L:  You know a stop and go light.
R:  Yes.
L:  They don't even have that.  I mean it's -- it's just enjoyable.
R:  That's what I -- I used to live -- I don't know if you know it -- Tomah, Wisconsin?
L:  To- -- no.
R:  T- -- It's where I ninety and I ninety four split off.
L:  I'm going up there this fourth of July for -- at, ah, Menominee.
R:  Okay, that's not too far.  That's in Wisconsin.
L:  Family reunion, up there.
R:  That'll be nice --
L:  Yeah, it will.
R:  -- it's a nice area.
L:  It will.  Ah --
R:  You'll enjoy that.  And there's a lot of -- a lot of times I've been to Dell Hill Friday night fish boils.  What about those?
L:  Well, and it's sorta weird, w- where they have the supper club.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have the sup- --
R:  They have a lot of 'em around there.
L:  Yeah, they have this --
