R:  Hello?
L:  Hey.  I'm Nora.
R:  Hi, I'm Rita.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too.  Weird thing, huh?
R:  This is my first time.
L:  Me, too.
R:  Oh, okay.  [inaudible].
L:  So, were supposed to talk about whether we like eating out or eating at home better.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And describe our perfect meal.
R:  Yes, why don't you start us off.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I was just looking in to recipe books and 'cause I think [SIGH], I don't know.  Maybe eating at home.  If I have time to cook and stuff, I like to do that.
R:  Mhm.  But --
L:  Um.
R:  -- what kind of food do you cook?
L:  Um, mostly vegetarian food.
R:  Mhm.  Are you a vegetarian?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] not very strictly.  I eat meat and fish and chicken occasionally, like a couple of times a year.
R:  Mhm.  You get some --
L:  But oth- other than that, I'm pretty much a vegetarian.  How about you?
R:  Um, I'm also not a vegetarian.  But I generally cook vegetarian food, just 'cause -- I don't know what to do with meat.  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so, whenever I cook -- I cook pretty rarely, these days.  'Cause --
L:  'Cause you're -- 'cause you're busy?
R:  Yeah, but when I have time, I like cooking.
L:  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Like, i- i- -- often I eat out because I don't have time to cook at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I think one of the problems with eating out though, is that I always end up eating too much.  Like, if you go to a restaurant and you sit down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's so much food, and it's really good, and [LAUGH] I just eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and eat and eat and at home it's like, you make stuff and portions and you just eat what you want and then save it, whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I sometimes doggy bag, too, and bring stuff home.  But, still like, when it's all there, you're like, "Eat it now", just when it's hot and yummy.
R:  Yes, and -- but even when I'm at home, like, I like it when other people cook.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I do the dishes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's my best case scenario.
L:  Pardon?
R:  That's the best case scenario, for me.  I'll do the dishes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  If someone will cook it for me.
L:  I -- I was thinking -- like, 'cause one of the questions was, ah, is what, um, like, describe your ideal meal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like, I -- I wasn't thinking necessarily in terms of what I was eating, but I was thinking in terms of like, not having to worry about --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- like, cleaning the kitchen and putting away --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the dishes, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  But, if you had to choose a favorite food, what would it be?
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I have no idea.  I don't think I could.  I think i- if, um -- variety is what -- you know what I mean?  Like, what makes you enjoy anything.  Like, if you just -- if I just ate taco or something, then not be happy.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, I'd initially be kinda all right, but --
R:  If you could have anything right now [LAUGH], what would it be?
L:  Um, I was just gonna start making a -- a sesame and noodle salad.
R:  Mm.  Sounds good.
L:  But then, I bought the ingredients for it last week, but then the, um, cucumber is getting moldy.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  I have to figure out a plan B.  How 'bout you?
R:  Oh, I just ate, so I'm not really hungry [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  What did you eat?
R:  I've had, like, enough food.  Um, my room mate made chicken parmesan.  She likes -- she is a meat eater, mostly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she only cooks meat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I started eating more meat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though I still like veggies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, she does -- she buys a lot of vegetables and she waits until they're almost moldy [LAUGH] and then she --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- cuts them up [LAUGH].
L:  Throws them all in one dish, usually?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, it's like, "I gotta make something with this" [inaudible].
L:  What was it, chicken parmesan, or egg plant parmesan?
R:  She made chicken.
L:  Chicken parmesan.  I -- 'cause I had a egg plant parmesan last night.
R:  Yep.
L:  Let's just see [NOISE], um --
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH], um, yes, egg plant parmesan is one of my specialties, that I cook.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do you make it?
R:  Um, it takes a really long time, 'cause it's better when you slice the egg plant really, really thin.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, it's really bad for you, 'cause you have to fry everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, if you see me making it, you probably won't want to eat it, but it's delicious --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and you -- you don't realise how much oil has gone in it, but --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  My boyfriend makes it, and he doesn't slice it -- slice the egg plant, super thin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, how thin do you slice it?
R:  As thin as I can without cutting myself [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, that thin, huh?
R:  And then it just takes forever to fry, too.  'Cause --
L:  Yeah, i- it seems like a really labor intensive meal, but, I mean, it's really rich, and good.
R:  Yeah.  I like foods that are really bad for me.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm -- I'm one of those people who's like, I could get the low fat [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
R:  -- but it's not as delicious.
L:  Yeah, I know, I -- I feel that way too.  [NOISE] Especially, like, being mostly -- I mean, not -- not eating, like, I don't eat a lot of [NOISE] -- oh, my gosh, just a sec.  Can you turn it down Timba[?]?  Jeepers.  Um --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I, like, I try to eat healthy in general, and not eat a lot of like, processed foods.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, um, or, you know, like, a lot of meat or whatever.  So -- so, when it comes to like, should I get the whole fat yogurt, or the, like, skim, I always go the whole fat, and like, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I'm always like, life's short --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I want whole milk [LAUGH] [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Definitely.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, a perfect -- what would your perfect meal be [LAUGH]?  Is there like, a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- favorite dish, or anything?
R:  Um, I guess my perfect meal would be, um, I don't know, I mean you're with friends --
L:  What?  Yeah.  A meal with friends --
R:  -- company, good -- good company, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good food, um, anything my dad cooks.
L:  Oh, is he a good cook?
R:  Yes, I guess.
L:  Cool.
R:  And, um, [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, did you see the final episode of Iron Shaft[?]?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I didn't.
R:  Do you ever watch Iron Shaft?
L:  I've -- I've watched it like, once or twice.  I- is it done now, it's ended?
R:  I think it actually ended a couple of years ago, but they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- were just playing the final episodes again --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with the end, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't have a TV -- well I have a TV, but not like, cable or anything, right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I did have cables for a little while and I totally got -- like, became addicted to the food channel.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty addicting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- sometimes I like, like, thinking and reading watching about food as m- much as I do eating it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I grew up watching the food channel, 'cause it was all my dad ever watched.
L:   Oh, really.
R:  So now when flipping channels, I'm always like, "food channel" [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  It's like a comfort.  So your dad's a sweetie?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] What kind of food does he like to make?
R:  Um, well, he always liked making really fattening foods and then, um --
L:  So [inaudible].
R:  -- and now his cholesterol is too high, and now he makes healthy foods that aren't quite as delicious.
L:  Oh.
R:  Used to like going home for [LAUGH] dinner all the time, and now I'm like, "Mm".
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, get the brown rice and some vegetables.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It is delicious, don't get me wrong but --
L:  Right, in their own way.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but there's something about really --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- rich foods that just can't be beat [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.  Pesto's one of my favorites.
L:  What?
R:  Pesto?
L:  Pesto, oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's also really bad for you, but it's so good.
L:  I guess so.  Yeah, I, um, I like making it -- I only make it, like, once a year, but, like, when basil's in season locally.  And I, like, do it all by hand.  Well, I -- I -- I guess I grate the cheese so it's a machine, but other than that -- like, chop the basil and garlic, and stuff by hand, and the pine nuts.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's really yummy.  I like it.
R:  Do you really?
L:  But really labor intensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that's kind of the fun of it.  I like the process.
R:  Yeah.  Do you do a big holiday cooking thing?
L:  Um, I did it this year.  Like, with some friends -- it was kind of weird.  Like we had -- the starter was, um, chinese hot and sour soup [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then we had --
R:  What holiday's this for?
L:  What?
R:  What holiday is this for?
L:  For Christmas.
R:  Okay.
L:  But then, um -- but then we had turkey and stuff.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, I guess we do big, like, thanksgiving --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in my family, but other than that -- we try to cook for passover, but I don't know if you've ever eaten passover foods that are all made with massa[?] [LAUGH]?
L:  Oh, really?  No, I -- I haven't really.
R:  It's kind of ... bland and not terribly interesting.  But you have to make it, 'cause there's nothing else you can eat.
L:  Ah.
R:  But -- so there's a lot of cooking there, but it's never terribly good [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  But --
R:  There are only [inaudible].
L:  They're just ceremonial.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  But after a week of eating just massa and eggs --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh
R:  [LAUGH] We're all --
L:  You're like, "Ah".
