R:  Hi, this is Sean.
L:  Sean, this is Rob.
R:  How ya doing, Rob?
L:  Okay.
R:  So I guess we're supposed to discuss changes in the weather [SIGH]?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And how does that affect you [LAUGH]?
L:  Oh.
R:  How -- how do you -- are you glad spring's here?
L:  I'm glad spring's here but it's an off and on.  Ever since spring, we've had some hot weather, we -- we've had some nice weather, then we've had some nasty weather, then we've had -- and now we've had some nice weather.
R:  Yeah, it's just been cold and cold and cold and --
L:  Yeah. Where are you -- what part of the country --
R:  I --
L:  -- are you in?
R:  -- live in California.
L:  Oh, California.  Well, you don't worry about it too much, I guess.
R:  Yeah, well, it -- it's been cold for us.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Where are you?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Ohio, yeah, you get -- well, you get real cold [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I find it's miserable when it gets cold.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I just wanna stay inside and just watch TV [LIPSMACK].  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wanna get out of bed.  'Cause I ride a motorcycle around and it's been real rainy here.  We've had a real good rainy season, so it's kinda --
L:  Well, that's good.  You won't have any of -- fires if you're the --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, wildfires next year, 'cause when it rains, then everything grows and the next year is a drought and everything dies.  And that's when we get our fire seasons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah [LAUGH], kind of a catch twenty two thing, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  No rain, wonderful weather, and then the fires start.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  But if you get some rain, you won't have the fires.
R:  Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.  Catch twenty two.  So what kinda weather are you guys having out there right now?
L:  Well, we've been having it in the seventies for the last three or four days.
R:  In the seventies?  Oh, that's pretty good for Ohio.
L:  Yeah.  Pr- yeah, that's probably right.
R:  Well, you gotta get down to -- you get like below zero, don't you [SIGH]?
L:  No, we don't really get below zero very often.
R:  Yeah?
L:  We have winter -- we've had winters we can get it twenty one below.
R:  Jeez.
L:  But that's the coldest it's ever been here.  It hasn't been below zero but maybe three times in the last three years.
R:  Oh, how do you handle something like that?  It's gotta be depressing [SIGH].
L:  Oh, it's not -- it's not at all that bad.  It's a dry cold.
R:  You get -- you -- you get used to it, huh?
L:  It's not that bad, really.  It -- it -- you're inside most of the time and it is hard on your heating bill, thought.
R:  Yeah, right, yeah.  Tracks up your heating bills.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess being from California it means that when it drops to the fifties then freezing [SIGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, great, now today's a good seventy five today, so it's pretty pleasant out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's, ah, after about five o'clock at night it -- some of the sun goes down, it starts to get a little bit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chilly, ah, for this town.
L:  I always watch the weather channel.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and you tell -- you tell what the weather is all around the world.
L:  You never know what the weather's gonna be here.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  It -- it's changeable.
R:  Does it snow where you're at?
L:  We had about thirty inches of snow this year.
R:  About thirty inches?
L:  All year.
R:  Ah, oh, all year, oh, yeah.
L:  I don't think we had anything over five or six.
R:  Oh, that's not too -- have you ever had like the -- the streets piled up with snow and all iced over and --
L:  I've not --
R:  -- salted?
L:  -- iced over this winter, but not snow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  it wasn't too much snow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it was iced up some of the time.
R:  Are you close to the lake there?
L:  Please?
R:  Are you close to the lake?  The lakes?
L:  We're in southern Ohio.
R:  Ah.  It's like [inaudible] windier there.
L:  By the river.
R:  By the river, yeah.  It gets windier over there, right?
L:  It's windy, yeah.  And --
R:  Our [inaudible] --
L:  -- it hasn't been windy this year.
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's been an unusual year.
R:  Yeah, the weather's been really strange everywhere kinda this year.  It's been a -- it's been a bit on the cold side for most everybody, which means we're probably gonna have a really hot, hot summer too.
L:  I think we might -- we just might have a very hot summer.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, it just kinda comes and goes and goes in spurts.
L:  Right.
R:  But, ah, ah, hopefully it's gonna be a nice summer so I can get out on the motorcycle and drive around and -- and --
L:  You have a motorcycle?
R:  -- get to the beach and [inaudible] the bikinis and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Get away from people wearing, you know, hats and fur coats and --
L:  That's right.  Do you --
R:  -- makes 'em bundle up.
L:  -- have a motorcycle.
R:  Bundled up, yeah.  Yeah, I -- I drive a motorcycle.
L:  Ah.  Isn't that dangerous?
R:  Ah, not so far, knock on wood.
L:  How long have you had one?
R:  Ah, 'bout five years.
L:  Is that -- what kind is it?
R:  Ah, Yamaha.
L:  A Yamaha.
R:  Yeah, so it's a nice one when the weather's out -- weather's really nice and you can drive around in a T shirt and it's really cool.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, yeah, get some sun.
L:  Good.
R:  Except for when it's really hot, then you wear less clothes so if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if something happens, then, ah, you'd have more, ah --
L:  Accident.
R:  -- chance of getting hurt.  You wanna wear full leathers and stuff, but then you're -- you're -- if it's a hot day wearing full leathers, then it's like --
L:  You're hot.
R:  -- you're -- you're boiling hot and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wherever you stop, you gotta like take off all your -- you gotta peel of all those --
L:  Are you required to wear helmets out there?
R:  Yeah, yeah, we have to wear helmets here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] in a second if you don't.  Besides, if I -- if you don't have a helmet, then you get the wind blowing in your face and it's cold and chilly and you wind up eating bugs and stuff so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], so --
L:  You get bugs splattered on your helmet?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've driven it -- I've driven like on a really hot, nice summer day [SIGH], just when driving a bike and then -- and then like a blat, you know?  Had something go down the back of my throat.  It's like, oh, God, you know [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What the fuck -- you know, what the hell is that?
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  It's like, oh, man.  So, ah --
L:  You haven't had much change in weather, I guess.
R:  Well, California always runs fifties to nineties, you know, so it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, it's --
L:  Can't beat that.
R:  -- seventies, eighties average, but I like warm, warm weather.  I like --
L:  You like it hot, then?
R:  Yeah, I like it hot.  I prefer it hot, you know?  No --
L:  It's a pretty [inaudible] out there with the ocean, I think, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's real foggy --
L:  In the winter, it's around fifty to sixty, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  Then the summer it's between eighty and ninety, I guess.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Ninety's a pretty hot day for California.
L:  Oh, is that really true?  Then they're in the eighties?
R:  Pardon?
L:  You're in the eighties then.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'd say about mid eighties most of the time, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- a lot of people move here for the weather but I like -- I prefer tropical Caribbean --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  -- I travel there myself.
L:  Where do you go?
R:  Ah, like, Mexico, up Caribbean, Bahamas, Caribbean, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  +Trinibago, anything like that.  Anything in that, like, Caribbean area, where it's -- where it's always warm and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and humid.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But here, like I say, we've been having a pretty kind of a mo- a pretty cold winter for Cali- like California standards.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  But, ah, if -- thank God spring's finally here.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So -- so people are getting out more and walking their dogs and getting exercise and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- getting outside and getting some tan, getting some color.  I guess in -- in Ohio you guys -- you are guys are, ah, not gonna hit here -- here in summertime, it gets pretty nice there, right, though?
L:  No, it's either hot or cold here.
R:  Really?
L:  Generally.
R:  Really?  One or the other.
L:  We have had a nice April, I'd say for the most part, except for one week, where it was pretty nasty.  It was in the fifties and forties.
R:  Oh, that's pretty nasty.
L:  But, hey, this -- this time a year is generally the best time of year for us.  The average temperature's around seventy.
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's nice and comfortable.
L:  Yeah, I -- I like it actually a little cooler.  I like it around sixty, seventy, actually.
R:  Really?  I guess you guys from Ohio are used to the colder weather.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] piling on tons of clothes and wearing hats and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- down jackets and all that.
L:  Right.  But fifty seven, you know, it -- it's just cool enough that you don't -- it -- it's just nice.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  It's like air conditioning.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so it's like heater all winter and air conditioning all summer there?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To get -- to keep it rack -- racking up electric bills, huh?
L:  That's right.  Gas and electric makes a lot a money here.
R:  Well, I guess we're making ten bucks or so.  That'll pay for something [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right?
L:  Maybe it'll pay for my dinner tonight.
R:  Yeah, right, right.  If the cheque ever comes.
L:  Right.
R:  Seeing as how they --
L:  I talked to a woman last couple of nights ago and she said she got paid six weeks later.
R:  Six weeks, yeah?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I haven't been doing this very long.
R:  Yeah?  Ah, I'd be surprised [SIGH] but, ah, you know, it's some -- something -- something different to do.
L:  Said she did one in March then she got paid six weeks later.
R:  Six weeks later, huh?  What -- what were your subject that you guys had to talk about?  Was it weather?
L:  Please?
R:  What were you guys talking about?
L:  I forget now.
R:  Some blah, blah, blah, whatever.
L:  It wasn't the weather.  Ah, it wasn't that.  I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it's an interesting study.
L:  Please?
R:  This is an interesting study.  I guess they just wanna see how people talk about weather and how they talk about food and [SIGH], ah, I guess what kind of verbiage they use or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, seems kinda strange.  Weather's like here -- here we have like, ah, you know, if it changes ten degrees or if it starts raining, they have a storm watch.  The storm watch team comes in, you know.  We get like a quarter inch of rain and they make quite a bit deal out of it 'cause it's California.  Nobody --
L:  Quarter of an inch of rain?
R:  You know, get like -- yeah, get your quarter of an inch and big storm here and [inaudible].  They're all -- all -- all the newscasters are out there going like, "Storm watch," and that, you know, "of two thousand three".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
