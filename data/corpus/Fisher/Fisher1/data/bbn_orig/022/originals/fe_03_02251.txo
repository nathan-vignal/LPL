R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, how are you?
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing fine.  Have you participated in this before?
R:  Ah, yes, I have.  This is the second call.
L:  Is it?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm new to the program, but, ah, it sounds pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  So we're supposed to talk about the weather and illness, huh?
L:  Yeah, it's -- ah, that's what the recording said, you bet.  Um, I actually find it's not so much the weather, ah, that correlates to some -- to illness with me, um, it's more of me just taking care of myself and staying away from crowds of people.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I, ah --
R:  The weather has nothing to do with my -- w- with my wellbeing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I -- I like -- I like walking in the rain, snow.  I -- I love all the, ah, the, ah, gifts that God gives us, you know?
L:  You bet.  Where you -- where do you live?
R:  Uh, Soldofi[?], Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Harrisburg.
R:  Oh, okay.  Not too far.
L:  No.  So we get, ah, pretty much the same climates [inaudible].
R:  Pretty much, so I love the change of seasons.
L:  Ye- I do too.  Um, ah, the last couple years I've been spending more and more time in the winter in Florida, believe it or not.
R:  Really?
L:  And, ah, I'm just d- finding that, ah, [LIPSMACK] ah --
R:  Uh -- what's you're name?
L:  My name's John Hoffman.
R:  John, I'm Robert.  How you doing?
L:  Very good, Robert.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Glad to meet you.
R:  Ah, nice -- nice to talk to you, sir.  But, ah, I'll tell you one thing.  I was out in California one time for a New Year's Eve concert to see the Grateful Dead in California.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  San Francisco.  And it, being on the west coast during Christmastime really bummed me out.
L:  Did it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  'Cause I like to -- I like to be in the -- in the cold when it's winter.  You know --
L:  I see.
R:  -- supposed -- supposedly the winter months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  October, November, December, January.  It was so warm out there, I was really depressed.
L:  Yep, so it's --
R:  I don't know how those people -- I guess if you live around the -- the heat all year round, you know.
L:  Right.  Yeah, like we're --
R:  That's why I'm glad I'm -- I live on the east coast, the change of seasons.
L:  Sure.  Yeah, I know, ah, I don't like Florida or California in the summer at all.  It's just way too hot.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, either way, I mean, our conversation here is pretty simple because I think we both agree.  The weather really doesn't have su- much of effect on either of us.
R:  Not -- well, do you travel at all?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, it's sporadic.  Ah, sometimes I -- I, ah, this past year I didn't get to travel much, but in previous years, I have been fortunate enough to travel a little bit, you bet.
R:  Right.  Right.  I -- I -- I like -- I like -- I like weather.  Wea- you know.  'Cause it -- being a writer, it i- inspires a -- a lot of emotions, so you can, ah, extrapolate from -- from what, you know, the feelings are outside.
L:  Yeah, I can believe that.
R:  Sure.  Sure.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  But I know -- I know -- I know a lot of people who get -- who get aches and pains because of the rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And stuff like that.  Ah, I hope to never get that -- that way.
L:  Yeah, I have, ah --
R:  I don't know if it's because arthritis or what, dude.  Any arthritis run in your family?
L:  Um, not so much in my family.  I have a steel plate in my leg.
R:  Okay. Oh, really?
L:  So, yeah.  So sometimes when i- -- when it's -- if I'm out in the cold a lot, that's when it -- it tends to bother me.  But it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really not -- it's not, ah, you know, it's not an illness.  It's just --
R:  [LAUGH] Right, sure.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  You'd be walking along in the supermarket and get the coldness by the freezer.
L:  You bet.
R:  [SIGH] No kidding, man.
L:  Yep.
R:  How'd that happen to you?
L:  Um, I just shattered my leg, ah.  It was just kind of goofy, um --
R:  Left leg, right leg?
L:  Left leg.  W- --
R:  Kneecap?
L:  Nope, um, below --
R:  Femur?
L:  It was right above the ankle.
R:  Oh, kid -- no kidding?
L:  Yep.  And, ah --
R:  So your calf, huh?
L:  [LIPSMACK] You bet.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah.  And it -- it was actually I, um --
R:  Are you an active person?
L:  Pretty active, yeah.  I try to, ah, either get cardiovascular or -- or a weight workout four times a week.
R:  Did it limit your m- your mobility, dude?
L:  Ah, not really.  Um, the doctors did a good job putting everything back together and, ah, once it healed, it was just a matter of just get -- you know, getting the leg strength back.
R:  Right.
L:  So, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, ah --
R:  That's the most important thing. [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  How's the weather out there today?
L:  Beautiful.
R:  Really?
L:  Just -- just beautiful, oh, yeah.
R:  Ah, we -- we just got -- we just got, ah, nailed with a little -- little rainstorm.
L:  They said it was coming up [SIGH], but we didn't, ah, we didn't get any rain today.
R:  Right.
L:  We got hit y- last night --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but not today.
R:  Kinda nice, though.
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, being -- well, being, ah, someone who likes to enjoy outdoor concerts and everything, weather is like, comes and goes.  Makes things -- makes things either, you know, more pleasurable.
L:  Sure.  And a lot of people don't look at it that way [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I know, I know.
L:  I do.
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, yeah, I can be out fishing in the rain and just enjoying a lot of kind of stuff, but most --
R:  Are --
L:  -- people will -- am I what?
R:  No, no, I was just listening to you, like fishing and snow -- you like fishing?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I live less than a mile from the river here, and so I fish there and, um, I don't know if you've ever heard of Graystown[?]?
R:  No, I've never heard of it.
L:  It's the -- of the turnpike the other way, about halfway to Pittsburg, ah, but it's, ah, it's a lake resort.
R:  Okay.
L:  And in -- in the summer, I try and spend as many weekends up there as I can.
R:  That's nice.  Hang with your buddies, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Buddies, fam- friends, family --
R:  Sure.
L:  Ah --
R:  Or even solo, you know, enjoying the sunshine.
L:  Absolutely.  Um, 'cause that lake is thirty two miles long --
R:  You like walking -- you like walking in the weather, like, when, you know, torrential rainstorms, and stuff like that?
L:  Yeah, that kind of stuff I do, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  [LIPSMACK] And I love heavy snows.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't like shoveling afterward.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's what I'm saying, live on the east coast, you appreciate the change of seasons.
L:  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't be -- I couldn't be somewhere where it's one, you know, climate all the time.
L:  Ye- the only place I've ever enjoyed that was that way was Costa Rica.
R:  Right.
L:  Um [SIGH], but that's more of a tropical area but it's --it's always between sixty two and seventy two degrees.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, but in the change of seasons, of course, you get there is -- is the rain.
R:  Sure.
L:  'Cause they don't get any snow.
R:  Mhm.  I can imagine what the people in London feel like, you know, grey area all the time.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Dreary, you know.
L:  Yep.
R:  It was --
L:  And --
R:  It was pretty funny a couple weeks ago.  We had a -- a nice damping of fog out here in -- in Philadelphia and I felt like I was out in San Francisco.
L:  Cold.
R:  Oh, yeah, it was so cold, dude.  Put my headphones on, put some Grateful Dead on the headphones and just took --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a nice walk park through the -- took a nice walk through the park.  You know?
L:  Yep.
R:  San Francisco's a beautiful city ... for weather.
L:  Ye- ye- oh, okay.  I was going to say I've never been to San Francisco.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah --
R:  My goddaughter lives out there and, ah, my memories of her because -- bec- -- the change of seasons, you know?  I mean the -- the fog and the coldness off -- off the, ah, off the coast.
L:  Huh?  Neat.
R:  Sure.  You've never been to Frisco. You've ever been to the west coast?
L:  Um, yeah, I've been out to Bishop, California [SIGH], which is just a little hick town.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] um, I haven't been -- the only other place I was is Vegas out that way.
R:  The weather -- the weather never brings you down, huh?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, ah, where in -- where was I too?  I was in, ah [NOISE], mm, hah, I was in a little town out there but I can't remember what it was.  It's right where the big Navy base is.  Huh.  And I can't think of the name.
R:  Barrett.  What, town or city?
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was a city.
R:  No, I'm --
L:  It's a major -- what?
R:  What part of -- what you talk about what part of country?
L:  Um, it was in southern California 'cause we took the train to Mexico.
R:  Oh, round San Diego?
L:  That's it.  Or -- yeah, San Diego, yeah, that's it.  That's it.  That's it.
R:  Right.
L:  Thank you [SIGH].
R:  Right.  Never been down -- never been down south that far on the west coast.
L:  Gotcha.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  I -- I, yeah, I can't imagine. I mean weather's weather.  I -- I -- I just think of it as whatever God's gonna give you, you know, you have to be able to handle it, endure it.
L:  Sure.  And enjoy it.
R:  Sh- of course.  Of -- that's why I like walking in the rain and the snowstorms.  Thunderst- I love thunderstorms, you know.
L:  Yep.
R:  It doesn't change my mood at all.  Doesn't make me, ah, down at all.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  No.  That -- I like -- I like that kind of stuff.  That's why -- when we go to Lake Graystown, we always -- we pitch a tent.
R:  Right.
L:  So, ah, we have a blast when it rains.
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH] Thunderstorms.
R:  I think that's what this nate- I think that's what they, ah, this call is about nature, ah, about whether it makes you ill or something like that?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Is that was the -- the purpose of this call was?
L:  Um, I don't -- to be honest with you, I don't know if that was the purpose.  I don't even know if I understand this program.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, the program I think is just to, ah
