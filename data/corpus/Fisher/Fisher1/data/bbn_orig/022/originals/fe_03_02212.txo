L:  My name is Tammy, from North Carolina.
R:  My name is Jenny, from New York.
L:  Hi, Jenny.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Fine.  And you?
R:  Good.
L:  That's good.  So, I guess we are supposed to be talking eating out versus at home?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] What is your opinion on that? [LAUGH]
R:  Um.  I like both, actually.  I'm not supposed to answer like that, but I mean, I like trying out different restaurants --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I like trying different foods.  I'm open.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I also like, you know, well, I don't really cook so I guess if I'm eating indoors, hopefully someone's cooking for me --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, um, how about you?
L:  Um, I'm about the same way.  Uh, I like to eat foods that are cooked outside on the grill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my husband, he cooks a lot out on the grill.  I don't know how to use the grill actually.  So I -- I kinda like it both ways, but I like Mexican food.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I can't --
R:  Do you like Japanese food?
L:  Actually, I've never tried Japanese food.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  I like, I -- I love Japanese food and I also -- I mean, I like all kinds but you know what? I'm not big on the Italian.  I think I try to stay away from carbohydrates as much as possible.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it is just so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- filling, you know?
L:  You're right.  But, um --
R:  But, um, I like all kinds of food.  What do you cook, though?
L:  What do I cook?
R:  Mhm?
L:  Um, I cook a lot of Italian actually. [LAUGH]. I like Italian.  
R:  You know what?  I cook spaghetti because it's easy.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yep.
L:  I think that has a lot to do with it because of the amount of time.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you find that you eat out more or eat at home more?
L:  Actually, I think ah -- probably about half and half.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Actually, because, um, we eat a lot of Subway and you know, sandwiches like that, a whole lot.
R:  I like their pita, um, sandwiches.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Things made with pita bread.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The bread -- sorry about that.  And, uh, what else do I eat when I go out?  Um, I don't know.  I like all kinds of food, actually.  So.
L:  I'm the same way.  I kind of -- we go a lot to the buffet type places.
R:  Oh, those are crazy, though.  I mean, you just -- uh, and you know what else I also like?  International House of Pancakes.
L:  My daughter likes to go there.
R:  I -- I don't live near one, but um I -- I -- whenever I get a chance, I love -- like going to New Jersey or, um, far out in Queens where they have it, it's -- it's really good.
L:  Mhm.  I -- 
R:  The pancakes and the waffles.
L:  Mhm.  I've been there, but I just -- I don't like a lot of breakfast food.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I can't --
R:  Do you usually eat breakfast or not really?
L:  I eat breakfast, but I've been on a diet so most of the time I eat some type of granola bar or something like that.  I don't -- I'm not really a breakfast food person.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Cool.
L:  I'm -- I'm happy with a bowl of cereal and milk.
R:  Oh, I haven't had cereal in a while.  I had turkey bacon the other day [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't think that is very healthy, but they say that is healthier than, uh, regular bacon, so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's like ninety five percent less fat, yeah.
L:  Yes, but --
R:  Because I watch what I eat too, well, sometimes, not all the time.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I try my best.
L:  I have been.
R:  So, what other foods do you like?
L:  Um?  Let me see.  My favorite food, which is the worst thing in the world, is pizza.
R:  You know what?  There's this -- I'm very picky about my pizza.  I like it very thin and lots of crust.  Um, there's this place that I -- I swear by.  I always go to that place.
L:  Mhm?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I like it thin too.  I don't want the thick, doughy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and I don't like this -- the buttery, greasy --  I don't -- I don't like that.  I am happy with a vegetarian pizza on a very thin crust.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, because then, you know, you're getting vegetables so that's good, you know?  Its not just car- carbohydrates, you know, so.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  That's cool.  So, um, where else do you -- what other foods do you like to eat at restaurants, other than Mexican food?
L:  Mm.  Let me think.  Most of the time, just something like steak.  If we go --
R:  Oh, I love steak.  I just had steak the other day at this restaurant called Anita's.  It was really good.
L:  Really?  Um -- 
R:  Yeah, and I love um, what's that called?  Um, tuna tata[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's really good.  I love that.
L:  Okay.  That's just --
R:  Yeah.  I like all kinds of food, actually, so.
L:  Really?
R:  Mm.
L:  What is your favorite?
R:  Um.  Japanese is good.  I like Japanese, but I guess, you know, a lot of people don't.  It's like, um, you just have to get used to it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I didn't like it at first.  I only used to eat the rolls.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then moved on to the slices of raw fish.  I bet that sounds so disgusting to you? [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  I don't eat fish at all.
R:  Really?  You know that's right, it's very good for you, though.
L:  I know.
R:  Oh, you just don't like the taste of it?
L:  I am the only family -- person in my family who does not eat fish.  I just --
R:  Really?
L:  I do not -- now, I -- I eat shrimp.
R:  Oh, but where do you get your iron from then?
L:  That's why I have to take medicine for that. [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, are you low in -- yeah, are you low in iron?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yes.
R:  My friend, she was supposed to be taking that, those pills, but she stopped because she said she was getting chest pains from it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I told her it's because she's not eating in the morning before she takes the medicine --
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Because you are never supposed to take med- medication on an empty stomach.
L:  No, and I found that out.  I have to eat something before I take it.
R:  Oh, the same thing happened to you, right?
L:  Mhm, yes.
R:  I don't know what else would have iron but, you know?
L:  Well, actually broccoli is good for you, dark green vegetables, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And wheat bread.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's certain things that --  I've got a diet that, you know, that you're supposed to go by to give you more iron and actually -- and you being from New York, you've probably never heard of grits?
R:  You know what?  I have.  It's kind of like a rice kind of?
L:  Kinda.  It's a breakfast food around here.
R:  And what -- what is it made of?
L:  It's made of corn.
R:  Okay.  Oh, is it -- is it good?
L:  Yes, it's actually good.
R:  And it's healthy, right?
L:  Mm. It's very healthy.  Um, it's really a good source of iron.
R:  Wow.
L:  They tell -- mhm.  It -- it's unbelievable how big of a difference it makes if you're going to be a blood donor for the Red Cross or something.
R:  Ahah.
L:  They'll tell you if you have low iron, eat grits, like the week before you're going to come.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And -- and it brings your iron up.
R:  So what foods are known in are -- in, uh, North Carolina?  Like, if I ever go, what must I eat there, at a restaurant, say?
L:  Most people from out of town go for the barbecue.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yes.   Support barbecue.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or the base barbecue.  And --
R:  Oh, that sounds tasty.
L:  Yes.  It's --
R:  Do you know of any restaurants that I should know of that, if I ever go down -- ov- over there?
L:  If you ever come, in North Carolina there's a place called -- it's Bill Ellis Barbecue and it's wonderful.
R:  Wait.  Could you spell that?
L:  B.I.L.L. E.L.L.I.S.
R:  Okay.  Barbecue.
L:  Mhm.  And his barbecue's really good.  He caters a lot and he also has some restaurants.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's great.
L:  And that's -- you know, that's the main thing a lot of people want and they also have really good banana pudding.
R:  Oh, I love dessert.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, so you always eat dessert, um whenever you go out or do you just skip it?
L:  I did.  I used to.  I don't anymore.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I did up until about a year ago. [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, my friend and I went out to eat today.  She got this um -- it was one of the specials for the -- the night.  A steak salad so it was, um, chopped up steak with salad and they put fries on top of it.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  It was -- yeah, I had some of it.  It was really good.  And I had a beef stew with, um, rice.  That was really tasty too and avoc- avocado salad on the side.
L:  Oh, that sounds really good.
R:  Yeah.  I -- that's what I like to do.  Like, try different restaurants because I just think that, you know, I mean, it's just good to try different things, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, just to see -- because there are so many restaurants out there.  But you know what?  With the economy now, I mean, people don't go out to eat as much as they used to.
L:  No.
R:  People don't like to spend money as much.
L:  No, I noticed that.
R:  A lot of the fine dining places actually are hurting from their business and um, actually there's a lot of promotions and online there was this thing.  Um, I don't know what website it was, but it was really cool because what you can do is, um, when it's your birthday, they email you a gift certificate of fifty dollars --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- and you can go to one of the, uh, mentioned, uh, restaurants and use it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, think about it.  You know.  Like, an entree is like, I don't know, I think fine restaurants are usually probably like twenty --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So, you're saving a lot of money.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  So, you know.  I -- I'm going to be using one soon, in May --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I got one for my friend.  I'm looking forward to it because I usually don't eat at restaurants like that.  Like too upscale.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I like going to places where it's more, um, not as chi chi, you know what I mean?
L:  Yes.
R:  Where have to dress up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It just makes me feel a little uncomfortable and -- and almost pretentious.  I just like to be comfortable.  That's -- that's my main thing.
L:  See, that to me, and also I have two small children, so --
R:  Oh, how old are they?
L:  I have one, two and one, seven.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Do you take them -- take them out to eat?
L:  Oh, yes.  They love to eat out.
R:  Oh, that's so great.
L:  As a matter of fact, that's most of the time that we eat out, is they like to eat out.
R:  Uh-huh.  And you don't have to cook because you're probably so tired?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  At the end of the day.  I mean the- they're young, so they definitely require a lot of attention.
L:  Oh, yes.  I have one right now that's trying to talk to me. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He's running over me with a bus.
R:  He's like, "Mummy, talk to me instead".
L:  [LAUGH].  As long as he has something to roll, he's fine.
R:  What kind of foods do they li -- do they like?
L:  His favorite is pizza. [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's great.  So --
L:  Yes.  And -- and my daughter, she likes grilled cheese sandwiches.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh so, you can make those at home for her?
L:  Oh, yes.  
R:  Oh, that's -- 
L:  And there is also a restaurant, um, in the town where she has dance class at, that they have grilled cheese sandwiches as one of their children's meals.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, we go there on Tuesday nights.  
R:  Oh.
L:  We'll eat out tomorrow night.
R:  Oh, what other food do they have there?
L:  It's called Andy's Cheeseburger --
