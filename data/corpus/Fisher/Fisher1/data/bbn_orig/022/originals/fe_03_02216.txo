R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Sheila and I would rather go to a restaurant.  How about you?
R:  Um, I think I'd rather eat at home, actually.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH].
L:  Though it all depends if you --
R:  So -- so why restaurants?
L:  I don't know.  There are things that I can't make, like I mean, I couldn't make a good lobster.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  It's more of a treat.  I mean, I cook, I have to clean it up.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Oh, see, I make my boyfriend clean it up for me.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which is much better.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well I'm married and I have th- you know, well, I have grown children so it really becomes a lot --
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.
L:  -- to cook for everybody.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  You cook for hours and they eat it up, one two three, and you're not really conversing with them and then you're cleaning up.  No, I'd much rather go out to eat.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Are you a good cook?
R:  Um, sometimes.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Ah.
R:  Sometimes it backfires on me, but you know, I try.  [LAUGH].  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  I like to cook, though.  I cook a lot of, like, complicated things so, yeah. 
L:  Oh, I just made something outrageous the other night.  A broccoli casserole.
R:  Oh, yeah?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sounds good.
L:  Oh, it was the best and it was so easy.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  It was just broccoli bits and I put in some mushroom soup with some cheddar cheese, rich crackers on top, baked it in, and it was outrageous.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I made some risotto last night.  That was fun.  It was the first time I'd ever made it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that was exciting.  [LAUGH].  Um, so, what was the second question again?  It was --?
L: Whether we wanted to go out to a restaurant or whether we enjoyed eating more at home?
R:  Yeah.  The other one, though, was, um, oh, we were supposed to describe our perfect meals.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].  That's a harder one.
L:  Perfect.  Oh, God.  Um.  Perfect.  I don't think I ever had a perfect -- oh.  Oh, I guess my perfect meal would be, yeah, a lobster dinner really very well.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, just perfect.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  Not too small, a nice size and there's clam chowder soup with that.  The service would be good also.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH].  I've eaten at restaurants where we've waited a long time, yes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Or a steak.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we're near the city, so we -- you know, there's so many good restaurants.  They're expensive though.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I just moved to a -- a little town, uh, about a year ago from, um, St Louis, so I'm -- I'm not used to the lack of restaurant [LAUGH] opportunity.
L:  Oh, I was in Florida for a while and the food -- but New York really has the best restaurants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When it comes to Chinese food.  I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- if you go to Chinatown, you get the best Chinese meal.  I mean, no one makes it like Chinatown.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And Florida, it's all like -- I don't know, it doesn't taste right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's the water in a lot of places.  You know --
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- even the, you know, ah, the pizza is better in New York.  It has the crust.  It's -- everything's from the water.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a lot of perfect meals.  The Chinese food would be perfect here.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Italian food is really good.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I like a good, um -- ah, I don't eat meat so I like a, you know, spinach and cheese lasagna.  [LAUGH].
L:  In fact, we've been there, um, they just opened up an Aunt Lindy's[?] again.  Oh, I don't know if you know about it?
R:  Yeah, I've heard the name, I think.  I don't know.  I haven't been to New York in years though.
L:  Oh, this is in Brooklyn.  It was here about twenty years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was the perfect meal.  The fish, everything, was fresh right from the water.  The clam soup, they had their own recipes.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  They opened up after twenty years, uh, and they had a grand opening and the food is not the way it was.
R:  Oh.
L:  But that would be a perfect, ah -- I'd say all of New York.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  They have French -- they have French, uh, restaurants, in the city.  There's this great [inaudible] the best.  I think people come from all over for their food here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A very big difference than in Florida.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I had um, I was in ah, San Francisco a couple of weeks ago and I had the best sushi.  It was so good.  [LAUGH]  It was, um, you know, fresh from the water.
L:  Oh, that's, uh, nice.  I never really cultivated sushi very much.  I'd rather have something, maybe, like stuffed cabbage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I'm Jewish.  Um.  Ah.
R:  Yeah, stuffed cabbage is good.  I made that a -- a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Stuffed cabbage --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- potato pancakes, um, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Everything that's fattening.  And the turkey is good, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I make a turkey once -- that would be, like -- if you asked what was your favorite meal is that I make, would be a turkey.  It is the easiest thing to make. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's good for everyone.  It doesn't have to be Thanksgiving either.
R:  [LAUGH]  No, it doesn't.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  Now see, you don't find many nice restaurants where you are now?
R:  What?
L:  You don't find many nice restaurants where you are now?
R:  Not really.  I'm in this little town in Colorado now.  Um, I came here for school and, ah, it's -- yeah, it's a weird shock after living in a city, you know?  It's very strange.  [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  You know, and -- and you know what, when you go to different places, they don't know what you're talking about either?
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I know.
L:  There's something about different States, like, if I said I wanted a sucking candy, they thought I was saying something obscene, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  
L:  Or an egg creme.  An egg creme is, you know [LAUGH] you probably don't know what an egg creme is.  It's things you put an egg in, and beat it up.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know those.  I didn't know that's what they were called.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, no.  An egg creme is seltzer, chocolate syrup and milk.  It's a delicious drink.  They would look at me as if I was crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Different places have different, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there are different restaurants, you know, um, all over?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My favorite was in Florida.  I gotta say that there was once -- one I really favored in Florida, when we talk about favorite meals.  There's a place called Sweet Tomatoes.
R:  Oh, yeah, I've been to one of those.
L:  Right.  You can't -- I can't find it in Jersey, I can't find it in New York, Long Island, wherever I look, I can't find it.  I think it's just something down the South.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where you had all the soups, the best salad bar in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really good and --
R:  Yeah, we have those near me, actually.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess you can just live there.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Yeah, well the -- the really creepy food in, um, in Colorado is, um -- oh, what are they called?  Um, something oysters.  Um.  Ah, riverbed oysters or something.  But what they are is they're, um, they're cow testicles.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And for the longest time, I thought that they were actually oysters that they found -- Rocky Mountain oysters.  And I thought they were oysters that they found in, you know, the little streams in the mountains, for some unknown reason.  Why there would be oysters there, I don't know, but, um, no, they're cow testicles.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And I was really freaked out when I heard.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, I know.  It's -- you know, it's really your upbringing, where you've lived, where you've grown, and what you've gotten used to.  Like, in Florida, no matter what I got, even if I wanted, um, mashed potatoes or whatever, everything was so heavily seasoned.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They would have, like, [inaudible] potatoes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And your hamburger automatically came with a whole load of mayonnaise on it.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Ketchup, cheese.  I said, "Could I just please, you know, have a plain hamburger?"  
R:  Yeah?
L:  She looked at me as if I was strange.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that happens.
L:  But you'll have -- just have to look, though.  But we have varieties here, but there's a lot of chains you don't, you know, have.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like there isn't a Denny's here.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Um.  It's all these southern states.  Um, forgot the other ones that I went to down there.  Um, you know, like your Outback. There are some places that just have the same things, like we all have an Outback.  
R:  Right.
L:  We all -- Friday's is all over the place.  You might have a Friday's in Colorado?
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, we've got those here.
L:  Yeah, that's decent, isn't it?
R:  I get tired of those chains though, you know?  Sometimes I just want to eat someplace interesting.  [LAUGH].  So, I get tired of eating at the chain restaurants.
L:  Well, you should come to New York.
R:  I should.  I'd like --
L:  They have --
R:  I have a lot of friends there.  I'd like to visit soon, actually.  
L:  They have, I mean, you name it, they have the best restaurants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's not all that expensive so that, um --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  There are some Polish restaurants that I could name.  Theresa's, you can go in and have a whole meal for, like, six dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it is outrageously good.  Not fancy.
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  But it's, you know, good stuff.
R:  [LAUGH].  I don't need fancy.  [LAUGH].
L:  And even the coffee is better in New York.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  The bagels are better.
R:  Well, the bagels are definitely better.  [LAUGH].  There's no doubt about that.  [LAUGH].
L:  And I asked, when I was in Florida, I said, "Why does your pizza taste horrible?  Why is your coffee disgusting?"  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And you know --
R:  And they probably said, "Well it's not [LAUGH] disgusting.  It tastes fine".
L:  No, a couple of people agreed with me.  They said to me, "If you really want, go over to this place that says 'New York', New York Bagels or whatever".  So I said, "Well, why can't you make it like this", you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And they said "It's the water".
R:  Yeah?
L:  What they put in the water in New York, whatever the chemicals or whatever, it's what's good tasting.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And they don't have it. 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And they truthfully -- I mean, I used to see the -- the um, when I was in Florida, the trains coming in and they bought everything from New York.
R:  Yeah.  Wow.
L:  They can't get pickles.
R:  Pickles?
L:  Oh, is that us?
R:  They don't seem very hard to get.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, couldn't get any pickles and ah, everything was imported from New York.  
R:  Wow.
L:  New York cheesecake -- New --
