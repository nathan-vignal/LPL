L:  Danielle.
R:  Hi, my name is J- -- Hi, I'm Jill.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Danielle.  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good, um, [inaudible] what're we supposed to discuss?
R:  Ah, guess eating at a restaurant [LAUGH] and wheth- -- or if we like eating at a restaurant or at home better.
L:  Okay.  I -- I like eating at a restaurant better.
R:  Ah, I do too, but I love my mom's home cooking [LAUGH].  But, ah --
L:  Oh, yeah, well that's always good.
R:  [LAUGH] But, ah --
L:  I feel like I -- when I go to a restaurant, I can just relax.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and you can have the drinks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how old are you?  I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  I'm twenty. [COUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  You can't drink yet.
R:  No.
L:  But, um, but I can, so [LAUGH] that's why I like it too.  And I just think it's real -- I think this is weird [LAUGH].  Um, it's relaxing and just like, not as stressful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think.
R:  I went -- I just think that, like, it's better.  You can try new things, like -- and there's also different stuff that I would never make at home, that I would get out to eat usually.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I'll tell you, like, restaurants good and some foods, I don't know, that restaurants have -- it just like, like [inaudible] they always create that [LAUGH], or like --
L:  And they like, make it really nice -- like, looking also.  The presentation's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I eat at home, like I cook, for myself or whatever, and it just doesn't really look -- I mean not that it doesn't taste good, but really look good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think it's like, more appetizing to like, sit in front of like, a nice, you know, nicely prepared meal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The presentation.  So --
R:  Yeah.  You've more options, too.  Like, a lot of times when my mom's like, "We're making [inaudible]", "Argh, [LAUGH]".
L:  Exact --
R:  "I don't feel like that tonight".
L:  Well -- well, I cook -- I cook for myself, because I'm like, I'm twenty six on the twenty seventh.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's hard, you know, like, cook in my apartment, with everybody around.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.  Next year -- fuck [LAUGH] -- next year --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- I'm gonna have an apartment, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.  I have to learn how to cook [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, you don't know how to cook?  I -- can your mom teach you, or no?
R:  Yeah, she probably will.  I need to learn.  I'm just lazy.  I don't wanna cook [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  No, it's hard to make -- and also the things they make at restaurants, in fact, are really hard to make.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, like, i- it's more simple at home, just to make like, pasta or something.
R:  Yeah, exactly, I'm gonna be living off of that.
L:  Or like, chicken.  And then my chicken's like, not ever seasoned right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think it just tastes better in the -- in restaurants.  But, yeah, if I'm going to somebody's house, I mean, I like that.  But then again --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] parents -- I [inaudible] at my parents home, and they cook.  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't know, other than that, I really just like restaurants.  And plus you're being served.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  You know, you don't have to do anything. [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I mean, I -- I live right by New York City, so it's just like, there's so many --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  -- restaurants.  Yeah it's so --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- so fun --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- to just go out all the time and find, ah, new places and everything.
L:  Yes, but it is expensive.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  It's just -- it's so much cheaper to cook at home.  That's why I cook a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if I'm going on a date, you know, I like to go to restaurants [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know, I always make my boyfriends take me out [LAUGH], to restaurants.
L:  [several inaudible words] I just go on dates.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, um, yeah, I don't know.  I took some cooking classes.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  From, um -- yeah, from the chef that worked at -- I don't know if you've heard of Le Circ[?]?  You heard of that?
R:  Where?
L:  Le Circ.  It's like, in the city.  It's like, a really nice restaurant.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard of it.
L:  Yeah, one of the -- the, um, chefs that used to work there taught --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- a class at the Institute of Higher Education.  So I took a class hoping to learn like, how they make it --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- in restaurants.  You know how they make things in restaurants, with like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the sauces and stuff.  But, I mean, it's an hour.  You know, it's a few hours, so it's not like you learn --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really learn --
R:  I know.  I want to take a cooking class.  I think that would be fun.
L:  You know, it's a lot of fun.  Definitely fun.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And, it's like going to a restaurant, because at the end you get to like, eat all the food, and take leftovers.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And you sit around with wine, and like, everybody like, you try everybody elses dishes.  So --
R:  Cool.
L:  It's kind of like a restaurant, but also like home cooking, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and you don't have to clean up afterwards, is good too.  That's always the problem when I cook.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that's always the best part of going to a restaurant too.
R:  I have a --
L:  I haven't --
R:  I eat at the cafeteria at school, and it's just the worst food [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, you do?  Where do you go to school?  Oh, you don't have to say.
R:  Ah, Fordham[?], or, oh, whatever, Fordham University.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  So, the cafe is really bad there?
R:  Yeah.  The food is so bad, and it's just like -- we -- I end up eating like, pasta or hamburger every day [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my god, yeah.  See, but that's like, you don't have to clean up after that, and it's so bad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It depends on the restaurant you go to.  If you go to a bad restaurant, I'd rather eat at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if it's just not good.
R:  [SIGH] That's tr- --
L:  See, most of the -- most of the, ah, restaurants in the city are pretty good.
R:  Yeah, you can always find something good.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  So I -- that's what I like [LAUGH].  This is actually a cool topic.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I'm like, "Food", I'm like, "Okay" [LAUGH].
L:  [inaudible] I know food.  Really well.  Um -- so what, you live in the dorms, or no?
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  So there's no --
R:  And then next semester I'm going to have an apartment on campus, so I'm get to cook. [SIGH].
L:  Ah, that's very -- yeah, but you don't have a kitchen in your dorm, or no?  Or yes?
R:  It's like, really crappy, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Not in my actual room, I don't have one.
L:  Do people cook in the kitchen in the dorm?  Or no?
R:  Not -- not really, 'cause it's like, public.  Like, everyone uses it, type thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's kinda gross.
L:  Yeah, when I was in college [several inaudible words] getting them cooked.  They always like, microwaved.
R:  Yeah, that's like the only thing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, like, [inaudible] stuff, or like ch- -- you know [inaudible] or something.
R:  Yeah.  That's basically all that, ah, [LAUGH] I eat.
L:  Well -- well, next year, living in an apartment, it'll be better.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I cook -- I cook a lot more now that I like, live alone.
R:  Mm.
L:  Or, I live with roommates, but I mean, you know, in college I never did.  And like, coming home from school, I never did, and my parents -- you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Like, even during the day, when they're out like, I just -- I didn't really cook much, but now it's just like it's easy.  And summer market right there, and it's cheap, it's so cheap.
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's the thing, too.
L:  Like I made lamb chops today and it was like, four dollars for two like -- not even lamb chops, they're bigger.  Like shoulder blades.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Lambs?  And they were like, four dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, if you go to a restaurant, you order lamb, it's -- it's definitely --
R:  Thirty dollars.
L:  -- over twenty five dollars.
R:  Yeah.  It'd be ridiculous.
L:  See what I mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's ridiculous.  And I can't afford it, so --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I --
R:  I know.
L:  I mean I go to restaurants, but you know, I put it on my credit card, or -- which is really bad.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Or I go on dates.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Or I've got to find cheaper places.
R:  Me and my friends will go out sometimes, but it's like, always a treat when we go out [LAUGH] to eat in the city and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But that's what -- like, I'll go home on the weekends and I'll just eat my mom's food, and just like, "Thank God for your food".
L:  Yeah.  And that's so good.
R:  And that's what --
L:  Does she give you leftovers?  To take to school?
R:  Yeah.  And like, we always do big Sunday dinners --
L:  Oh, really?  That's nice.
R:  And like, my family --
L:  Every weekend?
R:  Yeah.  So, I always get fed well [LAUGH].
L:  Are you from New York, or from Jersey, or what?
R:  From Jersey, yeah.
L:  Mm.  Well, that's nice.
R:  But, um -- what was I gonna say -- the, ah -- I like eating out, but like, I just never can finish my food usually, and I always feel so wasteful.
L:  Oh, why don't you take it home?
R:  It's like -- I do, but sometimes, I don't know, it's too easy to always clean it off [LAUGH], and I don't know.
L:  No, you're right.
R:  It just sits there --
L:  Or if you're going out after or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I always finish my food [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I like to eat a lot.  It's really bad.  But, um, I'm on Atkins now.  You know, the Atkins --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and, ah, [several inaudible words] such a thing.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible], so -- so I'm cooking at home a lot.  But, um, yeah, when you gotta w- -- it's all so hard because if you go to work, like -- you don't work yet, but like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- at an office.  You know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you feel like, either like, eat out or you should cook the night before and bring it.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I think it gets really expensive to eat out.  Like I [inaudible] myself with just taking out all the time.  I love take out [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And it adds up, like you said, ten dollars a day?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  You know, that's -- it's five, it's fifty dollars a week.
R:  Yeah, that's like, too much.
L:  Yeah, that comes to, what?  It's two hundred dollars for lunch.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  That's crazy, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I love take out, though.  Like, Chinese is one of my favorite things [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  It's really good [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Thing is, I have -- I mean there's so many restaurants around me, that if I like, if I had the money, I would definitely eat out every night.  I would go to a restaurant every night.
R:  No, I know.  My -- me and my b- -- that's like what me and my- my boyfriend do all the time.  Or he's like, "What are we going to do.  Let's go out to eat" [LAUGH].
L:  Everyone's always eating [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But, ah, yeah, there're some good restaurants around me.  Very good ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a really well known place.  It's got the [inaudible] restaurant.  Don't ever go to the Sea Grill.  It's, um --
R:  In Manhattan?
L:  It's in Manhattan.  It's in Rockshore[?] Center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's supposed to be like, really good.  Went there for evening meal.  The fish was like, overcooked --
R:  [NOISE] Argh.
L:  And like, the [inaudible] was mahi mahi and it was like, well done.
R:  Really?
L:  You know?  Yeah, it was really bad.
R:  That sucks.
L:  And I'll never go --
R:  I know, I hate that.  When you go out to eat and it just like, sucks [LAUGH].
L:  Sucks. [inaudible]
R:  'Cause it's like, a treat to go out to eat and then --
L:  Exactly, then you like, it's even worse -- but the thing is like, you can always send it back, which is good, too.
R:  I know.
L:  You know.
R:  I'm always too shy to send it back.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I think it depends on my mood, but sometimes if it's like, really bad, I'll -- I'll send it back.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  I do feel bad, though.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I work at a
