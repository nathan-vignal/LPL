L:  Hi, are you there?
R:  Hi.  Yes, I'm here.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, do you remember all those things we're supposed to talk about?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Okay.  I think the first was getting sick, some people think you get sick when the seasons change.  
R:  I think that's true.
L:  And -- oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.  Okay.  That's been your experience, has it?
R:  Yeah, 'cause I live in New York and is -- um, weather changes all the time.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Yeah, and um, a couple of my friends always get sick when the weather changes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, some days it's cold, some days it's hot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when the weather changes from hot to cold, they get sick.
L:  Ah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't experience that myself.  I know some people get sick when -- when, um, spring comes for example because they have allergies.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And they get, um, sick with, you know, in -- in response to the pollen that's in the air.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Wha- what medications do you people take when -- when they get sick?  Do -- do they have --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- favorites or --
R:  No.  Actually, I -- well, Robotussin you know, for colds --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or they're a flu, usually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But for pollen and stuff like, um, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I wouldn't know.
L:  Yeah.  There's prescription medicine, I think, for that.  I took it once, but I only one time or a couple of times had -- had an allergy.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Ar- are you in New York City or New York State?
R:  New York City.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Great.  What a dynamic place.
R:  Yeah, it is.  The weather is crazy right now, too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  One day it's hot, and one day it's cold.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we been having some of that.  I'm not that far away from you actually.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Wow.
L:  Right.  But it's -- it's such a different lifestyle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think?
R:  Yeah, it is.  Very much.
L:  Yeah.  Well, how about the ordinary pollution in New York?  Do you think people get sick from that a lot?  Do you --
R:  Act- actually, yeah, because I have friends that live in the Bronx --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and, um, it's real polluted in the Bronx.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they get sick -- well, most of my friends have asthma and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they did a study on that, um, the air pollution in the Bronx compared to the air pollution in Manhattan --
L:  Right?
R:  -- and Queens, and there's more pollution in the Bronx than in either -- all the five boroughs.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And what can they do for that?  Is there medication you can take [LAUGH] or do you wear a gas mask?  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, um, nothing.  I mean, you know, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- uh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that would be a problem.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Right.  Are people worried about SARS?
R:  SARS?  A lot of people don't go to Chinatown any more because of the SARS --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that, um, going around.  And they're leaving a lot of business in Chinatown, 'cause I live in Manhattan.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, they don't go downtown any more.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm even scared to go downtown.
L:  Are you?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's a problem.  Um, well, I don't worry too much about getting sick, and -- and I don't --
R:  You don't?
L:  -- have any seasonal allergies, but as I say, I -- I do know people who -- who have it.  Um, you know, for the seasons, but especially in the spring time and there are, you know, prescription medicines that people take for that.  But apart from that, um, no, I'm in Philadelphia, and we have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some pollution, too, but not nearly as much as you people have in New York.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, there's no -- like, um -- you don't get any allergies, right?  You don't have any allergy?
L:  No, I don't have any allergies.  I had an allergy to a medicine, um, a sulphur drug that I would take for a urinary tract infection --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but, um, that seemed to pass.  I mean, it just -- it -- it -- when I first took it, I had an allergic reaction, then I didn't take it again, and then somebody else prescribed it for me years later and I took it and I didn't have an allergic reaction.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I guess I'm kinda fortunate that way.
R:  Yeah.  Um.  Um, like, I have -- well, I have allergic reactions because I live next to a park.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, um, when spring time comes, when the flowers start to bloom --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  [SIGH] I get, you know, I get allergies.  My nose starts running --
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- and stuff like that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I usually, um, my sister in law, she lives out on Long Island, she gives me some Claratin.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- that's prescription, but she still gives it to me 'cause they give it to her.
L:  Yeah.  I had a friend who took that, too, and -- and she swears by that.  Apparently that's a really effective, um, medicine.
R:  It really is.  Even for cats.  Like, dust and pollen and all that, it's good.
L:  Ah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it expensive, do you know?
R:  Um, I wouldn't know because she gets it for free.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] well, nothing's as expensive than free.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Ah.  Do you have -- were you wearing a watch?  Do you know how long we've been talking?
R:  I do not know.  But, um, I think it's been five minutes.
L:  Oh.  We're supposed to talk for ten.
R:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] right.
R:  I don't think I could talk for ten minutes.
L:  Well, we have to try to -- to do it.  I mean, I -- wha- what did they say?  They said sick when the seasons change and then two more things, but related to that.
R:  I should of wrote down the question.
L:  Well, that's the thing.  I think it -- well, I'm gonna make -- I'm gonna have one more call, so I'm going to try to write -- write it down when they -- but it probably it'll be the same topic.  I don't know.  Have you, um -- have you made more than one call?
R:  No, this is my first time.
L:  I see.  Okay.  So, so you don't know if the topic changes when you --
R:  No.  'Cause, um, first they called me and I wasn't home.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had to step out for a minute, and the topic was donuts. 
L:  Oh.
R:  It was weird.
L:  Yeah.  I could do well with donuts, chocolate covered, jelly filled.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, gosh.
L:  You have a lot of donut stores in New York?
R:  Yeah.  A lot.  
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  Crispy Creams[?] Dunkin Donuts, of course.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Um, different stores.  I mean, I -- I can't even name them --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- off the top of my head.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I can't name them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- off the top of my head.
L:  Yeah.  We have a lot, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think people choose between their donut stores not by their donuts, but by their coffee.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].  It's really too funny.
R:  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH].
L:  Do you think something will come on the line and tell us now you're ten minutes are up?
R:  I think so.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Oh --
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, I think we have three minutes left 'cause I think we started -- well, right now it's six twenty.
L:  Oh.  
R:  It's the same time, right?
L:  Right.  Well, I didn't have a clo- yeah, it's the same time.  Yeah, really, I'm not on the moon.  I'm only Philadelphia.  Have you been to Philadelphia?
R:  No, never.
L:  Oh.  It's a pretty city.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And the -- it -- it's a lot cleaner.  You would not have as much, I think, um, people who do suffer from allergies and polluted air don't have such a bad time in Philadelphia.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  We -- we don't have any industry any more.
R:  Oh?
L:  Which is one of the causes of the pollution in the air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we lost, uh, a lot of population and a lot of jobs starting in the fifties --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and so now we have nice blue sky.
R:  Wow.
L:  And -- and -- and a quieter economy, but um, as they say, I think a lot less, um, illness in response to allergic things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you like the winter?  Do you get much winter in New York?
R:  Oh, the last time it snowed was, um, like a month and a half ago.
L:  Aha.
R:  And it wasn't supposed -- in my experience, like, I been living in New York for twenty two years and um, I've never seen it snow and um --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- it was a March --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- or I forgot when.  No, it was in February it snowed.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And it was like two feet of snow.
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Ah.  
L:  That must have been fun.  Did you make snowballs and a snowman?
R:  Did I?  I went off -- [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I felt like a little kid.  I was playing football with my friends and --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- you know?
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from New York.  I --
L:  Oh, because you said you've only been there for a -- a while, I thought?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I just gave away my age, twenty two.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I'll give away mine.  I'm sixty six.
R:  Wow.  God bless you.  You don't even sound like it.
L:  Oh well, thank you.  [LAUGH].
R:  Like, sixty six has a sound, but you know?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I could talk like this.
R:  No.  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I don't know what else to talk about.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, um, okay.  We've covered -- they want us talking about sickness and medicine.  I think I got that -- that part right, but uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the third thing?  Do you have -- do you get sick when the -- do people when the seasons change?  What's our conclusion about that?  We think, well, some people do and some people don't?
R:  Some people do, some people don't.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  And do you think it -- it's related to the area where you live?
R:  I think it is. 
L:  Okay.  I think we -- we agree on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The area where you live, the pollution that's in the air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then what you do about it, and I think we both feel you take Claratin.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Ah, how about tea?  Were you ever told to drink hot tea for -- for not feeling well?
R:  Yeah, like Theraflu[?] but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but --
L:  Oh, Theraflu is a kind of tea?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I didn't know that.  Yeah.
R:  It's, um, like for headaches, muscle aches sometimes, um, they have different Theraflu's, but it's, um, mostly for when you're sick.  Like, you have a fever or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah --
