L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Karen.  Who am I speaking to?
R:  This is Carol Ann.
L:  Oh, Carol Ann, how do you feel about that?  Do you have -- do you have, uh, seasonal sickness?
R:  Oh, I get allergies, which is seasonal.
L:  Oh, gosh.  Yes, I understand the allergies, but like in the fall, I -- a lot of people I know before -- I knew before I moved where I am now --
R:  Mm.  
L:  -- um, the shortness of the days used to cause somewhat of a depression.
R:  Yeah, it's true because, uh, with my allergies, I took allergy shots, but that still doesn't alleviate me getting them from year to year.
L:  Oh, the allergies you're talking about?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I found that the older I get, the more -- I never suffer from allergies --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the same thing, um, the older I get, I went to -- I had a cold that would not go away --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and I went to the doctor and he -- he said, "This is no cold, this is allergies" and I looked at him, like, "Hey, you're crazy".
R:  Right.
L:  But, at -- the older I get, the more I suffer and um, I agree.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, the way I found out I had allergies was that I went to a nutrition seminary --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and they took my blood pressure.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And they told me, "You have allergies" and I said, "No, years ago I had allergies to tomatoes" and sure enough, I -- you know, I went to the doctor for what I thought was a cold, like yourself, and uh, but it lasted, like, five to seven days and he went and I told him what they told me at the seminar --
L:  Nutrition, right?
R:  -- and he said to me, "Well, let's take your blood" and sure enough, he said, "You have a very high concentration of allergy", and I just had learned to live --
L:  It surprised you?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I had learned to live with it because I just thought it was bronchitis and I just thought I was at certain times, you know, a couple of times a year, I would get a cold --
L:  Right?
R:  -- an- and that, you know, I also had sinuses, so that's -- I said, "Well, put it up to that", but it -- after I had the allergy shots, then the, uh, cold diminished.
L:  So -- so, your allergies are more or less seasonal?
R:  Right.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But it's -- well then you must live in a colder climate than I do?
R:  Yeah, I probably do.
L:  You -- you have -- you have, uh, uh, eastern -- like New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- accent?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  Uh, I understand.  I used to live in western New York --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and I didn't suffer allergies there.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I suffer them.
L:  I'm now -- I'm now -- I'm now on the gulf coast of Texas and we don't have a hard freeze where I'm at and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's just a matter of waiting for the trees to bloom or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yo- you know?  It's like we have one week of winter.  Um --
R:  So, you --
L:  -- but -- but I know that a lot of people, like I was trying to say before, especially with the time changes, used to go into a seasonal depression.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With, um, the lack of light.  You -- you know what I mean, and um --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't seem to -- I -- I seem to gradually go from one change to another with the light.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It has -- to light -- the light, to me, has nothing to do with it.  The light -- I think --
L:  It's just -- it's -- okay, I understand what you're saying.  Um, for me personally, I -- I like, uh, more or less home remedies, homeopathic remedies, um --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  -- drinking lots of water, um --
R:  Right.  Yeah, I don't put my --
L:  -- putting air cleaner in my -- uh, an air filter in my house.
R:  Right.
L:  Things like that, trying to -- because I also, um, thank God, I ha- I raise dogs, labradors, and I'm not allergic to them, but what I have found is, they suffer just as much from pollen --
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  -- and the -- the -- environment, as I do. 
R:  Yeah.  I have -- I have dogs and when I found out I had allergies, to my surprise, I was allergic to my animals.  Cats --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Cats, dogs, and dust mites.
L:  And so what have you done to --
R:  Well, I --
L:  Because I know that you're just not going to put your best friends outside?
R:  No, that's why I took the allergy shots.
L:  Okay.
R:  Not only that, but uh, you know I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, I don't always stay contained because I have --
L:  No.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the house, uh, I don't -- I open the windows in the summer even though I have central air conditioning.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Ah, I also have diabetes, so I try to make sure I have a good diet and I walk --
L:  Good.  That sounds like you're taking pretty good care --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of yourself, but okay, ho- how do you -- what do you think about this?  Sometimes I think that the air -- well, like you say with the fresh air, I think the inside of your house is more toxic than the outside.  
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Absolutely.  I mean, we have molds up here --
L:  Oh, gosh, mould like you would -- I know mould.
R:  And, uh, I mean, just -- I -- I can clean, and the next day, I see nothing but dust, so I know --
L:  Oh, yes.  I understand --
R:  -- and the windows aren't even open.
L:  Well, where -- where does it come from?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's what I --
L:  I'm telling you --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I know dust.  I know dust.  I have never -- I -- it -- I -- I don't know where it's coming from either.
R:  And I think that gives you colds, too, because I think taking in all the dust, taking in all --
L:  Oh, sure.  It's -- you --
R:  -- the particles that --
L:  You're filling them --
R:  -- blow around the house, I think that has a lot to do with your immune system.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, breaking yourself down, because you're not in a sterile environment.
L:  No.  No.
R:  And um, you're bound to get colds.  Thank goodness I can say I don't get as many -- I used to get it when I -- before the shots, I got it, like, six times a year, that I mean, it was severe, because I don't put medicine in my mouth and --
L:  Oh, I don't either.
R:  -- I don't even take an Aspirin and stuff --
L:  No.
R:  -- like that.
L:  No.  Uh-huh.  No.  I don't either.
R:  And, uh, but I was finding myself more -- and plus, I went from the city environment to a rural environment and I found, you know --
L:  You -- there is a rural -- I mean, I'm in the rural -- I'm in -- in the country also --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and is that cleaner for you?
R:  In some ways, it's cleaner, but in some ways, I'm more susceptible, uh, to things I wasn't susceptible --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the city because of the pollen --
L:  Pollen.
R:  -- and the trees and the flowers, so that -- that brought on a lot of reactions.  Uh, and I'm basically, uh, a home kind of therapy person.  I --
L:  Yes.
R:  It takes a lot for me to go to a doctor and --
L:  Oh, me too.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- say, "Fix it up" because I give it a while before I go there.  I have to be almost, like --
L:  Then you and I have a lot in common.
R:  Yeah.  We may be of the same era.
L:  I wait it out.  Pardon me?
R:  We may be of the same age era, that's what it is.
L:  Oh, uh, okay.  Um, I can disclose my age.  I'm not ashamed of it.  I turned fifty one --
R:  See, I'm --
L:  -- in February.
R:  I'm fifty four.
L:  Okay, then we are.
R:  So we're baby boomers.  [LAUGH].
L:  I think -- [LAUGH].  We're -- I've seen -- I've -- uh, in my past, oh yes --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I would -- I would, um, an Advil for this, um, a blah, blah, blah for that.  Well, I got so that the last Advil I took was probably eight years ago and I developed --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- hi- and I developed hives.  I am a highly --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- allergic to Advil and --
R:  Medica- 
L:  -- many, many, many pain relievers that the doctor -- the doctors prescribe.
R:  I can't -- I have to -- I take very little pain relievers because --
L:  I --
R:  -- I -- I would be sleeping all day.  I'm, you know --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- they have to cut it in half or a quarter of it.
L:  Oh, yes.  I -- I --
R:  Even when I'm --
L:  I understand.
R:  -- when I'm sick with a cold and they have to give me --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- medicine, it's got to be of a lower level because --
L:  It's good, though.  I think yeah, that's good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I used to think a little is good, more is better, but I learned through my experience that a little is fine and you work your way out.  Take care of the small --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you know, if that's not enough, then fine, I still have the option of a little more.
R:  Well, didn't your mother have all these weird sayings about if -- if you do this --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- you get well with this and if you do that --
L:  Oh, and you know?  You know, there's a lot -- there is a lot to it.
R:  Right.  Because I know my grandmother's Italian and --
L:  Mine, too.
R:  -- she --
L:  Mine -- mine was.  [LAUGH].
R:  And she would go out in the yard and take these herbs and if I had a cold, she would say to -- 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- me, "Oh, you gotta chop this up and you gotta put it in -- in tea and --"
L:  Or --
R:  "-- and this is what you gotta do", and I'd say --
L:  And do you know, don't you wish you would of listened closer?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Oh, my goodness me, too.
R:  Whatever kind of illness I had, she had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some sort of home remedy. "Don't worry about it.  Let's do this", you let -- you know, even with a cold, she has mustard plasters and --
L:  Yeah, I was just going to say --
R:  -- she had --
L:  -- the mustard plaster, but okay, how do you feel about your attitude has a lot -- a lot to do with how you feel?
R:  Well, I think so.  I think if you --
L:  I do.
R:  -- have a good life, and you treat yourself well and you take care of yourself --
L:  Right.  It -- and your attitude towards other people and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's almost like --
R:  You gotta be in harmony.
L:  the -- yes.  It -- it's like --
R:  Your body's gotta be in harmony, too.
L:  -- what you put --
