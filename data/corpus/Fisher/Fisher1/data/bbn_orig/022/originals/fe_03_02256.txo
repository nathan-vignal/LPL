L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- season -- the seasons change, you know.
L:  Yeah?
R:  It's no big deal, you know.
L:  I would think Florida would be pretty good for that, is it?
R:  No, it isn't.
L:  No?
R:  We have a real -- I think we have the highest pollen rate ever.
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  I think.  I'm not for sure.
L:  Yes?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And is it worse, like, this time a year in fall?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know a lot a people around here talk about, you know, hay fever and all that type thing, but I guess I've been fortunate, I've never had too much of it but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which I'm --
R:  No, but --
L:  -- glad.
R:  --you're lucky then!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It is one miserable feeling once you get a sinus attack.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it lasts for -- it usually lasts a week.
L:  Yes?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, so what they were saying, do you do anything -- do you take any kind of medication or just kinda wait it out?
R:  Ah, I take medication and wait it out [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, gosh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You know, over the counter, like --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- Advil or --

R:  -- ah, or, um, and Oraleave[?] sinus --
L:  Okay.

L:  Yeah, that sounds awful, ugh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So do you kinda have to deal with that for like, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just a few months out of every year?
R:  Oh, it's -- it's every year.  It's --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- not a few months.  It's like throughout the whole entire year.
L:  [SIGH] Have you, um --
R:  Even in the wintertime too.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's awful.  'Cause, yeah, it never gets real cold down there, I guess, huh?
R:  It get -- it gets cold.
L:  Yeah?
R:  But it -- it's not cold enough to snow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's no fun [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] We get the hailstorms, you know --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- hurricanes and all that mess.
L:  Ye- -- well, what part of Florida?  Are you like real far south or more towards the northern part?
R:  Um, north, um, I'm Palm Coast.
L:  Okay.
R:  So that's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, like you're heading -- it's forty five minutes to Jacksonville.
L:  Okay.  Oh, wow, everybody comes to you for spring break [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, Daytona Beach.  They don't come here to the actual --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Palm Coast, see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see, Daytona Beach is about thirty minutes --
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  -- from where I live.
L:  Have you lived around there your whole life?
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  Okay.
R:  Came here when I was fifteen.
L:  Okay.  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I guess, as far as being sick, I'm usually pretty lucky.  I -- I'm usually pretty healthy, although I've got, um, three young kids now and I -- I have noticed that they seem to get a lot of things, especially in the winter and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I always seem to catch some of that [SIGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So that's not good but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, it minor type stomach flu, colds --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that type thing, so at least it's over quickly [SIGH], but ... what do they say?  As far as [SIGH] taking medica- if I have a cold, I usually pretty much wait it out, although sometimes I do take the cold medications.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they make me feel really weird [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  You know, kinda spaced out.
R:  Yeah, I take -- I take the medicine -- sometimes if -- if it's too bad, I take it during --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the day, but most of the time it's before I go to bed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I won't wake up with one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know have one middle of the night and then --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- if I have to wake --
L:  -- like to do that --
R:  -- up on --
L:  -- too, take it before I go to sleep, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopefully I can sleep well at least [LAUGH].
R:  But sometimes -- and on top of this I take it during the day.  I have to have something in my stomach.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can't take it on a upset -- you know, empty stomach.  It upsets your stomach.
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's true [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That's no good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh.  So let's see.  What else did they say?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think we kind of covered it [LAUGH].
R:  Pretty much, we've gotta --
L:  Oh.  Have you done more of these calls?
R:  Huh?
L:  Have you done more of these phone calls?
R:  Yeah, today.
L:  Yep.
R:  This is my first day, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's three.  You're only allowed three.
L:  Yes?  This is my third one too.
R:  Ooh, that's cool [LAUGH], so ...
L:  Yeah.  So it's kinda interesting to, you know, the topics and talking to people all over the place [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], oh.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Now how did you find out about it?
R:  Through the internet [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you find out on the big, big savings boards?
R:  No, I found it on Ask dot com.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I've heard of that site but I didn't find out about it there, so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  Neat.  They must --
R:  It was --
L:  -- have --
R:  -- I think Ask dot com is a little bit faster than -- I have MSN.
L:  Yes?
R:  I think it's a little bit faster --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- to find information.  Just a little --
L:  Isn't it --
R:  -- bit --
L:  -- amaz- -- they must have thousands of people doing this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But at the same time, you have to ask it in the form of a question.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Okay, yeah.  I think I used to go there all -- it used to be called Ask Jeeves or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think?
R:  It's still called that but the sh- in -- they shortened it out --
L:  They shortened it out to --
R:  -- to --
L:  -- just Ask?
R:  -- just Ask dot com.
L:  Well, that's easier to type in [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's neat.  So are you doing this now from home or work or where?
R:  Um, home.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] -- well, some people say they do it from work and I think, "Wow, that must be a nice job" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Just don't get caught [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When I was working, I couldn't have done it [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, but anyway, let's see.  I don't -- well, do you have family?  Does your family get sick very often?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But do they have some of the same allergy type things that you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  It sorta like, it goes around the family.
L:  Yeah?
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, do you ever take --
R:  Inherited from my mother.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She gets nose bleeds and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- coughs and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- then sneeze and ...
L:  Yes.  Ooh.
R:  And puffy eyes, watery eyes, itchy throat.
L:  Well, I've heard 'em say a lot a times, if you have a bloody nose or s- that that's sinus related so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ew, yuck.
R:  I don't have the bloody nose.  I just have the, um, sore throat, puffy eyes, itchy eyes --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and coughing.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And -- and you know, headaches.
L:  Yeah, but -- that would get real old [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause if I feel that way for a day, it's kinda bad, but if you were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feeling that way for weeks on end, that's ew.
R:  [MN] Oh --
L:  Well, have you ever taken like -- is it Claritin, is that one of those allergy medi --
R:  No, I -- ah, Claritin has too many side effects --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm afraid, because I take also, ah, I am hypertensive.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, um, l- high blood pressure, say.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And -- and it's little too s- ah, strong.  You had to h- take certain medicines that won't interact with my blood pressure --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- medicine.
L:  -- okay.
R:  If it does, it'll mess up, you know.
L:  Ok- -- well, I have been reading lately about that.  I've never taken it, but isn't that the one that just recently became over the counter and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- used to be --
R:  And --
L:  prescription?
R:  -- it had too many side effects --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- to it.  Yeah.  Before it came over a -- um, before over counter, it had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was telling on the commercial how many side effects it had.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was too much.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So I just take -- ah, used to take Benadryl, but my system got immune to it. Now I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- taking Aleve[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] It's working --
L:  That must be --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- good stuff.  My mother in law swears by Aleve.  She takes -- I mean, she takes it for headaches just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- regular muscle aches and she says it can almost always nip it in the bud so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm remembering that [LAUGH].

L:  Oh.
R:  It's so nice.  Hills on top a hills.
L:  Yeah, that's what I --
R:  Ooh --
L:  -- I just think of it being so pretty 'cause, I mean, I love Indiana.  I've always lived here, but it's just --

L:  -- so flat and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just kinda boring, you [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].

R:  Oh, well, it's not too close.  Pleasure Island and all those are --
L:  Well, that's true,
