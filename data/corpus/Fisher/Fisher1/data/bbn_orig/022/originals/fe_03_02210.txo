L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Kay.
R:  Well, hi, Kay.  My name is Di.
L:  Hi.  Ah, food, huh? [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is the first time I've done this.  I don't know if --
R:  Oh, me --
L:  -- you've done it before.
R:  No, this is the first time I've done it too [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Well, we'll both get through it together, then.  Um, [NOISE] wh-  -- I guess we've gotta do where everybody would rather eat.  Um --
R:  Yeah, in or out?
L:  Um, I think I like 'em both the same.  I wonder if that's an option.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  'Cause I can get prime rib out, but I can't make it at home.  So --
R:  Do you cook much?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you cook much?
L:  Um, not really, no.  I'm single and I have -- you know, it's just me and my dog, and so it's kinda, you know, hit or miss when -- if I have company, I'll cook, but -- how 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, I don't cook very much either.  I didn't cook -- well like, I like eating in, 'cause it's cheaper, and I think it's healthier, but like, when I eat out, you know, like, it's quicker and it's easier and [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Yeah, but I don't know what they put in the foods, 'cause my -- my feeling is that they butter it up and there's a lot of like, oils and stuff like that, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I gain a lot of weight when I eat out.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's -- well, it's true you have more control than you do at -- at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, actually, I was just making some egg salad when I got the phone call, so --
R:  [LAUGH].  That sounds good.
L:  You know, I make those kind of things for, ah, work, just because it's cheaper than going out every day.  I don't know -- where do you live?  What city?
R:  Oh, I live in Dallas.
L:  Oh, jeeze, I'm in --
R:  But yeah --
L:  -- I'm in New York [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I'm in Manhattan.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow, that's cool.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  And we're --
R:  And we're at probably the op- opposite poles of the earth [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  Like, New York and Dallas [LAUGH].
L:  My sister used to live down in, um, Flowermount.
R:  Is that in Texas?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a suburb of, um, Dallas, as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you know where Grapevine is?
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  It's the ne- -- it's right there, beside that [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I'm not that familiar with Dallas.  I actually come from Arkansas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm Minnesotan, transplanted, so --
R:  [LAUGH].  All the way to Manhattan.  Wow.
L:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  Um --
R:  When you -- do you like to eat out like, at a nice restaurant?  Or --
L:  Well, i- [SIGH] -- it's so different here than anywhere else in the world, because every -- literally, every restaurant delivers.
R:  Mm.
L:  From --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, McDonalds delivers, here.  And --
R:  No way.
L:  -- you know, diners, ah, up scale restaurants.  They all will deliver, because, you know, people, once they get home, they -- they -- they either want to stay home, or they want to eat something and go out.  So, it's amaz- -- it's just amazing to me because I lived in Minnesota for so long, you know.  You never had delivery of anything except pizza [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, mhm.  We have the same as -- yeah.
L:  So, that's, you know, a big adjustment for me.  [LAUGH] It is a good thing, but it can also --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- be a bad thing, 'cause, you know, by the time you order it, and then you have to tip the guy, you know, you've spent fifteen bucks on dinner, and, ah, -- and --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- all you've done is get something in your house.  You know, so, um, yeah, I don't know how often -- how often I actually eat out, or d- -- have it delivered in.  I'd say at least once a week I have something delivered, but, um, that's about it, so --
R:  I always wondered about like, New York City and like -- like, actually being in the city, like where the supermarkets are.  'Cause like, you never see like --
L:  Yep [LAUGH].
R:  -- the movies and stuff, or that there are actually supermarkets somewhere -- anywhere?
L:  Yeah, but -- and actually when I used to visit here, I did the same thing.  I just would look at people and go, "How co- -- how do you -- do they live here?" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  "H- how do you get just s- something simple, like food".  And, um, once you get in the neighborhoods they do have, ah, chains of, um, grocery stores.  There's the, ah, Food Emporium, which is kind of a upward scale, um, grocery store, and then there -- the other two that are big here are Degastino's[?] and Gristidi's[?] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- which are kinda, you know, down with, um, not a Food Lion, but, you know [LAUGH], cause I know there are Food Lions there, but, um, maybe round the Albertson's level.
R:  Oh, okay.  Albertson's I can relate to [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  So, um, I remember that was at my sister's.  Um, so you -- I mean, we -- you do have access to grocery stores, but m- -- you know, not everyone owns a car.  I don't.  So, you end up either buying only what you can carry home, or you can --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have it delivered for another three dollars, and then a tip.  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, that's interesting.  I never really realised that about that.  How you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you probably like, you could have like, maybe, four bags of stuff.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes I just figure I'm just going to get everything right now, and have it all delivered, at once, and just be done.  You know, for a month of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, unless I need bread or milk, or whatever.  But, um, i- -- honestly, most of the time, I just try to just get enough that I can carry, 'cause it's -- I just hate to add on to already sky high prices here.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Like, aren't you guys don't have like, Sam's[?] Club?  I don't know if you -- like, your sister probably shops -- it's like a huge like, kind of like, um, warehouse --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- kind of --
L:  Yep.  They had one -- when I lived in Minnesota, we had Sam's Club, and --
R:  In New York I imagine you can't just like -- I do --
L:  There's one on the outskirts.  Um, there's a mall like, probably about twenty five miles north of here.  And it's got a Target, and a Home Depot, and it -- it might be a BJ's or it's Cosco[?], one or the other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I have a sister that lives upstate.  The one that lived in Dallas, actually, and -- and, um, when she comes and gets me, I'm like, "I need to go to Target's. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I need it so badly".  They only have it -- it -- they have like, two K-Marts in this whole city.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, um, and the Target's that they have are, you know, a subway ride away, and you -- then you run in, again, to how much can I carry? [LAUGH].
R:  Right, right.
L:  Or you could take a cab and spend more money than you would save by going there.  It's crazy, so ...  So, anyway, I suppose we're suppose to talk about you're favorite meal.
R:  Um, favorite meal, like, if I had to make it, it's probably something really easy that -- to make, like spaghetti or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I know --
L:  Yeah, see, ah, mine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at home would be [NOISE] roast beef.
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.  You said roast -- did you say roast beef?
L:  Um, prime rib, out.
R:  Oh, prime rib, out.
L:  Yeah.  Roast beef, in.
R:  We used to --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  So you're like, a meat woman.
L:  I really am not, but when -- I mean, I very rarely like, order chicken sandwiches or anything like that, I'm more, you know, I'll eat [inaudible].  I don't really like a lot of meat, but if I'm out to a really nice place, that would be what I -- I would order.  You know, is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- prime rib.  I'm not a seafood person, and, you know --
R:  Oh, neither am I, yeah.  I guess ordering out, I would order, like, I am a sandwich person, I'm a deli person.  I like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like sandwiches and soups and salads on the side, and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, I don't know, I mean -- how are we supposed to know when we're done? [LAUGH].
R:  I think they, oh, I think they --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- tell us.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I think in the beginning it said it would tell us when like, time was up.
L:  Okay.  I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was so stunned that I got called, 'cause I just signed up for it today.
R:  Oh, did you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  Um, Craigslist?  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  Oh, ah, what's that?
L:  It's -- there's a great website that my yoga teacher told me about when I was looking --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- for an apartment.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's -- you should write it down.  It's craigslist dot org --
R:  How do you spell that?
L:  C.R.A. --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I.G. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- S.L.I.S.T. --
R:  L.I. -- okay.
L:  -- dot org.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they have on it -- that -- they have -- it started in San Francisco, so the first one -- time you go there it will, um, come up to a San Francisco page.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, they have other cities that you can go and find information out, or jobs, or whatever.  Um, it's just unreal, it's -- I've never seen anything like it [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  You know -- and they have part time jobs etcetera jobs, they have, you know, chat rooms, they have, um, apartments for rent, and just stuff -- an- and legitimate businesses around here use it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that the listing is free.  So, I don't know how he makes his money, but, um, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But --
R:  I'm sure he finds a way.
L:  Yeah.  It's just, you know -- and -- and, um, another thing -- like tonight I just did a focus group that I found on there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for an hour and a half of my time, they give you a hundred and twenty five dollars.
R:  Wow, that's amazing.
L:  I know.
R:  Very good information to have.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  I found out about, um, this study through Fat Wallet dot com.  Have you heard of that website?
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  It's like, um, they -- people just pu- -- it's, um, a message board, basically, and people post like, great deals they've found online or at
