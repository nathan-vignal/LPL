R:  Hi, my name's Brian.
L:  Hi, I'm Tammy.
R:  Hi.  How you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.
L:  Good.  Well, this is my first one.  Yours?
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].  Well, I don't know.  Seasons are changing here, so we've been suffering from allergies.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm actually getting a bit of a cold myself right now.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think we're going on two weeks here of this allergy nonsense.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness, yes.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, it's -- it's been raining a lot here so that -- when it rains it tends to make me a bit ill [NOISE].
L:  Oh, I think we could use some rain in our area.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It might help c- calm down of this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff that's in the air.
R:  [NOISE] Um, yeah, so what do you do when you get sick?
L:  Hm, well, I've -- I've taken some -- some allergy medications which --
R:  Like -- like Claratyne or something?
L:  I didn't take Claratyne.  I tried, ah [LIPSMACK], I tried Tylenol allergy sinus.
R:  Okay. Yeah, that -- that's not bad.
L:  Yeah, it was okay.  It didn't really -- it helps when I'm not real bad.  If I'm real bad, it doesn't help much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you find anything that helps you?
R:  Um, well, I -- yeah, I got Claratyne 'cause it's -- you don't need a prescription anymore.  You can buy it at, like, CVS or something, or a drugstore.
L:  I've never tried it.  And it works really well?
R:  It does.  It's really expensive though.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's like ten bucks for five pills.  It's kind of a lot.
L:  But one lasts all day?
R:  Ah, twelve hours, I think.
L:  Okay.
R:  But yeah, it works -- it works well and it doesn't really make you weird and tired.
L:  Well, I'd be willing to pay that [LAUGH] to feel --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- to feel good.  It's like that ex- other ex- -- any expensive medicine.  If it really helps you feel better it's worth it.
R:  It's worth it, right.
L:  I'm trying -- oh.  [LAUGH]  They -- they asked if -- if you go to the doctor -- they think a cold by seven days if you don't go to the doctor; in a week if you do [LAUGH].  Probably right.  I don't think anybody can get rid of your cold.
R:  Right.  It's the same thing.  Seven days in a week.
L:  I -- I used some really strong Halls cough drops too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some of those ice blue ones.
R:  Okay.
L:  Those help sometimes when you're just real stuffy and -- and can't get clear.
R:  Right.  There's this stuff that I got.  It's, um, [NOISE] Zycam[?], something like that.  It's supposed to -- if you're getting sick, you -- you like inject it into your nose like a liquid gel or something [SIGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  And if you do it, it's like echinacea or something.  It's supposed to make -- if you get a cold, it goes away quicker or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if you feel like you're getting a cold then [SIGH], um, it supposedly prevents you from getting a cold.
L:  I'll have to look for that.
R:  But --
L:  I think I fell behind.  I was out of the States for about a year and a half.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I -- I don't think I have caught up on all this new information.
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't know that Claratyne was --
R:  Yeah, I think that just happened, actually.  A couple months ago.  But, ah --
L:  Trying to think of what -- what else we did this week besides be miserable [LAUGH].  I -- you know, when Tylenol allergy sinus wasn't working well enough for me, I actually just took some Dayquil[?] and it seemed to help more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even though it's not -- even though it's supposed to be for cold and flu and I had allergies.
R:  Yeah, sometimes the allergy medicine like Tylenol and stuff like that doesn't really help as much as like, the cold medicine does, the non-drowsy cold medicine.
L:  Well, I think -- I didn't used to believe that changing seasons could make you sick, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I moved here from the Caribbean and when I got here in January it was so bitter cold.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we all got sick.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  We all got real sick.  We're in Ohio right now.
R:  Okay.
L:  And coming into this real, real cold weather, it -- we all really got down bad.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- and now that the season's changing again [LAUGH], it's happening again, so maybe there's something to it.
R:  You know, I never really experienced a dramatic change in seasons because I grew up in California.  But I live in New York now and there's very dramatic changes in the seasons and it's really affected me.  Um, like when it starts to get cold at the winter, I always get sick and, even when it turned to spring, I got sick.  Just like every time there's a change in the weather.
L:  I don't remember it happening when I was a kid and I was here in the northeast when I was a kid.  But then I lived in Texas and California too and I noticed that when I lived out there, I -- I did not get sick.  But definitely here, we do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We tend to get sick when those seasons change.  And this time it's been even worse.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can't even remember everything they said at the beginning of the call [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I d- I don't know what this is for and why they need you to talk ten minutes about a topic.  But, ah, what are you gonna do?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, illness.
R:  Ah, drink tea too, that helps -- helps --
L:  I've been -- I've been drinking a lot of tea, tea with lemon --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I can't stand tea with honey in it.
R:  Yeah, green tea's good for you.  It's got like, uh, anti-oxidants or something like that.
L:  I haven't tried that.  That's kind of a new thing since I got back too.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I see it everywhere now, but I thought it was some kind of diet thing.  I didn't know it was for --
R:  No, it's just a different type of tea.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's good for you.
L:  I'll have to try that too.
R:  Um, they have like, green tea with echinacea too, which is good.
L:  I've taken echinacea before and it did seem to help.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it does [SIGH].  [PAUSE] Um, let's see.
L:  Well, if I had a remedy for being able to breathe when you -- when you -- when you lay down, that would be good too [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had to sleep in a chair one night.
R:  Oh, seriously?
L:  Yeah, I was just so stuffy.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I couldn't do anything about it.  I was afraid I was gonna have to go to the doctor and be irrigated.  Have you ever had to do that?
R:  Ah, I never have.
L:  Oh, my gosh, it's terrible.  The first time I went and they irrigated my sinuses, what they do is put a hose in one side of your nose --
R:  Ugh.
L:  And they run water through --
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- your head.
R:  No.
L:  And it pushes everything up the other side of your nose and your mouth.  It's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- really painful.
R:  I bet.
L:  And really gross [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  No, I've never had to go through that.
L:  Well, I was really afraid that I was gonna have to go do that and it's not fun.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine [SIGH].  I haven't even been to the -- I don't have insurance so I -- I don't go to the doctor --
L:  I --
R:  -- when I get sick.
L:  -- I don't have any here.  I have insurance in South America.  My husband's still there with his job.  But I don't have any here either.
R:  Right [SIGH].  So I just try to cure myself if I'm sick.  Usually it's nothing too bad.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  As long it's not like SARS or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I guess if it was that we'd know it.
R:  I don't know though.  A lot of people in New York have it.
L:  Really?
R:  Thirty people or something like that have it in New York.
L:  But I think what I've had has only been allergies this time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I haven't had the coughing or the, um, the other miserableness that can come with a cold.  Just, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sinus problems and the sneezing, so.
R:  Yeah, I don't really get that that bad. I get the -- more like a sore throat and like, uh --
L:  Well, I have --
R:  -- congestion.
L:  -- a little bit of a scratchy throat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Worse in the mornings than at night.
R:  I find that if I sleep with the window open at night, sometimes that really makes me -- like my sinuses and my throat are sore [SIGH].
L:  Well, I would guess that it would because if it's allergies you've got, you're letting all that stuff in all night.
R:  Right.
L:  That actually makes a lot of sense.  I never thought about that before.
R:  Have you tried an ionizer?
L:  No, what's that?
R:  [LAUGH] It's a little machine.  It -- it's similar to an air purifier, but they -- but it's a -- specifically an ionizer.  It does something to the -- I -- I can't remember positive or negative ions, whatever it is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that it adds to the air, but I've 'em and I did notice that when we used 'em, it made a big difference.
L:  Really?   Yeah, I'll have to look into that.
R:  I bought one from QVC because I wasn't sure if, um, if it was really going to be a good thing and they let you use any product for thirty days and return it --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- if you don't like it.  And I thought, "Well, you can't lose with that".
L:  Right.
R:  So I bought one from there -- for there, really for my daughter because she has problems at night.
L:  Right.
R:  And it really, really helped her a lot.  I -- I noticed it the first night immediately.  She slept so much better.
L:  Huh [SIGH].
R:  But that's a thought too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's not something they talk about a lot when they talk about -- I guess 'cause it's -- they can sell medicines over and over but you only need to buy an ionizer once.
L:  True.
R:  [LAUGH] They don't make as much money that way.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I'll have to look into that and get one [SIGH] 'cause that -- that's what's the worst, is waking up in the morning and just being all congested.
R:  And I just read something else and I haven't tried it but they say if you take some horseradish and some vinegar --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I got myself a nice bottle of horseradish.
R:  That -- that'll -- the vinegar, I forget.  The vinegar kills, ah, bacteria.
L:  Okay.
R:  And the horseradish opens up your sinuses [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  So [LAUGH] ...
L:  It does that -- like hot Chinese mustard too is good [SIGH].  It's basically the same thing.  It's got like wasabi in it, which is horseradish [SIGH]. [PAUSE]
R:  I thought that was pretty unique.  I couldn't imagine that a lot of
