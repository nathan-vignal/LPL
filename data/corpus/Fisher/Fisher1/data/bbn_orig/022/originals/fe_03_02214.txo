R:  Hello.  I'm Jim.
L:  Hi.  I'm Bob.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hi, hi Jim.
R:  Hi, Bob.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Good.  And what are we -- we're talking about food?
R:  Yes.  We're talking about food.
L:  Okay.  So, you've got restaurants, uh, and um, home cooking.
R:  Yeah.  Um.  Why don't you start?  Ah, which one do you like better?
L:  Um, at home.
R:  Yes.  At home is much better, of course.  Um, I -- I think it is better because not only at home every meal is made individually, ah, and it is made to the full attention of whoever is cooking it, the -- be it wife, girlfriend, mother, ah, grandmother even.  Or fathers.  But also since the ho- food cooked at home is prepared by somebody you probably know or at least are acquainted with, I think they kind of know what you would like better and perhaps could customize a meal to your, um, specifications.  What do you think?
L:  Well, I like the home cooking meals myself because of the fact of, um, you do- you don't know, hm, at the restaurant what type of chemical type additives they use in the food.  Such as, I guess, what do you call that?  MSG and all kind of different, uh, chemicals [LAUGH] which to into the food to so called make it taste better.  And you don't know what's in there.  Um, some of the restaurants [COUGH] do advertise they don't put any chemical agents in the, uh, food but ah, I don- and I've worked in restaurants before and I know the, um, the sanitary conditions in a restaurant are not that great. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I -- I don't know if you've seen the book, uh, Fast Food Nation?  It -- it's really revealing about what's -- what they do in restaurants, such as fast food restaurants, such as McDonalds and um, some of their food is genetically mutated, like the Chicken McNuggets and some of the other food are -- it's just basically a +concoction of chemicals and add -- with add a fe- a few drops of flavor to make it taste like it's real food.
L:  Right.  So, the restaurant world is not that good for me and, ah, home cooking, ah, I don't buy organic food, so to speak, but ah, [LAUGH] I'm getting near to that point, to start buying food that's not, uh, um, you know, especially meats and chicken and stuff that are not fed, uh, chemically also.
R:  Yeah, um.  Food cooked at home mostly should be, um, more satis- satisfying to the person because, um, not -- not only it's probably cooked by somebody you know and they probably know what you -- you probably -- you want, and even if you don't, you could tell 'em what exactly do you want.  A little bit more salt, a little less sugar.  Th- the restaurants, they're not going to know anything.  They're just gonna crank out meals, uh, like assembly line meals, basically.  They just -- everything exactly the same.  No different.  It's pretty -- it's pretty generic and there's no personal touch to it, of course.
L:  No.  There are a few restaurants back in -- I used to live in New York and they did have some good Italian restaurants years ago in New York.  Who -- it was really home cooking and not the processed type food they got today.  But the -- the quality of the food has changed because everybody wants to eat faster and supposedly the food tastes better. [LAUGH].  I don't know how that could be, but they try to make it taste better, I guess.  But I can't eat any of the -- like Burger King or McDonalds.  I can't eat that food.  Can't digest it.  
R:  Yeah, that sounds familiar.  
L:  My -- my stomach doesn't work on it.
R:  Yes.  Some of the quality of the food has been on -- [inaudible] for quite a while now.  There used to be actual restaurants with, um, with actual people, chefs, who -- who have skills, basically, and now look at it.  Very few restaurants act- actually have real chefs, so to speak, even those proc- self proclaimed gourmet restaurants which is -- I -- I don't know if you have them over there, but here in Los Angeles we have an expresses.  Well, uh, they claim to be, um, gourmet Chinese food.  Well, I know for a fact since one of my friend's fathers own a chain of them, they hire Mexican cooks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who know nothing about Chinese food at all.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's pretty sad.
L:   Yeah.  I was in -- where was it?  Kansas City, Missouri, and they had, um, one of the best Italian restaurants that was there.  It was a chain of restaurants, but they all cooked the food.  They had the directions on how to cook the food correctly, and they weren't Italian.  I believe they were probably Spanish origin, I think, but that didn't -- the food wasn't bad, to tell you the truth [LAUGH] it was real good.  When I asked the person, I said, "How do they do this?"  He said they make sure the ch- the -- the -- everybody go -- whoever cooks goes to school and they teach them how to cook exactly the way the company wants them to prepare the food.  And it was quite good.
R:  Yeah.  Um.  If --
L:  But I think it could be -- I think it's the, um, education wise, too.  Um, now that Italian place was -- even though it was a -- was a chain, it did have outstanding food, for an Italian, well, non -- non Italian people.  Let's put it that way.  They weren't Italian, but they were educated on how to, ah, cook the food.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, some restaurants, uh, here in LA, like in and out chains, they're -- they're over here in, uh, California and I believe Arizona.  Um, they are not a franchise restaurant although they're a chain.  Um, they're all owned by the same people and, um, all their food is, um, made quite well because not only I believe they, um, they have their own list of how to make it and they are all properly trained, but also I believe what they have are people who -- uh, they -- they're just like guests except they are paid to, uh, test, to, um, eat the food and see how -- uh, how on time the delivery is and, uh, how -- how well the food is cooked and everything and I believe in several other restaurants also have them, I think.  Jack in the Box have them.  They're called, um "mystery guests" if I'm not mistaken.  And I -- I think those really help to up the quality of food in restaurants to a certain standard, I guess.
L:  And Jack in the Box?  That used to be back East, but they went out of business back East.
R:  Oh, it's still everywhere over here, uh, on the West Coast.
L:  Huh.  Yeah --
R:  Every city has one.
L:  They had them in Connecticut.  I lived in Connecticut.  They had them in Connecticut, but then they all of a sudden, they disappeared.
R:  I -- I believe back in nineteen ninety four, nineteen ninety five, they had, uh, a little salmonella thing where some kids died because of --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It might of been that.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that really took the comp- hit the company really hard.  Uh, for three or four years, a lot of people just refused to eat at their place because of the infection.  But I -- I think it's a lot more clean- it's a lot cleaner now.  Um, I checked the restaurants around here and, um, they -- they look pretty clean compared to McDonalds, which is just a mess.
L:  [LAUGH] Old McDonalds.  Oh, goodness.  Yeah.  Well, I remember, ah, Jack in the Box, it wasn't too bad.  When it was -- when I had uh, one of their hamburgers, I guess it was pretty good.  That's going back quite -- quite a few years.  [LAUGH].  That's not that I remember exactly how it tastes, even, but as far as years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they had -- before they had, uh, what was the fast food restaurant was, what do they call that one?  It was twelve cents.  Oh, gee whiz.  I forget the name of it, but it was -- had holes in the hamburger.
R:  Holes in the hamburger?
L:  Yeah.  Castle.  Some kind of name, Castle.
R:  White Castle.  White Castle.
L:  Yeah, White Castle.  Right.  It had four holes in the top of it.  And the hamburger was about a, I guess, a quarter -- a quarter of an inch.  About a quarter of an inch thick.  Four holes in the hamburger.  Why they did that, I guess -- I suppose they cook fast or something.  And that's when I was growing up, that was the only fast food place in [LAUGH] in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Well, um --
L:  I think they still sell the White Castle.  I don't know if they still have the -- but they still sell them, sometimes frozen, I've seen in the store.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen a White Castle anywhere around Los Angeles or anywhere in California, too um, for certain, but what I have heard is that, um, because of the advent of McDonalds and Burger King, all those chains, um, they can't really compete with, um, on the national level so they've retreated basically back into the south.  I think Georgia and Arkansas, I know they still have some.  That's pretty much what I can, um -- I know for sure and um, a lot of people there still recommend them.  Just like in and out here.  Um, they're much better than the big chain ones, as far as I know.
L:  Yeah.  So, our agreement is eat home.  [LAUGH].  We're better off.
R:  Yes, eat home. [LAUGH] --
