R:  I'm Christina.
L:  Hi, I'm Dana.
R:  Hi.
L:  So.  We're gong to talk about food?
R:  Okay. [LAUGH].
L:  That's a tough question about what do you prefer.  Eating out or dining in?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  For me, it would depend.  I like to dine out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that I don't have to cook it and I don't have to clean it up.
R:  Right.
L:  And it might be something that I don't know how to prepare.
R:  Right.
L:  I do like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kind of a treat but sometimes it seems like a lot of effort to go out to eat.
R:  Right.
L:  Not to mention --
R:  Well, in my opinion, I prefer eating out.  I'm pretty lazy about cooking so --
L:  Are you? 
R:  I know for sure that, when I eat out it's going to be better than anything that I would make.  But, I also e- eating in is also pretty -- pretty nice because then at least you know you save money and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, I don't know.  Sometimes I just -- I get too lazy to dress up and go out.
L:  Yeah.  But sometimes eating out is fun though.  It does seem like a treat especially --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're going someplace you either really like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know you're really going to like it or maybe something new.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  So, um, I mean,  -- like I was watching a thing the other day on TV about like the health -- the health department.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, like how sometimes the health department doesn't exactly rate them correctly and then they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- were doing an expose on like restaurants that got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in LA --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like they were talking about stuff like readings.  Like you would get an A if you're very clean, B if --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're so-so clean and like they were talk -- they were showing A restaurants.  The inside and the kitchen.  It was so disgusting.  Like they -- they photographed -- they had, like a secret camera and um, they photographed people tak- -- like the chefs taking something out of the garbage and stuff and like it was so disgusting about that.  And, it's like when I eat at home I know that everything that I eat [LAUGH] is clean, you know?  Like I made it.
L:  That's true.
R:  If I drop it on the floor, I'm not going to eat it. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  You have the confidence of knowing your eating was sanitary.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I don't think I worry about that too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean I've gone into a place and left --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- going, ah, I don't think so.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  This doesn't look very clean to me.  Because that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- definitely important.  You could not enjoy a meal too much if -- if you didn't feel it was um, clean.
R:  Right.  Absolutely.
L:  I think one thing I do like about eating out is that it's always presented really nicely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's on a dish and it's arranged so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe you'd have a little parsley, or whatever.
R:  [LAUGH].  Right.
L:  Nothing that you'd do at home.
R:  Right, right.  Absolutely.  And like, as far as eating out, like I also feel like it -- it's definitely beneficial with nowadays how families don't really sit down a lot and have dinner together.  Like you have to sit down and eat together if you go to a restaurant.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, like you can't go and watch TV or play in your room or whatever.  Like you --
L:  That is true.
R:  -- have to do it together and be a family or be together.  Whoever you're with.
L:  That -- that's right.  Because especially after you order and you're sitting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- waiting for your meal to be prepared --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible]
R:  It's a real social experience, more --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- than like sitting at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know how much more I can talk about this. [LAUGH].
L:  I do, actually, like it and it doesn't happen very much when we do go out to dinner with somebody else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like you go with another family or go with --
R:  Oh yeah, absolutely.
L:  -- friends.
R:  I'm not married.  I have a boyfriend and like I really enjoy going out to dinner with him.  Like, I like staying at home and making stuff but -- and like it -- it's fun to make stuff together but I -- I don't know -- like I feel -- I feel -- I like it better because then it feels more like a real date when you go out.
L:  Sure.  I can see that.
R:  You know, like -- like yeah, it's fun to have him come over and we can cook together and it's very much a bonding experience but then it's just sort of us hanging out, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it's not dating, it's not us being like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know.  I'm not sure how to expand on that, but.
L:  It's not an everyday thing, it's more of a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- special thing.
R:  Right, exactly.  It's a dress up and look pretty and then go out.  [SIGH] So, yeah.
L:  That's true.  That changes it.  Also --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- I was just thinking.  You get to go out.  Everybody gets to order what they want, assuming --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's on the menu.  It's not like making one meal, even like for you and your boyfriend.  Say you really wanted spaghetti --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you made it and he's like "ugh".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, he's not really caring for that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can go out.  You can order spaghetti.  He can order a hamburger or whatever he wants.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  That is one thing I really enjoy because there is things my family doesn't necessarily enjoy that I do, so if we go out I can, like, ho, I can finally have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, whatever it is, vegetarian lasagna or something.
R:  Right.  And I also -- I don't know, as far as like I am trying to be more health conscious lately.  Like I used to go out all the time, to eat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I never cooked and I just feel like I gained so much weight doing that 'cause you don't know what people put in it.  They can put --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like ten pounds of butter in it.  You would have no idea even though it tastes good.  
L:  Sure.
R:  But y- you're more able to control like what you eat when you cook at home.
L:  I think that's true and you -- you know, they tend to -- they give you the full plate of food and it seems like portions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are getting bigger.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  And you're just sitting there.  You have nothing else to do so you just kind of keep eating off your plate unless you make a decision, "OK, I'm only eating this much of this --"
R:  Right.
L:   "-- and I'm done".
R:  Right.  But normally that doesn't happen.  Normally, I clean my plate [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you're busy talking and enjoying yourself and before you know it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's happened.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes, it is nice at a restaurant 'cause for me, I'm married, I'm the mom --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to have a [inaudible] ask me is everything okay?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Would you like anything else?  Let me clear --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that dish for you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm really lazy at washing dishes.  I had to get an apartment that had a dishwasher. [LAUGH] otherwise --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- we would never have eaten at home.
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But even if it's not made right, like say you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I cook something at home for my husband and he doesn't really care for it.  We try a new recipe and it doesn't taste that well.  You know?  That's dinner.
R:  Right.
L:  But in a restaurant if something is not prepared to his satisfaction, it's nothing on me.
R:  Right.
L:  He can say, "You know what, I -- we need to send this back".
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause his steak is too rare --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or what have you.  You know?
R:    Uh-huh.
L:  My feelings aren't hurt.
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't make it.
R:  [LAUGH].  And he can have exactly what he wants.
L:  Have it the way you want it.  Right?
R:  Right, exactly.  I can really hear that.
L:  But dining out, I think, like you said, the specialness of it, it's different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like the variety.  Just you can go have something different.
R:  Right.
L:  And the ease of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't have to cook it or clean it up or shop for it or anything.
R:  Oh, yes, absolutely.
L:  But there is the cost of it like you said, and also not knowing.  Well, we're going to assume everybody is sanitary, but --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, not knowing if -- I mean, yes, it could be vegetables but like you said, do they saute it in ten pounds of butter, or?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or what would it be?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I think they also said, what's your favorite meal or what was your --
R:  Oh really?  Okay.  Um, like my favorite meal or my favorite kind of cuisine?
L:  I don't remember.  Um.
R:  Okay, well, I can address both.  My favorite meal would have to be corned beef and cabbage.
L:  Really?
R:  My favorite kind of cuisine is Japanese.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are those like so far apart from each other or what?
R:  I know [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I love Japanese food.  I -- I just think it's unbelievable but it's so expensive, that's the problem.  Like I never have Japanese food.  It's like --
L:  I've only had Japanese food a few times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have to say it's not my favorite of the few times that I've had it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I actually like all kinds of foods.
R:  Really?
L:  I don't know.  I guess my -- an ideal meal for me if I tried to visualize it, is there would be a nice salad with it, there would be some very nice vegetable thing on the side.  Some kind of zucchini, mushroom and squash.  Something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that my family doesn't normally like that I could have and probably --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some kind of yummy pasta.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With a lot of cheese [LAUGH] on it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Um.  And maybe some garlic bread.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Or some kind of [inaudible] bread like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But then I also -- I don't know.  That's a tough one and I don't -- and I guess that's one thing too, about eating at a restaurant, is there's all that -- Like if you made spaghetti at home, you might not necessarily make garlic bread and make this and make that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- all the things you would get at a restaurant.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is maybe, a good thing.  But --
R:  Right.  Garlic bread.
L:  You wouldn't be having all that --
R:  With the ten pounds of butter that you can't see.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  Yes, although sometimes there's certain things I'm not very confident in preparing, like seafood.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah.  Oh me, neither.
L:  So.
R:  I cook it for ever 'til it's too tough.
L:  Yeah, so you know, in a way, I like to go out for seafood because then I have a -- more confidence I'm really going to enjoy it and it's going to be prepared correctly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I've asked the butcher block guy, the seafood guy, like okay, "Now, what do I do with this?"
R:  Right.
L:  And what -- "I mean, if I was to buy it you know, what do I do with this?"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How would I prepare this and they've been fairly helpful and there've been a few things that I've bought that I think --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there's certain things I like to go out for rather than make like Greek food or um, seafood.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Have you ever --
R:  I've never made Greek food.
L:  Have you ever tried to prepare any Japanese food at home?
R:  Um, well, my mom and I did try before and it was pretty fun to try to make it together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it just takes a long time and you need to be really careful, especially if you want the raw fish with it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like you have to be so careful how you prepare it otherwise you are going to end with salmonella poisoning and that is not fun. [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, like -- so generally if I do want Japanese food and sushi and stuff, then I would have to go out, like it takes too much time.  It would take hours --
L:  Okay, right, okay.
R:  -- to get it done.  Right.  So I mean, but the thing is with that is that like while I love sushi and I could eat it all day, it costs so much money.  You know, it's like thirty dollars for one meal, just for you.
L:  Now, is there certain kinds of fish that they use or seafood or?
R:  Oh, just really fresh tuna and really fresh -- just like all kinds of fish and seafood and stuff.
L:  Mhm.  And there's like seaweed and a little rice and a little --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do you do all that?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Little wraps and --
R:  Right.  Exactly.  So, that's -- the biggest, biggest um, con against -- against eating out with Japanese food is it's way too expensive for a just a normal day to day thing.
