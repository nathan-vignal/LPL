L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  I'm Sheila.
L:  Hi, I'm Shauna.
R:  Well, you want to start or you want me to start?
L:  Um, this is actually my first call, so you can start.
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, this is your first call?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, okay.  The topic is colds, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how the -- you know, do -- on the season.  I usually don't get a cold and so I don't usually go to the doctor for a cold.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  I usually, like, get sick towards the end of the year.  Like, for maybe [LAUGH] like two months at a time.  And um, most times I get bronchitis and that's the way it's been since I was a child, and I think, a -- about two years ago, I got my tonsils taken out --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- ever since then, I haven't really gotten sick as much, but like, I really try during the winter time not to drink, like, anything really cold --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- or ice cream or something.  Even that'll get my throat really cold and if I have to go outside and breathe cold air, type thing.  'Cause I have, like, asthma, or is there something just wrong with my throat.
R:  Right.  
L:  So I end up getting sick a lot more, just coughing.  Throughout the winter season.
R:  Usual -- usually, if I do get a cold, I don't go to the doctor.   I just -- I just wean it out.  [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's -- it's -- to me, I can go to the store and get something to take, but now, I -- I usually do that, but now since I'm on, um, blood pressure medicine, I can't do it.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Because you know, you can't take certain things and you --
L:  Right.
R:  So, but, um, I just -- I hardly get a cold.  I wean it.  
L:  Okay.  No, I usually, like, wait around a couple of weeks 'cause I'm in school, so I don't really get a chance to go to the doctor that often, but um, if it gets really bad to the point where I can't handle it any more, then I'll go.  
R:  Uh, my daughter had a cold, so I -- I'll take her because she's under one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, you know, if she gets a cold, runny nose or whatever, I'll take her 'cause she's a premie.
L:  Right.
R:  I won't -- I won't wait for her.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, she has a little runny nose or something.  [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he's getting on my nerves right now.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Um, is there anything else there we're supposed to say?
R:  That you -- we have to talk for ten minutes on this.  [LAUGH].
L:  For ten minutes?  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Wow.  I --
R:  It's actually -- it -- it's not going to seem like that long, but you know, once you -- you know, 'cause you have to, you know, talk about, you know, the effects of the cold, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And stuff and I have taken, like um, the Tylenol and flu stuff.
L:  Mhm?
R:  For it, which my husband, he ha- he had a cold and I was pumping him with orange juice and he was taking vitamin C at one point, and he was supposed to be taking it every day so he wouldn't catch a cold.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, he didn't take it every day.  He stopped taking it, so when he got a cold I, you know, went to the store and bought, um Nyquil and Dayquil and you know, give it to him every day. 
L:  Really?  I'm not really a buff for taking medication.  And I think that's why I stay sick longer.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But [LAUGH] it's just -- I don't know.  I just hate any kind of medication whatsoever, but um, I was going to say something and I forget.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, yeah, I don't -- I don't -- really can't do the medication.  I don't know if it's just because since a child I've never really taken medication and I'm like, you know, always been forced to take it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like being a sem- a semi adult now, you know, I -- I just don't like medication.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I'll -- I'll take it on occasion.  I was supposed to take medicine every day and I forget.  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LAUGH].  Now, so I -- I don't like to take, like, cold stuff 'cause I -- I forget.  I forget I'm supposed to be taking it, but if it's him, I don't forget to remind him to take his medicine.
L:  Do you what I realized, though?  Like, when I used to get coughs really bad, I usually eat some Jello --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- or, um, some pudding and that kind of soothes my throat.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's a good idea.  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause I mean, like, it was just like, the throat would be really itchy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and bad, and I think just like, Jello, it just -- it's something that just smooths it out, I guess, when it goes down your throat.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause, like, I used -- I've always, like, had my refrigerator stocked with Jello and pudding.
R:  Oh, I like --
L:  So --
R:  I eat ice.
L:  Ice?
R:  I -- I don't care how cold it is, if I'm drinking something, I want ice in it.
L:  See, ice will get me even worse.  I don't know why.
R:  Even if I have a cold --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I want ice in my drink.  I don't care.  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I have the -- if I have a -- if I have sodas in the refrigerator or orange juice in the refrigerator, most of the time I jus- -- I put ice in my orange juice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause I'm so used to ice.
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- and it's just --
L:  Do you drink a lot of water?
R:  Yes.  I drink water with ice in it.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Which a lot of people say that defeat the purpose, but of course, you know, but I feel I want ice in my water.   
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if I have it out of -- well, a lot of the time -- we have a water cooler.
L:  Right.
R:  And I put, you know, ice in that so you know, either way, even if -- when I have a cold, everything I -- you know, drink, I still have to have ice.
L:  That's interesting, 'cause I mean, I think, like, before when I was getting as, like two months, six or whatever, um, I didn't really drink that much water back then and I think recently, like when I've really started counting the number of bottles or glasses of water I drink a day, to make sure I get my total amount.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I'm like a [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh.
L:  I drink, like, I'm like really crazy about those, so --
R:  Oh, I drink plenty of sodas, um, and I try to drink plenty of water, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if, you know, my husband's sick, he got tired of me giving his soup when he had a cold, 'cause I was --he's, "I need to eat something else 'sides soup".   [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I said, "You gotta get your strength back".  You know, I was pumping soup down him.
L:  Mm.
R:  And he, you know, and you know, her friends make, you know, chicken soup?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so -- uh, no, I won't be pushing this button, and why's my --
L:  Mm?  
R:  Um, sorry, my battery's low.  Hold on.  I gotta switch phones before this phone go out on me.
L:  Okay.
R:  If only my husband left this phone off the hook all day.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's the first time I better [inaudible].  You there?
L:  Yes, I'm here.
R:  Okay.  First time I ever let my battery go low on my phone, 'cause I went out today.  But yeah, I would -- if my husband get a cold, I just -- you know, I give him chicken soup and he gets so tired of chicken soup and orange juice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or cranberry juice.
L:  I can't stand orange juice when I have, like, my sore throat or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it just bothers my throat even more.  But then again, I'm not a really a fan of orange juice on a regular day either.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So --
R:  I gave him cranberry juice, pineapple juice.  I give him any kind of juice.
L:  Mm.
R:  As long as he getting juice in him.
L:  Well, I know, like, the infirmary on campus, they continuously like -- for pretty much any kind of illness, even --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- colds and stuff, they hand out, um, what is it called?  Ibuprofen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like cough syrup, Dyma- something.  I don't remember the exact name of it, but yeah. 
R:  I know when I was younger, I used to, um, there was this pills at the drug store that were good for colds and you had a cold, you take this pill, it -- it'd knock it right out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which was -- my sister used to buy it all the time.  And they worked great.
L:  Were they vitamins?
R:  No, it was a cold -- it was some kind of cold --
L:  Herbal medication?
R:  It -- it was over the counter medication, though.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it would of ha- it was some kind of cold -- cold and sinus pill or something.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And it worked great. 
L:  'Cause I had some friends who told me about some herbal medication, but I never really got around to taking it.
R:  Oh, my, I don't take too much of that stuff.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm not -- I'm not too into that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- I just never gotten into that.  Only one thing -- you know, I drink green tea.  You know?  But I just -- I ain't into a lot of stuff like that.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  What?  I just hope, you know, I just be grateful when I don't get a cold.
L:  Right.
R:  Especially this year.
L:  You don't have one?
R:  No, especially this year, because I had my daughter to look after, too, and worrying about her getting my cold.  You know, if I have a cold?  So she's -- she's got to stick right onto me.  Well, she's -- she's grown, but she had a runny nose this year and she -- oh, my gosh, didn't want anybody clean her nose.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She got mad at me.
L:  She's one?
R:  Actually, she's only eight months.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  She's eight months.  And so I give her the children's Tylenol, and cold stuff.  And she has to have, like, four, um, cc's or something like that, 'cause she's so little, she can't take like so much.  But she -- she gets -- I think she did good.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And mostly I stayed in so I -- so she wouldn't, you know, get a cold.  Uh, it was -- it was pretty good.  
L:  I don't know --
R:  Wha- what state are you in?
L:  Maryland.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And you?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  Not to far away.
R:  No.  I be going -- I be going down that way the weekend.
L:  Really?  What part?
R:  Baltimore.
L:  Oh, I'm in Baltimore also.
R:  Yeah.  I be going down that way.
L:  Yeah, I be leaving this week.  I'll be done with school.  So I'll be heading home.
R:  Oh, you'll be grad- will you graduate this year?
L:  Yes, I will.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.  Yes.  It's been hard.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  That's all I can say [LAUGH].  Yeah, it's been an interesting couple of years for me.
R:  Mm --
