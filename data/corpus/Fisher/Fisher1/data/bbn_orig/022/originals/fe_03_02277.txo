R:  Hi, I'm Verana.  I'm from LA.
L:  Hi, Verana.  My name is Barbara and I'm from kind of near LA.  I'm north of LA.  Valencia.
R:  Okay.  So, we're close.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Good.  So the topic is on wellness?
R:  Yes.  When the seasons change.
L:  When the seasons change, and being well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, how do you feel about that?
R:  So, what do you do, uh, to keep well?
L:  What do I do?  I take a lot of vitamins.
R:  Okay.
L:  I take -- every day I take Echinacea. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, it boosts your immunity, and I um, I take two thousand milligrams of vitamin C.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I also get a flu shot, usually in October.
R:  Okay.  Great.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Um, I try to, you know, eat healthy.  I eat, um, a lot of veggies and fruit.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I drink a ro- a lot of juice and then I also take vitamins.  I have, like, uh, one daily for women.
L:  Mhm?
R:  I have ten of, like, all the vitamins and, uh, I don't know what else is [LAUGH].
L:  To keep you well?
R:  Yeah, then, um, I drink a lot of tea.  I try to avoid caffeine, I try to avoid alcohol.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I try to work out, you know, at least three times a week.
L:  Do you have kids --
R:  No.  
L:  -- that you have to keep well, too?  No?
R:  No.  Do you?
L:  Yeah, and that's a part of the problem, too, is when they go to school, they come home and they bring home, you know, various colds and --
R:  Oh, it --
L:  -- flu bugs and -- and things.  I try --
R:  Is that --
L:  -- to give them vitamins, too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
L:  To keep them healthy.
R:  Especially when the seasons change, you know, you tend to, like, dress not according to the weather, so you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind -- kind of like tend to get a flu or something easier.
L:  Right.
R:  Did you notice that, too?
L:  Yeah, it seems like, you know, it's cold -- lately here it's been cold and look like it's going to rain, and then a couple days later, it's warm and then they start getting sore throats.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, that's what happens --
L:  Then we've got to up --
R:  -- to me, too.
L:  -- the vitamin C, up the orange juice.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And don't breathe on each other.
R:  Okay.
L:  But we never -- do you go to the doctor when you get a cold?
R:  Um, if it doesn't go away after, like, three or four days, yes, I'll see a doctor.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes if I have a really bad sore throat, then I will, just to make sure it's not strep throat.
R:  Yes.  Exactly.  But otherwise, yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- I always wait, you know, for it to go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go away by itself.  And then, um, what about sleep?  Do you think it's important, uh, to stay well, to get at least like seven hours of sleep or something like that?
L:  I do.  I think -- 'cause I always feel like if I've only gotten four or five hours --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- that the next day I feel more run down and it would be possible to start getting sick.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
L:  I believe in eight to ten hours of sleep.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Mhm.
L:  To stay healthy.
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.  And you also, you know, look tired and you can kinda like see it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, um, how are you about, like um, going on vacation?  Like, goin- going to Mexico.  Do you think that's important to stay well?
L:  You know, I haven't ever traveled anywhere out of the -- you know, immediate United States.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  So I don't know, um, I've never been, you know, down to any areas where they have different illnesses and stuff that you have to worry about, like, not drink the water or --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Have you ever done that?
R:  Yeah, I have actually, but I always got lucky.  Yeah, but --
L:  Or you bring your own water with you or --
R:  No.  Actually, they always told me to not [LAUGH].  I was, like, a kid at this time and they always told us to not use their water and to not eat the food and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm?
R:  But I always did.  I just never got sick, so I got lucky, but I know --
L:  Oh, you got very lucky.
R:  -- other people did, so [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And especially now with the whole SARS thing going on.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, in the Philippines and China and everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It makes me a little leery about wanting to travel -- 
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- out of the United States. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause there are no -- yeah.  I don't think --
L:  My mom has -- 
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I was gonna say my mom has a friend that just came back from China and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- my mom said, "And I don't want to be near her for at least ten days because I don't know if she came into any contact with, you know, the SARS thing and she could give"-- you know, she can get it and give it to her.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And I don't believe they have any, um, you know, way to cure it or anything.
R:  How do you feel about black tea?  Do you think it's -- it's -- it's -- helps you to -- helps you stay well, or it's more damaging?
L:  You know, I've never tried that.  I've tried green tea.
R:  Green tea?
L:  Mhm.  Just recently I tried that for the benefits of, um, dieting.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And I didn't like the taste of it.  Have you -- so, you've tried black tea?
R:  Yeah.  I personally don't really like it, but I was told that if you have one or two cups a day, it's good for you.
L:  Mhm?
R:  'Cause it helps your body fight free radicals or something like that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I personally don't like it.  [LAUGH].
L:  The taste?
R:  No, it's kinda bitter.  I don't like it.
L:  Yeah.  The green tea, I don't know if I did something wrong or what.  I think you're supposed to put a lot of sugar in it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I thought, well, that defeats the dieting purpose, so I just -- yeah, I have two boxes of it sitting up in my closet.
R:  What do you think about dieting?  Do you think it's important in order to stay well?  Do you think it's important, um, to ke- to maintain a healthy weight?
L:  I think it's important -- yeah, I think -- you know, not eating fast foods and greasy foods.  I think that can bring your body down, where you might get sick more often.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think it's important to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy and, you know, I've also heard if you exercise regularly, that keeps your immune system --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- um, you know, going.  But I don't -- you know, once in a while, it's good I think to treat yourself to [LAUGH] something unhealthy.  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You have to [LAUGH] it's kind of a drag to think every day, oh you know, I got to eat healthy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, to stay well, so once --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- in a while it's okay to go off and, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.
L:  -- have a little something special.
R:  And, um, how do you feel about, like, peace of mind and happiness?  Do you think that's an important part of being -- being well?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think you have to be happy with yourself and um, you know, and -- and -- and enjoy your surroundings in order to feel -- to feel good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you think?
R:  Yeah.  I think that's -- I think that's a very crucial part, actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, um, no matter how well you keep your body in shape, if you're not -- you know, if you have too much stresses, you're unhappy with, um, what you're doing or in a relationship or whatsoever, I think that's, um, can really, really make you sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I think anything that, you know, brings you down and then you tend to, you know, get depressed and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you end up being irritable and -- and can get sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More often.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Um --
R:  And, um, how do you think, uh [LAUGH] the change of seasons affects, uh, how we have to change our habits to stay well?
L:  Let's see.  Maybe by dressing warmer.  Um, you know, I like summer time because then it's warm out and yo- when you go out at night, you don't have to think about bringing a jacket.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  But then I'm not prepared when -- you know, in California the seasons seem to change real quick.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then suddenly it's not summer any more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you're stuck, you know, out somewhere and you're freezing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Yeah, so many times, you know, it's like really warm, like especially in the winter time, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like eighty five degrees --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- around noon and then around five o'clock, you're like freezing.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Or during the summer, my kids enjoy, you know, the -- the beach a lot and --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- it's always freezing in the water.  It doesn't seem to matter to them, but that's when, you know, a couple days later, they get sick.  And then once the sickness starts with them, it goes through our whole family.
R:  Uh-huh.  Mm.
L:  But I don't know if there's any way really to avoid that.  You know --
R:  Yeah, no, I don't --
L:  -- they have to have fun, too.
R:  -- think so.  
L:  But, I think --
R:  I think you can't really avoid to getting -- I don't know, get a -- getting flu.  You know, occasionally?
L:  Yeah.  Do you get a flu shot?
R:  Um, I did last year.  I don't think I'm going to get it this year, no.
L:  No?  Did you still get sick after getting the shot?
R:  No.  Well, I have, like, you know one or two colds a year, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I got it with -- with or without the flu shot, so it didn't make a difference really.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, then --
L:  Okay.  Um, usually what I do -- well actually, last year was the first year that I got a flu shot and my kids did, too.  My husband didn't want to get one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But we -- before I'd gotten the flu shot, we used to get the flu every year.  This is the first year, knock wood, that we haven't -- none of us has gotten it.
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  So I think I'm gonna start doing it every year.
R:  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Probably -- 
L:  I think it really has helped our family.  And plus they're around so many other kids and I work at their school --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and there are so much germs, you know, going around there, but I think it helps.  At least it seems to have helped us so far this year to stay well.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, we've just --
R:  Probably.
L:  -- had our share, you know, a few little colds here and there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's been it.  
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  And, um, one of their close friends up the street had the flu really bad and it managed to pass by us, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  This is the time of year.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  This is it.  
R:  And then, um, do you think it matters, you know, it affects your wellness if you're exposed to all that?  Like, public areas and stuff like that?  Like, if you work somewhere, where it's like a lot of public traffic?
L:  Yeah.  I think, like, at the school or um, you know, like in the hospitals.  I've gone a few times to visit people and --
