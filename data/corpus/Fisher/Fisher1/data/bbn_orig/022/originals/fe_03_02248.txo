L:  Hi, I'm Tori.
R:  Hi, I'm Erica.
L:  Hey.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, the -- I guess the topic is the, ah, is do -- do you get ill during changing -- like, changes of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- seasons?  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I do [LAUGH].
R:  I definitely do too [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I live in Florida and I -- I have bad allergies, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it seems like when, ah, certain times of the year it's, um, lot of pollen.  That really affects me.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- definitely.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you at?
R:  Well, I'm in LA right now but, um, I'm from -- I grew up in Michigan so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that was major season changing and just I -- well, that's also very sporadic weather.
L:  Right.
R:  So every day, it's day to day, you never know.  It could be seventy and then thirty the next day, so --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- I think that really kills your immune system so you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- always struggling to, ah, keep up.
L:  Yeah, I do.  I -- matter of fact I have to take allergy medication, um.  Being in Florida, you know, we have so many things that bloom at different times of the year.  Right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now [COUGH], matter of fact, right now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're in the middle of one of 'em [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, ah, I -- I take, ah, prescription medication.  Well, I also take Benadryl, that really helps.
R:  Yeah, that -- that knocks you out, though.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So -- yeah, I take some, ah, prescription stuff too, definitely.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.  It's starting to -- to, ah, everything's starting to bloom out here as well in LA, so --
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  -- people are really starting to get stuffed up.
L:  Yeah.  How do the seasons affect the -- the weather out there?  I mean over in LA.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long have you been there?
R:  Um, about two years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- year and a half.  Um, not -- not so much.  I mean obviously coming from Michigan, it's not, ah, so big of a deal here but, you know, you get like a winter rainy season --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, yeah, I guess you guys do too, but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's pretty much, you know, seventy degrees out here all the time so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- there's not too much of a ...
L:  Does -- is there a lot of stuff blooming?
R:  It seems like it, um.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least my nose tells me it seems like it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, but it's -- it's, um, a lot better than Michigan.  I don't know if there's like more ragweed or something out there but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it's also quite humid.
L:  Wow.  What other questions were we supposed to, ah, to cover about the -- the seasons, do you remember?  They went through it so quickly.
R:  I know.  Um, okay, so we had the seasons and then --
L:  I know.  It was how to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how to keep yourself well.
R:  Right.  Okay, well, how do you keep yourself well?
L:  Well [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I just, ah, I -- m- medication, like you said before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really, you know, helps a lot with allergies.  Um, I just, ah, you know, try to keep my house clean.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely from dust.
L:  You know, I dust a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, um, you know, you try to use the air filters --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, some sort of air cleaners or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- air filters.  During the winter, I use a humidifier and I use a bacteriostat in it, which really helps --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, and the liquid?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the water part of the humidi- um, humidifier and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] so that really helps a lot and I have little babies so it makes a big difference --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with, you know, the breathing in here and stuff.  And --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] just always vacuuming and changing the filter and I change my air conditioning filter as well to try to, you know, limit what comes in from the outside.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  You know? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I get -- from my allergies I get asthma and stuff so it's, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's very important that I, ah, keep it dusted and somewhat clean [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  I tell you though, I don't really know what to do about the car situation 'cause I know that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the -- yeah, the filters in the, ah, i- in your air conditioner in your car --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, over time, they can accumulate stuff that'll affect your, you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- allergies or different, you know, different things and, um --
R:  Bet you guys use that a lot in, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Florida, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, we --
R:  Pretty muggy.
L:  Yeah.  It is a lot, actually --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's very humid and a lot of stuff, you know, a lot of the -- the plants and trees -- like here we have -- we have really bad pollen but like, the, um, [LIPSMACK] the, ah, the oak trees are just, I mean, the produce a lot of the pollen --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- and it's just so bad and then we have other plants that bloom, the pine and other -- other types of things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that creates, you know, a lot of stuff.  But I have to say the pollen's the worst here.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  That would make sense.
L:  -- because it's nasty yellow.
R:  Right.
L:  It coats everything, it gets all over your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pool and your car and --
R:  Oh, really?  Wow.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] I mean it's just -- I'm forever cleaning my pool I have so much pollen it just gets in there and [NOISE] [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  Oh wow.  I didn't realise it was that bad.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty bad, but --
R:  Yeah, my mom was in, um, Scottsville which actually is -- I don't  know the dry weather's pretty -- it's pretty good for me, at least.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think a lot of -- a lot of the things don't even live out there so --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And there's really no season change too much out there, so that's not bad at all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as far as that.  But I mean in Michigan, it's like I was always getting sick, so I was really affected by it when it would get cold and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause your immune system's just trying to keep up with, like, what's going on [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and it gets --
R:  Gets confused.
L:  -- colder there --
R:  Oh, it gets real cold.
L:  -- than it does here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah, I mean you guys --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get snow there and --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- that's, you know, I'm sure --
R:  It's windy and wet and yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure --
R:  It's really bad.
L:  --  it's real different than here as far as the -- the way the -- the seasons are, [NOISE] you know, what -- what blooms, what doesn't.
R:  Right.
L:  That kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everything gets frozen over but you -- I imagine you have your own set of --
R:  Right, but then you have to deal with the cold --
L:  -- problems.
R:  -- yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Yeah, so you just have to keep yourself, I don't know, I guess warm and, ah, I don't know, like healthy eating right and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here, you know, we just again try to -- to go -- I think the biggest problem here is one of the things that I really can't stand -- I've lived here all my life and, ah, it really messes up [NOISE] during seasons changing because --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- s- you know, we're in the middle of April here and we just had a cold snap not long ago.  Right in the middle of April.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I mean it's like, where did that come from?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, this is supposed to be hot weather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not cold weather.  And it's -- you know it gets hot for two or -- or cold for two or three days and then all of a sudden it's -- it's, you know, rainy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then all of a sudden it's hot, eighty degree hot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then everything opens up and blooms again.
R:  Right.
L:  And then it's, ah, you know, back to, you know, the cold, the rain and I mean it's just -- there's -- there's -- the seasons [NOISE] don't seem to stay [LIPSMACK] as level.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they don't seem to stay as consistent.
R:  [inaudible], yeah.
L:  You know, it's like -- I don't know.  Maybe it's -- I don't know.  It just seems like years ago it just everything stayed so consistent.
R:  I know, right?  I mean I just remember -- yeah.  I don't -- who knows why that is, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I remember the -- the snows being really, like really consistent and it was snowy for, you know, a good three months at least.
L:  Right.
R:  But now it's like, ah, kind of slushy, kind of --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- not, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  It's gross.  You'd rather just, you know, it just snow and get it over with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then it get warm.  But yeah, I was just in Detroit a few, ah, weeks ago and it was sixty one day and then thirty literally the next day and --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- it's like, I don't [LAUGH].
L:  And it --
R:  What season is that [LAUGH]?
L:  -- that really affects you.  I mean that affects you, you know, your body so much.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I mean your -- your allergies, I mean, you know, I think that's why so many -- so many people have allergies.
R:  Right.
L:  Because there's -- the weather fluctuates from one extreme to the other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so quickly, your body can't get acclimated to one way.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know?  And then just when you start to settle into one particular temperature or -- or a -- a range of a, you know, a -- a very moderate range.  All of a sudden you're way at the other end of the scale again the next day [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  So that really -- your body just -- I don't think has time to --
R:  Yeah, stabilize.
L:  -- to get used to it, yeah.
R:  Yeah, get comfortable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So, I think that that's probably one of the biggest things with me and my allergies and my -- my kids as well, is we have, you know, the range of temperatures --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then things bloom and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then it's like you're -- you're battling with that and -- I mean we have -- we have seasonal, you know, supposed to be seasonal periods where things bloom --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and you can kind a --
R:  -- what are your seasons?
L:  You know, I -- ah, I wanna say --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- April and March or March and April is pollen, really bad, bad pollen.  And a matter of fact right now we're supposed to be out of pollen.
R:  And what's your, um, what's the weather like then?
L:  It's, ah [SIGH], it's hot, it's humid --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah [LAUGH], it's in the eighties.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I -- and I'll say we're supposed to be -- matter of fact, we had our first, ah, out here in the Atlantic, they had, well, further on out, way out, they had their first tropical storm of the -- the season.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, that -- and it's too early.  We're not supposed to have that until May.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  And, ah, 'cause we have hurricane season.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, which really brings in a lot of rain, so you're dealing with every day at two o'clock, we get showers --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, and that's pretty --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you can pretty much bet around two o- -- two or three o'clock --
R:  That's crazy. Wow.
L:  It's consistent, yeah.  But --
R:  At least it's consistent though so you can deal with it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, with the rain.  I mean you kind of know when it's coming --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they're the h- -- you know the storms come sporadically anyway. You can't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- always count on it to be at the same time, but [SIGH] you know, five out of seven days, it's right around two o'clock , you know [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  So I mean, it kind of helps with knowing that way.
R: [MN]
L:  [NOISE] But there are days when it just rains for two or three days, [NOISE] you know, and then it -- it's like no rain, you know for a day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or two and [NOISE] so it -- it changes but, um --
R:  So then what -- what is your winter like?
L:  It's -- you know [SIGH], winter is so weird here because we don't get real -- we don't get winter like Michigan people get winter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  To me, it's freezing cold, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's seventy --
R:  Oh, no, I get cold too, don't worry [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know, to me seventy --
R:  It's like fifty degrees.
L:  -- degrees is cold.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Um --
R:  No, I know [LAUGH].
L:  So -- 'cause I'm a Floridian, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'd say my -- our winters here are -- [LIPSMACK] we don't get super cold until --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somewhere in January, usually.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like the end of December.
R:  Okay.
L:  Beginning of January, somewhere in there, and then our winters, [LIPSMACK] gosh, they c- -- they really -- they don't last too long but I'm going to say February --
R:  Oh, wow, okay.
L:  -- maybe even at the -- they kinda -- even into March a little bit, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- not too bad into March.  You know.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's more January February is our coldest, I think, our coldest times.  Our hottest times are, ah, [LIPSMACK] I'm trying to remember when my electric bill is -- is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the highest and there's two months out of the year --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know, and it's -- I think -- I wanna say it's ... May -- it's either April and May or May and
