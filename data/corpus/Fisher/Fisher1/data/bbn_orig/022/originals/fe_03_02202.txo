R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Hi, my name is Brenda.
R:  Hi, I -- I'm, ah, Dee.
L:  Dee?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Sounds like a great topic, food. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  So, where do you like to eat, and wha- what do you prefer?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, it's anytime I don't --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- have to cook it's great. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah -- but, I don't know.  I suppose that eating out would get, ah -- could get tiresome.  Ah, I don't mind cooking and it's, ah, [SIGH] you know, I d- -- I'm not -- I always tell people I cook to survive. [LAUGH].
R:  Right?
L:  So do you do much of the cooking in your house?
R:  Well, I'm single, and, ah, I do --
L:  So any cooking that gets done, you'll do it, right? [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right.  But I really don't cook that much.  I -- actually, over the past week or so, I had some friends, ah, out of town guests, to come over, ah, for Easter, and, um, so after then it's like I've been in this cooking mode.  I've been doing -- I -- I try to cook maybe just twice a week, three times a week at the most and then just, um, you know, eat leftovers.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, for after that.
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- I love to eat out.  And -- but actually, I got burned out on eating out.  'Cause I eat out so much, I feel like I can save some money and also eat healthier if I eat at home.
L:  Right, that's true.  Very true, I know.  There's just my husband and myself now.  Our kids are grown and gone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I had cared for my mom and grandmother, up until, ah, December and they were both disabled and so there were always people in the house and there were always people coming and going, and now it's just the two of us and it's like, "Okay, ah, what do you want to eat?" "Ah, I don't know.  What do you want to fix?" "Oh, I don't know".
R:  [LAUGH] So do you do a lot --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- of cooking now?
L:  I don't do a lot of cooking.  I do some cooking, um, we eat out some.  We've both been trying to loose weight, so we're on this slim fast, um, well, plan --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  [NOISE] -- it's not a diet, it's a plan.  And, ah, so we are, ah [SIGH] -- we basically just eat one meal a day.  Are you still there?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Oh, okay.  I heard a click or something.
R:  Yeah that was [NOISE] [inaudible] I'm not answering it though.  It throws the system off, they say.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, anyway we, ah, we usually have a -- a -- a shake for breakfast and then either eat lunch or supper, whichever, and have a meal bar for the other one, and have fruit and stuff in between.  So, ah, yesterday I cooked.  Yesterday we had, ah, chicken legs --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- and thighs and stuffing and potato and bean -- green beans and ... So [SIGH] yesterday I --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- cooked, today we had to go to Nashville, so it was eat out at Arby's[?] today on the way.
R:  Mm.
L:  And tomorrow, we'll probably eat the leftovers from yesterday.  Then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe Wednesday, I'll probably cook again.  I like to make home made soup, I -- I l- -- I usually make things from scratch, when I make [SIGH], so ...
R:  Yeah, it's kinda hard to come by that these days.
L:  [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I suppose that's true.
R:  Everybody [NOISE] you go the -- go to the supermarket and what do you see?  You see Hamburger Helper --
L:  Convenience everything.
R:  -- and all these different sauces.  I was in the grocery store today and I saw different types of gravy.  I hadn't seen that before.  I think it was by Heinz.
L:  Mhm.  In -- in [inaudible] that jar.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've seen those.
R:  Yeah, different s- -- like, ah, garlic gravy, garlic something and --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  I haven't seen that one.
R:  Yeah, herb -- different types of herb gravies and things like that.  And I hadn't seen that one before.  But I wouldn't think that it would be that great.  I mean --
L:  I don't know.  Ah, our problem is, well, both my husband and I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol --
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  -- and we're both trying to lose weight so we're on like --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- ah, he's on his low fat, low sodium, you know, high fibre and --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- it's [SIGH] basically impossible to find any packaged food, or really, when you go out, any food either, that fits all the categories.
R:  Right.  E-  -- now you're right about that.  And -- and that's my dilemma as well, because I -- I found the same thing.  I mean, there's no restaurant that I know of that has low fat, low sodium, low cholesterol food.
L:  Right.  Subway, go- -- they come close.  Ah, um, we really -- and they're good.  We like subs from subway and they're --
R:  Except the meat is processed.
L:  Well, that's true --
R:  Which means it's high in sodium --
L:  -- unless you just get the veggies.  If you -- if -- just get the -- if you're gonna go vegetarian, I guess, um --
R:  But even that.  You know, even that -- that vegetarian, um, with the veggie, um, burger that they have.  It's pretty high in sodium.
L:  Is it?  Is it?
R:  Yeah.  So, unless -- and even if you get the vegetables, I mean like, you know, the peppers or -- if, you know, they're, um, the canned peppers or in the bottle or whatever --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- those are high in sodium as well.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Like pickled type --
L:  Right.
R:  -- vegetables.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  So, [LAUGH] you almost have to --
L:  Your doomed.
R:  -- cook at home if you're going to stick to a low sodium, low fat, low cholesterol diet.
L:  And then it's like cardboard. [LAUGH].  Well you just flavor it.
R:  I don't think it has to be, though, because --
L:  No, I know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I actually, you know, like I sometimes cook, um, turkey -- turkey legs, you know, the turkey drumsticks --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and just boil them, season them well.  My doctor was telling me, 'cause I have the same problem.  You know, low, ah, high cholesterol, ah, hypertension --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and she was telling me that [COUGH] you, um, that you -- you really have -- you need to cook at home, because the only way you're gonna stay on that low fat, low salt, you know, low cholesterol diet is to cook at home.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Because [COUGH] most restaurants [NOISE] -- you have a few of 'em that -- that, you know, they claim to have low fat foods.
L:  Right, but you really don't know what's in it.
R:  You really don't.  If you don't cook it [NOISE] -- in it.  So -- and they're more concerned about taste than they are about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, giving you a healthy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hea- -- giving healthy -- healthy food.  So --
L:  That's for sure.
R:  Yeah, so it -- I mean, that makes -- makes a lot of sense, but -- I actually prefer to eat at home, to be honest.  But I do like eating out too.
L:  I think most people are that way.  I mean I -- we are -- we -- you know, like you say, it gets tiring to eat out.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Just gets --
R:  Well, because when you go out you gotta wait, you [SIGH] -- first of all, if you go to a popular restaurant, you're sitting there, and sometimes I've been in situations where I'm waiting for -- or other people are waiting for the table --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the waitress keeps coming back filling up my jar [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That actually irritates me after a while, because when I'm drinking coffee and I get it just the way I want it, you know, I don't like coffee extremely hot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I put a little, you know, put my creamer in it and I use, ah, Sweet and Low or whatever, sugar substitute -- get that just right, and then the waiter comes along and fills my cup up again --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  They think they're doing me a favor, but they actually -- they're actually not.
L:  They always come along when I have my mouth full and say, "How is everything?"
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  "Mm".  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that too. [NOISE].  But, yeah, there's -- I mean there's just a -- a number of different things that just kinda irk me abou- about that whole experience, but ... I mean, I -- I do -- I like eating out, though, but like I said, it -- it gets kinda old.
L:  It -- it does.  What, ah --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- and when my kids were -- were small, when they were home --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- of course it was -- we didn't eat out too often.  It was mainly -- it was mainly home cooking, most of the time, and I was very blessed in that I didn't have to work outside, so I was home.  I was a stay at home mom, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I got to have [SIGH] something ready for them when they came home from school, and, you know, a good supper going and then on the table, so I didn't have to rely on the convenience [SIGH] -- throw it together in two minutes.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although, sometimes I did, you know, you buy things --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- like that, but, um, but basically it was -- and I had to real- -- I didn't know how to cook, when we got married. [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  My husband bought me a Betty Crocker cookbook --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and he said -- he said, "I like to eat.  I don't like to eat outta cans.  I don't like TV dinners.  We're not going out all the time, and we're not eating at your mother's". [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you know it was --
L:  "And I'm not cooking".
R:  [NOISE].  You know, what was -- what was, ah, funny in my situation, though, was that when I was growing up, I never did any -- very much cooking at home other than -- the only cooking I can remember doing, when I was in college and that -- 'cause I went to school at -- in, ah, in my home town.  You know, with -- and stayed at my parents' house --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the last two years I went -- the first two years I went away.  But, um, I never did very much cooking except, maybe, scrambling an egg, here or there -- here and there, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, maybe doing the sausage, the bacon.  Real simple breakfast food, generally.  But I actually learned -- I, you know, I was always, you know, real close to my mom and I used to sit in kitchen and talk to her all the time while she was cooking, 'cause she was like you, a stay at home mom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that's really how I learned to cook.  I mean, there were a lot of things that I had never cooked before, and just from watching her, I remember how she did it --
L:  You do, you learn an awful lot, just from --
R:  You really --
