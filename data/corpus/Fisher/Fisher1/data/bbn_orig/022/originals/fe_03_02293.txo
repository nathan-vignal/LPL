L:  Hi, I'm Mary.
R:  Hi, I'm Heather.
L:  Hi, Heather.
R:  This sounds like an interesting topic?  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  I had family the other day --
L:  And?
R:  -- um, that was okay, let's see, with this.  Well, right now in Nebraska, the weather is really screwed up.  Like, yesterday it was seventy two and today it's fifty.
L:  That's -- 
R:  And raining.
L:  -- almost exactly like -- I'm in Min- Minneapolis.
R:  Oh.
L:  The same thing, it was gorgeous yesterday.
R:  So, a couple weeks ago, I had a cold that actually didn't last very long, but I remember in February when we thought winter was, you know, going to behalf --
L:  Huh.  
R:  -- um, I was like sick for three weeks.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I had a cold and then I got better and then the next day, it was worse than it had been before.  And it seemed like everyone was passing it around school.  I go to the university.
L:  Yeah.   I think that happens a lot.  I know I was in office building --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and everyone was -- well, not everyone was sick at the same time, but there was -- it was like this huge germ just went from office to office.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And somebody in the complex was always sick and sneezing.
R:  Yes.  
L:  So --
R:  And then I -- I have a music education night class which is with some people doing masters degrees --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and they all teach during the day, so then their elementary kids come to school sick and then they give it to the [LAUGH] college kids.
L:  Sure.  
R:  But I don't know, I think going from winter to spring and spring to winter seems to bring a lot of illness here.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I think a lot of that is caused by the fact that so many buildings now are air tight.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And you -- you're not used to whatever the outside temperature is, because you're in this controlled climate and then when you go outside and all of a sudden --
R:  There's drastic change.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  If the pollen has come out since you went to work in the morning, it's gonna affect you.
R:  Yeah.  I agree with that.  I probably don't do enough to try to keep myself well.  I know I don't drink enough water.  And I don't get enough sleep when school's crazy.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I used to -- it was funny, um, I would be really sick at night, like getting a really bad cold and my voice would get bad, my eyes were watering and I'd think, oh for sure, I'm not going to be able to go to work in the morning, and then before I -- you know, in the morning, I was fine.  Or just the opposite.  I would be fine in the morning and then when I got to work, all of a sudden I would start to get sick and they would be, like --
R:  "You go home".
L:  "You should go home".
R:  [LAUGH].  I had the same thing.  In fact, the last time I was sick, I felt like I was getting a sore throat for about a week and then, it's like, I go to bed and my throat would hurt and then I'd get up in the morning and I'd be fine, and then it would start again, and then all of a sudden, I had all this congestion and mess, but I didn't have the sore throat any more.  It was kinda weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was like I got the cold slowly.
L:  Well, people often ask me if I have allergies.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I honestly don't know.  I -- nothing is severe.  I mean, like, it's -- I know people who are, like, if they're in a room with an onion, their throat swells up and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  But I don't know if I -- you know like, I seem to get a runny nose frequently and they say, "Do you have a cold?" and I -- "No, I don't think so.  I don't feel like I have a cold".  "Well, then you must have allergies".
R:  I'm the same way.
L:  And I don't know if it's the change of the season and, sure, the pollen count is high, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it never stopped me from doing anything.
R:  Yeah.  And it's not like you're sneezing non stop and --
L:  Yeah, I don't feel sick.
R:  -- eyes will water and --
L:  It's just annoying because my nose won't quit running.
R:  Mm.  Well, I had a -- a teacher in Kansas once that thought Echinacea was just the ultimate thing and she said that she had not been sick for years.  So I got some and I don't think it did anything for me.
L:  I think a lot of that is mental.
R:  I do, too.
L:  If you really believe it's going to make you better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're going to swear by it.  "Oh, yeah, I feel better".
R:  And there was something, I don't remember what it was, I got at Walderings[?] once, it was some herbal thing that was just to make your cold not last as long.  I think it was something zinc based or something, and I -- I don't really know because you can't really compare because sometimes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you have a worse cold than another time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I didn't know if that did anything or not.
L:  And like, with the recording status, you go to the doctor with a cold --
R:  Yeah.  It's going to last a week.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Otherwise it lasts seven days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's very true, except now they -- there is supposedly a medication that will get rid of a cold.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I don't know.  Is a cold really so awful?
R:  Yes.  Yeah, it could be a lot worse.  Well, I got a flu shot because everyone at school was saying that I should get a flu shot, and it -- I never got the flu, but I had some weird thing the middle of March where I had a fever and I had body aches, but it was really minor.  It was just like, you know, a couple days or something, and I don't know if that was still flu or what that was.
L:  Maybe it would have been a full blown flu if you hadn't had the shot?
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's what I thought.
L:  But I always kinda laugh at people who say -- people who say, "I had a flu shot and I didn't get the flu this winter".  I'm like, "Well, so how are we going to prove that without the shot?"
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You don't really know.
L:  No.  
R:  But I don't know what else they'll -- they'll come up with.  They're always coming up with something new.  I had never had one before.
L:  It's some -- I -- I was really ill the past two years and in and out of the hospital and the staff there, they're always sick.
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] like, if hospital workers, with all their cleanliness procedures and the gloves and everything can't stay well, what hope is there for the --
R:  Yeah, how can we -- [LAUGH] --
L:  -- rest of us?  [LAUGH].  
R:  Yes, that's true.  I take the, um, bus to school and I know that that's got all kinds of people with who knows what on it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Before and after I get on there and why I'm on there, and standing at the bus -- bus stop doesn't always help me there.  That's the worst thing in the winter because with that, you'll be all bundled up and then the bus will come and you get on there, the heat blasting and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then you're all bundled up and you're on there for like ten minutes and then you're just burning up and then you go outside and it's freezing, so win- winter is not the best time.
L:  You should try it in Minnesota.
R:  Yeah.  I can imagine.
L:  Actually, it hasn't been too bad the last couple of years, except we had a real cold, severely cold stretch.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I didn't know what I was going to do.  I have a water bed and I had the heaters all cranked up as high as they would go, and I had like six blankets on them, and I could not get warm.
R:  Get warm.
L:  I didn't know what I was gonna do.
R:  Well.  Yeah, it actually wasn't too bad here, except we had probably our worst snow storm, it was on April sixth, after everything was spring like for two weeks, and it was supposed to be a lot worse.  They had forecasted, you know, like a ton of snow and it was going to be really wet, heavy snow because it was going to rain first and they were all worried about the trees and branches coming down --
L:  Oh, sure. Yeah.
R:  -- and all of that, but luckily, it stayed rain longer than they had predicted.  But that was -- that was wild.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then like two days later, it was seventy.  
L:  Is that -- that the same time when the east coast got all that snow?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  That was right bef- right after that, I think.
L:  I thought it was funny, I was watching, um, some of the morning talk shows, like Regis and Kelly?
R:  Mhm?
L:  And he was, "What's the temperature now?  Oh, my God, it's thirty three degrees".
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And I was like, "What are you whining about?"  That would be balmy for us.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  But then the -- as the snow accumulated, I could see that it would be a real problem.
R:  Yes.
L:  Where do you put it, in a city that size?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know even here they were, like, trucking it away.  
L:  Yeah.  Like, a million dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A million dollars for every fifty tons, I think.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that's not much when you start filling a truck with snow.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, especially if it's big, heavy wet stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I know here they were, um, they had the trucks all ready to start sweeping the streets.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And then the weatherman kept saying, "Wow, we got a big snow storm coming", so they --
R:  They were all ready.
L:  -- took the street sweepers off the trucks, put the plows back on, got the sanding trucks loaded and ready to go and all it did was [LAUGH] rain.
R:  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  Probably this winter more than any other winter that I remember, they would forecast snow all the time and then it'd either do nothing or rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So like, this storm on April sixth, everyone was, like, "Oh, it's gonna rain" and then we get a huge storm.  There was one other time, I think it was in October, all of a sudden, like, three weeks in a row they'd been forecasting snow and it hadn't done anything and then all of a sudden, they hadn't forecasted any and there was a ton.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's another reason why people may get sick more often, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the seasons change.  You kind of -- it's impossible to dress --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Like, if you go to work in the morning and it's really, really cold.  I know at least in Minnesota, it could be sixty degrees by the time you're ready to go home.
R:  Yeah.  I have that here, especially right now.
L:  Or vice versa.  And then people always try and rush the seasons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so they see -- you know, as soon as it gets to be forty degrees, people are walking around in shorts.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I saw that last week.  [LAUGH].
L:  And they get their bicycles out.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, you know, of course if you dress like that and, you know, then it rains, you're probably gonna get sick.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah --
