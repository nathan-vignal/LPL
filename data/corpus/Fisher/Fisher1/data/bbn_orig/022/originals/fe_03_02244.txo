L:  Hello?  
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes?
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Richard.
R:  I'm Michelle.
L:  Nice to meet you, Michelle.
R:  You too.
L:  Ah, where you from?
R:  Um, I live in Florida.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm in, um, Seattle, Washington.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yes.  Um --
R:  Now, what all did she say on the recording?  [NOISE]  I missed part of it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It sounds like --
R:  It's like what do you -- what do you to keep yourself well?
L:  H- what do you kee- h- do to keep yourself well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and with the changing seasons [SIGH], does it -- do you [SIGH] h- suffer any illnesses w- and what do you do to keep yourself well?
R:  Oh.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And that's an interesting topic because I'm dealing with allergies right now.
R:  Yes, me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've had allergies though since, ah, September of last year.
L:  I never used to have them until a year ago.
R:  Yeah, it seems like it's just really gotten real bad, and they're everywhere.
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Yeah.  And, um, as a matter of fact, the -- at the beginning of last week I had to go to the emergency room because I was having what I thought was an asthma attack --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  Even though I don't have asthma, because of -- allergies were so bad.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  They'll cause it, you know.
L:  'Cause I ... really for a -- for a while I thought I was having a heart attack!  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Because I couldn't catch my breath and I couldn't breathe normally and it was just very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very scary.  [NOISE]  And it sounds like you have a little one.
R:  Yes, I have twins, which, speaking of, on the allergies?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have -- they're almost two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the boy of the twins has allergies really bad.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I found allergies really seem like they're on the rise with people, because I've never had anything in my life.
L:  Yeah, I totally --
R:  And my doctor has just put me on, um, Allegra Anflownase[?].
L:  Interesting, because I've never had, um, an inhaler before and I was prescribed an inhaler.
R:  For your ... 'cause the --
L:  Uh, for, ye- -- not because he thought I had asthma but because of the allergies, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Becau- well, the allergies will cause it because that's like my son.  He, um, he takes Zertec.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, I have to  put a cream on him because he breaks out.  He gets like, eczema.
L:  Yes.
R:  Really bad from his -- because he's got food allergies and an outside allergies also.
L:  Yeah, I have a friend who, ah, it's really quite serious because [SIGH] she does have asthma and then, on top of that, with the allergies and sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she has to be rushed to the emergency room because she cannot breathe, even with the inhaler.
R:  Yeah.  Does she keep like one of the, uh, because we have to keep a, um, it's called a Epi pen.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  For him.  Does she keep one of those?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  We have to have one of those everywhere we go and he uses a nebulizer, which is, ah, like a -- it shoots it up through a mist --
L:  Right.
R:  -- instead of using the, the spray, like, squirt inhaler that you would use.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  And then, I went in, when mine started acting up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I was keeping just like, God awful sinus headaches --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the time.
L:  Yes.
R:  And sore throats because of all the drainage and stuff.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, that's when my doctor put me on the stuff and they said that just like, well, like in our area, it's really bad.  They said that this part of Florida, because we're like up in the Panhandle --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- is really bad on people.
L:  I don't think I could -- because of, mm, I'm getting allergies now, I don't think I could live in Florida --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- because, those are my all- -- I just don't think I could do it.
R:  It's real damp.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's a lot of mold growth around here.
L:  Oh, I would think.
R:  So, a lot of it just depends on that, you know, 'cause that's what I found, like, we -- we're military.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we just moved on base.
L:  Okay.
R:  And the town that we're in is really -- I mean the water's just like, across the highway from us, which the highway is right in front of the base.
L:  Okay.
R:  So half of the base residents live right on the water.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, yeah.  We moved on base here and we left stuff outside when we were first moving in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and things just started molding within days.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  It's that horrible.  I just couldn't believe it.  And I've had, uh, since we've moved here, I've went and bought things like that Damp Rid and stuff --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to put in the bathrooms and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- cracked the windows a little bit and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- run the fans longer.  There's so much that you have to do with allergies.  Ever since -- just with my son, um, because see, he --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he, he can't have milk, [SIGH] soy, eggs, beef --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- peas or spinach.  And he can't be around cats.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  He's terrible.  The poor little thing.  He -- it's horrible for him.
L:  You said you had twins?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And does the other one have these allergies?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  Nothing.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]  She's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just fine and dandy.
L:  I used to take everything so for granted because I never had any -- any health problems.
R:  Yeah, until you get something like an allergy, you don't realize it.
L:  And I never realised how serious they could be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Until I had to go to the emergency room 'cause I couldn't breathe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just because of allergies and I -- 'cause I -- like I said, I took my health very, very much for granted, until I [SIGH] -- and it sounds -- I always thought people were like, exaggerating or just, you know, being a baby with allergies.
R:  Yeah.  You don't realize it until -- 'cause like I've never had any problems, you know, like that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And then after my son had all these problems, then you start looking around.  Once you have it, then you start seeing stuff, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  You start reading.  You see more articles because you're like, "Well, this kind of pertains to me" and you start paying a little bit more attention.  And that's just like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and babies.  They just had a article in, um, Parent's magazine --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for like, May, about how more children are getting allergies and they don't know why, but they are.
L:  Wow.  Wow.
R:  And they start showing up around five months or so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and that's about the time he started getting his really bad.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I have a -- a cousin that lives in Kansas and her son is just right around five months old.
L:  Yes.
R:  And she was telling me all these problems he was having, like really gassy and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spitting up a lot and stuff, and I'm, you know, and then I'm like, "Well, is he getting any rashes?"  'Cause that's how his first started, was rash.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, like, and that -- the doctors, the biggest thing, oh my gosh, with him, i- I had to go round and round for like seven or eight months --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to get him into an allergist --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they don't want to listen to you.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  They think you don't know anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, it's like I go through and I crawl for -- cross reference.  I go to the library and get --
L:  Good.
R:  -- books.  I read the books I have.  I go online and pull up --
L:  Good.
R:  -- all the information I can.
L:  Good.
R:  And when -- when symptoms start seeming the same as what you have as to what you're reading in all this stuff, you know, well, then you're like, you know, "Well, something's not right".
L:  Exactly.
R:  And the doctors are like, "Well, you know, you don't have a medical degree so you don't know anything".
L:  Oh, I hate that.
R:  I kn- -- [LAUGH]  I know.  Me too.  That's how it was with me getting him into an allergist.  But at the time, I was seeing a doctor off base --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but once I took him to the doctor on base, well, he was just like, "Yeah", you know, "This child needs to go in".  And, um, my doctor off base was like, "Oh, no.  He just has baby eczema and he --
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- just needs to go to a dermatologist".
L:  Wow.
R:  So I went for a while to the dermatologist and then, ah, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] got him in, um, put i- -- went ahead and switched him over and got him seen on base.  And the first thing that the doctor on base did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He was like, "Well, let's take a scrape of this and see if it might be something fungal that can be cleared up".  And he --
L:  Good.
R:  -- took a scrape, which neither my pediatrician nor the dermatologist, which you would think a dermatologist would do a scrape.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I w- -- that just -- well, I was like, wow, you know.  He really impressed me.  So we switched our whole family over to the same doctor, and, um, that's on base, you know.  And he got him referred off 'cause I had to go through and get a referral to get him to see a specialist like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, sure enough, you know, they did it and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it's -- it's harder, a lot of times people say in infants, because the tests don't come out accurate when they do the skin test and everything, which --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- they did that to him, but --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- my, um, allergist is a pediatric allergist also.
L:  Interesting.  Okay.
R:  And they, they go through two, um, food allergies and things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do what they call a blind challenge --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in which they make 'em eat the stuff but they don't tell you whether they're getting the allergen or the non-allergen.
L:  Okay.
R:  And you just wait and notice and see if there's a breakout --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which he was allergic to all his things so all his were definite sure fire allergies.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's crazy.  And if something makes you throw up, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pay attention to it, because that -- that could be like a food thing too.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause that's one of his symptoms on beef and spinach.  They make him throw up.  That's how I found out about those and then the doctor tested him too.
L:  Really?
R:  It's crazy.  I've learned so much within this past year about allergies that I had no idea about, which you're probably doing all the same things, too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It [MN] -- stuff, you know.  You just get into this and then you have to start looking and you keep looking and there's so many people out there that can help you and give you information and, you know, just reading their stories and see what they went through.
L:  Yes.  But it drives me crazy because not every doctor will listen to you.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's what -- well, my -- I kind of got off the subject a minute ago with my cousin --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you know, I told her, I'm like, you know, "All of his stuff sounds just like JJ's.
L: Wow.
R:  You need to take him in and tell 'em that you want to see about going to an allergist because you think he has a -- either a milk intolerance or an allergy or something" and finally she's got him going in next month.
L:  Good.
R:  But it's like same thing, you know.  They didn't want to listen to her.  And she's -- she's a lot younger than me so she --
L:  Okay.
R: -- really had problems.  You know, she's just like, early twenties.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I'm like, in my thirties.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, and it's like, poor -- I told her, I'm like, you know, "Don't give up, you just keep on, keep on and push until you make those doctors let you go to the allergist".
L:  Yeah.
R:  So thank goodness she's got him going in.  So, he shouldn't have to suffer like my son did.  My son went covered in rash --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- practically from head to toe.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  From November until like, April.
L:  [COUGH] Oh, no.
R:  Yeah.  It's crazy, you know.  And they're just like --
L: You must have been --
R:  -- "Oh, no.  It's baby eczema.  You just need to change his laundry soap and --"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  "-- change his bath soap".
L:  Oh, no.  He must have been miserable.
R:  He was.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  He, he still
