L:  Um, my name is Blake. 
R:  Hi I'm Elizabeth. 
L:  Okay -- what was the question? 
R:  Um, it was, um, do you get colds during the change of the seasons and what do you do to prevent it I guess. 
L:  Okay  ah, yeah sometimes I get a cold I guess -- really just get enough sleep, but I -- I would say enough sleep and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Me too I usually have to end up in the doctor's office with sinus problems. 
L:  Alright -- okay.  And -- and then -- let me see, um, we're supposed to talk about ten minutes right -- I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Right.
L:  And then they -- I guess the -- somebody else comes on in the system turns it off or whatever -- okay. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, yeah let's see.  Uh, normally I -- I don't get sick that much it's -- yeah about -- but if anything maybe a cold or I take some cold medicine or something like that -- you know. 
R:  Yeah, what -- what part of the Country are you in?
L:  Um, Texas -- yeah. 
R:  Oh, I'm in Wisconsin.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That probably makes a difference.  [LAUGH] 
L:  E- exactly  yeah, you got the really cold weather out there -- 
R:  Yeah  yeah, it does get pretty cold.  Right now it was like seventy -- yesterday you know it's down to fifty and then you get a headache with you sinuses and it's more of a pain. 
L:  Yeah, because allergies change -- constantly changes and stuff like that. 
R:  Yeah  yeah, do you guys have like, um, seasons  like with the trees budding or do they just kind of see leaves all the time? 
L:  No, y- yeah there are seasons -- yeah  yeah, fortunately, uh, -- it's -- it's not like Florida I guess where you have this -- well kind of two seasons maybe -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cold and warm -- whatever but are -- are really not in cold just kind of little bit cold but yeah -- anyway there is four seasons. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  The trees change and all of that stuff yeah -- that's -- 
R:  Yeah I think that has a lot to do with it with all of the pollen and the budding and everything. 
L:  Mhm.  And, um, yeah there's, uh, -- well there's -- I guess most of Texas -- well some of the North Texas gets a little bit, uh, colder I guess up near Dallas -- that's where I am down near Dallas. 
R:  Oh, okay -- okay.
L:  And then you know South Texas -- you know Texas that's a huge place that  the South Texas just gets you know warmer quite a bit. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Uh, even during winter, uh, but actually it get kind of got cold down there, um, this winter -- it's been kind of weird. 
R:  Yeah, I guess everything -- I think mainly it's the weather what effects everybody. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's just the way it is here, it's cold and damp one day, and sunny and hot the next and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know especially during the springtime. 
L:  Right. 
R:  It seems to make a big difference. 
L:  Mhm.  Did you grow up in Wisconsin or -- 
R:  Um, well actually Michigan. 
L:  Oh, Michigan, okay. 
R:  Yeah.  I live down in Georgia for, um, a couple of years in the army.  And, uh, it was a lot better down there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  As far as the seasons go and be warm and sinuses and everything makes a difference. 
L:  Yeah -- yeah does, uh, -- it just, um, -- let's see -- I guess the summer -- the summer starts what pretty soon I mean it will be -- 
R:  Uh, yeah, -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah about the middle of -- end of May it starts you know getting up there being pretty warm at night.  So like right now it gets down into the, you know thirties at night. 
L:  That cold -- I mean even this time  okay yeah. 
R:  Yep -- yep.
L:  It's amazing yeah --
R:  Oh, it is -- it is. 
L:  Are you in the mountains or is it just -- 
R:  No, um, actually we're in the, um, [inaudible] Marine.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know and so -- you know right next to the river -- pretty close -- probably an hour away from the Mississippi. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So it makes a big difference. 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah that's, um, -- yeah I guess in Dallas there's -- well there's a lot of lakes around here, but -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  A lot of people think -- I mean have you ever been to Texas? 
R:  No I never have. 
L:  Okay everyone thinks Texas is dried up and that's not really the case -- it's actually -- there's are a lot of pretty parts of it, but um -- there's lakes and stuff like that -- yeah I mean -- some out West it's a little bit drier you know with cactus and stuff like that. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  And, um, let's see -- how long have we been talking?  What five or seven minutes? 
R:  Something like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay we've got another few minutes okay. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  And -- and then sometimes after we get through what do they -- we add some more comments or add some more information or something? . 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess -- that okay. 
R:  Yeah I think that's what it is.  I've never really done this before.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah I haven't either -- I -- I'd tried yesterday, and well, um, -- what happened I guess it didn't -- the system didn't work, I hit a button -- pressed a button that didn't register or something about the phone. 
R:  Oh, okay  okay, yeah, my son brought me the phone and said, "You've got this phone call mum".  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like, "Alright".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah -- cause it pay -- what is it ten or twenty or something or  
R:  Ten. 
L:  Ten okay. 
L:  Did -- I was trying to see -- did they say how long -- I mean is this just ten minutes but I guess it goes for total fifteen minutes or something like that. 
R:  Something like that. 
L:  Yeah okay. 
R:  Yeah I don't really know.  Like I said I've never done this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah -- yeah that's true. 
R:  But you know I don't know if they're going to ask us what our conclusions are then -- or -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or what on the subject. 
L:  Right the, uh, --
R:  How old are you? 
L:  I'm actually thirty four -- yeah. 
R:  Are you?  I'm thirty six. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  Yeah so I don't know -- it's always seemed to be that way my whole life with the -- you know sinus problem so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't really think it's my age.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How about you?  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, uh, not -- not really -- I've never had to have much cold -- I mean I might -- this last year too I might of gotten a few more colds but, uh, -- you know it hadn't been  -- I've never had too many colds to worry about but I guess in my day I've had a little bit of allergies and stuff like that but I really don't have it. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I just, uh. [SIGH]
R:  Just take over the counter medicine. 
L:  Yeah -- yeah just you know something like that -- I guess I had part of the flu this year -- I should of taken the flew shot but I didn't do it. 
R:  Oh, I didn't get one either.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I got lucky this year though, I didn't get the flu.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Was it pretty -- was the flu a big deal down there?  [inaudible] 
R:  Um, not too bad this year. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  Sometimes they -- you know it's a pretty big deal and it makes the news and stuff, but I don't -- didn't hear of anybody dying this year from flu out -- over in Wisconsin -- so.  Which is always good.
L:  [inaudible] How far close are you near Green Bay?
R:  Um, probably about three hours.  I'm closer towards Madison. 
L:  Okay Madison, Wisconsin -- okay. 
R:  Yeah.  So -- what about [inaudible] though. 
L:  Oh, you haven't been there? 
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  No.  It was just on the TV -- it's hard to get tickets. 
L:  Yeah that's what I've heard it's really hard and that. 
R:  Yeah it is, unless you want to pay a couple hundred dollars for a ticket. 
L:  Exactly. 
R:  So that's really not an option.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah that's -- it's -- that'd be -- I mean I don't know.  It's easier -- I've been to Cowboy games up here but -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  They're not as expensive -- I mean I -- I could probably get in a game -- I mean they're not that good, but hopefully they'll get better, but they're probably -- I could get in for fifty a game -- I think fifty dollars a ticket. 
R:  Oh, that's not bad at all. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And they'd be okay. 
L:  And, uh, -- but yeah there's, uh, -- I guess the state  what's an older stadium, I guess, uh, and stuff like that -- but Green Bay, I guess actually the -- your fans own the team or something and it's totally different. 
R:  Yeah they get -- they own stadium and everything. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So that's -- actually they are trying to build a new one too. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but I guess the taxpayers aren't -- some of them do and some of them don't, so it's all politics. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But --
L:   Do they really need a new stadium or is that just -- 
R:  No -- no [inaudible] I don't think they do but 
L:  Yeah just use -- they should use what they have -- yeah. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah I mean it's not falling down or anything you know -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from the pictures I've seen -- you know when you're looking at it during the games and it doesn't seem bad at all. 
L:  Right -- right that's true. 
R:  So you haven't actually been there so. 
L:  Mhm -- I've seen it I guess, um, on TV and then there's, uh, -- what they are trying to build a new stadium out where the Cowboys are I guess so 
R:  Oh, are they? 
L:  They -- they -- I mean they really don't need one but Jury Joans -- he likes to have the most new equipment or building and facilities, so that's what they're trying to do -- it's kind of river walk or something you know with other things around it -- you know. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Restaurants and all that type of stuff. 
R:  Okay -- okay well it sounds nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sounds expensive but nice.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes that's right.  Is the [inaudible] h- how much is it c- -- is it costing very much in Wisconsin or  
R:  Well I  I don't know what you mean in a, um, --. 
L:  Right.  Like I -- know you know LA's real expensive -- well California is real expensive -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you know just normal little thing -- you know food and all that stuff is like expensive but  
R:  Well we -- we pay two bucks for a gallon of milk. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  What's it there? 
L:  It's -- it's probably -- yeah a dollar eighty something like that -- probably about the same. 
R:  Oh, okay.  So that's not bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah and gas is one fifty five. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  A gallon here.  What's it there? 
L:  Actually it -- it's dropped, it's only is dollar -- you can get it for a dollar thirty four. 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  That's amazing the difference -- yeah but --. 
R:  It is a big difference.
L:  Yeah I'm surprised. 
R:  Well maybe we'll get that cheap over here now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH] Exactly, um, --
R:  But Texas is an oil state so. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You guys probably produce quite a bit of oil for your own use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Compared to Wisconsin where there's not much.  [LAUGH] There isn't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] Yeah that's, uh, -- I -- I guess they are -- that may be -- they may have more going on -- I mean uh, the wells might be going down next year. 
R:  Oh, the
