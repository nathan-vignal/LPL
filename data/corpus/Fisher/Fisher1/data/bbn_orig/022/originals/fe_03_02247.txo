R:  Hi, my name is Josh.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, I'm Krista.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Fine.
R:  Ah.
L:  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.  What are we supposed to talk about?
L:  Um, I guess illness is what the recording said.
R:  We have to go for ten minutes about that?
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  I don't know.  I've never had one of these before.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Illinois.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you with, uh, a school or --
L:  No.  My, um, aunt sent me an email and said, "If you want to do this and make money, you know, hit the link".  I hit the link, put my name in and, bam, you called [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  Interesting. Ah, because -- well, I think you get money only if they select your name out of, ah --
L:  Random or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever they d- I -- I have no idea what the hell this is [LAUGH].
R:  Well, actually, what it is is -- the company I work for is BBN Technologies.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we do a lot with speech recognition.
L:  All right [SIGH].
R:  So basically they're recording us and trying to get our dialects and all of -- and all the different words.  And then basically [MN] they're probably gonna try to annotate it afterwards and just -- they just -- they just want a big sample of people to get their -- their models to be better.
L:  Okay.  Well, the recordings that we're supposed to talk about illness and that if you go to a doctor, you're sick for [SIGH] five days or if you don't, you're sick for seven, and do we agree? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I have no idea.  I haven't been to the doctor in a while, I guess.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, let's see, what else is there?
L:  And I figure, you know, you go to a doctor, they usually give you antibiotics or something for ten days, so --
R:  That's true, so that's --
L:  -- y- you know, it's like, so of course you're sick for seven or eight days [LAUGH].  By [MN] --
R:  At least.
L:  At least, you know, or --
R:  At least, and then officially, you're cured.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  But, um [SIGH], ah, so, what else?  Let's see.
L:  Um [SIGH].
R:  So what -- okay, I guess I -- see, I wanna ask questions that are totally not related to this now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  No, that's okay, but let's see.  Um.
L:  Well, do you have to talk with -- on the topic that they want you to?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Or --
R:  I don't think it was explained too well, to be honest with you, but ...
L:  No, I don't think it was [MN] explained very well and all and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean I could analyze them really well [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, what it could be though is, is it could be sort of, they just want you to talk for a while and not really -- and just to -- and just to sort of get a broad range of -- of words and, you know, and just -- just so it seems like you're naturally talking.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they -- and if they give you a weird topic like that, they might realize that after a while, people will just start wandering and that -- that could be [MN] what they want.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know.  So I don't know if it really --
L:  So what?  We're supposed to guess what they want?
R:  Uh, basically, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, so, ah, let's see.  A doctor -- okay.  So now, what kind of doctor are they talking about?
L:  They didn't specify.
R:  They didn't specify.
L:  They said, um, um, ah, like a cold, like if the change of seasons and that, to me, was always a flu that you didn't go to a doctor for.  You know, you only go to the doctor if you're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- contagious, like if you have strep or bronchitis, you know, or things like that.
R:  True.
L:  I mean, if you have a cold, most people don't go to a doctor 'cause they have a cold.  They take a Tylenol and go to bed.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Call in sick and make a day of it, you [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Hm.
L:  So --
R:  Very good.
L:  So I don't know what they're actually wanting you to ... refer to. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I'm just wondering why they put two people on at once.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know that either.
L:  I thought we were supposed to talk to each other.
R:  Yeah, we were, but I mean why couldn't they just ask us questions by ourself, you know?
L:  I don't know.
R:  But I guess they want more of a --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- natural language type thing, so I guess --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's why they put both of us on.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Oh, you got peanut butter.  Awesome.  Okay.
R:  So is that your son?
L:  Three -- yeah, three year old.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, he's the only one not in school yet.
R:  Really?
L:  And once he goes to school, he will be sick all the time because that's a germ factory.
R:  Exactly.  And he'll have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to be out for at least seven days.
L:  [NOISE] At least seven days.
R:  Not five?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's right.
L:  Not five.  Once they don't count the weekends then you go back to Monday and Tuesday, to be seven, you know.
R:  Exac- yeah.  They didn't --
L:  'Cause it's --
R:  -- specify if it was --
L:  'Cause they didn't specify if it was a work week --
R:  If it was a work day or --
L:  A work --
R:  -- a regular day.
L:  -- week or a -- a normal person's week, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So I -- I don't know and I -- it would probably depend on your job with how many people you were actually in contact with.
R:  That's true.
L:  'Cause like me, who stays at home and I'm only in contact with the kids, you know, I don't get sick that often at all.
R:  That's good.
L:  But [NOISE] I don't go to a factory or an office or anything like that.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So where if you did, you'd be sick more.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Although I do go to an office, but I don't g- I haven't gotten sick, I don't think.
L:  Are you close to people or are you spaced out well?
R:  Well, I have my own room.
L:  Well, see, that probably helps.
R:  That probably does help.
L:  [NOISE] You have your own room?  What do you do?
R:  What do I do?
L:  Yeah, what do you do?
R:  Well, I work for BBN and I do a lot with speech recognition and, um, software programming.
L:  So do you normally call people [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, no, I didn't --
L:  -- like this?
R:  I didn't call you for this.
L:  I didn't call you. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Well, what happens is, is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the Fisher -- the Fisher system here hooked up just two random people.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they want us to, I guess, talk and converse and they wanna sort of figure out the speech pattern from two people conversing.
L:  Mm.
R:  But no, I -- they just -- they called me.
L:  And -- and what would be the, um, [NOISE] the relevance of such information?  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I mean ... why?
R:  For -- for what do you mean?  Having us talk?
L:  Yeah.  What does that do, besides give somebody a reason to have a job?  I mean --
R:  Ee [LAUGH], okay, well, so basically --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the whole problem with speech recognition is, is that it works -- it works reasonably well when you have a very sort of, ah, closed environment.  You know, basically, me just speaking very clearly without any sort of distraction.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay?  Now, a test like this would, you know, right now this is recording all of what we're saying and interacting.
L:  Okay.
R:  And at times, we're not really saying full words.  We might be saying, you know, just like, A. or whatever --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then we would sort of -- we would understand that, but a regular generation model wouldn't.
L:  What, you mean like a computer wouldn't understand?
R:  A computer wouldn't understand it, basically.
L:  So we're basically teaching a computer how to talk?
R:  Well, we're basically te- teaching a computer sort of how we're interacting and what we are sort of saying and what meaning we're trying to convey in this -- in this little framework.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You see what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, so now I'm going to start using real words [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] What do you mean?
L:  Instead of going yeah, ok- okay, what el- -- you know?
R:  But see, but that -- that's could be -- that could be what they wanted, though.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Because they have to also train the model to pick up these little words in between and it's hard to program in A. and yeah, and you know, just like little, little sort of slang words, I guess, and this is what is --
L:  Well, how about the new kids' slang like my cous- -- my cousin is only seven years younger than me and if it's good it's supposed to be the bomb.  I mean [LAUGH].  How --
R:  Right.
L:  Okay?  So how does that, you know, how do you teach a computer all of that goofy stuff [LAUGH]?
R:  Well, what the -- with the way it works though is you have this big thing called la- language generation models.
L:  Okay.
R:  And depending on the situation you're talking about, like for instance, if I wanna read the -- the Wall Street Journal, there's gonna be a lot of stuff about stocks and bonds and, you know, industry.  But if I want to talk about baseball, I'm going to have a whole big model that's just set around words like hot dog, home run, first base, second base.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So right now, what -- what they're doing here is they're trying to get a huge -- they're -- th- we're trying to make a huge big model that can sort of encompass everything.
L:  Oh.
R:  You see?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I get it.
R:  You get it?
L:  I get it.
R:  So --
L:  Okay.  So how often do you go to the doctor [LAUGH]?
R:  I -- I don't -- I haven't gone in the past many years.
L:  [NOISE] So you wouldn't say that you would get just 'cause the season changed then?
R:  No, I wouldn't.
L:  You have no allergies, then.
R:  I do not.
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  It's very --
L:  Convenient.
R:  Very convenient [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess a lot of it though might stem from, you know, how healthy you can keep yourself, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which I guess helps keep the doctor away.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So people tell me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway, so --
L:  Anyway, um, h- hold on.  We've been t- I've been on the phone like ten minutes and thirty two seconds, so --
R:  That's how long it's been so far?
L:  Well, since she called -- the operator later -- lady called me, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So do we hang up, or do they tell us when to hang up?
L:  It said it would tell us when ten minutes has elapsed.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And it's like -- but I -- I really don't -- their topic was really lame [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I mean that -- they should have called a nurse or something [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  But I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they could be just -- they might not really want that.  You see what I'm saying?
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  They may just want people to talk for a while.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And by giving them a topic it's kind of like, "All right, now they at least have something to go on, whether they wanna talk about it or not".
L:  Or whether they're gonna speak at all. You know, I mean they might have people who just don't talk at all [NOISE] once they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they sit there go, "Hi, okay and now I say what to you?" [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, then -- then you'd be like, "So what do we do now?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, "What do we do now?"  And I guess
