R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  This -- I'm -- I'm Melanie.
R:  I'm Jenny.
L:  It's nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  So -- so, it's food tonight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, restaurants.  They've called me before but it hasn't been anything I wanted to talk about.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, restaurants.  Um -- oh, I eat out a lot more than I should.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot more.  In fact, I order out a lot.  They deliver.  Everything delivers around here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I order -- I order Chinese a lot.  I order pizza a lot.  My kids love pizza.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My husband's out of the country so I've been ordering out for the kids and me a lot.  So.
R:  Oh.
L:  How about you?
R:  Well, I only have a tiny baby and he doesn't care what he eats, but.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  [LAUGH].  
R:  He --
L:  I remember those.
R:  I do --
L:  My oldest one's two and a half and so she's into pizza and whatnot and my little one's just a year old.  And she doesn't really care.
R:  Sure.  Mhm.  How many?  You have two kids?
L:  Yeah, I have two girls.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  We don't get to go out much.  You know, you don't take the kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're not as fun to take on the -- you know, out to a restaurant.  People kind of look at me funny when they start screaming.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  With just one it was okay but now that both of them are here, it's kind of -- it's kind of odd.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We go to family places like Denny's and, you know, the [inaudible] and stuff but we don't get to go out anywhere nice without finding a baby sitter.
R:  Yeah.  I guess, I'm so far, pretty brave.  I -- I had a call earlier than I planned to and even have kids so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than kind of resent having not to do things, I just kind of do things with him.
L:  Yeah.  When our first one -- when we just had one, we went places but now that both of them are here, it's kind of -- it's kind of harder.  Now we go places like the zoo.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But with the first one, we just -- we took her everywhere and she was pretty good but you know, now that there is two of us or two of them, we kind of shy away from anything that doesn't have a playground.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  We let them loose in the playground and eat our dinner.  We don't get out much without them.  Occasionally.  We went out for our anniversary in January but other than that, we don't get to go out and eat anywhere nice.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  I actually eat out a lot because I do mystery shopping.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do too.  [LAUGH].
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  In, um, Seattle.
L:  See, I'm in Alaska.
R:  Oh, wow.  I think that --
L:  Yeah, I do that too.
R:  I've heard of people who, I mean, people that find out about the studies that pay and so I also do mystery shopping sometimes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not that unusual but --
L:  Yeah, people travel in the same circles, kind of.
R:  Yeah.  It's funny.
L:  So.
R:  But, do you live near a big city over there?
L:  Yeah, we live in Anchorage.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So there -- there's more work that I could do.  There's five of us in town that do it.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yes.  Five of them that I've got in contact with.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, I haven't tried to find people in town that do it at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I live in Seattle and I think there's probably a ton.
L:  Yeah.  There probably is.  I do a lot of restaurants.  I do a lot of fast food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm really getting sick of fast food.
R:  You what?
L:  I'm really getting sick of fast food but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm not one to turn down a free meal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Regardless.  If it's just free food, you know, that's just a meal I don't have to cook.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  I'll go by myself and leave my kids with my husband.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Get me a free [inaudible] or whatever.
R:  Yeah.  So.
L:  Yeah, I want to get --
R:  How many?
L:  So.
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty interesting.  There's a lot of jobs around here, so.  I don't really say no and sometimes I should 'cause I get a lot of leftovers going on and --
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- did that at first.  I've only been doing this since about October.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, we -- we just got here in September and I lived, before we got here, we were in a little bitty town in Texas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So there wasn't much there and there wasn't a whole lot I can -- I could do there but I got really into it up here and I do a lot of merchandising too.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I'll pick up a -- I'll pick up a fast food in my merchandising route so I can have free lunch while I'm on my way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does merchandising pay all right or?
L:  Yeah.  I make like um, eleven or twelve dollars an hour.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that's pretty good.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm working a lot lately.  I'm working like four days a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But normally I try to work about two or three.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  So.  Daycare will really eat up your money.
R:  Yeah.  If you have to get childcare for that.
L:  Yeah.  My husband normally works nights so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he keeps them during the day.  He's deployed right now so he doesn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I have them in daycare but when he gets back that'll -- I'll get more of my money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can see more of it anyway.
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, I've --
L:  We have --
R:  On the other hand, I really enjoy cooking.  I just don't have time for it right now, really.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I like to cook.  I like to cook when my husband's home.  With just me and the kids, it's like when I cook something, it's too much and I'm not big on leftovers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, things get thrown away and I -- I've been eating a lot of lean cuisines and fixing a lot of grilled cheeses for the kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.  But when he gets home, I'll cook -- I usually cook a lot when -- when we're all here.  He works nights and so he comes home for supper and he's here three meals a day so I cook.  You know, if I'm not working all day, I'll cook three meals a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's --
R:  Wow.  So you deserve the breaks.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I love fast food.  I -- I'm eating lean cuisine to make up for eating all the fast food.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So.
R:  It's funny.  I don't get -- yeah, I don't do any fast food mystery shops.  I don't know of any except for a McDonald's one.
L:  Yeah.  I did those for a while and --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I got tired of them.  I got tired of McDonalds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But other ones I do are for the same company and they're dedicated route.  They don't -- don't really hire reps.  We got in.  I got lucky and got in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So they're more of a full time thing except that with Alaska it's so spread out they can't really have somebody do full time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I got lucky but that's about all.  You know, I do apple beef here.
R:  Oh, I do them too.
L:  I've done them a couple of times.  There's two in town though and only one of them gets shopped.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's the same one every time.  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we like to go there.
R:  Oh.
L:  And there's a Stewart Anderson cow company here too.
R:  What is it called?
L:  It's called Stewart Anderson's Cattle Company.  It's like a big steak house.
R:  Oh.
L:  And a friend of mine has done them before.
R:  Yes.
L:  And so, I'm trying to get in with them.  So far I haven't been very lucky.  But we're dy-.  We haven't been there since we got in town and I'm -- we're dying to try it but I'm waiting on somebody else to pay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So.  And I do my points.  Do you do my points?
R:  My points?
L:  My points is like a click through site.  You gather points on line.
R:  Oh.  Ah huh.
L:  They have gift certificates you can earn at Stewart Anderson so I'm going to save my gift certificates.
R:  Oh.
L:  For Stewart Anderson then get to shop for it so I could really rack up.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  So.
R:  I haven't tried out things like that, on line, but actually one of them finally paid to give me a picture frame that is just three.  It's like a little, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, two by two.  It wasn't very great but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like, well at least it's sort of actually legitimate but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just kind of stopped doing that 'cause it didn't seem like worth my time.
L:  Right.  Only a couple of them have really paid off.  My points has paid off a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I do Harris Poll too.
R:  What is it called?
L:  It's called Harris International.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I just got a stand mixer from them.  I've been wanting one forever.
R:  I'm sorry, what?
L:  And I just had -- a stand mixer, like a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with a bowl attached to the bottom.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I've been wanting one for ever and I finally -- I just ordered -- I had enough points and I ordered one and it came in.  So I was excited.  I [inaudible] made a cake so I can use it.  But we don't even eat a whole cake if I make it.  So.  I -- I'm just kind of -- I've kind of abandoned cooking for a while.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I have a freezer full of convenience foods.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Packaged noodles and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, as -- as far as anything, you know, that requires a lot of preparation, I -- that's kind of out of the question lately.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been so busy and just keeping up with the kids by myself and I'm not used to that, so --
