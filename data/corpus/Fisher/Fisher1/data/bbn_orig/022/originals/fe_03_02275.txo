R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Steve.
R:  Hi, Steve, it's Harry, how are you?
L:  Okay, good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, yeah, not too bad.
L:  All right.  Wasn't, ah, wasn't expecting this.  Ah, what was the quote again now?
R:  I believe we're supposed to be talking about illness and seasonal affective disorder.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, how -- how do you prevent from, uh, getting sick?  I, ah, I go to the gym, you know?  I try to eat well and, um, you know, I take my Echinacea.
R:  Echinacea?  You did not hear of this study that says -- a German study that said Echinacea actually will lower your sperm count if you're a guy?
L:  Really?  Well then, I guess I won't pass my unhealthy genes on to, ah, to children at least, huh?
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You're very, very healthy, but sterile, unfortunately.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't think it's there, I -- just read that somewhere because I used to be a big fan of Echinacea, and now I'm not.
L:  I don't know, sometimes there's a smear campaigns out there to, uh, to discredit homeopathy.  I nev- you never know from which, ah, from which way the, ah, the --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- swing comes.
R:  And both slants are skewed, unfortunately.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But, ah, but yeah, I trust things that come from the ground before I do prescription stuff overall.  Um, but nothing's -- nothing's a Bible -- you know, nothing's gospel.
R:  That's funny, because I skew the other ways.  I'd rather have something that went through an extensive testing period.
L:  Right.
R:  Than something that somebody says, "Hey, this made me feel good".  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, no.  I mean, these things date back to antiquity.  I mean, they've been working for centuries, you know?  But, I uh, you know, I -- to each his own, you know, whatever -- whatever works for you.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I'm definitely a big fan of anything you want to do, go ahead, as long as it doesn't bother me any.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, when I read about these Chinese king pills, for example, I read about these a while back, supposed --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- to be the best thing for -- best thing since sliced bread, and then you read the ingredients and among it is mercury --
L:  Ah, geeze.
R:  -- heavy metals.  [LAUGH].
L:  We get enough of that in our drinking water, for God's sake.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. You heard about, uh, Perk?
L:  What is it?
R:  Perk.  Uh, it's --
L:  No.
R:  -- it's rocket fuel, basically.
L:  Oh, wow.  Wha- what's that in?
R:  It's in basically everything right now.  It's in our water.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know -- I know enough about the fluoride and aluminium and all those things --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- chromium, got enough -- we got enough to go around right now.  We're pretty -- pretty -- got our hands full.  [LAUGH].
R:  The really insidious one is, uh, during the winter --
L:  Wow --
R:  -- something like -- during the winter, something like sixty or seventy percent of our lettuce comes from this one area.
L:  Really?
R:  Which, if you eat it, if you say -- if you're saying you want to be healthy and I'm going to eat salads and all that all day long --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and it turns out that you'll actually be getting something like three or four times the FDA recommended dose of Perk. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Which is -- it's rocket fuel.
L:  Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure you get that even if you don't eat the salad, so you might as well eat the salad and get the good with the bad, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, but it concentrates, that's the thing.
L:  In -- in lettuce, specifically?
R:  Yeah, in lettuce, evidentially.  Just -- 
L:  Oh, right.  Well, then I go with spinach.  I go with one --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- of the other leafs.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I suspect it works the same --
L:  I don't think you get that much out of lettuce anyway.  I think you have to eat hordes and hordes of lettuce to get something, you know, really anyway.  It's mostly water.
R:  Yeah, sure.  It's all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, no nutritional value.  It'd be --
L:  Very little, anyway, yeah.
R:  -- a support system for dressing.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think organic tends to give you a little more nutrients than, uh, non organic anyway.
R:  Um, I don't --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- know about that, but at least you don't get the pesticides.  And you don't --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- get the, um --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think sometimes when things are prepared with a good energy or, ah, you know, I think sometimes there's more of a quality to when you're eating it, you're getting some of that back.
R:  Oh, do you --
L:  But that's on more of a metaphysical level, I guess?  [LAUGH].
R:  Am I getting my RDA recommended allowance of che?
L:  Yeah, that's the question.  The meat, the cheese, the diary.  Gimme, gimme, gimme.  That's probably --
R:  I don't --
L:  You know, I -- I know better.  I'm aware of my own destruction, but I -- I'm just getting over a mild bout of the flu myself right now, but ah, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think if I eat my pizzas and my, uh, you know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, my milkshakes and whatever.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, on the chicken that I'm currently washing as we speak.
L:  Oh, very nice.  Very nice.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  Of course, nowadays when I get the flu, people are, like, "Are you sure it's not SARS?"  So, you know, I got --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- gotta whole lot of headaches going on.
R:  Yeah, that's really funny.  I -- I actually work with people that are in -- you know, that travel extensively.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I've been in contact with a couple of people that may have been in Asia at the inopportune moment.
L:  Ah.
R:  You want to talk paranoia?  [LAUGH].
L:  Ha, ha.  Well, there's a cure I hear, so I guess it's just quarantine you have to worry about, or -- or --
R:  Well, there's no- --
L:  -- recognizing the symptoms or whatever it is?
R:  Working out the symptoms and quarantining yourself.  But think about people's natural re- reaction? 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know?
L:  But, wh- we -- we --
R:  They flake.
L:  We should probably, ah, is there more to the topic we should be discussing?  I want to make sure that they don't, ah, review our file and say, like, "What are these guys talking about?"
R:  What a couple of mooks.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I gotta believe they're, ah, just real quick.
R:  I think they --
L:  What, ah --
R:  -- said something about, um, about the seasons' change as well, yeah?
L:  Oh, okay.  So, pollen and things like that, maybe?  I -- I tend to be a little affected by that.  I don't really have allergies that much, but uh, you know --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- I do, ah -- I don't know, you know?  Especially, like, I just moved from California to here, to New York.  Ah, where are you?
R:  We're New Yorkers.  Yeah, I'm New York as well.
L:  Okay.  So, um --
R:  Probably you found about this on [inaudible] list, or --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I was -- I -- I'm from out here, but I went to California for three years, uh, which you know, I hated and anyway, I came back and um, the -- the kinda change of going from the climate to this climate, it -- it was even --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I think that's why I have the flu, plus a lack of sleep.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, lack of sleep will do that.  When you start -- when you moved back to New York and you realized all the fun things you can do?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Plus -- plus the move itself, you know?  You -- you're up all night packing boxes and, you know, and then I did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the cross country trip, so you know, blah, blah, blah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, it's stress- it's stressful, though.  Hell.
L:  Yeah.  So I think probably the immune systems gets a little lowered and then with the change of weather.  This weather's been kinda inconsistent.  We have the nice weather, the bad weather, then we have a little rain and then we have, like, a -- a heatwave.  It -- it -- you know?  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Like, all --
R:  It's a big --
L:  -- in the course of a few hours.
R:  Good fortune to take this week off.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Cramming for an exam and, uh, the -- at the end of May, so --
L:  Oh, yeah?  You're in school?
R:  No, it's -- it's a -- what do you call, professional certification.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Very good.  Oh, so you, uh --
R:  But, um --
L:  So you have more of a vested interest in the subject around -- surrounding the subject?
R:  What's that?
L:  You have more of a vested interest in this, uh, random subject that we've been given, then?
R:  No, not really.  I couldn't care less.
L:  Not really?
R:  I'm jus- yeah, that's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- just --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm just doing this for laughs, basically.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It loo- it looked kind of interesting.  I was like, ah, you know, free money, why not?
L:  [LAUGH].  I'm doing it for the sad ten dollar check.
R:  Well, there you go.  You get ten bucks for nothing, you know?  For chit chatting with some moron in Long Island.
L:  A little something.  Are you in Long Island?
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Whereabouts?
R:  Oh, in Huntington.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  I moved out here --
L:  I'm from Oceanside myself.
R:  -- a couple months ago.  What's that?
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Oceanside myself.
R:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  The, uh, the funny thing about seasonal affective disorders, I've got -- a good friend of mine --
L:  Mhm? 
R:  -- you're supposed to get -- you know, I think a seasonable affective disorder, like, in the fall.  That's when the days start getting short and light changes and you start to freak out a little.
L:  Okay.
R:  Right?  But my buddy gets it in the spring.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And I have no idea why.
L:  I -- you know, I don't know any more.  I mean, there's just so many disorders that there seem to never used to be, and uh, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I chalk it up to this toxic society and its many uh, different ways.  But, uh, it always gets, you know, always seems to get accepted just, you know, it's introduced by the media, you know?  We got a Western Isle virus.  We got a seasonal disorder, we got a this.  Oh, asthma's up, you know what I mean?  I don't know, meanwhile, you know, the World Trade Center went down, we have, like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- tons of asbestos swimming around, and you know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and asthma rates went up, you know?  And then we got, you know, the Western Isle virus which, like, three old people died from and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know, they're suddenly spraying -- just spraying these huge pesticides all over our cities because of this?
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  Like, what are pesticides giving us?  I don't know.  You know, like, uh, I just get very sceptical about all these things.  Even Alzheimers.  Where was Alzheimers thirty years ago?  There was no, you know --
R:  Oh, you know --
L:  -- the -- there wasn't --
R:  It comes out a lot in -- it comes a lot of it, I think, to um, to winter causes.  We have good -- good economic times right now.
L:  Yeah, we sure do.
R:  So, we're bus- --
L:  We sure do.
R:  -- too busy -- we're too -- you know, whe- when you're really -- when things are rough, you're too busy to worry about the fact that your allergies are bothering you and you're all sniffly today.
L:  That's right.
R:  But, uh --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, give us a nice, you know, happy economy, lots of time off --
L:  [LAUGH].  Or just tell us --
R:  -- suddenly we go --
L:  Just tell us we're the good guys and we're doing the right thing overseas and then we'll all go to bed at night.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, that's a --
R:  The right thing, huh?
L:  -- prescribed medication.  [LAUGH].
R:  Are we doing the right thing?  Please tell me we are.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Oop, wait.
L:  I don't -- Don- Donald Rumsfeld says we are, and you know what?  That guy looks like a saint to me.  [LAUGH].
R:  It's go- good enough for me, man.
L:  Yeah.  He looks like grandpa to me.  Mother's milk.  [LAUGH].
R:  If -- if the oil industry tells us that we're not going to war for oil, who am I not to believe them?
L:  Yeah.  And especially with, uh, the Bush family owning most of the oil.  Hey, who am I to --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- question that.  But, ah, but on the topic of colds, um, you know, I uh, I wouldn't mind if Bush got a severe flu.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  There you go.
L:  I don't know if tha- I don't know if that's in keeping with the topic.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what they're trying to accomplish from this thing, but look, Danny, on illness, let's stick with illness for a little --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  What -- what --
R:  -- while.  I -- like --
L:  What was that quote?  They gave a quote and then they said, "Do you agree with that" and then I -- I --
R:  Oh, something about --
L:  -- didn't catch it.
R:  -- waiting seven days.
L:  What was it?
R:  I think there was something about waiting seven days to see a doctor, whether or not you agree.
L:  Oh.  Ah, you know what?  With the way doctors are these days, if it's -- if it's not, like, something towards the homeopathic doctor variety, I -- even if it is, I -- I tend to wait anyway 'cause I feel like your body is designed to overcome these things, or to at least try and I think in giving it the chance to try, it actually becomes stronger.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know?  And if -- if you go for, like, a quick out or something that'll overcome your body's own defenses, and will do it for you, then the next time around, you're gonna have to do that again or, you know, you're going to have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rebuild, you know?  So I kind of agree --
R:  There is --
L:  -- with that, you know?
R:  There was one school of thought that says that a fever is your body's response to an infection.  So --
L:  Yeah, that -- that makes sense to me.
R:  -- basically -- yeah, so if you get rid of the fever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it may take you actually longer to recover from the infection, whatever it might be.
L:  Yeah, because you're treating the symptoms, not the source of the problem.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, I agree with that. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, you- you're body -- you're body's already designed to deal with these kind of things.  Um --
R:  My personal favorite is when very educated people talk to me and they say, "Oh, I had a cold, but the doctor gave me anti -- gave me antibiotics and now I'm fine", and you're going, "Eh?"  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Right.
R:  Excuse me?  'Cause let's have a little discussion about antivirals --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and antibiotics.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?  Somebody's got to go on a [inaudible] inhibitor for a --
