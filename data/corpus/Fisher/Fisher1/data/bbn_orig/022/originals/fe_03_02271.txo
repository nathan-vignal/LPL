R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Derise.
L:  Hi, my name is Mario.
R:  How are you?
L:  Oh, I'm not ill.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good thing.  Um --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Well, the weather's -- I don't know where you are, but the weather's pretty nice here.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I know we're -- we're change -- we're changing a little bit now into the spring season.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, yeah.  What part?
R:  Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Marina Del Ray.
R:  Oh, so you know.
L:  So I know.
R:  Probably even prettier there.
L:  Well, it's, ah -- I actually was about to go out, ah, by the pool with, ah, my, ah, paperwork and, ah, just, ah, spend an hour out there, being it's such a nice day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, but then I got the call here so I figured, oh, I might as well sit at home and take care a this.
R:  There you go.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, do you find that, um, out there with the ocean weather, you do not get as -- the -- the -- the seasonal change like we do here in s- you know, in the springtime?
L:  Well, let me tell you.  I came, ah -- I was born and raised in Chicago.  So I grew up with winter colds and, ah, you know, flus and, ah, and one thing that really bothered me was the -- the heat, heating systems, ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, which is very dry --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which dry up my sinuses and, um, you know, just really started off, ah, for, you know, opening, mm, for getting sick, you know, ah, with -- with, ah, dry sinuses and that.  And, ah, so, um, one thing I always said, you know, first chance I get I'm -- I'm heading outta here [LAUGH].  And after growing up for thirty years in the Midwest, um, you know, I moved to California and, ah, I don't get sick out here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  I maybe get sick once every two years and that's because some idiot around me was sneezing and --
R:  Sneezing.
L:  -- you know, and, ah, just spreading it, you know.   Usually when I worked in the offices, the -- that -- you know, that will of -- often go around the coworkers [NOISE].  And, um, so, you know, now that, ah -- I work outta my home and I have for about two years and I haven't gotten sick or anything, you know.
R:  Yeah, I find the same thing.  I -- I work in an office situation and I -- we always think it's like the air conditioner or something, you know, that just kinda circulates the germs.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, I'm -- I guess, you know, in -- in general, I, um, rarely get sick as well.  I know that they mentioned at the beginning of the call would I go to the doctor with a, you know, ah, if something -- if I had an illness in -- or a cold or whatever after seven days, and usually I don't.  You can pretty much determine how long it's gonna last by the symptoms you have.
L:  Right.
R:  Nothing really, really severe unless some really weird flu comes coming through and everybody gets it.
L:  And then you know if you've been pushing it like when you should be sleeping or staying home but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- no --
R:  You gotta know how --
L:  -- go out --
R:  -- to medicate yourself --
L:  -- anyways.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- accordingly and a lotta times, it's just a lot of rest and completely shutting down, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  But how 'bout, um, how 'bout even worse illnesses are -- have you had experience of those?
R:  I -- see, I'm sorry, say that again?
L:  Ah, how 'bout, ah, ah, illnesses other than, ah, colds and that, um --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- have you been fortunate?
R:  -- I had maybe ten years ago, um, some female, um, ah, ah, s- s- I had a hysterectomy.  I had cervical cancer.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But it was-- it was -- I was lucky and they were able to catch it so I was rather --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- I was like thirty nine which was pretty young but I wasn't gonna have any more children.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so that was a little weird.  That's probably the worst that I've ever been hit with anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And it -- and it -- at the same time, I had shattered an ankle, so I was laid up --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with one foot and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then having -- I had four different surgeries over a period of six months.
L:  Well, at least you got it and knocked it all off in one period, huh?
R:  Exactly.  You know, and it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, you -- we -- we bitch and moan about insurance costs, you know, and, you know, for years and years and years I paid into it and I never used it.  And boy, I'll tell ya, when you really need it and you have it, hallelujah.
L:  Yeah, wow.
R:  And you know, the insurance to -- you know, isn't -- today what I have isn't as good as it was ten years ago, you know.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  Everybody's cutting back.
L:  Right.
R:  So, how 'bout you?  What -- any serious illnesses?
L:  Mm, no, to tell ya the truth, not really.  I, ah, I was unfortunate enough to have a, um [LIPSMACK], I had a -- I've been on -- I've been self employed for about two years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I realy don't have insurance coverage and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I'm about to sign up on -- with my other partner.  We're about to get a plan, ah, among the partners.  There's about four of us.  Um, but I have not and, ah, last year I, um, had a toothache that was just -- would come and go, come and go, and finally I said, "I gotta go take this care -- you know, this taken care of".  And I needed a root canal.  [LIPSMACK] And, um, it turned out that there was, ah, an ongoing infection and after the root canal, I was swollen.  I was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I had a fever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was laid up and I -- and I went to the -- back to the dentist on South Bay and he immediately said, "You're going to the hospital" [LAUGH].  And it was a real bad infection and they had to, um --
R:  Remove the tooth?
L:  Yeah, they had to remove the tooth, but before that, they had to feed me, ah, um, in -- ah, what's that?  Ah, [LIPSMACK] um, they had to keep me on, ah, +intravenous whatever it is to kill the infection.
R:  Antibiotics?
L:  Yeah, constant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- antibiotics for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three days, just to kill the infection and --
R:  Oh, you really had it bad.
L:  Yes, and then removed the tooth, so I was on morphine.  I was on everything.
R:  I know all about that.  Actually, my ex husband is an oral surgeon, actually down in the South Bay area.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] So this will be --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- [LAUGH] that's what he does, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, ah.
R:  And, ah, I used to work for him so I used to see that and that -- you know, I think that, ah, dental pain is probably, um -- I probably have had more of that than any real --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, illness, illness, you know.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  And you remember it when you have something like that.
L:  Oh, definitely.  But anyways, to make a long story short, ah, because I was not covered, ah, they sent me to the university, ah -- the University Hospital in Torrance --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is covered by the state.  I had a seventeen thousand dollar hospital bill but --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- because I -- ah, I qualified -- I technically qualified as -- as unemployed --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because, ah, being, ah, self employed, business was real slow, it was -- it was just, you know, it's starting so, ah, they paid the bill and, ah, I actually ended up on -- owing only seventeen hundred, you know, which is about ten percent.
R:  And you were -- had good treatment?
L:  Um, oh, fantastic treatment.
R:  Where were you sent?  University where?
L:  Ah --
R:  U -- not USC -- was it USC?
L:  I think it's USC, ah --
R:  The USC dental school?
L:  Ah, ye- mm, yeah, the dental school is out there too.
R:  Yeah, I used to work at the US [LAUGH] --
L:  The Harbor -- Harbor Medical Centre.
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no, this is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- part of USC, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that's very cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Well.
R:  -- it's good to know that you can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get some --
L:  Definitely, I'm --
R:  -- kind of cover.
L:  -- glad to --
R:  Just k-
L:  -- I'm glad the doctor had enough sense to send me there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somewhere else, you know.
R:  Yeah.  You know, medical costs can be, especially when you're self employed, really high.
L:  Yeah, no kidding.
R:  Really high, so -- so I guess it's good that you're fairly, ah, healthy person, you know?
L:  Oh, luckily, you know, knock on wood [LAUGH].  But, ah, yeah, other than that, I don't know.  My family's been pretty lucky too.  My, um [LIPSMACK], I think the worst that's happened is, um, and knock on wood again, my, ah, dad, ah, an angioplasty, um, couple years ago but he is seventy seven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Took seventy seven and, um, he, ah, you know, was -- it was -- it was a very, you know -- well, it's rude awakening as to his -- his, ah, eating habits and that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he had the angioplasty.  Now he exercises every day, my -- my step ma, his wife, ah, ah, feeds him very, very healthy meals, um --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  We're Mexican so, ah, we're used to the, you know, the meat and the tortillas and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, you know, the greasy food so no more of that and, ah --
R:  Do you eat healthy?
L:  I, ah, eat healthy when I cook at home, but I, ah, you know, I have a weakness for burgers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Oh, yeah.  We all do.
L:  -- yeah.  And of course, Mexican food.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I love Mexican food and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- down here in California, you know, you get some of the best.
R:  What would you -- be there's -- there's pros and cons about that too that's -- a certain amount of it, of fat and stuff.  Look at the Atkins, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the -- that -- that diet there.  I mean, he's got -- well, he's just passed away, but it's all meat and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  Well, you can't have the sugar, you can't have the starches --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and the potatoes and stuff, you know.
L:  The whole thing is the concent- -- is to focus on that only and keeping away the carbs.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And for a time period to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- able to get rid of all the fat and everything else.
R:  Well, I'm sure it doesn't hurt that you're sitting also at the marina c- I mean, you don't wanna sit down there and look like you, you know, you're eating hamburgers every day [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I would say that's kind of like a little doctor over your shoulder right there [LAUGH].
L:  There you go, there you go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess it helps a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know anything about my family history.  I'm adopted so it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, everything that comes along is kind of a new, new thing for me, but I'm fifty one years old when really heal- healthwise I've, you know, had your normal children's diseases and chicken pox and that stuff, but really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been very, very fortunate and I've only broken, you know, one bone [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].
R:  So I just did everything at one time.
L:  Oh, wow.  You're lucky.  Well --
R:  Yeah, I don't even -- I don't think I've seen a doctor in probably a year and a half, you know.
L:  Really?  Well, yeah, yeah, I, um, in my last +full +time full time job I went to get -- get everything taken care of, you know, I mean every test, every, you know, thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could think of 'cause I knew I was gonna go on my own soon.  And that was, like I said, two years ago, so I'm probably due and, um, you know, I should definitely do it in the next six months, I guess.  But, um, I also have high cholesterol, um, but then again, ah, since I was diagnosed with that, I have changed my eating habits.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Do you take medication for it?
L:  Ah, you know, I was put on the Lypitol[?].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I re- it made me feel weird.  I -- I don't know
