L:  Hi, it's Bonnie.
R:  Hi, Bonnie.  This is Anthony.  How are you this evening?
L:  Good.
R:  Great.  Ah, which do you prefer?  Eating in restaurants or eating at home?
L:  Um, well, eating in restaurants is, ah, not as cheap ...
R:  But it's more convenient.
L:  Right.  It's more convenient.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know, this is weird.  This is the first call I've had.  Um --
R:  Okay, this is only the second one I -- I've had.  So, um, ah, where -- where are you from?
L:  I'm from Doylestown.
R:  Oh, okay.  Ah, I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I -- I guess I -- I don't know how you feel about it, but, ah, I -- I've really paid close attention to my diet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, even though I love to eat out, um, I tend to do it more on an occasion basis, where, you know, I can kinda monitor what I eat at home.  But, are -- do y- -- are you any -- like that at all, or --
L:  Yeah, I've -- I generally, um, shop at the Freshfields and get good healthy groceries, and watch what I eat.
R:  Right, exactly.  But, yeah, um, I don't know about you, but I live alone and, ah, i- it -- I -- I -- I love to cook, but I hate cooking for one person.  So I tend to [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah, I'm the same way.
R:  -- do the microwave stuff.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I don't do the microwave stuff, but, um, I do the simple, quick --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and easy, under ten minute stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I generally eat with my -- best friend comes over every day, so, even though I live alone --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  It's like having a little family.  And, um, then I'll -- I'll cook interesting, different things, like ethnic things.
R:  Sure.  That -- see, that kind of stuff is fine, and it -- it's always great when you can cook at home, but yet have people that you could share it with.  That's -- that's kind of a neat thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm at a place in my life right now where I -- that's -- that isn't possible. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, because I'm going -- I've gone through a divorce, and everything, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- basically I'm just -- I'm eating for me, and, ah, so, you know, sometimes I just say, "Screw it.  I'm tired of eating in here, even if I have to go out somewhere and go to a bar and eat a sandwich or something, I'm going".  You know. [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  Just to get out.  [COUGH].  But, um, [LIPSMACK] -- but I enjoy cooking a lot at home, so, ah, I love trying new recipes and things like that.  Ah, but I find myself now -- I'm not doing nearly as much of that.  Simply because I'm only cooking for one.  You know.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, um, I go through phases.  Sometimes it's a lot of takeout --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, sometimes it's -- you know, I'm cooking every day, and sometimes I'll go home from work at lunch and even cook.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  So you really are into like, cuisine then.
L:  I try.  My boyfriend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- says I'm good at it.  But, um, I don't know.  I have --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- fun.  Yeah.  My mom couldn't cook, so I made a promise to myself that I would.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's always interesting how our mothers influence us, yeah.  Bad or good, right? [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it all works together for the good, hopefully.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, she tried.  She just didn't, you know, understand flavor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] So she wouldn't, you know, use spices and [NOISE] we found pepper in the house from like, nineteen seventy four.  Like, that's how bad it is.
R:  Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH].
L:  Funny.
R:  That's hilarious.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and she served it to my friend, and my friend noticed the, ah, the date on the pepper and was horrified.  Was pretty funny.
R:  Nineteen --
L:  That was funniest.
R:  -- seventy four.  Holy smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].  That's amazing.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I mean, I -- I've almost put pepper on ice cream, that's how often I use it, you know.  That's nice.
L:  Yeah that's funny.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you know, being from the south, now, ah, my grandmother, ah, she's passed on now, but, you know, the southern cooking -- the old southern cooking was use lots of Crisco and lots of --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- fat packed in your fried chicken, and stew --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all that kinda stuff.  And biscuits and all that.  And, ah, I really had to, ah -- I had to out grow that. [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Go through it to get to the point where I could eat healthy, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it -- it's a lot different today, you know, but growing up, you know -- I mean, that was just the way, you know, ah, old people cooked back then.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know, down here.  But, ah, anyway -- but she was a wonderful cook, and I was a fat kid, you know. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So -- but, ah -- and of course, you know, we still have the, ah, the big church dinners and -- and there's a lot of that that goes on down here, [inaudible] so occasionally you had to be bad, you know, and then just make a [inaudible] last all week, you know.
L:  Right.  Are you actually in Tennessee, or are you in Philadelphia? [NOISE].
R:  No, I'm in Tennessee.  I live in Nashville.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there was an add in one of the local papers here --
L:  Right, ah.
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- so I answered it.
L:  Hey, Luka?  Sorry, my cellphone's ringing.
R:  It's okay.
L:  'Bout the computer, the robot thing.  I'm on that --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- so I'm doing that.  Did you just call my house?  All right, I'll call you back.  All right.  Bye.
R:  I like that, the -- the robot thing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That's kinda the way I was looking at it too.  The -- the first guy that I talked to was also from Philly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, so I -- I assume that there's a lot -- a lot of that, obviously from, ah, University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, anyway in --
L:  I thought it was all Philly.  I got so confused.
R:  Yeah, no the -- ah, there was an ad in one of the, ah, local papers, here.  Actually one of the alternative papers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, you know, there was an add for it, so I thought, "Heck, yeah, I'll do that", you know, so I -- I logged on the website and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hooked up and ah, the first night the -- the night of the day that I'd, ah, signed up, I got a call.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it's -- it was kinda cool.
L:  I thought it would be like, not talking to humans, at all.  'Cause my friend that just called referred me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's funny, 'cause she just called, and, um, this is my first call from the robot.  So she sent me this email, and she was like, "Become -- talk to robots and people", and I don't think I really understood, completely, until tonight.
R:  Right, right.  I wasn't sure the first time, ah, I -- I was on the phone either.  It kinda, you know, but -- you know, once -- once he and I started talking, then it was, you know, it was like, "Oh, yeah, okay.  This is cool".  You know, so, ah, then anyway.  Well, so we've decided that restaurants are sometimes good and most times bad, and cooking at home is most times good --
L:  Well, you don't what -- what they're putting in your food at the restaurant.  I mean, if you look at all the bad angles.  I mean, I guess, like, also, you know, it could be dirty and then it --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  And you have more control over fat content and stuff at home. [NOISE]  But I like the experience of the restaurant.
R:  Well, and -- and [several inaudible words].  Yes, exactly, where -- where, you know, you can just kinda chill out, and, you know, maybe have a glass of wine or something, and just -- just let them take care of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I think -- I think all of it, you really, when you -- when you look at the total picture of health.  Um, you know, you need some of that time for yourself, too, you know, to actually be served.  So, you know, i- it kinda counter balances things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in your life.  You know.  So, fr- from that aspect, you know --
L:  It's something to do.
R:  -- ah, when I think of health.  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
L:  No, it just -- it's something to do, too.
R:  Yeah, well sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely, absolutely.  Ah, you know, um, all work and no play.  You know -- you know that won't do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um, you know, when I -- when I think of health, I -- I really try to think of the whole picture, not just the nutritional side, but also, you know, what's good for me, you know, what's going to feed my spiritual side, or my emotional side, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] my physical side, you know, 'cause I have to get the proper exercise and things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, just kinda the total picture and -- and part of that is just being able to not have to worry about it -- just go out and have some fun and chill out, and, you know, have a glass of wine, and enjoy the experience.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now I -- I totally concur with what you're trying to say.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  So, I -- I'm sure there's a lot of great restaurants in Philly.
L:  There actually are.
R:  What part of -- what -- what part of town are you in?
L:  I'm dead smack in the center of town.
R:  Okay.
L:  So I'm like, right by our city hall.  So --
R:  Okay, sure.  Um, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, it's been a while since I've been up there, but I used to, um -- I used to date a girl that went to Branmar[?] --
L:  Oh, okay, my -- my friend's sister went there.
R:  So, I -- I've -- okay.  Yeah.  See, so I -- I've got a sort of a semi lay of the way and -- but like I say, it's been a -- it's been a while since I've been up there, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I know we used to hang out in [inaudible] a lot.
L:  Oh, yeah.  What's in [inaudible]?
R:  Gosh, I don't know.  It's so long ago.  [LAUGH].
L:  There's a mall.
R:  I think there was a Bloomingdales, yeah.  That's what I was going to say.  I --I remember buying a tie a Bloomingdales.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But at any rate.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, ah -- have you ever been to Nashville?
L:  No, I have an aunt from Memphis, but no, I haven't been to Tennessee.  Since I was three, but I don't remember.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you should come down and visit sometime.  So it's a beautiful place.  Actually, topography wise, it's very much like Pennsylvania.  'Specially at, ah, east Pennsylvania.  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, mountainous, trees --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, when I used to spend time up there, I used to, you know -- specially going through, ah, Pennsylvania Dutch country, and all through there --
