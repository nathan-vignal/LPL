R:  My name is David Athens.
L:  My name is Jonathan May.
R:  How are you doing, Jonathan?
L:  Pretty good.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing very well
L:  All right.
R:  Um.  The topic, I suppose, is food?
L:  Yes, and --
R:  Right?
L:  -- do you prefer eating at a restaurant or at home, etcetera?  So what about you?  Where do you prefer eating?
R:  I guess it depends.  It -- it depends, you know, how I'm feeling.  Um, generally I think it's, um, to be out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Basically, to be out.
L:  I -- I agree.  I like to eat at a restaurant.  Um, in general I like -- it's like one of the two things I like to spend my money on.  The other is travel but I -- I really like to go to nice restaurants and um, I can get food that I -- I couldn't normally or wouldn't normally choose to make at home.  I -- I typically order like the fish or steak because I generally just make chicken at home, myself.
R:  Right, right.  And it gives you a chance to try things that you couldn't possibly make at home anyways.
L:  Right.  Or wouldn't think to, like things with corn meal and crusting.  I went to a Portuguese restaurant just the other night and it was really phenomenal.  They just did -- made stuff with interesting sausages that I just, ah, would never have thought to make and which were wonderful little appetizers.
R:  Right.  And -- and it gives you a chance to sample like you say, you know, Portuguese.  You can sample many cuisines of the world and um, you know, you can get an introduction and um, maybe it can entice you to want to go to that place.
L:  Right.
R:  And now, um, the -- going back, um, but there are times when I like to entertain and be at home.  Um, mostly on the weekends.
L:  Right.
R:  But the qualifier there is that I can't get the food to taste as good as the restaurants.  You can get the recipes from the restaurants, um, say, and --
L:  You can do that?  Really?
R:  Well, not at every single one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but sometimes you can.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, and they'll give you the sort of things but they'll always leave out one crucial ingredient.
L:  Right.  That you need.
R:  Or not crucial but something small that gives it that extra something and it doesn't quite taste the same.
L:  I found that in a lot of cookbooks that are made by famous restaurateurs that ah, they have ways of keeping you from really getting their recipe just right.  And I think, well, part of that is that they make assumptions that being master chefs and having large restaurants where they would make what you wouldn't necessarily make yourself.
R:  Right, right.  Exactly.
L:  There are certain foods though, that I think I only will eat at home and prefer them at home.  One of them is chili.  Um, it's difficult to find a good chili, I think, outside of -- aside from like family recipes.  I haven't and I've been to -- haven't had too much success at restaurants.  Maybe I'm a chilidog, you know, but then you're not really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going for the chili.  Often meatloaf.  I just don't really trust meatloaf --
R:  In -- in a restaurant?
L:  Yeah.  I mean it's such a home food anyway.  Like if you're going to a restaurant why are you going to bother with the meatloaf?
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH].  That's true.  Um, going back to the chili thing, I guess it depends also on if you are referring to an east coast, ah, south or a west coast chili.  Now, I was raised --
L:  I don't know the difference.
R:  Actually, out here in the west --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the Rocky Mountain west, or the southwest, I should say, there's no beans.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or meat.  It's basically -- or there is meat.  It's pork and it's green chili.
L:  Oh yes.  I've heard about that --
R:  It's basically --
L:  I saw a TV show about the -- about chili cook off and they had, like a green chili kind of sub competition.
R:  Right, right.  It's fantastic.  It's really good.
L:  Really?
R:  I mean, coming from the east, going west, I would ask for chili and they would -- I would ask where the beans were and they just would laugh.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh.  So you're from the east originally?
R:  Ah, Midwest actually.
L:  Oh, Midwest.  Yeah, I'm from [inaudible].  That's where I am right now, actually.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, yeah, so our -- I'm in Massachusetts.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm in the -- the sort of food -- Yeah, the chili that we pretty much g- grew up with is a, you know, ground beef and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and dark red kidney beans.
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, green chili is just completely foreign to me.
R:  Yeah.  You should give it a try, like if you're in Albuquerque or Denver, it's really --
L:  Mm.
R:  Actually they call it the green chili trail from Denver to Albuquerque and you can find some nice little places off the highways.  You know, if you just go off on a highway -- off -- off the main highway --
L:  Right.
R:  And get in some good towns.  You know, Sante Fe or -- or -- or [inaudible] or something that you can find some really nice places.
L:  What makes the chili green?
R:  Ah, the green chilies?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't -- I don't -- I don't exactly what um, the type of chili is.  My buddy is a um, fireman, sorry, in Denver and every year they have a chili cook off for -- for charity and he's, you know, something of a master --
L:  Oh.
R:  --um, cook as far as that goes.  [LAUGH].
L:  Is the point to make the chili spicy or just [inaudible]?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, he makes it spicy.  I mean, you -- you can sort of vary it but he makes it very spicy and he -- I -- I think the best thing would be to -- is to fire roast, um, the chilies themselves.  And, like I said, he didn't know the name of them and I -- I don't think -- they might be Anaheim chilies.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I'm not certain.  It's sort of a light green.  Um, yeah, it's a sort of a light green chili.
L:  Yeah, in fact --
R:  But it's very tasty.
L:  In the chili that like I make, for example, we don't even have -- there aren't really whole chili peppers in it all.  The only -- to the only degree that there is chilies, is just chili powder.
R:  Right.
L:  Which isn't all that spicy even, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there is probably better chilies out there than the stuff that we make at home, but --
R:  That's the kind I grew up with too and I -- I love it.  I do like that.  You know, the kidney beans and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know it's very tasty.  Very tasty.  Um, before we run out of time I suppose, the second topic was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- describe your ideal --
L:  Oh yeah, ideal f- -- mm.
R:  -- meal.
L:  Well, um.  I would say it definitely has a lot to do with atmosphere.  Um, I really like um, you know, something that has a complete meal with an appetizer and then eventually dessert and obviously a good main course.  Um, I would say, um, I -- I love a nice r- rare tuna steak. 
R:  Mm.
L:  That's seasoned very well.
R:  Very nice.
L:  Um, with maybe a nice salad or perhaps something, I don't know, some sort of sausage or something as an appetizer and then ah, I -- I'm always partial to creme brule.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I know they have it at every restaurant which is good for me 'cause I like it with -- with a --
R:  Yeah, you get to compare, huh?
L:  With a nice thick espresso, I think, at the end.  How about yourself?
R:  Oh, that sounds -- that sounds great, actually.  Um, I guess I'm thinking of a -- of a nice Italian place, um -- you know, I lived in Chicago for eight years and um, go to Little Italy down there and have a nice -- you know, a simple salad maybe with some ruggela[?] or maybe just like a de presse[?], you know, with just really nice beef steak tomatoes.
L:  Mm.
R:  Ah, some, you know what it is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And a mozzarella and um, maybe just a -- a simple pasta --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe um, the -- the dish is actually -- is -- is escaping me at the moment.  Um, it's -- it's seafood.  It's got a bunch of -- oh --
L:  Clutinesto[?] or something, or?
R:  No.  No.  It's -- oh it's on the tip of my tongue.  It's um -- tu tu temarie[?].
L:  Oh, tu tu -- fridetema[?].  tu tu temarie or something like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  You're right, you're right.  frutitemarie[?].
L:  You get like -- it's got the clams and the oysters and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  Yes.
L:  I've had that before.
R:  And maybe, you know, a tiramisu and of course, um, a -- you know, a cappuccino.  [inaudible].  
L:  So --
R:  But that's a lot of food.
L:  Have you eaten in Italy before, then?
R:  Yes I have.
L:  Oh, 'cause you sound -- it sounds like you're describing a lot of meals I had the summer I was travelling in Italy.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  And boy, I just ate great all the time. 
R:  Ah.
L:  My -- my -- my friend, his family is from Sicily --
R:  Oh, fantastic.
L:  -- and we went there and ate his family's food and it's just -- the food is just tremendous there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It's mostly 'cause it's just coming from the ground.  You know, they pick the figs right off the trees and they -- they're just heavenly, yeah.
R:  Oh, fantastic.
L:  And -- but all over Italy, wherever we ate.  Even in-- even in like a train station where you wouldn't expect the food to be any good, it was still pretty good.  [LAUGH].
R:  There's something about the tomatoes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I was there and it was probably fifteen years ago, I was -- I stayed above the um, the market in Venice.
L:  Huh.
R:  And every morning I would go downstairs and you know, get tomatoes and cheese and bread and just -- there was something with the tomatoes and I haven't quite -- I haven't tasted tomatoes like that since --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, since I was a child.  I haven't tasted a tomato quite like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's something with -- you know, there -- there -- you know, the nutrients in the soil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they lack -- I think it's the lack of herbicides and things like that that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we use way too much of.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  Um, the -- for me, the best -- the thing that was the most notably different was the coffee and I -- I've -- and it's also been the hardest to replicate because I get some of um, ah, ah, my friend's foods 'cause  his -- his relatives live here and they -- they can do a pretty good approximation of like the brigoli's and the p- -- just the way they make pasta etcetera but um, and I guess it is true that the fresh vegetables are pretty hard to replicate but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but getting the coffee right.  I mean, I saw the way they made it and they even gave me a coffee maker so I could try making it myself and I brought back the right coffee.  Um, but, you know, they -- it's just like their espresso is just like it's really thick and it's got this nice little, ah, little ah, what do they call it?  Cream on top.
R:  Yeah, the cloudy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, the really nice cloudy little -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It just tastes so good and -- and you know, the -- the biggest reason I want to go back is just to go to those cafes again, and --
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I used to work for a restaurant company in Chicago and they -- they had a certain type of espresso that was the best I've had in America and the name, you know, escapes me so it really does no good.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, the coffee I brought back was Lavasca[?].  Which is --
R:  That's it, that's it.
L:  Oh, is that it?  Okay.
R:  That was it.  Absolutely.
L:  I brought back bricks and bricks of it, actually, but --
R:  Is that right?
L:  -- but they my coffee maker actually broke.  I, ah, I think I heated it up too much and the rubber kind of warped --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I ended up having to throw it away.  Like one of those --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know those octagonal metal coffee makers that they used?
R:  Sure.  Sure, I've got one of those.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
