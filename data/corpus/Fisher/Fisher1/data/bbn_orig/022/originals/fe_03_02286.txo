R:  Well, I'm [inaudible].
L:  Hey, I'm Christina.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  Pretty good.  
L:  Wh-
R:  So, do -- do you agree that, uh -- how long does a cold last for you?
L:  Um, I'm actually starting to get a cold, and it's finals week for me.
R:  Oh, ho, ho, ho.
L:  So, um, I think that if you just push through it, that it'll just go away on its own.
R:  See, uh, do you take, like, medicine and stuff for it?   
L:  I took a cough drop today, just 'cause I was -- I was, like, my throat was already sore and then I was stressed out, so I had some cigarettes and they just didn't work well together, so --
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's gonna dry out your throat even more.
L:  Yes.  So I just kinda have to stick with the caffeine instead of the other, you know, form of stress relief.
R:  Mhm.  So you're not --
L:  Do you take -- do you take any medicine?
R:  You know what?  Normally if I get a cold, no, I don't.  Uh, I -- I do like, uh, home remedies.  Like, you know, you know how mothers always have their home remedies?
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Like, whenever --
L:  -- a humidifier?
R:  Mm?
L:  Like a humidifier or --
R:  No.  You know, uh, you just starting to get a sore throat now?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, uh, you know what I've always managed to use, uh, like a glass of warm water --
L:  And salt?
R:  Salt.
L:  Yeah.  Totally.
R:  And -- and it -- it -- and believe it or not, it works.  It does --
L:  Sure.
R:  It does work, 'cause especially, oh, your throat gets like, dry [inaudible].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that gets tremendous then.  I also like to -- to tend to take, uh, honey sometimes.
L:  If I get honey and tea, is what my dad would always give me.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And you get warm tea and you get the honey, um, and the honey and tea also works well if you're, like, um if your bones are achy, you know?  It just -- I don't know why, it makes you just feel better, so --
R:  Helps, uh -- it does.  Yeah.  I -- I mean, more or less and -- or when my body starts aching --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I normally take an Aspirin or something, take two Aspirin.  But like, I tried over the counter cold medicine and all that, and it doesn't work.
L:  It works for my allergies.  Like, I take Benadryl.  I -- I sometimes -- I have Zirtec which is prescription.  I haven't taken it in a while 'cause I don't have a prescription renewal on it, but that --
R:  See, that's --
L:  That works good.
R:  I think, uh, I think that's what I have, too.  
L:  Zir-
R:  Now, let's see.  What do I have?  I think I have Zirtec.  Oh.
L:  Does it work for you?
R:  Oh, is this Zirtec?  I'm trying to figure out.  Um --
L:  Is it little with the square --
R:  Yeah, it's a square.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  And -- and it does work for me.  The only thing, you know what it does?
L:  Mm?
R:  It gives me a headache.
L:  Yes.  It does.
R:  And -- and -- and I go -- I go to bed 'cause, uh, the doctor told me take it at night, 'cause before I got sick and since I have asthma, I usually take it -- in the -- and I was having a hard time breathing, so they gave me Zirtec, right?
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I wake up in the morning and it's like, oh, my head is pounding.
L:  See, I just -- I get that if I don't have, um, if I don't have coffee.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I get headache all the time.
R:  Yes, see, because you're -- you're getting addicted to caffeine.
L:  It's the only -- it's the -- I usually eat organic foods and stuff and that's the only really bad thing that I -- that I put into my body, are is nicotine and caffeine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm terrible at it.  It counteracts everything that I do to be good, to be healthy.
R:  Yeah, it do.  Now, question; when you eat organic food, doesn't that help you out with your cold?
L:  It does.  I have not gotten sick all semester until now.  I think it's just because I'm stressed emotionally and I'm stressed school wise, that I'm starting to get maybe a little bit sick.
R:  Yeah.  And I heard about that, too, 'cause when you're stressed, your system, it -- it breaks down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know --
L:  And no sleep, if you don't get sleep, um, then you're more susceptible because that's when your body regenerates itself.
R:  True, yeah.
L:  So.  And I didn't go to bed until five o'clock this morning and I woke up at eight o'clock this morning --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and I haven't gone to bed yet.  So.
R:  Oh, you got that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's too much.
L:  I had two finals today.  What am I supposed to do?
R:  Oh, how'd you do?
L:  I did well.  I think -- my throat was hurting the whole time during, um, during my one final, but the other one, I got to eat lunch right -- I, like, rushed to get lunch and so um, you know, if you eat breakfast, then you're supposed to be better at school stuff in the morning I guess.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  So.
R:  See, I -- I'm a good morning person, but lately, once I take the Zirtec and then it comes time to wake up --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- it's like, I'm dragging.  Ever [inaudible] now, when you took it, did you have any other side effects?
L:  Um, it made me a little bit drowsy.  It said it wasn't supposed to, but um, it made me a bit drowsy and this is really odd, but I had problems with my blood uh, when I was taking it.  It would make my blood sugar be more -- not -- it wouldn't rise and fall, um, so much but it'd be more sensitive.  Like, if I took the Zirtec, it would be much more sensitive to what food I ate or um, you know, the medicines I had.  Or if I was ill, it'd be -- it would -- I'd have to really watch my blood sugar.  It'd be a lot different, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the on- did you have any side effects with it?
R:  Uh, just -- just the headaches.  That's all I -- that's all I've gotten so far, and it's like I --
L:  Have you tried --
R:  -- feel tired, because I only -- I take them at night before I go to bed.
L:  Have you tried Claritin at all?
R:  Uh --
L:  It's another brand.
R:  No, I haven't.  
L:  Because I used to take Claritin and that was really good.  The only thing about Claritin, um, it didn't make me drowsy or anything.  I just -- it was too expensive, that's all.
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  So I'm not taking -- I'm not taking any medicine right now.  Um, after the take -- I took a while ago, like, about a year ago, so --
R:  Yeah.  See, I have to take -- 'cause I'm the -- I won't take medicine or go to the doctor at all.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I never go.
R:  You know, I'm --
L:  I went to the health clinic because I had to get my physical for, um --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- for my -- for my trip that I'm going on.  That's the only reason why I went.
R:  Oh, where you going?
L:  I went to the Ukraine.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm teaching English there, so that should be fun.  We leave May fifteenth, so --
R:  For how long?
L:  Um, I'll be there until -- well, my girlfriend's coming back on June third.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I am staying in London because I have family there.  I -- I -- I'm a British citizen, but I was born, um, but I lived, I grew up in the United States.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I -- I have family there and I want to visit my grandfather.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause I haven't seen him in a -- about two years, 'cause --
R:  So --
L:  -- I've been at school and so I'm staying an extra week there over from my trip and then I'm coming back and I'm actually staying and doing school the summer, too.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  That'll work.  'Cause you -- you -- and now, aren't you -- aren't you scared, like when you're -- when you're -- when you're sick?  You know what the big fear for me now is?
L:  What?
R:  If I get sick, if you -- if -- if I'm going to catch that SARS.  'Cause you don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I -- I don't think I'm worried about that.  I -- I mean, I guess you could call me, like, a naturalist.  Like, I guess -- and you'll be like, nature will prevail, or nature will eventually win in the end, no matter what you try to do?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I do do prevention things, but I think if it happens, it happens.  And there's gonna a reason for everything.  Do you believe there's a reason for everything?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There is.
L:  So, and I've seen really in my life some of the bad things that have happened to me, turned around and then the best things, and the most times where I've grown the most and I've really learned a lot and God's really shown me what I could do, to like make my -- my life better through the hard times.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, 'cause have you ever tried those zinc tablets?
L:  Um, I don't think if there's zinc in my multi vitamin or not.  I have -- oh yeah, I take iron, too.  Um, I have -- on there it's got -- it's uh, formula and it's got -- I don't think it has zinc in it, but my teacher was telling me about zinc.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it -- see, I -- see, I don't even take multi vitamins at all.
L:  Well, this is just iron.
R:  Mhm.  I'm a -- and my mother always says, yeah, it builds up your resistance, helps you with colds and all that, and -- and I -- I'm the type -- I get sick maybe once a year, knock on wood, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Really?
R:  Once a year, and it's like -- when I get sick, I get real sick.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, and like --
L:  Have you been sick, like, this year?
R:  Um, it usually goes -- oh, it varies.  With the change of weather.  If I don't take care of myself, like now, it -- it's cooler, it's -- it was supposed to be eighty two, it's warm, then it cools down real quick.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Uh, in Pennsly- in Philadelphia.
L:  In Philadelphia?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I visited there once.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I went on a missioner's trip with my youth choir.
R:  Oh.
L:  When -- it was a couple of years ago 'cause I'm not in the choir any more, but --
R:  Oh, okay.  Where do you live?
L:  Um, I live in Seattle.
R:  Oh, you calling from Seattle?
R:  No, I'm actually calling from Tennessee --
