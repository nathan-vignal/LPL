R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Chrissie from New York.
R:  Hi, how are you doing?  JC from Philly.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good.
L:  All right.  So, food.  Do you like food?
R:  I love food.  I'm Italian.  I have no choice.
L:  What?
R:  I'm Italian.  I have no choice. 
L:  I am too.  Exactly.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's part of the culture.
R:  Right.
L:  It's all about food.  It's funny.  [inaudible] asking him, you know, do you speak Italian?  And he said, "The only thing that I can speak is about food".
R:  Right.
L:  Which totally makes sense.  [LAUGH].
R:  Food and the curse words, right?
L:  Exactly.  That's it.  The food, the curse words.  You know, like the your mother [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do you eat out a lot or do you like to eat at home?
R:  I eat out all the time and I absolutely hate it.
L:  You hate it?  Why do you hate eating out?
R:  Um, I guess because I have no choice.
L:  Okay.
R:  And because I won't eat --
L:  Can you cook?
R:  -- Italian food, out.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, I don't know, a lot of times I look at my waiter and I [inaudible], you know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, ah, I -- I eat out almost every single day, at least one meal.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um.
L:  Is it like lunch usually, or dinner?
R:  It's usually lunch or if I'm working late, I'll catch dinner or sometimes breakfast.  Like there's always a meal that I eat out every single day.  I don't live at home anymore, so.  But, ah, yeah it's 'cause I'm always on the road for work.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Contractor.
L:  Contractor.  Yes, so you're out there.
R:  Yeah.  I build it.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So, ah, I don't know.  I -- I -- I don't know.  I'd rather eat at home 'cause, um, my aunt sends me over gravy and it's better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you call it gravy or sauce?
L:  We call it gravy.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Yeah.  We -- we're old school Italian, like came over into Chicago.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because my -- my ex-girlfriend's family didn't understand why I was calling red spaghetti sauce, gravy.
L:  I know.  They -- whenever I go to a restaurant and like I have to like remember like sea sauce.  Sea tomato sauce.  And it's like --
R:  Yeah.  Say tomato sauce and you'll get like hollandaise.  [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  You get hollandaise.
L:  Exactly.  Well, we call it gravy.  You know, gravy is the stuff that has the meat in it.  You know, every Sunday.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yes, so.
R:  And marinari[?] you just call marinara[?].
L:  Yeah.  It's marinara and then there's sauce and then there's you know, alfredo.
R:  Exactly.
L:  There's a lot of things that they do now that's Italian food.  Like, I don't know.  I guess it's Italian but it's kind of like Chinese food here.  It's not what Chinese people would eat.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, it's not what Chinese people-- it's not what It-  That's why I said, I don't go out to Italian restaurants.
L:  Yes, 'cause it's just not like, I mean, I don't know, it's just not traditionally what my family would eat, ever.
R:  Never.
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  And I laugh at every Olive Garden commercial.
L:  Like, I think about pizza, like even pizza, like we didn't eat pizza.  We certainly didn't eat circle pizza, ever.
R:  Yeah, we ate square.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So. are you Sicilian or northern?
R:  Actually, ah, my grandfather was born in Sicily.
L:  Okay.
R:  In a town that actually he bears the name of.
L:  Okay.
R:  A town called Lodico[?] and that's my grandfather's last name.
L:  So you are mostly Sicilian then?
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] --
L:  Or all?
R:  Dons and Sicilian.
L:  Yeah, we have both too, in mine.
R:  My grandmother was from Northern Italy.
L:  Did your grandmother always tell you to pick women with long waists?
R:  With long waists?
L:  Did she tell you that?  Long waist and light eyes.  You don't want those dark girls with the thin waist, the small waist.
R:  No, my grandmother passed away when I was nine.  I didn't get the good advice.
L:  See, I think if she had lived longer, that would have been the advice. It seems to be --
R:  You got light eyes and long hair and long waist?
L:  I -- I actually -- I don't.  Which is funny.  And neither did she.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's sort of like one of those things, you know, which she always would say.  Don't go -- like she would say to my uncle -- because I was very young when my grandmother passed away too.  My great grandmother.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she would say, "Don't go for those ones with the thin waist".
R:  I -- I'm so lucky though 'cause um, my two sisters and my brother, they -- they all have brown eyes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I've got ice blue.
L:  Sweet.
R:  Yeah.  And I --
L:  You got the northern thing.
R:  -- got my grandmother's eyes.  I got my grandmother's eyes and I lucked out.
L:  Especially here.  It's definitely lucky.
R:  I lucked out.  Everybody in my family, like light blond hair.  Like -- not every body in my family.  My brothers and sisters, light blonde hair and brown eyes.  Me, chestnut hair, blue eyes.  I look like the frigging m- mailman.
L:  Do they hate you?
R:  No.  They love me.  My brothers and sisters.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I hate them.  My brother looks like Brad Pitt.
L:  Sweet.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, for him.
L:  Yeah, for him, exactly.
R:  Actually, he's pretty pissed off.  My brother's older.  He's in his thirties and he's married with kids and all.  And he's like, yeah, Jay, where was this Brad Pitt kid when I was in high school?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause my brother looks like Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall to long hair down to his waist or whatever.  Rides a horse, like he's got a horse and stuff.  So we call him "Legends".
L:  So I'm sure that the girls are all over him, then.
R:  Doesn't matter.  He's married with children.
L:  I know.  But I'm just saying.
R:  He lives in Florida now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And his next door neighbor's like Don Johnson or whatever.
L:  Ah.
R:  So everybody thinks it's him.
L:  It's very funny.
R:  He gets asked for autographs and shit by like all the little ten year olds.
L:  Does he do it?
R:  Sometimes for laughs.  He will sign his name and they get home and they'll be like, wait, what?  It doesn't say Brad Pitt.  [LAUGH].
L:  That's very funny.
R:  Giovanni, what?  [LAUGH].
L:  Do you have a very Italian name?
R:  Me?  No.  A very Irish name.
L:  Ir-  Are you Irish and Italian?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, really.  Kindred spirits.  That's exactly what I am.
R:  Yeah, I'm Irish too.
L:  I'm Christina Maria Regina Westcote.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, you wound up like me.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Jason Noel Salvatore Calvin.  [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH].  It's very funny.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Was your mom Italian?
R:  Yes --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- she was the first one born in this country.
L:  [LAUGH].  Mine too.
R:  She was the first one born in this country --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and um, my -- this is great.  When my mom and my dad got married, my grandfather wouldn't go.
L:  Because he was an Irish guy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, there's a whole thing in my family too.
R:  He wouldn't go.
L:  It was like, I mean --
R:  My uncle Joe gave my mom away.
L:  -- he would have preferred to marry a black man.  You know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right.  It was the equivalent, wasn't it?
L:  It was.  It really is.  Like, you know, I'm the Devil's spawn.
R:  Right.
L:  According to the Italian side.  And the Irish side, you know, the Italians are [inaudible] too.  They don't like them either.
R:  Nowadays.  It could have been a lot worse.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  I'm like, I'm only Irish.  I thank God.  Well, I don't know.  What part of New York are you from?
L:  New York City.
R:  Are you from the city?
L:  Mhm.
R:  From Manhattan?
L:  Yep.
R:  Nice.
L:  Well, you know, I was born there.  Actually I live in Queens now.
R:  Queens.
L:  'Cause it's just awfully expensive there.
R:  Are you a Queen?
L:  No, I'm n- not a Queen, but --
R:  Princess?
L:  -- actually my uncles who I -- who I live across the hall with, are.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good to know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you like Queens?
L:  I like Queens.  It's fine enough, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I spent part of my childhood here because you know, coming from an Irish family, I live in the Irish section.  I live in Woodside.
R:  Okay.
L:  So there's all these Irish pubs and all these Irish diners.
R:  No doubt.
L:  Yeah, like diner pub type of things which I love to go to.
R:  Yeah, what, pubs?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You do karaoke and shit?
L:  No, no.
R:  Thank God.
L:    Not that kind of pubs.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I just like, you know, I'm a sportsperson so.
R:  You know the difference between a pub and bar, right?  True definition?
L:  I know they serve food.  That'd be my assumption.  I don't know.
R:  A pub does not serve alcohol.  It only serves beer and wine.
L:  Interesting.  I didn't know that.
R:  And in Florida, that's the legal definition on the license.
L:  Fascinating.
R:  Because in Florida you could be a store, a pub or a restaurant with a -- with a beer and wine license or you could be a full-fledged bar or a full-fledged restaurant with -- with a full liquor license.  They actually sell all of them in Florida.
L:  Wow.  I didn't --
R:  'Cause we were drinking at spring break and we were like, yow, shots of kamikazes and he said he couldn't do it.
L:  'Cause he's a pub?
R:  And I'm like, "This is a bar, ain't it?"  And he goes, "No, it's a pub."  "Like whatever, make me my kamikaze before I give you a slap."  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my.  [LAUGH],
R:  So, ah, yeah, that's how it worked out.
L:  Was that recently?
R:  I just got back from spring break.
L:  Excellent.
R:  Fuck.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Thirty.
L:  Did you feel really old?
R:  No.
L:  I'm -- I'm twenty eight and my friends just went and they said they felt like totally old.
R:  No, I didn't because --
L:  You didn't?
R:  -- I knew a bunch of people down there.
L:  They felt like dirty old men.
R:  No.  I look like twenty five.  But, ah, I -- I mean, ah, I don't know, I was down there with a bunch of friends, so I didn't care.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we went down like -- we spent five days in Orlando so.
L:  I used to live down there.
R:  What, Florida?
L:  In Orlando actually.
R:  How'd you like it?
L:  Um, I liked it except for that the people were totally racist and homophobic and sexist.
R:  And all tourists.
L:  And all t-  I mean the thing is it's like they're the nicest people and they sound like their door is always open and you can always come in and have a cup of coffee --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as long as you're white.  You know?  [LAUGH].  It's sort of like that.
R:  Yeah, well.  Here's the other thing though.  I tell you what.  I live in Philly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's pretty rough up here right now like, I mean, like it -- it's rough.  Like you don't want to be like white, Italian, Irish, Jewish, nothing.
L:  Really?
R:  You don't want to be anything but black in South Philly right now.  Well, in Philadelphia as in general.  It's getting bad so, like, I got down there --
L:  In terms of crime, do you mean?
R:  Oh my God.  I got.  Me and my boy just got stabbed.
L:  Oh no.
R:  I got stabbed like thirteen times, like three months ago.
L:  Wow.  That sucks.
R:  For being white.  And this is what happened.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  A bunch of black people were -- were putting beer bottles through the car behind us at the red light and we jumped out to do something about it and like, forty black people came out of their houses and shit.  And I could not believe it.  I just could not believe it.  The cops drove by and wouldn't stop.  Like the cops were afraid for their lives.
L:  White cops?
R:  White cops would not get out of the car.  I was like, you got to be kidding me, man.
L:  That's really scary.
R:  It was really scary.  I -- I started dropping people with anything I could grab.  Like I turtled.  And this one big dude, he was like shack size.  He knocked my body out.  I was fighting him on the hood of a car and I got his big puffy jacket off of him and I like pulled it over my head and just turtled on the ground.  I was getting kicked for like fifteen minutes.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  My friend came and picked me up.  He was like, "Yow, dude, you all right?" and like, yeah, he's like, "Your back is bleeding to death, dude".
L:  Oh, no.  So you got to go to the hospital?
R:  He goes, "I think you rolled over on some glass."  I pulled my shirt off.  He's like, "No dude, you got hit by --
