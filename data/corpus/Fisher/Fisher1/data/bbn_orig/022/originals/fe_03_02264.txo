L:  Hi, my name is Andrew.
R:  Hi, I'm Garrett.
L:  Hi, Garrett.  Um, okay.  I guess I'll get started.
R:  Go for it.
L:  Um, I have, ah, seasonal allergies, so I get -- I would say, yes, that when the seasons change, it does affect my health in some ways.  Ah, I don't have bad seasonal allergies, thankfully, but I do have some allergies, um, usually like, you know, ah, once spring kinda gets going, um, sometime like round March, maybe, and it usually only lasts for a few days.  But, ah, I do get affected and I know, ah, other people who have, you know, allergies of greater severity, so.
R:  I know people with the same situation.  I actually am not in that situation, believe it or not.  Um, I don't really feel the change of seasons more than just, ah, enjoying them [LAUGH].  I don't, ah, get affected by pollen and things like that in the air, but I do a lot of people do.  There's a lot of allergies that relate to the change of seasons.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, and I've actually never really lived in areas where the change of seasons is very pronounced.  I grew up in Texas and so you really pretty much have hot and not as hot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And in here -- I live now in Tennessee where I go to university, ah, in Knoxville and, ah, there's a little bit more, ah, +pronunciation of seasons.  We have a distinct summer, a distinct winter and then there's a -- there's a fall that falls somewhere in there and then there's a spring.  So we -- we have, ah, you know, seasons much more than in Texas, but still it's not anywhere like I would guess maybe the more northern kinda states in the United States where --
R:  I'd agree with you.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  I -- I grew -- I actually grew up in Texas as well, actually.
L:  Oh. okay.
R:  Um, in Austin --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and you definitely w- it definitely felt the summers.  I -- I completely agree with --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you on that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm actually in New York now and there is a more -- there is a major shift between the season, I think, um, the -- we just came out of winter, really, and even we're in spring having little touches of winter.  But when it's winter here, it is very, very cold and I hear some areas are very hot.  I haven't experienced one yet, but [SIGH] I do know there's a major change and -- and there are people -- a lot of people take allergy shots.  Do you take allergy shots for the change of seasons to help you or --
L:  No, I've never -- I've never r- ah, never been diagnosed with allergies severe enough that I took allergy sot- -- shots.  I had a friend growing up in Texas who did take allergy shots and I'm not exactly sure what allergens affected that person, but he took allergy shots, ah, so, ah, there's that.  And then, you know, too, a lot of t- ah, I've -- I've seen things recently where they say that some of the allergy problems people have are associated also with, like, smog and things that they can experience in cities so, ah, have you ever noticed, um -- you say yourself you don't have allergy problems, but people you know there in New York, do they complain of allergies maybe more than you knew when you lived in Texas?
R:  Um, well, ah, I think it's really just a change of environment but I think I see it lot in a difference -- different ways.  Um, I've seen people who -- seen people who grew up here.  They have sort of a -- I -- I -- I don't know what it's called.  You know, environmental allergies, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you grow up and you sort of -- when the season changes, your -- your body decides that now this is going to be the time when you're allergic to certain things [LAUGH] and [SIGH] I think your body feels that.  And in Texas I saw the same thing.  I mean is it -- it's so amazing the difference between [SIGH] -- because we don't have any of the things here in New York that I really saw in Texas in that sort of a way.
L:  Right.
R:  And the environment's so different.  But I do see people, you know, every -- I -- I -- I think you can actually develop, you know, allergies to the region, actually, based on, you know, the seasons as well [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Is that -- is that something -- do you know -- you live in [NOISE] Tennessee now.  Do you experience a lot of ch- is there a lot of differences in their allergies from there to Texas?  Did you say you did or you did not or what is that?
L:  Um, well, I -- I -- I would have to say that I've noticed at times when the -- when the pollen is prevalent here, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- feels more -- ah, my allergies are more quickly and more severely affected probably than when I lived in Texas.  And it's interesting.  I -- I lived like around -- I also lived [NOISE] around Austin part of the time [NOISE] when I lived in Texas and I lived round San Antonio and I'm going [NOISE] to be finishing up here at UT and I'm going to be going to Lubbock -- going to be moving to Lubbock to go to Texas State Law School.  And that will be an interesting part of Texas to be in, because there it's higher up so, ah, the allergens probably won't be as bad and it's a lot drier.  So I'm interested in [NOISE] seeing [NOISE] what kind of effect that will have on my allergies.  Hopefully, it will mean I won't have any allergy problems or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, just bear a few allergy problems.  But, ah, I'll just have to wait and see, really.
R:  When you do experience your greatest sort of, ah, allergies?  When -- when do those really come out most?
L:  Yeah, it -- it's kind of like around the end of February, beginning of March.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, ah, ah, sometimes in the summer, like I would guess maybe around July and then sometimes like in the middle of the fall.  And see I take a -- I have a prescription for, ah, Allegra, you know, an allergy medication --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I can take once daily but, except during those severe times, I don't end up doing -- doing that like -- for like I would say the last three weeks, I've probably taken my Allegra once every three days or something like that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Just --
R:  Yeah -- I -- I do think though a lot of time when the spring changes and things are starting to come out because, you know, in the winter, so many things aren't alive and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mold's not high and --
L:  And I guess --
R:  -- all.
L:  -- what I was saying about the Allegra ties in with the other part of their automated question there about -- I think they -- the question was, ah, referred to the statement -- I've never heard this statement --
R:  Neither have I.
L:  -- that -- that, ah, you go to a doctor, oh -- do -- do you remember exactly what it was?
R:  It was something like, do you go to a doctor seven days before a change in season, you know, and sort --
L:  Or something.
R:  -- of -- I -- as --
L:  I --
R:  -- something like that.
L:  -- yeah, I think it was just referring to the fact that -- that sometimes people just, ah, they don't --
R:  They don't know they're getting a change of season --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they decide to make it a -- a -- a -- do you -- you don't do anything like that?
L:  No, I mean, ah, the only thing I mean I go to a doctor for related to allergies is just to get a refill on my prescription of Allegra --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really.  And, ah, and I'm never even really gone in -- you know, they have a whole test where they -- they can, ah, they have needles, you know, and they -- they have this whole tray of needles where they -- they stick you with different kind of allergens --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and they see how you react and, ah, ah, and then that kind of -- they then determine what kind of shot regimen, I guess, to put you on for that.
R:  Oh, I've never heard that before, but that's -- ah, that -- in -- in -- in -- you've done that before, huh?
L:  No, I've never done that before.  My friend I said that had the allergies, ah, that had allergens, I remember [COUGH] I went with, um -- because I stayed with his mom, ah, after school, I remember one time we went to the doctor and I don't know, ah, for some reason I went back with them to the actual doctor's area and they had this little thing and it had just a whole bunch of needles on it.  And I was like, "What is that for?"  And he's like, "Well, that -- they use that to test me for the allergies".  I was like, "Whoa, I don't what that".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that --
R:  Well, that actually might be a really good thing, for someone to figure out.  I've never -- I -- I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just see people come and they're doing the same thing and it might be a good way to figure out, you know, what you are allergic to and so then you know when the change of season comes.  It actually might help you in the process of figuring out [SIGH], you know, what -- do you need to start really getting more of a medication that you might stop one during the break, you know, and --
L:  Right, and actually, ah, I -- the lady I work for, my boss, she has a lot of allergies and not all of them are necessarily sea -- necessarily seasonally related.  She has, ah, a lot of food allergies too and so she went through that whole diagnostic test that they offer and found out all the different kinds of -- of allergens she has.  She's got like, you know, she's allergic to, um, cheese and things and -- and she's got some, um, kind of pollen, ragweed allergies that she's mentioned before.  But she has a whole host of allergies.  I mean it's -- it's [LAUGH] pretty bad.
R:  It's -- it's a lot [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, a lot.
R:  Well, in -- in -- in -- and it really is I -- I think that a lot of, um, I think a lot of allergies do happen, ah -- I think the winter actually is probably the calmest time of the year for -- for a lot of people, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, allergy wise I think really summer is probably the worst for everybody.  I think summer's the most challenging for anybody. I really think that's when every -- I don't know.  I just -- I -- I think -- think that seems to be when I see a lot of people, you know, sniffling a lot and having a lot more of effects of it, even though winter's as -- a huge time of year.  You imagine people getting cold and such, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think this is when you really, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I think I think of summer, really, as when I see a lot of people get sick and take breaks and things like that and they're always talking about their sinuses and I think sinuses are -- have a relation to your allergies and everything like that as well --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- obviously.
L:  I -- I'm -- and I'm sitting here and I'm -- I -- I have the TV muted and I'm just kind of looking at the pictures as -- as I talk with you and, ah, they had just had a commercial for Clarinex[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is one of those big, ah, allergy drugs and, ah, ah, you almo- it's, ah, it's interesting just how many medications they have out there nowadays to treat [COUGH] -- excuse me -- all kinds of allergies that you can have and, ah, I just kind of wonder how in the past, ah, before they had all these drugs, I mean, maybe like they -- like, you know, they quoted some of these old sayings on the automated message before the conversation started.  Um, I wonder if -- if people just kind of, well, what kind of folk remedies or -- or just what whatever kind of remedies people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had when they had severe allergies back then.
R:  Yeah, I was actually -- ah, I was actually wondering if there was anything that you knew of, other than just general allergy medicines that you knew of.  You take Allegra, you said, but do you -- is there anything that you can do during the change of season that actually helps you to sort of get into it better and you don't feel the effects of the -- the allergies as much as
