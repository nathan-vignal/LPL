L:  Hi, my name is Stacey.
R:  Hi, I'm Fred.  [PAUSE] Are you there?
L:  Ah, yep, I'm here [LAUGH].
R:  I think we're supposed to talk about illness.  Is that it?
L:  I'm not quite sure.  There was a whole lot to that one there.
R:  Yeah, there really was.  I was a bit confused.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah --
L:  I'm glad I'm not the only one, then.  Um, I caught one part where -- where what -- what do you do to keep yourself well.  Um, I'm into holistic medicine.  I don't take -- I don't take medications, so --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, I'm more of a, ah, I'm a gym buff.  I spend a lot of time at the gym, um --
R:  You should meet my brother.  He's a holistic veterinarian.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, he's in Northern California.
L:  Well, I -- I've never heard of that.  I'm in Florida.  I've never heard -- I've never heard of that down here.
R:  Yeah, he, ah, ah, does a great deal, like, ah, he doesn't believe in feeding dogs or cats canned food.  It has to be, ah, like fresh meat and that's really all he believes in feeding dogs is -- is meat.
L:  Oh, wow.  I didn't -- that's, that's wild.
R:  And he won't do any, ah -- oh, he gets a lot of clients coming in that want him to do things like, ah, ah, bob the dog's ears or tails and he won't do any of that work, ah, which probably what, what makes him the least paid veterinarian in the United --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- States [LAUGH].  But, ah, to get back on the -- on the, ah, on the topic they asked us to talk about, is illness.  I don't get sick.  I- i- in other words, I'm sixty one years old and I have never been sick, except when I had to have surgery.  Then I got sick.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, I've had a lot of, ah, vascular leg surgery and abdominal aneurisms, so I was sick from that stuff and of course it's changed my life and my eating habits, ah, but as far as getting a flu or a cold, I just don't seem to get those things.
L:  I- I don't either.  And I have four children.  I have a sixteen year old, a twelve year old, a three year old and a two year old and, um, even when they get to sick, ah, they get sick and they get the flu, it -- it never seems to come to me and, and [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me too, I've never really, unless I have to have surgery or -- or something of that sorts.  Um, I had cervical cancer when I was twenty one and, um, I had that removed.  It's, it's never returned so, yeah, it's -- the only time I've ever really gotten sick myself is basically when I've had to go have surgeries too.  Um, I don't know whether it's -- it's -- it's my eating habits or, uh, you know.  Like I said, I go to the gym three days a week and, [LIPSMACK] and it's, um, you know running behind my children, so I don't know whether it's, ah, it, it helps my immunity system and k- where I'm keeping so active, um, but, no, I don't have -- really have a problem with illnesses either at all.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right now, we have, ah, um, there's, ah, my, ah, my best friend who I see on a daily basis, they all started getting a cold and her four month old son they put in the hospital last night with pneumonia.  And I mean I've been around every one of them, every one of them are sick and I'm fine.  I don't -- I --
R:  What do you attribute it to?
L:  Um, [MN] the only thing I attribute it to is i- is -- is -- is keeping -- is keeping active and -- and the way I eat.  Um, I -- you know, I do -- I do watch what I eat to a certain point, um, I don't eat a lot of, ah, I -- I don't, don't eat a lot of fried foods.  I do like fried foods but I don't eat of lot of 'em.  Um, if I do do 'em, uh, I'll do it once a week, maybe.  Um, but I -- I try to stay away from the fried -- the fried, greasy foods.  My only problem, probably, with, you know, with eating habits would be caffeine.  I'm the Mountain Dew queen.  I should take stock in Mountain Dew company.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I know Mountain Dew quite well.  I like it, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I don't like coffee.  If my mom gets on to me for -- I get up and I don't have any Mountain Dew, I freak out and I -- you know, I don't drink coffee.  I have to have my Mountain Dew.
R:  In New York, we have a soda, a coffee soda, called Manhattan Special.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And boy, does that pack a wallop! [LAUGH]
L:  I'm, ah, that -- that's -- it's -- is it -- it's like a cold -- is it a cappuccino?
R:  I- i- it's a little teeny bottle of -- of, ah, just dark coffee.  I mean, you know, no, no cream or milk in it, it's just black coffee.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's slightly carbonated but it -- it packs a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good caffeine punch.  I love it.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Do -- do you have a pencil handy?
L:  Do I have -- oh, yeah, sure do.
R:  Okay.  I just ran across earlier today a place o- online where you could take two surveys and -- and make up to forty bucks, if you're interested.
L:  Okay.
R:  H.T.T.P.
L:  H.T. -- oh, I'm sorry.
R:  H.T.T.P.
L:  H.P.P.T.?
R:  No, H. as in Harry, T.T. as in tom-tom, P. as in Paul --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a- and what are the -- what are two dots called?  Ah, one on top of the other?  Ah --
L:  Right, I know what you mean.
R:  Okay, then slash slash.
L:  Okay.
R:  Vlab.  V. as in victory, L.A.B.
L:  Okay.
R:  Dot C.E.B.I.Z.
L:  C.E.B.I.Z.
R:  Dot org.
L:  Dot org.
R:  It's something at Columbia University and there were two.  They were fun.  One involved, ah, ah, just stating your opinions and the other one involved a little gambling.  You pick whether you want to do this as a sure thing or whether you wanna take this at ten to one and how you gamble depays[?] how much you pay.  You coulda got paid up to forty bucks.  I only made eight dollars [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But it -- it was a fun way to kill a, ah, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it took about forty minutes.
L:  Ah, how long have you been, ah, doing this one?  This is -- this is like -- m- m- my second call, so ...
R:  I started yesterday.
L:  Yesterday?
R:  And I did two yesterday and I guess this is my third and last.
L:  That -- well, now I know there was another part.  You could sign up for tw- like, twenty five more calls.  I don't know whether they're gonna to continue it or --
R:  Oh, I said I would.
L:  Ah, me too.
R:  And, um, I have a little website and I posted it on the website, uh, ah, and but then [MN] I have not figured out how to really promote my -- my website yet, so a -- a lot of people don't get it --
L:  [MN]
R:  But maybe I'll key it on a few referrals.
L:  [NOISE] There you go. But, ah, no, I don't know what else -- you -- there was so much said that -- when she was talking about the topic of the day, [NOISE] and that's why I don't -- what sure she said. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she said something about an apple a day keeps the doctor away or something in that genre.
L:  [NOISE] Then that must be they were talking about th- the way you eat, keeping yourself, y- y- your body clean or, you know, the, ah, I guess keeping the vessel --
R:  I'm sure that would do -- I mean I try to watch my cholesterol 'cause I have high cholesterol and I've had a heart attack.  Ah, so I do watch that, but being I've have, ah, had so much vascular surgery, I'm in the house so much that I eat out of boredom.
L:  Ah, right, right.
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yes, I'm here.
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- I just heard a click.  Ah, when I had my abdominal surgery, I came out of the hospital weighing one sixty and now I'm up to two thirty and I've got to stop.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I've got to --
L:  Now, this is from -- from like varicose veins or --
R:  It --
L:  -- is that kinda -- is that --
R:  -- it was just a birth defect, something I've had for my whole life and after sixty years, it fell apart [LAUGH].
L:  Well see, now I have, ah, I'm, I'm an ex entertainer, sixteen years from being on my heels all my life.  I'm only thirty three but, ah, I have, ah, varicose veins and I believe they have a life in them, a heartbeat of their own.  I mean they're so bad that it looks like, um, a-- a cable.  There are several, several cables running through my -- through my calves, they're so bad.  And if that's -- I was wondering if that's what you meant, those kinda, that kinda vascular --
R:  No, no.  Ah, ah, they were aneurisms in the leg where the, the walls of the veins got weak and broke.  And, ah, not only did I have both legs done, but both of those failed and I'm subs- subsequently had replacement surgery done.  And I think both legs just have one vein running through them and that vein is, ah, a store bought vein, you know.  I mean --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I mean I -- I get around pretty good.  I can walk, just as long as I don't have to -- as I can stop --
L:  Right.
R:  -- after walking like a block, I need to stop for like, ten, fifteen seconds and then I can continue.
L:  That's wonderful that you can -- you can -- you're still out, you can still do it.
R:  Yeah, my advice to you about getting old is don't do it, it sucks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm trying.  I tried to quit at twenty five.  It's just these birthdays keep coming.
R:  I know.  I can't believe how long ten minutes is [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my goodness.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Well --
R:  Um, do you -- do you eat meat?
L:  Oh, yes.  If it was up to me that -- I would have red m- -- I'm a red meat freak.
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  And, ah, I mean if it was up to me, I would have steak and baked potato every night for the rest of my life and it would never bother me.  No --
R:  The thing I miss the most is I used to eat liver at least once a week and I miss liver, but I don't eat it any more.
L:  No, that's never been my forte.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] --
L:  Not at all.  Not at all.  But no, I -- I get this big thing from my husband, something about, ah, when you eat, when you -- when you p- when you finally pass, say how much red meat they find in the body from where people have eaten so much [several inaudible words], they'll find a whole cow inside a me when I'm gone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  I -- I love my red meat.  [NOISE] And, um, and what part of New York are you in?
R:  I'm right in New York City, right in the middle.  I live on twenty seventh street on the East Side.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Ah, matter of fact, I had some view of the World Trade Center the day it came down.
L:  Ah, wow.
R:  Ah, from my roof, I watched it fall.
L:  Oh, my gracious.
R:  And I watched the second plane smash into it.
L:  [NOISE] Ah!
R:  And I was very -- it was very strange because -- it was surreal because I knew all this tragedy was happening like, two miles away.  There wasn't anything I could do and I've just -- I just felt helpless.
L:  I can
