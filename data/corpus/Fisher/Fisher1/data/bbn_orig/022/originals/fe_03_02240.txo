R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Well, ah, I guess th- the topic of the day is food and [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I myself, would much rather eat in a restaurant because I'm a single mother and, um, I'm always having to cook and ah, plus it's cheaper to cook, ah, so -- so I enjoy being served once in a while.  [LAUGH].
R:  Absolutely.
L:  I prefer -- which do you prefer?  Eating in a restaurant or at home?
R:  Oh, eating in a restaurant, absolutely, especially if somebody is picking up the check.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  [inaudible].  Definitely.  I like that answer.  That -- that's even better.  Somebody else picking up the check.  I like that, yeah.
R:  Where -- where do you live?
L:  I live in -- in Los Angeles.  Whereabouts do you live?
R:  Fullerton.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah, Fullerton.
L:  Well -- well --
R:  Did you hear about this in the LA Weekly?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I tell you, um, it's, ah, I love, ah, I love the idea to ah, eat at restaurants and have as many people pay the -- the tab as possible.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  What kind of -- what kind of restaurant do you prefer, though?
L:  Um, well, ah, I like them all.  I live all kinds of food.  But my favorite is pizza.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh really?
L:  Ah, but -- ah, yeah.  But I also like seafood but my -- definitely pizza.  I -- I -- I love going out to eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and having pizza and --
R:  Mm.  One of the best places is at the beach in Huntington Beach --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- where you can get oysters Rockefeller.
L:  Oh, that sounds great.
R:  At Harpoon Harry's.  Oh, they're great.  Mm, yum.
L:  Oh, I have to check that out.  I love the beach too.  Too, especially to eat at the beach.  Ah, one time I went and ate -- well, this was many, many years ago, but at Gladstone's in Malibu beach and I just thought that was so -- and it was on a date and I just thought it was so neat just sitting there by the seashore and eating seafood and --
R:  Oh, I love -- I love restaurants.
L:  Yeah, I love restaurants.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, to me, I can't think of anybody who would say that they would rather eat at home.
R:  Eat at home.
L:  [LAUGH].  Than a restaurant.
R:  Well, no.  I once -- I once went with somebody who was a very good cook --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was almost like eating at a restaurant because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was such a good cook ...
L:  Ah huh.
R:  But the only part about it is, it was like, it was like an all night marathon thing and I'm not sure why -- I guess because he made it like -- I don't know, like someone would, um, do like a hobby or something.  He would take a very long time and you would always, like, end up eating like about ten, eleven o'clock at night when you really, you know, aren't enjoying it as much but it was fabulous, you know?
L:  Wow.
R:  He made beautiful meals.
L:  What do you mean?  Um, marathon.  You mean, like he kept cooking and cooking meals for you?
R:  Yeah, he would -- he would -- he would, um, cook and drink and drink and cook and cook and you know, but he would make fabulous meals.  I mean, he -- he really got into cooking.
L:  Wow.
R:  He really liked it a lot.
L:  So how?
R:  That -- that's great.  It's almost like eating at a restaurant.  I mean I really had some -- some wonderful food that he made.  Yeah.
L:  So you -- you say, when you say that, um, marathon, you mean like he kept cooking all night long for you or?  How -- how do you mean?
R:  Well, he wouldn't serve it.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  He would just take a long time to cook.
L:  Oh, I get it.
R:  I've seen women, you know, and have to cook for -- for our kids and, you know, you -- you learn how to get it on the table --
L:  That's right, because --
R:  -- at some point.  He would make it like an all night thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where he would slowly cut things up and you know, drink and it was just, um, I don't know, but it was fabulous food.  He was a really good cook.  I mean, when you had it, you loved it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he just took a very long time.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I get it now, what you meant by a marathon of cooking because at first I thought, wow, what did she mean --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- that he made -- that he was cooking all [LAUGH] all night long.  Well, that's kind of cook too.  Yeah, to be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --served by --
R:  At -- at one time it was very enjoyable --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because we would make a whole night of it.  You know?  And he would -- you know, he would make dinner and we would listen to music and that was -- you know, it was fun.  You know, but not --
L:  That --
R:  Usually when I would ask him to cook, I would help him so that I could move things along a little bit faster, you know?
L:  Ah huh.  Yeah, because when -- yeah, even though it is nice when you can have home made food and it's [inaudible] it's done by scratch by someone who really knows how to do it well, but the waiting and waiting.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, it's kind of nice.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I can understand that part too.  But, oh yes, of course, that's -- that is sometimes nice when you -- when you are with somebody that, you know, you're romantically involved with and how that -- you know, that special candlelight --
R:  Cooking together, right.
L:  -- dinner --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at home or whatever, but, like I said before, being a single mother and ah, it just seems like I -- I spend all my eating -- well, other than like when I go to work or something and eat out or drink but usually I --
R:  Oh, I know, I mean --
L:  -- even bag my lunch.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean there is one thing I'd rather, when we're talking about restaurants, I'm thinking like a nice restaurant like, you know, they have a lot of it -- do you live in the city or what part of LA?
L:  Yeah.  I live in Hollywood, actually.
R:  Well, see there you go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have some really cool places to go to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in that area.
L:  Oh what places would you recommend to go eat in Hollywood that maybe I haven't checked out yet?
R:  I haven't been there in a long, long time.  I, um, I know Muso and Franks[?].  It's fabulous.
L:  Oh, Muso and Franks?
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have a martini there.  I mean that -- that's it.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that -- that is a martini.  You know, if you like martini's that's the place to have one and then they have the, um, um, goulash, Hungarian goulash?
L:  I've never had Hungarian goulash.  What exactly?
R:  Oh, it's fabulous.
L:  -- do they put in it?
R:  Well, do you -- do you eat red meat?
L:  Um, on occasion.  I'm not much of a red meat eater but, you know, I'm always up to trying new things, so, to eat.
R:  Mhm.  Well they have -- well, it -- it's meat, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's beef, roast beef.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  Well, not roast beef exactly.  It's like a beef, like a stew beef almost --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and they -- it's with paprika and um, paprika and they, you know, it's just a Hungarian dish and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it -- it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  Th- that's the only place I know that serves that dish.  It's like a classic of theirs.  That's where people, movie stars, used to come in to have the Hungarian goulash there.
L:  Wow.  I wonder if Zsa Zsa Gabor used to eat Hungarian goulash there?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I'm sure she did, yeah.
L:  I mean, I've only been to Muso and Franks once and that was many years ago.  I don't even remember what we had but I think it was just something very simple but I -- I've always wondered what Hungarian goulash was and now you've answered my question.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'll have to try it at Muso and Franks.
R:  Oh, you really should.  It's -- it's really fabulous.
L:  Wow.
R:  Very good there and you know you go and you have a martini there.  You haven't lived until you've had a Muso and Frank -- Frank martini.
L:  Well, I will have to try that. 
R:  Right.
L:  That combination sounds good to me.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So where?
R:  Great.
L:  Where do you usually go to eat?  Where did you say that, ah, what area you are in, again?
R:  I live in Orange County in Fullerton.
L:  Oh, Orange County, yes.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereabouts do -- do you usually like to go out to eat around there?
R:  Well, you know, if somebody else -- if it's a nice dinner, there are a number of places here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's a place called the Summit House.  Ah, it's up on a hill in Fullerton and it's --
L:  Oh, Fullerton.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and it's really good.  They have this, um, this, um, fish dish.  It's called ah, the John Dory.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  And it's like -- it's a white fish and it's breaded -- some kind of breading with the macadamia -- they mix macadamia nuts in it.
L:  Oh my god.  That sounds so good.  [LAUGH].
R:  It's fabulous.  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm getting hungry just hearing that.
R:  [LAUGH], I know. 
L:  With macadamia --
R:  It's fabulous.  It's wonderful.  And, um, we also have a very good place on [inaudible] which is [inaudible] north of Orange County.  It's called the Cat and the Custard Cup.
L:  Uh-huh.  That sounds -- even the title of the restaurant sounds good.
R:  Yeah, it's like an English Tudor style kind of place.
L:  Oh, how cool.
R:  And it's -- it's very cozy inside.  It's all brick and fireplaces --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and cozy booths.  And they, um, they, the cook, the chef changes the -- the menu all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and one night you could go in there and you know, you could have venison with ju- juniper -- what is it?  Juniperry?
L:  I think it's called juniberry.  I don't even know the right pronoun-
R:  You know what I'm talking about, right?
L:  Yeah, I know exactly.
R:  That -- that kind of sauce.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  I mean, and he's always changing things around.
L:  Wow.
R:  Always.  And oh, on my birthday, which was this month, on the fifth --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we went to, um, this place called Martini -- Martini Blues.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  In Huntington Beach.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  And it's like a dinner and nightclub kind of place.  And, um, I had this fabulous salmon.  It was just so good.
L:  Oh, I love salmon.
R:  Oh --
