R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is Melissa.  How are you doing?
L:  Hi.  Good.  What did you say your name is?
R:  Melissa.
L:  Melissa, this is Jenny.
R:  Hi, Jenny.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH].  So, you prefer to eat at home or eat out?
L:  Well, I like both.  But, um, since I don't have a lot of time, I think I prefer out.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  How about you?
R:  It all depends.  I prefer eating out.  I don't mind eating at home just so long as someone else cooks it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right. [LAUGH]  I --
R:  I don't mind cooking, but just sometimes, you know?
L:  You get tired of cooking?
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH].  
L:  But, um, I -- I don't know if the question -- if they want you to make the choice or not?  It's difficult to make a choice.  Especially --
R:   Yeah.  Especially -- you're talking about it for ten minutes.
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, I like a home cooked meal, but I like -- you just said describe your favorite meal?  Or, you know, our ideal meal?  If it was for home, I would think that traditional turkey dinner with the mashed potatoes and the stuffing and all that would be my ideal meal.
R:  Yummy.  [LAUGH].
L:  But, um, out- outside, I guess I would have to go with um, a type of restaurant that had something different, something that you don't get all the time.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like some kind of specialty meal.
R:  I prefer -- when I go out to a restaurant, I prefer ordering something I've already had before, so I know I like it.  Or I end up sending stuff back a lot.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, wh- oh, do you really?  
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  
L:  What's -- what's your favorite restaurant?
R:  Um.  I have different places that I like.  I like Macaroni Grill -- it's pretty good.
L:  You know, I've never been there.  I heard that's very good.
R:  What --
L:  I've eaten probably just about everywhere else.
R:  What state do you live in?
L:  I live in Illinois.
R:  Oh, I live in Florida.
L:  In Florida?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm in Chicago.
R:  I had today -- I -- I took my son to the mall and I had um, a spinach and cheese calzone[?] which was awesome.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, I have probably pizza out or sometimes uh, calzone or something, two or three times a week, I would say.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  For lunch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  I -- I've just been trying to lately eat at home to, you know, dieting.  
L:  Me, too.  Dieting?  Is that what you said?
R:  Yeah.  Dieting 'cause it's kinda hard to diet when you eat out all the time.
L:  I stopped with, like, the regular fast foods.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And started doing the same thing, where I'd get, you know, chicken breasts and that and just cook it.  But they're sort of like plain meals.  But I like it.  Or salads.  But I --
R:  Well, see, whenever -- 'cause whenever I did fast food, I'd used to always just get a salad.  So that's more healthier for you, which I read up on and online, different ingredients.  So I used to always get the Caesar salad at Chick Fillet[?] whenever anybody at work ordered Chick Fillet, I would just get the Caesar salad and it turned out the Caesar salads have more fat in it because of the dressing and everything --
L:  Than if you were to get a hamburger?
R:  -- than like the chicken sandwich.  [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  I actually -- I downloaded all the different fast food calories and everything.  Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King, McDonald's and compared what could I order if I went out but Subway --
R:  I think -- I think that Subway diet --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I think that's BS.
L:  Do you?
R:  But I think all these people are losing weight 'cause all those carbs that you're eating, you know, it doesn't matter if it's wheat or what it is, I mean, it's still carbs and it is still fattening.
L:  It probably helps for the person who does fast food.  Like, if they were getting McDonald's, you know --
R:  Every day, mm.  
L:  and you're getting the -- the fries and a Big Mac and then you switch to Subway, it probably does make a big difference, just with calories.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know.  I'm not on a Subway diet.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm just trying to eat healthier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, it is interesting that the fast food restaurants are all starting to have salads, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  McDonald's now has it and Wendy's.  That's what I started getting from them.  But getting the fat free dressing or not using dressing at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you're right.  Because it is -- you -- you think you're doing well but I -- maybe you're eating more nutritious?  That's the thing --
R:  Is it --
L:  Go ahead?
R:  Is this your first phone call you're doing?
L:  No, this is my second.
R:  Oh, this is my third one.
L:  Is it your third?  Is it all the same topic?
R:  No.  The first one I had was um, about computer games. 
L:  Mm.
R:  And the second one I had was about like basically the economy and what -- what -- about the war and everything with Iraq and all that stuff.  That was a hard topic to keep up for ten minutes.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that would be difficult.  But I like a good challenge sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, um, eating at restaurants.  I -- you know what?  You know, the more I say I'd rather eat out, I wanna eat out for the convenience sake.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then sometimes, like, I do -- I do like different -- I like to go to the Olive Garden and I like to go to, you know, Appleby's and I like to TGI Fridays.  I just -- I like those types of places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're a little diff- each one's a little different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't get an opportunity to.  You know, I say I may prefer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- but I actually do eat more in.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda hard for me to continue eating out at, you know, four course restaurants now 'cause I have a two year old and he doesn't want to sit still.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We took him -- we went to Hard Rock Cafe.  I took my mom there for her birthday and it was awesome.  Even though I -- I ended up sending back my food.  I ordered um, it was like the flaming [inaudible].  It was like the most expensive one on the menu.  And I ordered that and it was supposed to be so tender and everything.  And it came -- it was so tiny, it looked like one bite, and it was burnt.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, it was so dry I had to send it back.  It was disgusting.  And I ended up getting, like, the T bone steak, which was -- oh, it was so good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Do -- do you, um, like, get your hopes set on something like -- do you get disappointed easily if it's not exactly what you think it's going to be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you go to the restaurant?
R:  I -- I'm picky when it comes to food.  That's why if I go out on a date, I like ordering something I've already ate before, so --
L:  So that you have --
R:  -- I know that I like it.
L:  That it's safe?  [LAUGH].
R:  So I'm not sending back food [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- when I'm like, on a date.  I don't mind sending back food if, you know, if I'm with the family or something.  If I don't like it, I'm not going to eat it, you know?
L:  I have a sister like that.  I usually end up eating it anyways.  She'll be, like, "Oh, this is the worst thing I've had.  Oh, this is the --" but I ended up --
R:  I get disappointed --
L:  -- usually end up eating it.
R:  -- if I go to a restaurant, going out to eat, and I don't like the food.  I get so mad.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, like I said, 'cause we don't -- I don't get to go to -- you know, I don't go to restaurant, restaurants.  Fast food all the time, but not restaurants as often as I'd like and uh -- so you do kinda have this anticipation that it's going to be a nice time out and that you're going to get a good meal and really enjoy it.
R:  At least you don't have to worry about dishes and all that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I know.  I know that --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't mind cooking, if I'm cooking.  Like, we always have potlucks at my work.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I usually cook up, like, four trays of lasagna and last time I cooked up like a big -- like two trays of, um, you know, chicken with potatoes and sweet potatoes.  I don't mind cooking if I'm co- cooking for like a whole bunch of people, but if I'm just cooking a dinner for myself, I'll cook --
L:  It's not worth all the mess.
R:  -- something easy at the house.  
L:  See.  I -- for, like, our family dinners, and stuff like when we have like Christmas and things, I do all -- most of the cooking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I always have people who help.  They'll come and they'll help clean up, like, I'll do it.  Like you, I'll do the, you know, the trays of the lasagna, the turkey, the everything.  But it seems like I have someone come over and that's their way of helping is, they'll clean, they'll wash the dishes as I'm going and like that's like pure heaven to me.  I'll cook all you want as long as you clean [LAUGH] the dishes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I cannot stand -- we make homemade pastas and stuff 'cause we're Italian.
R:  Yeah, we're Italian too.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we make homemade pastas and that's like a big mess, but I'll do it.  I'll make for, you know, the entire -- everybody could have, you know, dozens and dozens, but --
R:  See, my parents --
L:  -- help me clean.
R:  My parents used to own, um, Italian restaurants when I was young.  
L:  Oh, did they really?
R:  Yeah.  So we're used to, like, all of our food, we're used to cooking everything home made.  But I actually bought, um, 'cause we make, like a lot of lasagnas and stuff and I bought those -- those noodles that you just add the sauce and it cooks in there.  
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Lasagna noodles.
L:  Does it work?
R:  It was actually pretty good.
L:  Was it really?
R:  Mhm.  You don't have to worry about boiling all the noodles.  Because I think lasagna is so easy to make.  You know, you just boil the noodles and --
L:  Just layer it and it's in there.
R:  -- put everything down and that's it.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's like, I like, like mon- we make homemade monacari[?].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it's a little bit more work than like the lasagna 'cause you make -- we make the shells and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I feel like I get more cheese then.  If I could get the ricotta cheese, like I could get more -- or stuffed shells or something that has --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I want more cheese.
R:  Yeah, I got -- I'm standing outside smoking a cigarette and it just started smelling heavy gas.
L:  In your house?
R:  No, outside.
L:  Mm.
R:  Somebody's cooking with gas.  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm sure ten minutes is co- coming to a close pretty soon.
R:  [inaudible] I actually have -- I ran and got my phone because I -- if you refer people, you get a dollar for each person you refer.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I -- and you -- all you do is just give, you know, give them the link to the one site, whatever, and you give them the pin number, your pin number and they put that down and I referred, like, a whole bunch of people and I referred my mom and all got --
L:  Have you gotten any money, yet?
R:  Not yet.  I just did it, like, last week.  It took forever to get -- for me to get my first check.  I've only got one check so far.
L:  Oh, that's what I said.  Did you get -- you did get paid?
R:  Yes, I did get paid.  'Cause I -- I did the first phone call, like, probably about two months ago and I thought it was like, maybe a scam or something.
L:  But it's actually -- well, I did things for --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- one of the universities here doing market -- you know, forms and questionnaires and it did take -- you -- it takes a while to get your money, but they did it, like, in three phases.  Sure, I had three other opportunities, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the money comes --
R:  If -- if I did the one phone call and then I got the check, just like last week, I'd think okay, I'll go ahead and do my other two phone calls.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  I -- I -- this is just my second one altogether, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  but I -- I  -- I just did 'cause I call in to do them 'cause, you know, it takes forever to, um, to actually sit down and wait for a phone call, but you can just call the number and put your pin number in.  That's what I did.
L:  Oh, really?  And then they hook you up with someone?
R:  Uh-huh.  That's what -- that's what I just did to get you on the phone and that's what, um, I just did to my mom to get somebody on the phone.
L:  Oh, I didn't know you can do this.  You could call the number and then put the pin number in.
R:  Yeah.  You can do that.  My mom --
L:  So, then back to the topic of restaurants?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well. [NOISE]  Oh, hold on.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, they -- they only make you talk about it for a certain amount and you get to talk about whatever, I guess.
L:  Okay.
R:  The first phone call I did, I didn't know it was ten minutes.  I only talked to the guy probably like five minutes and still got paid.
L:  Oh, well that --
