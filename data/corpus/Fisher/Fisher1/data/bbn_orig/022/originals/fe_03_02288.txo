L:  My name is Kelly.  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Tara.
L:  This is the first time I've done this.  [LAUGH].
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  My aunt got me into this.
L:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about illness and, you know, changing seasons?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay.  Um, I live in New York City, so it's always dirty so you're always getting sick, so it's not even just the change of seasons.  [LAUGH].
R:  Me neither. Oh well, I live in -- I live close to Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, so it's the same kind of thing?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, I jus- this is weird, I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.  Um, I guess allergies?
R:  That's what I -- I have allergies.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yes.  Really bad.
L:  You take -- yeah, I used to have them, and it's funny, in New York City, like, I think somehow you live here long enough and you start to get like um, immune to them.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] like you've built it up.
R:  Well, when I -- when I first was diagnosed with allergies, they were really bad, but then after I started taking the medicine, it --
L:  It can be really scary.  I worked with a pediatrician for -- where in a little -- uh, a place where little kids would get it so bad they'd have to come in for shots like once a week.
R:  Mm.  Friends of ours, their son has allergies real bad.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And asthma and all that, and they'd go and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- get all that taken --
L:  Oh, I can imagine.  But I guess when the seasons change, you know, like the spring time, like it is now, is the weather -- what's the weather like there?  We actually had a really nice day today.
R:  Yeah, it's really nice here, too.  It rained this morning, but it's really nice here now.
L:  Yeah, we got some rain, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm so happy it's finally nice out, 'cause it's so -- when it's cold, it sucks.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  So --
L:  Um, illness and then there's the allergies.  Oh, what are your allergy -- what medicine do you take for your allergies?
R:  I take Allegra.
L:  Does it work well?
R:  Yes.
L:  My friend takes Claritin, but she swears it has some kind of, like, um, stimulant in it because she always feels really crazy when she takes it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Huh?  Well, I was taking Al- the Allegra.  I was taking it twice a day.  Like, six -- what was it?  I don't remember what it was.  Tw- it was twice a day, then I -- they -- they come out with that new --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a hundred and eighty milligram, you only take it once a day.
L:  And it works really well?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, that --
R:  So that's what I take now.
L:  Very nice.  That's good.  I know.  I actually have a stash of it 'cause the pediatrician office, I'm still friends with the people and they always get free samples.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm like, if I need it, I have it.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I take that.  I do -- I use that and I use, uh, Flenaise[?].
L:  That's the -- that's what everyone seems to talk about, is like, works the best.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So, but -- but -- because that came out fairly recently, right?  Like, a year or two ago?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Would it be?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah, 'cause mine were really bad at one time.  And I guess it was a change of something, then I went to the doctor 'cause it felt like my head was going to explode and she gave me --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- Flenaise and I took it for -- it didn't help for, like a week, it took like a week or -- like, a week, a week and a half to get into your system.
L:  And then it kicks in?
R:  Then it kicks in, and it worked after that.
L:  Ah.  Very nice.  I guess --
R:  So.
L:  -- the seasons changing this year was so quickly as -- I guess has made some people sick.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you can see, like, stuff falling through the air.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Like, off the trees, all the pollen and stuff.  Well, I don't even know what it is.
L:  Exactly.  No, I know exactly what you're talking about.  And when it gets --
R:  Flying through the air.
L:  When it gets so cold and then so hot and then cold.  Like, we had one day last week that was really nice, and then it went back to like forty degrees the next day.
R:  That's the way it was here, yep.
L:  Yeah.  So I guess it's pretty much the same weather.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, but oh, it makes little kids so sick.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, what else?  What else did they say?  Something about a cold for seven days?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Going to the doctor?  I can't remember.
R:  I think it's something about a cold lasts seven days.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I haven't really been sick since I have been taking allergy medicine.  That really has been helping.
L:  Oh, wow.  See, that's -- like, maybe it helps just in general?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  'Cause I know allergies can be so bad.  And it's the worst feeling, 'cause it's not horrible, but it's horrible enough to make you uncomfortable all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So, thank God for drug companies sometimes, right?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah,  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Yep.  
L:  But actually, I don't -- I haven't had a lot of people that are sick that I know of, because of the seasons.  Like, just like being like the flu or the cold or anything.
R:  Yeah.  I really don't know.  
L:  I work at a hospital, so everyone's all worried about SARS now.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, they're -- everyone's like, "Where have you been?  Have you been to any place?"
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  "Do you feel like if you have the flu?"  [LAUGH].
R:  Not -- we came -- I just came back from a cruise.
L:  Oh.  That must have been fun?
R:  So -- 
L:  Oh, that'd be the worst, being sick on a cruise?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, not being able to do all the fun stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess you could just sit poolside the whole time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  Get sunburned.
L:  Exactly.  I'm very jealous.  
R:  So --
L:  If only this was about vacation and cruises, people could talk about that forever.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Illness is not -- it's not a very good --
L:  I know.  Um, let's see.  Um, illness.  I don't -- I work at a cancer hospital, so I see illness a lot, but it -- I see the good stuff, when people are well, not when they're really sick, so --
R:  Yeah.  I work with the mentally handicapped, mentally challenged.
L:  Oh, so you ha- that's a really tough job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I can't imagine.  You must see a lot of stuff?
R:  I see a lot -- well, there's a lot of illness with them, too, because they're always getting sick and --
L:  Because they can't take care of themselves?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that must be so hard.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Oh, I can't imagine.  I guess it's -- is it the kinda job where it's like really hard, but them somethings it's so rewarding and it makes me feel better.  
R:  Yeah, 'cause after you see some of the accomplishments they can do and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- all that, so --
L:  Yeah.  It's so nice when you -- when people come into the hospital and they -- they're so sure that they're gonna die and then they -- they -- like, six months later they're off and then they're like, "Right, now I don't have to come back for a year".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].  Uh, yeah, we're [inaudible] seasons changing, sickness.  Um, I don't know.  What do you think?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I don't know what -- I -- I think that was [inaudible].  We should of -- I should of writ it down.  I wasn't really -- since it was the first time, I didn't know that they'd give you --
L:  I know.  I didn't know what to expect when I got the phone call and I was, like, oh this is it.  This is what they're -- what I emailed about.  Okay, okay, I'm ready.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And then they give you the question and you don't know.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, mm, we've talked about allergies and people --
R:  My aunt does this study, and she really likes it.
L:  I bet -- 'cause I bet you get a lot of really interesting conversations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, with like, people -- like you know, states away.
R:  Yeah.  Different areas.
L:  And it's -- I mean, even we're both on the east coast, though, you know, even though we're far enough away that, you know, it'd take a bus ride, but it's still, you know, our weather's the same and it -- I bet, you know, it's really similar.
R:  Yeah.  Get somebody different.
L:  Yeah.  Um, allergies.  This'd be a really good study if we're like little old ladies that have lots of time to kill, too, because they like to talk forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At my job.  They all still sit at my desk for, like, twenty minutes and tell me their life stories, because you know, they don't have many people to talk to.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, getting sick with the winters.  Uh -- well, this -- the seasons have been really weird because, like, winter's lasted forever.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it was --
L:  And there's so much snow.
R:  Oh, that's -- I know.  That was too much.
L:  It was way too much [LAUGH].  Way, way too much.  That one day that there was, like, what, like everybody got varied amounts.  I think we got like twenty three inches.
R:  Something like that, yeah.
L:  In Maryland, where my family is, they got thirty two.
R:  Wow.
L:  They didn't -- they couldn't leave the house for, like, three days.  Everyone did get sick then because they're all shoveling the driveways and got sick.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, being outside.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  All that sweating and coming in and --
L:  Exactly.  Even hot cocoa can't cure that.
R:  Mm hm.  
L:  Um, I don't know what to talk about.  Mm.  Uh -- I'm thinking.
R:  [LAUGH].  The only thing I have is the allergies.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I just have a stash of allergy medicine, I don't actually have allergies.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But one -- oh, there is one thing I was just -- you know, Claritin you can actually buy over the counter now.
R:  Yeah, then they have that other stuff, that Allervert.
L:  Yeah.  I went -- one of my -- my coworkers wanted to check it out and it's really expensive. 
R:  Huh.
L:  It's -- it's like thirty dollars for, like -- you know, like a -- like a box of what you would buy for like normal allergy medicine such as Claritin, that you know, can charge all the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's crazy.  That also could be inflated New York prices.  Never know.  
R:  I think it's about the same here.  Might be a little bit less.
L:  Yeah.  Usually --
R:  But it's about --
L:  -- there's not too much difference.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I actually -- I always, when I go home to Maryland, I buy like all that stuff in Maryland 'cause the -- go to the Walmart and it's so much cheaper.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, because we have that Super Walmarts here, too.
L:  Ooh.  It's got everything.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm very jealous.  We only have a Kmart and it's really stinky.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Literally.  [LAUGH].  Um, I wish I had other -- oh, I'm allergic to cats.  Well, actually, it's sort -- like, when at least when I was a little kid, they realised I was allergic to something and they kept taking all these things away from me --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- because they didn't know what it was.  It was very -- I -- it was very scary and they had, like, one week they took all my sultana molds, the next week they took all my chocolate.
R:  Oh, Jeeze.
L:  And then they finally figured it was the next door neighbor's cat.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, when I get around cats, I get so sick.  But, uh --
R:  My husband's allergic to cats.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like dogs better anyway, so -- sounds like you have --
R:  That's what I have --
L:  -- one in the back?  [LAUGH].
R:  Actually, I hear him -- hear him barking at the door.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  My father in law's sitting out there.  He probably thinks nobody's home --
