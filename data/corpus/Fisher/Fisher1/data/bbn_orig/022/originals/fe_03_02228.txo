R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, what --
R:  My name's Michelle.
L:  I'm Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.
L:  I guess you're taking part in this study as well, I think.
R:  [LAUGH].  I guess so.
L:  I don't know.  I just put in my -- an email and then I got this thing.  Ah, I got a call all of a sudden.  I never realised -- I totally forgot about it.
R:  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I've never done this before.
L:  Ah, me neither.  So what -- what do you like as your um --  Well, I've already forgotten what the question [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I already forgot what the question is.
R:  I like to eat in restaurants more than I like to eat at home.
L:  Yeah.  I like to eat in restaurants more than I like to eat at home.  Um.  I like restaurants that are -- that are -- that are good and -- and not too expensive.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I guess.  I don't know.  Um.  This is -- this is pretty bizarre.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I think -- I think it's describe your perfect meal.
L:  Uh-huh.  My perfect meal?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I like a -- I like a steak and a seafood dinner.  I don't know. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That sounds good.  Yeah.  No, I definitely like a steak or something and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some sort of potato like french fries or mashed potatoes or something.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um,  where -- where are you, actually?  Are you in New York or not?
R:  [LAUGH].  No, I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  You're in Los Angeles.  Oh.  Did you find this thing on [inaudible]?
R:  I did.
L:  Yeah.  Me too. [LAUGH].
R:  I didn't think it would start so soon.  I've never done this before.
L:  Yes.  It was strange.  I saw this -- this ad on [inaudible] and I like, oh, what the hell.  I'll put my name down. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I wasn't expecting any phone calls.  [LAUGH].  I didn't think they'd actually call me.
R:  Me neither.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I recognized the number so I go, okay.
L:  [inaudible].  You're in LA?  I lived down in LA for two years.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I um, I was a -- I lived in Burbank actually.
R:  Oh.
L:  I um -- and my apartment out there in North Hollywood.  I switched apartments and then in November two thousand and one, it blew up.  [LAUGH].  The apartment --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- was destroyed in a fire.  Yeah.  So.
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, ah, that's why, you know, I think any perfect meal is [inaudible]. [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, um.
R:  Um.  I can't believe they want us to talk for ten minutes about food.
L:  Ten minutes about food.  'Cause I have nothing else to say.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The only reason I don't like eating at home is 'cause I don't like to cook it, you know.
L:  Yeah, I don't like to cook.  I'm much too lazy.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Um, I like food better in New York than LA [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Are you from LA?
R:  I bet.  No, no --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from the Midwest, so.
L:  You're from the Midwest?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh really?  Where, where?
R:  What makes New York food so different than LA food?
L:  Oh it's different like [inaudible] food out there ah, tastes like um, movie props.  I mean, food looks but it --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know, I just know it's being from New York.  I guess I was spoiled because a lot of the places I went to, I would always be disappointed, so.  A lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the restaurants that I went to, so.  But, um, that's the difference between New York and LA.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know, for me, at least, and um, I don't know, I really don't think I have more to say on this -- this topic.  It's pretty strange [LAUGH] to talk about food.
R:  I know.
L:  And they don't even like prepare you what you're going to say, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, you should like, they should tell you about this way in advance and then I -- I would think about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I was all the time on the phone with my friend, Michael, let me take this.  See what this --
R:  So is your friend still on the other line, waiting?
L:  No, no.  He's on line.  It's catch up [inaudible].
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess I committed -- I guess I committed to this, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'll be curious to see whether we get ten bucks for this call [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that would be -- I feel like we should talk about food more but I don't [LAUGH].
L:  I have nothing else to say, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  What do you do?  Are you a student, or, ah?
R:  No, no.  I, ah, graduated already.  How about you?
L:  I -- I graduated ah, in ninety eight from -- I went to [inaudible].
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  And ah -- and ah, basically I was working, when I was worked back in California, I was working -- I worked at ah, I worked out at Warner Brothers out there, so.
R:  Oh. yeah?
L:  Yeah, and um, after my apartment burned down, I was transferred to the, ah, to the New York office.  I was able to get a transfer, so.  Which is great, because I'm from New York, so.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And then, um, recently, they -- they moved my, ah, they moved my position back to LA so now I left town, I didn't want to go back, so, I left, ah, I left my position there.
R:  Wow.
L:  So.  What do you do?
R:  Um, well, I'm just, ah, saving up money for grad school right now, so.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you want -- what do you want to go for?
R:  Um, I -- I'm still thinking about it.
L:  Thinking about it?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, um.
R:  But, I feel like it's been ten minutes.
L:  It's a good way to save money, I guess.
R:  I guess. [LAUGH].
L:  Talk ten minutes about food and you get ten bucks. [LAUGH].
R:  That's -- that's why I signed up.  I thought this sounds easy.  But I guess it's not --
L:  It sounds pretty easy, yeah.  But they give you one brand of topic out of nowhere, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know what they're --
R:  Talk about food.  Go.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, talk about food, that's it.  Here you go. [LAUGH].  It's so bizarre.  I'd kinda like to know what they're going to learn from this study.
R:  Maybe, you know, maybe it's not even a project about food.
L:  Maybe it's not even about food.  You know?  Maybe it's --
R:  Probably just like a psyche experiment on how people, strangers, talk to each other.
L:  Yeah.  I guess -- I guess we shouldn't give out any more personal information.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I guess they are recording this whole conversation so I don't know -- I don't know what else I can say, ah.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I'd hate to be the person who has listen to all these strangers talking to each other.
L:  I know.  It's a strange -- strange thing, yeah.  I guess maybe they get a laugh out of it, I don't know. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm not -- I'm not into cannibalisms. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's like the newest reality show.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Well, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm way out of things to say [LAUGH] about this topic.
R:  Me too.
L:  So.
R:  I don't know.  They said perfect meal.  I don't -- I don't know what else to say about that.  Do you have like a favorite food?
L:  Favorite food?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like pizza.  I like pizza.
R:  Oh, New York's a good place for that.
L:  I like -- yeah.  Well, New York?
R:  New York.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I [inaudible].  I couldn't find -- there's one place I like in LA that have good pizza.  I remember, it was on Melrose.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was, ah, something called Albana's.  Have you been there?
R:  No.
L:  In that area?
R:  I mean, in LA, all the pizza houses are like, you know, chicken and sun dried tomatoes and all that crap on it.
L:  Yeah.  It's all strange. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's all fancy.
L:  It's all bizarre.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't need gourmet pizza.  [LAUGH] I just want plain like [inaudible] pizza.
L:  Yeah, like are you right into -- California Pizza Kitchen would be a good representation of what pizza [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it is [LAUGH].  It's also, um, what else can I say about food?  I don't know.  Um.  Has it been ten minutes yet?  I don't know.  I [inaudible].
R:  I feel like it has. [LAUGH]  No offence to you, I mean.
L:  It's been -- on my cellphone, the counter has been eight minutes and forty three seconds, so that doesn't count -- it doesn't count the, ah --
R:  Oh, all the set up time.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah, so -- if [inaudible], let's see.  Let's see.  What else, what else?  What's your favorite food?
R:  Um.  I like pizza too.
L:  Pizza?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.   Crusty ones.
L:  You don't like sushi?
R:  No, I actually don't like it.
L:  Yeah.  Most people in LA like sushi.  I love sushi a lot.
R:  I don't know.  It's hard to be in LA and not like sushi --
L:  Actually, no.
R:  -- 'cause that's where everyone wants to go.
L:  I don't know.  I'm not really into raw fish [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  -- raw fish.  I tried it.  I tried it and you know, at the one place where they had all you can eat sushi over in Westwood.  I remember that.  And they had a place and all -- all you can eat and I was like that's okay, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't -- I wouldn't really be craving this kind of food.  I like Italian food a lot so.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's how I was lacking out in California. [LAUGH].  So.
R:  Well, that's 'cause -- that's like hardy stuff.  I mean going to all you can eat sushi seems like kind of crazy 'cause, I don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um.  What was I going to say?  There is a -- there's a good Italian place in Universal City walk if you've ever been to, ah.  That I liked.  That's one place I did like for Italian food.  It was Buco [inaudible].  Have you been there?
R:  I haven't but I've heard of it.
L:  You've heard of it?  That -- that's d- -- you want something okay, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for LA. [LAUGH].  But there was not much -- there was not much choice in LA. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  For me, at least.  
R:  Sure.
L:  But, ah --
R:  But, you know, stuff, like everything is so expensive out here but that's the only reason I don't go out to eat more, is just because of that.
L:  Oh, okay.  So did you do this thing -- did you just sign up for this, this weekend or something?  Is that --?  Did you sign up --?
R:  I don't -- I have no idea.  I mean, you know, you sign the little form and it says --
L:  Little form, yeah.
R:  -- when you're available.
L:  Yeah.  I thought -- I thought --
R:  I thought it was like an ongoing thing.
L:  Yeah, because they asked me all these days you're available.  And I could -- I could this time, right and then all of a sudden, yeah, like today, I got a call.  It's like wow.  I didn't really think they'd be on top of this so quickly.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I didn't know whether to believe it or not but I figured oh, I'll try.
L:  Yeah.  And then, um, you know they said they give -- like I saw two one five on my area -- as the area code.  Like someone from Pennsylvan- -- yeah, I guess it someone from --  I got emails saying there is an eight hundred number though.  You send in the four ID's so you know what it is.
R:  Huh.
L:  I mean, I thought it would be talking to like a computer or stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  Like giving answer -- answering questions or something like that.
R:  Right.  I thought it was going to be like a -- um, automated survey.
L:  Automated thing where you press the button each time, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what would you like and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know, randomly talk to somebody.  I don't mind.  You're a very nice person but it's just so strange --
R:  Right.
L:  Very bizarre --
