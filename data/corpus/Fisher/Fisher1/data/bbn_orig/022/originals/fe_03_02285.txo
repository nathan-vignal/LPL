L:  Jessica.
R:  Uh, my name's Larry.  [COUGH].  Would you like --
L:  I'm at -- sorry --
R:  Would you like to go first?
L:  Yeah.  Can -- you know what, I'm actually driving, so can you tell me the topic, because I didn't hear it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh, the seasons of the -- the change of seasons sometimes cause illness.
L:  Okay.
R:  And do we agree with that?
L:  Um, you want me to go first or --
R:  It doesn't matter.
L:  All right.  I definitely agree because I'm in New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know -- I hear your accent, so I guess you're not from New York, but um --
R:  I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah.  Like, the weather change has been unreal.  Will you hold on one second?
R:  Sure.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  I hope I didn't lose you?
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, you there?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  There was actually a cop car next to me, believe it or not?
R:  Well, hope they didn't pull you over?
L:  No, but they -- I got a little nervous there, because I don't usually talk and drive.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  So, um --
R:  That's fine.
L:  Yeah, the change in seasons basically everyone in my office keeps getting sick.  Um, what do you think?
R:  Well, I think uh, winter and uh, harsh weather definitely does bring on what they used the call the flu season, and one of the comments that was made, that if you treat a cold -- I forget.  Anyway, it's like a cold usually lasts for seven days.  I agree with that.  Uh, if it is untreated and if you go to the doctor, it's three days.  But anyway, you know, a cold usually has to run its course.  It's always been my experience anyway.  But, yes, there is such a thing as flu season.  I think the doctors allow for that, especially with elderly people.  And uh, otherwise they wouldn't have what they call flu shots to give to people. Uh, they also wanted to know if there was, uh, what we would do to prevent getting cold.  Um, myself, I just take the normal precautions.  I -- I layer my clothing.  We had a hell of a winter here in Pennsylvania.
L:  But do you find that because the weather has been changing so drastically, more people are getting sick?
R:  I do think so.  I think, uh, the flu, uh epidemics have been more severe and uh, things like that because one day it's warm and then you go -- it changes overnight.
L:  Right.
R:  Drastically, and uh, I think that's bad on your -- your system.  And uh, as far as catching colds and getting flus and things like that.  We had a very +bad -- bad winter season here, where I live, with uh, children having flus.  Our school was actually shut down and uh, for a few days --
L:  Because people were sick?
R:  Yeah, the children were all -- there were so many children out they decided not to have classes.  Our emergency --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- room in Union Town could not take any more patients at one time because the hospital was filled with just people that had the flu.  So we had a pretty bad epidemic of it, uh, I don't know, a lot of people believe in getting these flu shots, uh, they -- the doctors recommend the elderly to get them, but I don't believe in them myself.  I don't get them.  It's jus a matter of choice, I guess, but uh, just taking the necessary precautions that you normally would, you know, layer your clothing and try to avoid people who are sick, but that's almost impossible, and uh --
L:  I mean, I think it's also hard where, like, if you leave in the morning and you wear, you know, a certain type of clothing and by the time you get home, the weather --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- is completely different.  I --
R:  Absolutely.  Our weather has been wild this year.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's been really cr- like, you'll have like two or three days, even spring's even late at -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's bad.  It's just bad and we had a terrible winter here.  We had record breaking snowfalls and you said you're from New York, I think you had it up there as well?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it hasn't been good and uh, I do think the cold weather does bring a lot of the -- the colds and the flus on.  Uh, I think, uh, going to a tanning bed helps, uh, avoid colds.
L:  Going to a tanning bed?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I've -- I've never heard that before.
R:  Well, I think it's like light therapy for the bad months when you're depressed and everything.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And it kind of cheers you up. 
L:  And it makes you look like you went on a vacation?
R:  It -- well, no, it makes you look better.  When you look better, you feel better, but I think there's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something to do with the light therapy there.  Because we're spending so much time in darkness, if you're going to a tanning bed, you're exposing yourself to that extra amount of light and I think it does do something.  I've -- I -- I've heard other people say that.
L:  Really?  I've never heard anyone say that, so I've kind of intrigued right [LAUGH] now by that.
R:  Yes.  Well, it's a thought.  Well, you know, they do treat people that are suffering from mild forms of depression with light therapy.
L:  Oh.  See, I'm kind of -- I don't know.  I have never really gone, like, to a tanning bed just 'cause I don't know how safe it is?
R:  I don't know how safe it is either, but I just figured I didn't have anything to lose, so I went.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, there you go.
R:  I went --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's -- last year was the first year I ever went, uh, because I was like you, I -- I didn't know what the long term effect of it would be and uh, I don't know, it's just --
L:  And you felt like it made you feel better?  Just in general --
R:  Absolute --
L:  -- like, heightened your spirits?
R:  It did.  It really did.  And I didn't get a cold all winter long.  So, I -- I really think that might of helped.  I'm not sure.  Um, I couldn't prove it, but I do think there is something to be said for a little bit of light therapy because it did make me feel better and I don't think it was the fact that -- I didn't really even get a tan.  I just felt better.  I think it was the exposure to the extra light at the bad ti- like January, February, you know, you come home in the evening, it's dark at five o'clock, six o'clock.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You leave to go to work and it's dark, so people do get depressed and I know -- not tanning beds, but they do use some various forms of light therapy for people that are depressed.  It seemed to work for me [LAUGH] and I told --
L:  You think it -- it kept you not sick?
R:  I -- I do in a way.  Er, I can't figure out why else everybody that I worked with had a cold --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- and -- and I didn't, and that's the only thing I did that they didn't do.  So, I don't know.  It's -- it's a thought [LAUGH] and maybe we should all go to tanning beds.  [LAUGH].
L:  See, where I work, everyone was sick this winter.
R:  Mhm?
L:  Like, obvious -- you know, for obvious reasons, but everyone was sick.
R:  Me too.  Everyone.  And it lasted -- it went on and on and on.
L:  Right.  
R:  And I was never around so many people that were happen -- hawk -- hacking and coughing and sneezing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It would -- it would just go on and on and on.
L:  But now you get that for, um, like allergies and stuff?
R:  No, this was just like winter colds and I guess if one person gets it in a workforce, especially when you're in closed quarters like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everybody gets it, but I didn't get it.  Everybody else did but me.
L:  Oh, I got it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, did you?  And how long --
L:  Yeah.
R:  How long did it last?
L:  Um, well I was out for two days, but I'm the type of person, like, if I'm dying sick, I won't take off.
R:  You still go to work?
L:  Yeah.  Like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'll -- I'll still go into work.  I have to basically be like unable to move, to work.
R:  Well, that's good.  I bet your employers are happy?
L:  Uh, if they notice.  I don't know if they notice.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, they should, by your attempt at --
L:  It's one of those kinds of things.
R:  Oh, I know.  But it -- well, I -- I don't know what it takes for an employee to notice -- uh, an employer to notice, uh, a good work record except for the fact that you're there all the time --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and then they're gonna to take it for granted.  And yet other people miss all the time and nobody says anything.
L:  I know.  Oh, I agree.
R:  Yeah.  I guess it's the same --
L:  What do --
R:  -- everywhere, it really is.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, do you have any other thoughts as to ways we could prevent, uh, getting a cold?
L:  Um, I wore layers all winter and I still got --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't -- I really -- I think it's unpreventable, 'cause either way you're going to be surrounded by people --
R:  I -- I kind of --
L:  -- who are very sick.
R:  -- agree.  I kind of agree.
L:  As long as you get sleep, you know, that's important.
R:  The right rest.  Watch your diet.  Of course, we're all good at that.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah, I would definitely say getting rest, fluids, like all that kind of stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But who even knows with that, you know?
R:  Uh --
L:  What really helps.
R:  I think mo- more people are conscientious of flus and colds now because of all the weird ones.  Like, the flu strains that are going around.
L:  Right. 
R:  And we have that terrible thing going on now, that uh --
L:  SARS?
R:  Yes.  The SARS thing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And uh, that's terrible.  And it's going to affect a lot of people, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're working on some sort of a vaccine or something for it.  Some kind of a shot for it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I think they're come -- I think they're coming close to it.  I hope it's soon.  Because it must be highly contagious.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't --
