R:  [SIGH] Hi.
L:  Hello.  Hi, what's your name?
R:  Hi, I'm Tori.  Who's this?
L:  Hi, my name's Erin.
R:  Hey, Erin.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  You're in New York?
L:  What about you?
R:  I'm on the east coast too.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Well, you must be getting some wonderful weather down there.
R:  Yeah, actually it's very [NOISE] warm.  Um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH], it's -- we're coming into the rainy, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the rainy season, [NOISE] so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, ah, getting kinda crazy with the weather.  Doesn't really know what it wants to do. Right now we're fixing to get some bad storms in, but [SIGH], um ...
L:  Same here, mhm.
R:  Our pollen seems to be lasting a little longer this year.
L:  I know.  I just got back from taking a walk in the park and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's pollen rampant.  I'm like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- "Oh, gosh.  I should start taking my allergy medicine".
R:  What do you take?
L:  I usually take Sudafed.
R:  Really?  That works for you?  You know --
L:  Not really [LAUGH]!
R:  No [LAUGH].  It's just what we -- it's just what you take, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right.
R:  You know, I tell ya, I -- I swear, the last -- I'm gonna say probably within the last five months --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I have had really bad bouts with bronchitis, and come to find out --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- it's all related to sinus, which is related to allergies.  You know, they all kinda go hand in hand.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And I have been to my doctor, um, probably five times out of -- yeah -- well, yeah -- five times out of those -- the -- the five months, you know, that I've had the bronchitis, and each time they've given me a different allergy medication.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I have tried different ones.  I have tried the Allegra D., I've tried, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Claratyne.
R:  The Claratyne, you know, ah, Zertec --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- D. Allergy, [NOISE] um, you know, all different kinds of ones and, you know, my neighbour told me about Benadryl and, you know, I give my -- I give Benadryl to my kids, you know what I'm saying?  It's like --
L:  Yeah, like I'll take Benadryl --
R:  I never thought about taking it --
L:  -- but it knocks me out.
R:  Yeah.  I never -- I never thought about taking it myself, you know?  And I did and I tell ya, that's the best thing out there right now [LAUGH].  It works.  It's the only thing that works for me.
L:  I'll take Benadryl but I don't like to take it during the day 'cause it usually just kinda makes me feel wonky, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, well like, you know, like I was saying, my neighbour, she told me about it.  She only takes hers at night 'cause it makes her sleepy, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it doesn't do that to me.
L:  That's good.
R:  I don't know why.  It's really strange.  But I don't buy the actual Benadryl version.  I buy the store brand.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know? [NOISE]
L:  I just buy the generic.
R:  I just can't see spending that kinda money on, ah --
L:  I know.
R:  -- but it's, it's --
L:  Medicine is so --
R:  -- outrageous.
L:  -- expensive.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it cold up there now where you are?
L:  You know, it got warm these last couple days and then today it started just light showers.
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's been so weird 'cause a few weeks ago it was hot and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a week later, it was snowing.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, I keep thinking spring's here.
R:  Right.  How often do you find yourself going to the doctor for allergy related things --
L:  You know, I --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- I don't like to go to the doctor [LAUGH], so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I just don't, 'cause I figure -- there's nothing they can really do for me and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know I should go and get some prescription medicine.  My mom's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- always getting after me, like, "Go get Claratyne or whatever".  And I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never get around --
R:  See now that --
L:  -- to it.
R:  -- they always gave me samples and none of that stuff ever worked and so I just never [NOISE] got a prescription for it.  But Benadryl was the one thing that really did. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] You know.  It's the only thing that seemed to work, [NOISE] but I found, you know, with, ah, you know, dusting, um, you know, trying to keep vacuuming and keep things clean and changing filters and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doing all of that stuff, I think it kind of keeps it -- it helps to keep it at bay --
L:  Yeah, it just --
R:  -- in homes.
L:  -- kinda maintains it.
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, when you go outside and you wanna work out in the yard, [LIPSMACK] forget it [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  It's all over with.  You might as well wear a mask or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  'Cause it's -- it's just -- you can't -- you -- then it's just a losing battle.
L:  I know.
R:  You know?  And I think it really affects, probably, ninety five percent of the population.  I mean --
L:  I know, I know.
R:  -- I mean, that's just my opinion, but I -- I really think that it affects --
L:  To some --
R:  -- more people.
L:  -- degree, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I mean, and -- and -- just recently I had a really bad sinus infection that actually it came out in my eyes in a -- in a really bad [NOISE] eye infection.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I had to go to the eye doctor and when I -- well, actually I went to my regular doctor.  [NOISE]  She couldn't believe it.  She said -- she looked in my nose.  You know, they look in your nose and throat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she said, "You are like so swollen and so closed off".
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And she's like, "That's what it is.  It's coming out in your eyes".
L:  Oh, God.
R:  Yes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was absolutely horrid and I had to go to the eye doctor too.  When I went, you know, I had to get my glasses and, you know, because I wear contacts --
L:  Mhm --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- I know --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- that makes it so hard.
R:  Oh, yeah.  So it was --
L:  So do I --
R:  -- actually terrible.
L:  -- but then, I try not wear the contacts and I -- just glasses are so annoying, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tell ya though; I got glasses finally after so many years.  I hadn't had glasses in, you know, millions of years, it seems like and -- 'cause I got so -- you know, I'd just been wearing contacts forever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm just got used to it, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have allergies and it -- it affects your eyes --
L:  And then you're walking around --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with these big red puffy eyes and you look like a monster.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  And it just -- it also infects your -- your contacts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know, it contaminates --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, your contacts.  You have to soak 'em and clean 'em and , you know, hopefully not have to buy new ones but, you know, like, I wear disposables so I can just throw 'em away but --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- [NOISE] even still, it costs, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, but, you know that -- on the recording, it said to -- to talk about the three different parts of how seasons, you know, how to keep yourself well or -- what do you to keep yourself well, and the other one -- the last one, I thought was really kinda funny about the old saying about someth- --
L:  I didn't hear.  What was the saying?
R:  It was something about a cold will last seven days if you don't go to a doctor [LAUGH].
L:  You know, I never go to the doctor for a cold.
R:  Y- yeah, I know.  It's kind of --
L:  Do you?
R:  -- I thought that was kind of stupid! [LAUGH] I was like, "Okay!"
L:  Like, there's nothing they can do for you.
R:  Not for a cold.
L:  No.  No.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's nothing so --
R:  You know?
L:  -- why waste my time and money?
R:  Right.
L:  So that they can tell me to get some rest and drink some orange juice --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and wait it out.  Like, no thank you.
R:  I mean I can see if -- if it turns into something like an infection, you know, something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you might need antibiotics or whatever, but [SIGH] --
L:  I'm kind of of the school of I don't go to the doctor unless like, I'm near my deathbed --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Any kind --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of a what -- like -- like, I -- I don't know.  I just don't like to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I -- I thought --
L:  Alarmed about a --
R:  -- that was so s --
L:  -- flu or something, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  I thought that was so weird.  I was like ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I know.  Well, do you get any other illnesses with --
R:  Um --
L:  -- the season change, besides the allergies?
R:  You know, not re- well, I have asthma.  I've had asthma since I was thirteen, but I have maintenance for that and [SIGH], um, I tell ya the medication, uh, that I take for that that really helps a lot is not just my regular inhaler that I use daily, but [SIGH] I use another medication called Advir.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Which is like a -- it's like a round disc.  It's in a --
L:  Yeah, I've seen that commercial.
R:  -- you've seen those?  Yeah, it's -- it's like a -- a powder and you inhale it, but it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it actually -- the one of the components in it is a steroid --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, so the -- I think with that in itself, I think that helps keep, you know, keep the, ah, asthma at bay pretty much.  But, ah, it really is so -- the, you know, it's the seasons can affect you so much with that.  But  --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they do me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but they don't -- it's -- they don't really h- really, I guess, ah, affect my asthma, so to speak, so much.  It's [NOISE] -- it's more my sinuses.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I think if I let it go and I didn't take care of it and I didn't have my inhaler and my other medication, I think it would.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But because I use those --
L:  It's to --
R:  -- when certain things --
L:  -- maintain.
R:  -- pop up, you know, in the air, you know, certain, uh, season changes and stuff --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- it -- it primarily attacks my sinuses.  So [LIPSMACK], but, ah, do you have any other things going on with you or ...?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  But you know, I did have really bad, bad allergies when I was younger --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then when I -- I grew up in California --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then when I moved to another area of California for school, they weren't as bad.
R:  Ah.
L:  Because I know that there's different pollens --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the different areas that you live and I just moved to New York this past year, so I don't -- I'm curious to see how New York's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] pollen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- affects me.
R:  Well, going from, I think, from California all the way over to New York is -- there's a huge d- you know, change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, your body goes through a lot of changes because of climate and different -- different, uh, things that are in the air, you know?
L:  Mhm.  This is gonna be my first summer here and I know it's just --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- gonna be so humid, which, I mean, I'm used to the heat.  I mean, where I was going to school like, in Sacramento would be like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- one fifteen --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- every day.  And here I think it's a hundred or something but much more humid.
R:  Right.
L:  So that's gonna be --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- not too pleasant --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- for me.
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't really experience any other illness with the season change.
R:  Wow.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I talked to a girl -- I did another, ah, ah, another, ah, panel just a little while ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, to -- with a young lady in Cal -- in LA.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, she was telling me that, you know, there they have to contend with that smog, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all that kinda junk and the -- I mean, that stuff never goes away, it's just always there, all year round, isn't it?
L:  That's true.
R:  You know?
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's always there [LAUGH].
R:  It's like, oh, I mean, I thought we -- you know, we have it bad here with pollen and different plants that bloom and stuff, but there, you just got that smog and the --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- just the pollution.
L:  -- it's really disgusting.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean it -- it's so misleading 'cause you look out the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- window and you think, "Oh, it's so overcast, you know?  Maybe I should bring a sweater".
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like, no, it's just smoggy --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- and gross.
R:  -- pollution, yeah.
L:  It's -- it's --
R:  Have you ever been to Seattle?
L:  Yes.
R:  There's a cloud that just sits over the city of Seattle.  Have you ever seen that?  Have you ever noticed that?
L:  No, I haven't.  I haven't --
R:  It's a --
L:  -- been there in a long time.
R:  Yeah, I've got a picture of it.  Matter of fact, my sister graduated from law school there and when I went there for her graduation.  This is many years ago.  We were coming over the SeaTac Bridge or whatever it is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's, ah, the thing you go over when you're coming from Tacoma to Seattle.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And there was this huge cloud and it
