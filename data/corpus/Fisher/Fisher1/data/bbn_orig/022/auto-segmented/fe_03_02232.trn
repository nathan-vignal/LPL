HELLO MY NAME'S ANN  (fe_03_02232-A-0001)
HI REBECCA [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02232-A-0002)
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST  (fe_03_02232-A-0003)
OKAY I DID IT ONCE I'VE ONLY DONE IT ONCE BEFORE BUT I'LL GO FIRST IF YOU WANT SO BASICALLY WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TALK ABOUT THE TOPIC WHICH IS UM WHETHER WE LIKE EATING BETTER IN RESTAURANT OR HOME  (fe_03_02232-A-0004)
AND MY ANSWER TO THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE I LIKE EACH ONE BETTER FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS  (fe_03_02232-A-0005)
SO I PREFER TO EAT AT A RESTAURANT WHEN I WANT SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF EASILY LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY ELABORATE OR GOURMET OR SPECIAL  (fe_03_02232-A-0006)
OR WHEN IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION BUT DAY-TO-DAY I PREFER HOME COOKED FOOD  (fe_03_02232-A-0007)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02232-A-0008)
OKAY  (fe_03_02232-A-0009)
I LIKE THAT SOMETIMES TOO BUT I DO REALLY ENJOY COOKING BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I JUST DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO DO OR  (fe_03_02232-A-0011)
YOU KNOW I I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ENJOYS THE THRILL OF THE CHASE OF FINDING ALL THE YOU KNOW UNIQUE AND EXOTIC INGREDIENTS  (fe_03_02232-A-0012)
AND WHO HAS THE PATIENCE TO YOU KNOW MAKE A SAUCE THAT TAKES FIVE OR SIX HOURS TO  (fe_03_02232-A-0013)
GO THROUGH MY HUSBAND HAS ACTUALLY DONE THAT BEFORE HE'LL MAKE THESE SAUCES THAT YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THREE PHRASES AND LITERALLY SIX OR SEVEN HOURS  (fe_03_02232-A-0014)
AND IT'S LIKE I DON'T THINK THEY TASTE THAT MUCH BETTER THAN SOMETHING I CAN MAKE IN TWENTY MINUTES SO IT'S NOT WORTH THE TRADEOFF  (fe_03_02232-A-0015)
TO ME BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT WHEN I GO TO A VERY FINE RESTAURANT AND THEY HAVE YOU KNOW SOUS CHEFS [LAUGHTER] WHO CAN SPEND ALL DAY MAKING A SAUCE FOR ME THAT'S CERTAINLY A GOOD THING  (fe_03_02232-A-0016)
SO I THINK THE OTHER PART OF THE TOPIC WAS TO DESCRIBE A LIKE YOUR IDEAL MEAL  (fe_03_02232-A-0017)
OKAY  (fe_03_02232-A-0018)
OKAY  (fe_03_02232-A-0019)
YUM  (fe_03_02232-A-0020)
YEAH THAT'S REALLY GOOD I LIKE LOBSTER PREPARED THAT WAY  (fe_03_02232-A-0021)
WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT WAS IT DID THEY SPECIALIZE IN SEAFOOD OR  (fe_03_02232-A-0022)
IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD I'M GETTING HUNGRY  (fe_03_02232-A-0024)
I HAD CEREAL FOR DINNER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02232-A-0025)
I'M GETTING LAZY BECAUSE MY HUSBAND ISN'T COMING HOME FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND AH MY MY DAUGHTER AH YOU KNOW WANTED SCRAMBLED EGGS FOR DINNER SO  (fe_03_02232-A-0026)
SO AT THAT POINT I DECIDED I GET THE WELL I DON'T GET THE NIGHT OFF I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT BUT  (fe_03_02232-A-0027)
I GET A FEW MINUTES OFF  (fe_03_02232-A-0028)
SO MY IDEAL MEAL WOULD PROBABLY BE I REALLY LIKE UM REALLY GOOD FRENCH FOOD  (fe_03_02232-A-0029)
SO  (fe_03_02232-A-0030)
WE TEND LIKE NOT TO GO OUT TO EAT VERY OFTEN BUT WHEN WE GO OUT WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE REALLY NICE  (fe_03_02232-A-0031)
WE'LL USUALLY START WITH YOU KNOW REALLY GOOD WINE  (fe_03_02232-A-0032)
SOUP OR A GREAT SALAD LIKE I LOVE LIKE REALLY GOOD CREAM FRENCH SOUPS  (fe_03_02232-A-0033)
AND THEN USUALLY FOR THE MAIN COURSE  (fe_03_02232-A-0034)
IT JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON MY MOOD LIKE A LOT OF TIMES I LIKE TO GET LIKE A REALLY GOOD STEAK WITH A REALLY GOOD LIKE WINE AND MUSHROOM SAUCE BUT REALLY I LOVE SEAFOOD I LOVE CHICKEN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02232-A-0035)
DUCK IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE AT HOME BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD AND TOO MESSY SO  (fe_03_02232-A-0036)
THAT'S ONE THING THAT I'LL ORDER OUT  (fe_03_02232-A-0037)
AND THEN UM TO ME DINNER OUT IS NOT DINNER OUT UNLESS YOU FINISH IT WITH A REALLY GOOD DESSERT  (fe_03_02232-A-0038)
BECAUSE I LOVE DESSERT  (fe_03_02232-A-0039)
AND  (fe_03_02232-A-0040)
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY MY IDEAL MEAL I HAVE TO SAY PROBABLY THE BEST MEAL I EVER EVER ATE  (fe_03_02232-A-0041)
I ATE IN FRANCE  (fe_03_02232-A-0042)
AT A RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH OF ALL THINGS AND IT WAS LIKE ON THE SOUTHERN COAST OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN WE'RE OUTSIDE  (fe_03_02232-A-0043)
AND JUST EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT I MEAN THE SERVICE WAS SO GOOD THAT WHEN THEY SERVED US  (fe_03_02232-A-0044)
A TART THAT I ORDERED FOR DESSERT LIKE IT WAS A TART WITH RASPBERRIES ALL PILED UP AND HE TOOK IT FROM THE DESSERT PART AND HE WAS PUTTING IT ON THE LIKE FROM THE TRAY ONTO A LITTLE DESSERT PLATE  (fe_03_02232-A-0045)
ONE OR TWO OF THE RASPBERRIES LIKE FELL OFF THE TART BUT THEY FELL ON THE PLATE OKAY THEY DIDN'T FALL LIKE ON THE FLOOR AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTY RASPBERRIES ON THE THING I MEAN IT WAS PILED LIKE SEVEN INCHES HIGH I SWEAR  (fe_03_02232-A-0046)
AND HE STARTS APOLOGIZING PROFUSELY BECAUSE TWO OF THE RASPBERRIES FELL OFF  (fe_03_02232-A-0047)
I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS FUNNY  (fe_03_02232-A-0048)
BUT IT'S LIKE THAT ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND SERVICE I LOVE TO BE SPOILED THAT WAY  (fe_03_02232-A-0049)
BUT THAT I COULD THAT I COULD HAVE EVERY SINGLE DAY NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT IN A RESTAURANT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN  (fe_03_02232-A-0050)
UP  (fe_03_02232-A-0051)
I LOVE TO COOK BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO DO THE DISHES  (fe_03_02232-A-0052)
YEAH YEAH WELL I'VE MET A FEW PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO MIND AND UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T MANAGE TO MARRY ONE OF THOSE  (fe_03_02232-A-0053)
MY HUSBAND LIKES TO EAT A LOT  (fe_03_02232-A-0054)
AND HE OCCASIONALLY LIKES TO COOK ALTHOUGH HE'S NEVER EVER HOME  (fe_03_02232-A-0055)
BUT WHEN HE DOES YOU KNOW COOK HE MAKES OH  (fe_03_02232-A-0056)
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MESSES  (fe_03_02232-A-0057)
AND THEN HIS IDEA OF CLEANING UP IS NOT QUITE AS CLEAN AS MY IDEA OF CLEANING UP  (fe_03_02232-A-0058)
I SWEAR WELL MY DAD IS LIKE THAT TOO HE CAN USE EVERY PAN IN THE KITCHEN TO MAKE SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE  (fe_03_02232-A-0059)
I THINK SO  (fe_03_02232-A-0060)

HUSBAND REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TIL WE GOT TOGETHER BUT THEN LIKE HE'LL GET ON SOMETHING AND HE'LL MAKE IT LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES UNTIL HE  (fe_03_02232-A-0063)

OH THAT'S GOOD  (fe_03_02232-A-0067)
OH I LOVE CILANTRO  (fe_03_02232-A-0069)
DO YOU EVER PUT CILANTRO IN LIKE A GREEN SALAD  (fe_03_02232-A-0070)
THAT'S I LOVE TO DO THAT A GUY I USED TO WORK WITH USED TO BRING A SAL- LIKE A SALAD AT LUNCH HE'D JUST USE LETTUCE AND A LITTLE LIKE FROZEN CORN THAT OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE THAWED BY THE TIME IT WAS LUNCHTIME  (fe_03_02232-A-0071)
