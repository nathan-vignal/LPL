THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE I'M IN MIN- MINNEAPOLIS THE SAME THING IT WAS GORGEOUS YESTERDAY  (fe_03_02293-A-0005)
YEAH I THINK THAT HAPPENS A LOT I KNOW I WAS IN OFFICE BUILDING AND EVERYONE WAS WELL NOT EVERYONE WAS SICK AT THE SAME TIME BUT THERE WAS IT WAS LIKE THIS HUGE GERM JUST WENT FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE  (fe_03_02293-A-0007)
AND SOMEBODY IN THE COMPLEX WAS ALWAYS SICK AND SNEEZING  (fe_03_02293-A-0008)
SO  (fe_03_02293-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_02293-A-0010)
SURE  (fe_03_02293-A-0011)
YEAH AND I I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT SO MANY BUILDINGS NOW ARE AIR TIGHT  (fe_03_02293-A-0012)
AND YOU YOU'RE NOT USED TO WHATEVER THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THIS CONTROLLED CLIMATE AND THEN WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN  (fe_03_02293-A-0013)
YEAH IF THE POLLEN HAS COME OUT  (fe_03_02293-A-0014)
SINCE YOU WENT TO WORK IN THE MORNING  (fe_03_02293-A-0015)
IT'S GONNA AFFECT YOU  (fe_03_02293-A-0016)
YEAH WELL I USED TO IT  (fe_03_02293-A-0017)
WAS FUNNY UM  (fe_03_02293-A-0018)
I WOULD BE REALLY SICK AT NIGHT LIKE GETTING A REALLY BAD COLD AND MY VOICE WOULD GET BAD MY EYES WERE WATERING AND I'D THINK OH FOR SURE I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK IN THE MORNING  (fe_03_02293-A-0019)
AND THEN BEFORE I YOU KNOW IN THE MORNING I WAS FINE  (fe_03_02293-A-0020)
OR JUST THE OPPOSITE I WOULD BE FINE IN THE MORNING AND THEN WHEN I GOT TO WORK  (fe_03_02293-A-0021)
ALL OF A SUDDEN I WOULD START TO GET SICK AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE  (fe_03_02293-A-0022)
YOU SHOULD GO HOME  (fe_03_02293-A-0023)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0024)
WELL PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME IF I HAVE ALLERGIES AND I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW I  (fe_03_02293-A-0025)
NOTHING IS SEVERE  (fe_03_02293-A-0026)
I MEAN  (fe_03_02293-A-0027)
LIKE IT'S I KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE IF THEY'RE IN A ROOM WITH AN ONION  (fe_03_02293-A-0028)
THEIR THROAT SWELLS UP AND STUFF  (fe_03_02293-A-0029)
BUT  (fe_03_02293-A-0030)
I DON'T KNOW IF I YOU KNOW LIKE I SEEM TO GET A RUNNY NOSE FREQUENTLY AND THEY SAY DO YOU HAVE A COLD AND I NO I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE A COLD WELL THEN YOU MUST HAVE ALLERGIES  (fe_03_02293-A-0031)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE CHANGE OF THE SEASON AND SURE THE POLLEN COUNT IS HIGH BUT  (fe_03_02293-A-0032)
IT NEVER STOPPED ME FROM DOING ANYTHING  (fe_03_02293-A-0033)
YEAH I DON'T FEEL SICK IT'S JUST ANNOYING BECAUSE MY NOSE WON'T QUIT RUNNING  (fe_03_02293-A-0034)
I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS MENTAL  (fe_03_02293-A-0035)
IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU BETTER YOU'RE GOING TO SWEAR BY IT OH YEAH I FEEL BETTER  (fe_03_02293-A-0036)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02293-A-0037)
MHM  (fe_03_02293-A-0038)
AND LIKE WITH THE RECORDING STATUS YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR WITH A COLD  (fe_03_02293-A-0039)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH OTHERWISE IT LASTS SEVEN DAYS  (fe_03_02293-A-0040)
I THINK THAT'S VERY TRUE EXCEPT NOW THEY THERE IS SUPPOSEDLY A MEDICATION THAT  (fe_03_02293-A-0041)
WILL GET RID OF A COLD  (fe_03_02293-A-0042)
BUT  (fe_03_02293-A-0043)
I DON'T KNOW IS A COLD REALLY SO AWFUL  (fe_03_02293-A-0044)
MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL BLOWN FLU IF YOU HADN'T HAD THE SHOT  (fe_03_02293-A-0045)
BUT I ALWAYS KINDA LAUGH AT PEOPLE WHO SAY PEOPLE WHO SAY I HAD A FLU SHOT AND I DIDN'T GET THE FLU THIS WINTER I'M LIKE WELL  (fe_03_02293-A-0046)
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE THAT WITHOUT THE SHOT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02293-A-0047)
NO  (fe_03_02293-A-0048)
IT'S SOME I I WAS  (fe_03_02293-A-0049)
REALLY ILL THE PAST TWO YEARS AND IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL  (fe_03_02293-A-0050)
AND THE STAFF THERE  (fe_03_02293-A-0051)
THEY'RE ALWAYS SICK  (fe_03_02293-A-0052)
[LAUGHTER] LIKE IF HOSPITAL WORKERS WITH ALL THEIR CLEANLINESS PROCEDURES AND THE GLOVES AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_02293-A-0053)
CAN'T STAY WELL WHAT HOPE IS THERE FOR THE REST OF US [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02293-A-0054)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02293-A-0056)
YOU SHOULD TRY IT IN MINNESOTA  (fe_03_02293-A-0057)
ACTUALLY IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS EXCEPT WE HAD A REAL COLD  (fe_03_02293-A-0058)
SEVERELY COLD STRETCH  (fe_03_02293-A-0059)
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO I HAVE A WATER BED AND I HAD THE HEATERS ALL CRANKED UP AS HIGH AS THEY WOULD GO  (fe_03_02293-A-0060)
AND I HAD LIKE SIX BLANKETS ON THEM  (fe_03_02293-A-0061)
AND I COULD NOT GET WARM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA DO  (fe_03_02293-A-0062)
OH SURE YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0063)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0064)
IS THAT THAT THE SAME TIME WHEN THE EAST COAST GOT ALL THAT SNOW  (fe_03_02293-A-0065)
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY I WAS WATCHING UM  (fe_03_02293-A-0066)
SOME OF THE MORNING TALK SHOWS LIKE REGIS AND KELLY  (fe_03_02293-A-0067)
AND HE WAS  (fe_03_02293-A-0068)
WHAT'S THE TEMPERATURE NOW OH MY GOD IT'S THIRTY THREE DEGREES AND I WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU WHINING ABOUT THAT WOULD BE BALMY FOR US  (fe_03_02293-A-0069)
BUT THEN THE AS THE SNOW ACCUMULATED I COULD SEE THAT IT WOULD BE A REAL PROBLEM WHERE DO YOU PUT IT IN A CITY THAT SIZE  (fe_03_02293-A-0070)
YEAH LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS  (fe_03_02293-A-0071)
A MILLION DOLLARS FOR EVERY FIFTY TONS I THINK  (fe_03_02293-A-0072)
AND THAT'S NOT MUCH WHEN YOU START FILLING A TRUCK WITH SNOW  (fe_03_02293-A-0073)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0074)
I KNOW HERE THEY WERE UM THEY HAD THE TRUCKS ALL READY TO START SWEEPING THE STREETS  (fe_03_02293-A-0075)
AND THEN THE WEATHERMAN KEPT SAYING WOW WE GOT A BIG SNOW STORM COMING  (fe_03_02293-A-0076)
SO THEY  (fe_03_02293-A-0077)
TOOK THE STREET SWEEPERS OFF THE TRUCKS PUT THE PLOWS BACK ON GOT THE SANDING TRUCKS LOADED AND READY TO GO  (fe_03_02293-A-0078)
AND ALL IT DID WAS [LAUGHTER] RAIN  (fe_03_02293-A-0079)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0080)
YEAH  (fe_03_02293-A-0081)
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY PEOPLE MAY GET SICK MORE OFTEN WHEN THE SEASONS CHANGE  (fe_03_02293-A-0082)
YOU KIND OF  (fe_03_02293-A-0083)
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DRESS  (fe_03_02293-A-0084)
YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU GO TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND IT'S REALLY REALLY COLD  (fe_03_02293-A-0085)
I KNOW AT LEAST IN MINNESOTA IT COULD BE SIXTY DEGREES BY THE TIME YOU'RE READY TO GO HOME  (fe_03_02293-A-0086)
OR VICE VERSA  (fe_03_02293-A-0087)
AND THEN PEOPLE ALWAYS TRY AND RUSH THE SEASONS SO THEY SEE YOU KNOW AS SOON AS IT GETS TO BE FORTY DEGREES PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND IN SHORTS  (fe_03_02293-A-0088)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02293-A-0089)
AND THEY GET THEIR BICYCLES OUT  (fe_03_02293-A-0090)
AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE  (fe_03_02293-A-0091)
IF YOU DRESS LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW THEN IT RAINS  (fe_03_02293-A-0092)
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA GET SICK  (fe_03_02293-A-0093)
