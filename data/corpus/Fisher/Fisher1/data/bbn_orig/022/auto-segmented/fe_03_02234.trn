GOOD ANSWER  (fe_03_02234-A-0004)
GOOD ANSWER DO YOU COOK FOR YOURSELF ALONE OR ARE THERE OTHERS THAT YOU COOK FOR TOO  (fe_03_02234-A-0005)
YEAH AND DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A GOOD COOK  (fe_03_02234-A-0006)

I AH WHEN I COOK IT IS USUALLY FOR MY TWO KIDS UNLESS MY HUSBAND HAPPENS TO BE HOME FROM WORK AT A REASONABLE HOUR WHICH IS FAIRLY RARE  (fe_03_02234-A-0011)
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE I CAN THROW PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE MORE TIME AND EFFORT I SEEM TO PUT INTO SOMETHING THE LESS THEY ACTUALLY LIKE IT SO  (fe_03_02234-A-0012)
WELL THEN I SUPPOSE THAT'LL HAPPEN TILL THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER BUT NOW THERE'S JUST NOTHING BETTER THAN MAC AND CHEESE THAT COMES OUT OF A BOX SO I JUST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02234-A-0013)
