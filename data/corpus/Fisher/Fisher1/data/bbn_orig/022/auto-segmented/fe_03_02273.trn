I I DIDN'T USUALLY GET SICK FROM THE AH SEASONS BUT MY CHILDREN DID  (fe_03_02273-B-0048)
UM ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL YOU KNOW BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WELL I'M OLDER TOO SO WHEN YOU'RE OLDER YOU HAVE MORE CHRONIC ILLNESSES THAN ACUTE ILLNESSES  (fe_03_02273-B-0049)

THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE ANOTHER THING IS  (fe_03_02273-B-0053)
ACTUALLY WE HAVE IT SO MUCH EASIER  (fe_03_02273-B-0054)
THAN OUR ANCESTORS DID OKAY SO  (fe_03_02273-B-0055)
OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS AREN'T BUILT UP  (fe_03_02273-B-0056)

RIGHT BUT SEE THE THING IS IF YOU WERE OUT  (fe_03_02273-B-0059)
FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE WHERE YOU HAD TO BE OUT MY THEORY IS IS THAT YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE THE ALLERGIES BECAUSE YOUR BODY WOULD BE USED TO IT  (fe_03_02273-B-0060)
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT MAY MAY OR MAY NOT I MEAN I'M SURE SOME OF IT IS HEREDITARY  (fe_03_02273-B-0061)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02273-B-0062)
RIGHT EXACTLY AND NOT ONLY THAT YOU KNOW THE WORK EVERYBODY WAS DOING BACK THEN  (fe_03_02273-B-0063)
YOU KNOW THEIR BODIES WERE STRONGER NOW THERE WAS A LOT OF DISEASE BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE MEDICINES AND STUFF THAT FOR THOSE PARTICULAR ONES  (fe_03_02273-B-0064)
BUT IF WE HAD THE MEDICINES FOR THOSE AND WE WORKED LIKE WE DID THEN I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE THAT MUCH ILLNESS  (fe_03_02273-B-0065)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02273-B-0066)
NO I WAIT  (fe_03_02273-B-0067)

AND I SAYS YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING MY SON [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02273-B-0089)
YEAH HE SAID WELL HE'S HAD IT TOO MUCH AND HE JUST I DON'T THINK HE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I WOULD KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE HERE'S A WOMAN WITH SEVEN KIDS SHE DOESN'T KNOW NOTHING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02273-B-0090)
