UH THE SEASONS OF THE THE CHANGE OF SEASONS SOMETIMES CAUSE ILLNESS  (fe_03_02285-B-0004)
AND DO WE AGREE WITH THAT IT  (fe_03_02285-B-0005)
DOESN'T MATTER MHM  (fe_03_02285-B-0006)
I'M FROM PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_02285-B-0007)

WELL HOPE THEY DIDN'T PULL YOU OVER  (fe_03_02285-B-0012)
THAT'S FINE  (fe_03_02285-B-0013)
WELL I THINK UH WINTER AND UH HARSH WEATHER DEFINITELY DOES BRING ON WHAT THEY USED THE CALL THE FLU SEASON  (fe_03_02285-B-0014)
AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE THAT IF YOU TREAT A COLD  (fe_03_02285-B-0015)
I FORGET ANYWAY IT'S LIKE A COLD USUALLY LASTS FOR SEVEN DAYS I AGREE WITH THAT UH IF IT IS UNTREATED AND IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR IT'S THREE DAYS BUT ANYWAY YOU KNOW A COLD USUALLY HAS TO RUN ITS COURSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY  (fe_03_02285-B-0016)
BUT YES THERE IS SUCH A THING AS FLU SEASON I THINK THE DOCTORS ALLOW FOR THAT ESPECIALLY WITH ELDERLY PEOPLE  (fe_03_02285-B-0017)
AND UH OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WHAT THEY CALL FLU SHOTS TO GIVE TO PEOPLE  (fe_03_02285-B-0018)
UH THEY ALSO WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE WAS UH WHAT WE WOULD DO TO PREVENT GETTING COLD UM MYSELF I JUST TAKE THE NORMAL PRECAUTIONS I I LAYER MY CLOTHING WE HAD A HELL OF A WINTER HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_02285-B-0019)
I DO THINK SO I THINK UH THE FLU UH EPIDEMICS HAVE BEEN MORE SEVERE  (fe_03_02285-B-0020)
AND UH THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE ONE DAY IT'S WARM AND THEN YOU GO  (fe_03_02285-B-0021)
IT CHANGES OVERNIGHT DRASTICALLY AND UH I THINK THAT'S BAD ON YOUR YOUR  (fe_03_02285-B-0022)
SYSTEM  (fe_03_02285-B-0023)
AND UH AS FAR AS CATCHING COLDS AND GETTING FLUS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE HAD A VERY BAD BAD WINTER SEASON HERE WHERE I LIVE WITH UH CHILDREN HAVING FLUS OUR SCHOOL WAS ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN  (fe_03_02285-B-0024)
AND UH FOR A FEW DAYS  (fe_03_02285-B-0025)
YEAH THE CHILDREN WERE ALL THERE WERE SO MANY CHILDREN OUT THEY DECIDED NOT TO HAVE CLASSES  (fe_03_02285-B-0026)
OUR EMERGENCY ROOM IN UNION TOWN COULD NOT TAKE ANY MORE PATIENTS AT ONE TIME BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL WAS FILLED WITH JUST PEOPLE THAT HAD THE FLU  (fe_03_02285-B-0027)
SO WE HAD A PRETTY BAD EPIDEMIC OF IT UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0028)
I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IN GETTING THESE FLU SHOTS UH THEY THE DOCTORS RECOMMEND THE ELDERLY TO GET THEM BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM MYSELF  (fe_03_02285-B-0029)
I DON'T GET THEM IT'S JUS A MATTER OF  (fe_03_02285-B-0030)
CHOICE I GUESS BUT UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0031)
JUST TAKING THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULD YOU KNOW LAYER YOUR CLOTHING AND TRY TO AVOID PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK BUT THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE  (fe_03_02285-B-0032)
AND UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0033)
OH ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_02285-B-0034)
ABSOLUTELY OUR WEATHER HAS BEEN WILD THIS YEAR  (fe_03_02285-B-0035)
IT'S BEEN REALLY CR- LIKE YOU'LL HAVE LIKE TWO OR THREE DAYS EVEN SPRING'S EVEN LATE AT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02285-B-0036)
IT'S BAD IT'S JUST BAD AND WE HAD A TERRIBLE WINTER HERE WE HAD RECORD BREAKING SNOWFALLS  (fe_03_02285-B-0037)
AND YOU SAID YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK I THINK YOU HAD IT UP THERE AS WELL  (fe_03_02285-B-0038)
SO IT HASN'T BEEN GOOD AND UH I DO THINK THE COLD WEATHER DOES BRING A LOT OF THE THE COLDS AND THE FLUS ON  (fe_03_02285-B-0039)
UH I THINK UH GOING TO A TANNING BED HELPS UH AVOID COLDS  (fe_03_02285-B-0040)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02285-B-0041)
WELL I THINK IT'S LIKE LIGHT THERAPY FOR THE BAD MONTHS WHEN YOU'RE DEPRESSED AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_02285-B-0042)
AND IT KIND OF CHEERS YOU UP  (fe_03_02285-B-0043)
IT WELL NO IT MAKES YOU LOOK BETTER WHEN YOU LOOK BETTER YOU FEEL BETTER BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHT THERAPY THERE BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME IN DARKNESS IF YOU'RE GOING TO A TANNING BED  (fe_03_02285-B-0044)
YOU'RE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THAT EXTRA AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND I THINK IT DOES DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_02285-B-0045)
I'VE I I'VE HEARD OTHER PEOPLE SAY THAT  (fe_03_02285-B-0046)
YES WELL IT'S A THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW THEY DO TREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM MILD FORMS OF DEPRESSION WITH LIGHT THERAPY  (fe_03_02285-B-0047)
I DON'T KNOW HOW SAFE IT IS EITHER BUT I JUST FIGURED I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE SO I WENT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02285-B-0048)
I WENT IT'S LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR I EVER WENT  (fe_03_02285-B-0049)
UH BECAUSE I WAS LIKE YOU I I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF IT WOULD BE  (fe_03_02285-B-0050)
ABSOLUTE  (fe_03_02285-B-0052)
IT DID IT REALLY DID AND I DIDN'T GET A COLD ALL WINTER LONG SO I I REALLY THINK THAT MIGHT OF HELPED I'M NOT SURE UM I COULDN'T PROVE IT BUT I DO THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT THERAPY  (fe_03_02285-B-0053)
BECAUSE IT DID MAKE ME FEEL BETTER AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN GET A TAN I JUST FELT BETTER  (fe_03_02285-B-0054)
I THINK IT WAS THE EXPOSURE TO THE EXTRA LIGHT AT THE BAD TI- LIKE JANUARY FEBRUARY YOU KNOW YOU COME HOME  (fe_03_02285-B-0055)
IN THE EVENING IT'S DARK AT FIVE O'CLOCK SIX O'CLOCK  (fe_03_02285-B-0056)
YOU LEAVE TO GO TO WORK AND IT'S DARK SO PEOPLE DO GET DEPRESSED AND I KNOW NOT TANNING BEDS BUT THEY DO USE SOME VARIOUS FORMS OF LIGHT THERAPY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE DEPRESSED  (fe_03_02285-B-0057)
IT SEEMED TO WORK FOR ME [LAUGHTER] AND I TOLD  (fe_03_02285-B-0058)
I I DO IN A WAY  (fe_03_02285-B-0059)
ER I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY ELSE EVERYBODY THAT I WORKED WITH HAD A COLD AND AND I DIDN'T AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING I DID THAT THEY DIDN'T DO  (fe_03_02285-B-0060)
SO I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S A THOUGHT [LAUGHTER] AND MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO TO TANNING BEDS  (fe_03_02285-B-0061)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02285-B-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_02285-B-0063)

AND I WAS NEVER AROUND SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE HAPPEN HAWK HACKING AND COUGHING AND SNEEZING  (fe_03_02285-B-0065)
IT WOULD IT WOULD JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON  (fe_03_02285-B-0066)
NO THIS WAS JUST LIKE WINTER COLDS AND I GUESS IF ONE PERSON GETS IT IN A WORKFORCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN CLOSED QUARTERS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_02285-B-0067)
EVERYBODY GETS IT BUT I DIDN'T GET IT EVERYBODY ELSE DID BUT ME  (fe_03_02285-B-0068)

AND YET OTHER PEOPLE MISS ALL THE TIME AND NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING  (fe_03_02285-B-0075)
YEAH I GUESS IT'S THE SAME EVERYWHERE  (fe_03_02285-B-0076)
IT REALLY IS WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS AS TO WAYS WE COULD PREVENT UH GETTING A COLD  (fe_03_02285-B-0077)
I I KIND OF AGREE I KIND OF AGREE  (fe_03_02285-B-0079)
THE RIGHT REST  (fe_03_02285-B-0080)

OF COURSE WE'RE ALL GOOD AT THAT [LAUGHTER] BUT UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0082)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02285-B-0083)
UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0084)
I THINK MO- MORE PEOPLE ARE CONSCIENTIOUS OF FLUS AND COLDS NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THE WEIRD ONES LIKE THE FLU STRAINS THAT ARE GOING AROUND  (fe_03_02285-B-0085)
AND WE HAVE THAT TERRIBLE THING GOING ON NOW THAT UH  (fe_03_02285-B-0086)
YES THE SARS THING  (fe_03_02285-B-0087)
AND UH THAT'S TERRIBLE  (fe_03_02285-B-0088)
AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_02285-B-0089)
UH THEY'RE WORKING ON  (fe_03_02285-B-0090)
SOME SORT OF A  (fe_03_02285-B-0091)
VACCINE OR SOMETHING FOR IT SOME KIND OF A SHOT FOR IT  (fe_03_02285-B-0092)
I THINK THEY'RE COME I THINK THEY'RE COMING CLOSE TO IT I HOPE IT'S SOON  (fe_03_02285-B-0093)
BECAUSE IT MUST BE HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS  (fe_03_02285-B-0094)
