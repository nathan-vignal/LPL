I FOUND THAT IN A LOT OF COOKBOOKS THAT ARE MADE BY FAMOUS  (fe_03_02230-A-0017)
RESTAURATEURS THAT AH THEY HAVE WAYS OF KEEPING YOU FROM REALLY GETTING THEIR RECIPE JUST RIGHT AND I THINK WELL PART OF THAT IS THAT THEY MAKE ASSUMPTIONS THAT BEING MASTER CHEFS AND HAVING LARGE RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY WOULD MAKE WHAT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MAKE YOURSELF  (fe_03_02230-A-0018)
THERE ARE CERTAIN FOODS THOUGH  (fe_03_02230-A-0019)
