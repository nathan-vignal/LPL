YES AT HOME IS MUCH BETTER OF COURSE UM I I THINK IT IS BETTER BECAUSE NOT ONLY AT HOME EVERY MEAL IS MADE INDIVIDUALLY  (fe_03_02214-B-0007)
AH AND IT IS MADE TO THE FULL ATTENTION OF WHOEVER IS COOKING IT THE BE IT  (fe_03_02214-B-0008)
WIFE GIRLFRIEND MOTHER  (fe_03_02214-B-0009)

ALSO SINCE THE HO- FOOD COOKED AT HOME IS PREPARED BY SOMEBODY YOU PROBABLY KNOW OR AT LEAST ARE ACQUAINTED WITH I THINK THEY KIND OF KNOW  (fe_03_02214-B-0011)

IT'S REALLY REVEALING ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT THEY DO IN  (fe_03_02214-B-0015)
RESTAURANTS SUCH AS FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS SUCH AS MCDONALDS AND UM SOME OF THEIR FOOD IS GENETICALLY MUTATED LIKE THE CHICKEN MCNUGGETS AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOOD ARE IT'S JUST BASICALLY  (fe_03_02214-B-0016)
A CONCOCTION OF CHEMICALS AND ADD WITH ADD A FE- A FEW DROPS OF FLAVOR TO MAKE IT TASTE LIKE IT'S REAL FOOD  (fe_03_02214-B-0017)
YEAH UM FOOD COOKED AT HOME MOSTLY SHOULD BE UM MORE SATIS- SATISFYING TO THE PERSON BECAUSE UM NOT NOT ONLY IT'S PROBABLY COOKED BY SOMEBODY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02214-B-0018)
AND THEY PROBABLY KNOW WHAT YOU YOU PROBABLY YOU WANT AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T YOU COULD TELL 'EM WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE SALT A LITTLE LESS SUGAR  (fe_03_02214-B-0019)
TH- THE RESTAURANTS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING THEY'RE JUST GONNA CRANK OUT MEALS UH LIKE ASSEMBLY LINE MEALS BASICALLY THEY JUST EVERYTHING EXACTLY THE SAME NO DIFFERENT IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY GENERIC AND THERE'S NO PERSONAL TOUCH TO IT OF COURSE YEAH  (fe_03_02214-B-0020)
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR  (fe_03_02214-B-0021)

THEY ARE NOT A FRANCHISE RESTAURANT ALTHOUGH THEY'RE A CHAIN UM THEY'RE ALL OWNED BY THE SAME PEOPLE AND UM  (fe_03_02214-B-0031)
ALL THEIR FOOD IS UM MADE QUITE WELL BECAUSE NOT ONLY I BELIEVE THEY UM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LIST OF HOW TO MAKE IT AND THEY ARE ALL PROPERLY TRAINED BUT ALSO I BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE ARE PEOPLE WHO  (fe_03_02214-B-0032)
UH THEY THEY'RE JUST LIKE GUESTS EXCEPT THEY ARE PAID TO UH TEST TO UM EAT THE FOOD AND SEE HOW  (fe_03_02214-B-0033)
UH HOW ON TIME THE DELIVERY IS AND UH HOW HOW WELL THE FOOD IS COOKED AND EVERYTHING AND I BELIEVE IN SEVERAL OTHER RESTAURANTS ALSO HAVE THEM I THINK  (fe_03_02214-B-0034)
JACK IN THE BOX HAVE THEM THEY'RE CALLED UM MYSTERY GUESTS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AND I I THINK THOSE REALLY HELP TO UP THE QUALITY OF FOOD IN RESTAURANTS TO A CERTAIN STANDARD I GUESS  (fe_03_02214-B-0035)
OH IT'S STILL EVERYWHERE OVER HERE UH ON THE WEST COAST  (fe_03_02214-B-0036)
EVERY CITY HAS ONE  (fe_03_02214-B-0037)
I I BELIEVE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THEY HAD UH A LITTLE SALMONELLA THING WHERE SOME KIDS DIED BECAUSE OF  (fe_03_02214-B-0038)
YEAH I I THINK THAT REALLY TOOK THE COMP- HIT THE COMPANY REALLY HARD UH  (fe_03_02214-B-0039)
FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST REFUSED TO EAT AT THEIR PLACE BECAUSE OF THE INFECTION BUT I I THINK IT'S A LOT MORE CLEAN- IT'S A LOT CLEANER NOW UM I CHECKED THE RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_02214-B-0040)
AROUND HERE AND UM THEY THEY LOOK PRETTY CLEAN COMPARED TO MCDONALDS WHICH IS JUST A MESS  (fe_03_02214-B-0041)

OH I HAVEN'T SEEN A WHITE CASTLE ANYWHERE AROUND LOS ANGELES OR ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA TOO  (fe_03_02214-B-0046)
FOR CERTAIN BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD IS THAT UM BECAUSE OF THE ADVENT OF MCDONALDS AND BURGER KING ALL THOSE CHAINS UM THEY CAN'T REALLY COMPETE WITH UM  (fe_03_02214-B-0048)
ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL SO THEY'VE RETREATED BASICALLY BACK INTO THE SOUTH I THINK GEORGIA AND ARKANSAS I KNOW THEY STILL HAVE SOME THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT I CAN UM  (fe_03_02214-B-0049)
I KNOW FOR SURE AND UM A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE STILL RECOMMEND THEM JUST LIKE IN AND OUT HERE UM THEY'RE MUCH BETTER THAN THE BIG CHAIN ONES AS FAR AS I KNOW  (fe_03_02214-B-0050)
