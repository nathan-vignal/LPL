L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name's Linda.  I'm in, ah, Louisiana.
R:  Hi, I'm Elsie.  I'm in Tennessee. [MN]
L:  Okay, nice to meet you. 
R:  Mm, what part of Lou- -- what part of Louisiana are you in?
L:  I'm in Alexandria.
R:  Oh.
L:  How about Tennessee.  Where are you?
R:  Memphis.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Mm.
L:  Been through there many times.
R:  Oh, yeah?  Well I go to La Ronge and Hammond, ah, quite a bit --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Well, what do you think about Iraq?
R:  [MN] Well, I'm kinda -- oh, have mixed emotions on it.  Yes, one -- one way I feel, we -- we should go ahead and bomb him off the face of the earth --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and be done with it, [LAUGH] you know.  And then another is like, "Well, what is that gonna do?" [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm kinda -- kinda mixed.  I'm not a real political --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, person and so forth.
L:  [MN]
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, it's making me awful nervous.
R:  [MN]
L:  I see the President's gonna have a live, ah, press conference tonight at eight o'clock.  I just saw that on the news and that's kinda making me nervous too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The last time, you know, we bombed, his daddy did that the night before.  [LAUGH] So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda making me nervous.  But, ah, I think we're gonna have to do it.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  [MN]
L:  But I -- I just --
R:  What bothers me the most is I've got kids, [LAUGH] you know, old enough to be drafted and --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  So that [SIGH] -- that's -- you know, before it was never really touched home enough, you know, until -- I -- I guess that's a selfish way to look at it. [LAUGH]
L:  No, nah, I mean, that's the way you have to look at it.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  But it's, uh -- we're right, ah, at a military base about forty miles away --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they've, uh -- it's a joint readiness training, uh, launch pad, and they've had just hundreds and hundred and hundreds of people ship out of here.
R:  Mm.
L:  In fact this last Sunday there was three hundred and fifty, uh, [LIPSMACK] I guess you'd call it a -- a -- a convoy came by my house and it was just something.  It was scary to watch.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But I think we're goi- -- i- -- if we do this we're going to end up being in hot water in a lot of places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know I think it all stems to -- you know, the United States made it so easy for all the -- the foreigners to come over here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and give them everything that, you know, us Americans couldn't get, you know, and uh, no p- -- taxes and so forth like that.  So, you know, in a way you have to look at it that we asked for it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or we welcomed it, in a sense.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And it -- it's just something else.  It's, uh -- I'm afraid we're going to end up getting into it with Libya an- and, uh, Iran again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And then we got Korea over there just sitting.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  But --
R:  -- you know, if you read in Revelations, it's all pointing to the, you know, closer to the end of time so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you look at it one way, well, it's gonna happen, no matter what [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] I don't want to be there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  But it -- it -- it is scary, you know.  But then on the other hand and I'm -- I'm real conservative normally, but on the other hand we're kinda being pompous sitting there saying, "We can have nuclear bombs but you can't".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "We have sense but you don't". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  It's kinda, like, I don't know who we think we are.
R:  Yeah ... 
L:  I don't know.  It's -- it's something else.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Ah, do you know anything about his son?  Have you seen anything on, uh, Hussein's son?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  I saw this thing on -- I guess it was on Sixty Minutes [MN] the other night and, uh, he said that, um, he's like the worst terrorist in the world.  He tortures everybody and they said that he was in charge of the Olympic team and anybody that didn't make the team or didn't do good, he physically beat them with sticks and stuff.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  No, I haven't -- haven't heard that.  I know, uh, the fifteenth I'm leaving here and flying up to New York for a vacation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's like we're gonna go, you know, look at the, ah --
L:  Trade Center.
R:  Ground Zero --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so forth, you know.  And, ah, [SIGH] I -- I told my friend, I said, "Well, we need to see a lot of the -- the sights that we've never wanted to see before, you know, because --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they may not be there again --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, when we go again.
L:  That's true.  Have you been there before?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Make sure you go see the Statue of Liberty and --
R:  Oh yes.
L:  -- all that good stuff.
R:  I -- I collect her so I got --
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  I got millions of her. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] Y- y- -- we go -- go see her every time we -- every time we go up there.
L:  Yeah.  Are you nervous flying?
R:  No, I don't mind flying.  You know, the -- the terrorist thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is kinda in the back of my mind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I'm not worried about it.  You know, hey, if it's my time to go, I'm gonna go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  It makes you -- it makes you, ah -- the few flights I've been on since then, ah, makes you nervous.  You look at your passengers a little different. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you're just looking at everybody.
R:  Yup. [MN]
L:  So ...
R:  I know we -- we had a revival one time and we had this preacher who was talking and it was shortly after that and he said, "If you ever fly" he says, "always take you an alka seltzer and a bible on board with you".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he says -- and then, "Cause terrorists are deathly afraid of -- of Jesus" you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  He says, "You poke the alka seltzer in your mouth and you start foaming at the mouth --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and you hold up the bible". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  A friend of mine said she's gonna do that if she ever got rear ended.  She's gonna fall out of the car and throw a alka seltzer in her mouth.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  [MN]
L:  That's something though.  I tell you what, I checked just out of curiosity, like, two days after that Trade Center and the flights had dropped to, like, ninety six dollars round trip from here.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, trying to get people to come.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I haven't been up there, in I guess in about two, three years, now.
R:  Mm.  Well, it's been -- I guess it's been two or three years since -- since I've been up there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, no, probably, oh, four or five now.
L:  Yeah.  You sure --
R:  'Cause I haven't been up there since my grandbabies have been born.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So ... I got my -- my little -- well, my granddaughter will be two in -- in June --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I got her, you know, saying, "Dat you, [inaudible]". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She knows every time Grammy comes she's got something with -- and they got on the computer and made a picture and put her face in the Statue of Liberty's face.
L:  Oh.
R:  So that's my key chain.
L:  Oh, that is neato.
R:  So ... [SIGH]
L:  And how many grandchildren you have?
R:  Two.
L:  Oh.
R:  I got a boy and a girl.
L:  How old's the little boy?
R:  He -- he'll be a year old in August.
L:  Oh, neat.  That's the best time, when they're little like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Before they start going to school and learning how to say ugly words --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that good stuff. [MN]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] which I about had a fit 'cause they're from the -- from my same son. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I thought, "Lord" you know. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Huh, what do you think you are?  Rabbits?
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, but it's -- it's worked out real good and my -- my granddaughter, sh- -- she's almost two and weighs twenty pounds, and my grandson, uh, he's already twenty pounds.  He's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- fat little roly poly.
L:  Ahah, man.  I'll tell you what -- 
R:  Ah, they are a joy.
L:  Yeah, I'll bet they are.  I mean, I'm [MN] -- and you got a -- you said you had kids who were old enough to be in the service?
R:  Yeah.  I've got o- -- I've got one son, well, he's married, the one that's married and got the babies.  He'll be the last to go, I know, but then I've got a son that's, uh, just turned twenty.
L:  Yeah.  Ooh.
R:  So -- and single -- so, he'll be one of the -- the first called up.
L:  Well, they probably won't draft though.  They got so many people these days, you know, and they got so many in the reserves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they've called in a lot of 'em but, you know, tons of 'em haven't left.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was watching last night and they said, uh, you know, one guy had been called out, I think they said nine times and he'd never had to go anywhere.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, hopefully.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how many people does it take?
R:  Really. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, I -- I think with things like this they ought to get all them criminals out of jail and make them go do the fighting. [LAUGH]
L:  And that's the truth.  This, ah, woman that, ah, I used to work with said -- she said, one -- ah, the -- after Nine One One she said, "They ought to take every killer, serial killer and just vengeful killer and put them out of prison and tell them, 'Here's a million dollars if you can bring me his head'. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just ship them over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  It's nerve wracking though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Tell you what.  How'd you get hooked into this? Is this your first time doing it?
L:  Ah, well no, I've got a -- yeah, this is the first phone call I've --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- I've done.  Ah, my girlfriend, she heard ab- -- s- saw it on the Internet so she called me and, uh, sent me the email and so I signed up for it and then my [SIGH] -- I signed my mother up.  She just lost her leg in December --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- from, ah -- she went -- April she went in to have a knee replacement and got staph --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and they kept messing round and messing round, so they finally had to take the leg off in December.
L:  Ooh.
R:  So she's at home with no -- no income but her social security --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I thought, "Well, that'd be good for her".  And she got her first call yesterday.
L:  Oh, well, good.
R:  And then I signed my daughter in law up and she got her first call yesterday and I'm thinking, "Well".  Actually, they were supposed to do my call -- my calls at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they have called various times here at work but they -- ah, with the computer, the girl didn't know what it was.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So ...  And I -- when I was on the switchboard earlier one come through.  It's like, "I don- -- I don't have my password over here". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh lord.  I know I had to run when the phone started ringing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to try to find mine.
R:  [MN] 
L:  What kind of job do you have?
R:  Ah, I work at a steel fabricating shop.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  You know, clerical.  I'm a QC clerk, kinda like a, uh, a secretary in a sense.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's neat.  I just lost my job.  I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I worked for Bell South and, uh, [MN] we, uh -- they called it a transformation.  It was really a l- -- that means layoff in the real world.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah, they moved our, ah, office down to Baton Rouge.  I'm in the middle of the state and it's about a hundred miles away to Baton Rouge and I've got a widowed mother here and I couldn't [LIPSMACK] -- couldn't follow my job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm just kinda staying at home and enjoying myself right now.
R:  Mm.
L:  Doing a -- doing this kinda stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Do you get very many of these calls?
L:  This is the very first one.  You know, mostly I do that mystery shopping.
R:  Yeah, well, [MN] that's what my friend does and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  have helped her a time and then I have, oh, I've s- -- registered for a bunch of the company's sh- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  [MN]
L:  It's neato.  I've got twenty one scheduled in the next four days. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, I gotta go soon as I get off here, go and do a Kroger [SIGH] mystery shopper.
L:  Oh, yeah, I just picked up a Kroger too.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I just can't -- ah, I gotta drive out of town tomorrow about a hour north of here to -- to pick up a whole bunch of stuff.  They had a bunch of stuff that's just sitting there and offering bonuses so I said, "Shoot, I'll go do that".
R:  Really?
L:  You know, I love it when I can get the gas ones, that pays for my gas to go and buy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and get something
