L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm --
R:  Hi.  [NOISE]
L:  My name's -- 
R:  How -- [NOISE].
L:  -- Dawn. 
R:  I'm Rachel.
L:  Hi, Rachel.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.
R:  Um, where're you located? 
L:  So, how would you react if you were -- if they --
R:  Ah ...
L:  -- dropped a bomb in [LAUGH] wherever you live? 
R:  I -- I think [LAUGH] --
L:  Panic.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think everyone would be panicked, but I think especially because of all the hype.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, I -- I think it -- I think they're making it out to be a lot worse than it would be.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I think they're causing all this, too.
L:  Exactly.  The press has blown it up and -- 
R:  Oh, crazy.
L:  I mean, these countries that, you know, we're at war with now, supposedly, [NOISE] have been going through this stuff every day for years and --
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
L:  You know, we're just in a very -- I mean, we're -- I'm happy to be in a wonderful country, but --
R:  I -- I agree.
L:  -- we're spoiled.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I agree.  [NOISE] 
L:  You know.
R:  I -- I think that our country is the reason for a lot of it too, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  And I [NOISE] -- I think it's because of the economy and they're trying [NOISE] to boost the economy.  I think that's the only reason they're try they're trying to start this, and I think we're trying to steal, um, the country from Saddam for oil.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  So, I -- I think we -- we are the reason for this and I can understand why they'd want to attack us.  [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  I feel bad for --
R:  But in the same sense --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't -- I mean, especially like where -- I'm in south east Florida and the -- the coastal regions are going to get it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A lot.  I mean, no ma everyone's going to get it [MN] regardless.  Like, everyone's going to get it, but, I mean, they're going to -- the coasts are going to get it first -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then it's going to move inward, and I mean -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  That -- that's the scary part for me.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's very scary and, um, I just figure, you know, no matter what we say or do, the -- [MN] it's the big leagues that are going to determine what's going to happen anyways. 
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  So --
R:  -- we have no say. 
L:  There's no sense --
R:  None.
L:  -- in panicking right now.  I'm not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- panicked when they did the whole duct tape thing.  I didn't do that.
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't get all --
R:  [NOISE] I didn't even hear about that.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, there was a whole big thing, because I live in New York.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, there was -- 
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- this whole big thing of you gotta --
R:  So, you guys are definitely [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the terrorism alert.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] So, it's like, "Buy duct tape.  Tape up all your windows in case the poison's coming in and" -- 
R:  You're kidding me.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, [MN] no, it was a big thing for a while and -- 
R:  Oh my gosh, I never even heard of that.
L:  I was just like, "You know what?  Tape is not going to stop if it's really poison that they're talking about".
R:  Oh, definitely. 
L:  It's going [NOISE] to seep through.  You're just -- you can't stay in your house forever.  It's just not --
R:  [MN] And you can't be -- you can't be scared and you can't live in fear every day either.
L:  No.  There's only so much you can do as an individual and -- yeah, [NOISE] that's -- [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [NOISE] It's -- me and, ah, my boyfriend, we live part time in South Africa -- 
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and w --
L:  -- how wonderful.
R:  Yeah, it is, and we -- we're only back here because, ah, he's going through a custody battle and we were only supposed to be here, like, two weeks, it's been nine months, and all we can keep thinking is, "Gosh, we just want to get out of here before the shit hits the fan" you know.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like -- we -- because no one's going to bother South Africa.  You know, they have nothing to do with anything.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, [LAUGH] we want to be back there so bad and li like it's -- it's just not working and, oh, everyone's saying, you know, "Oh, March something's going to happen.  Oh, April something's going to happen".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just want to be out of here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  How wonderful.  How, um -- how -- were you, like, in the peace corps or something?  Is that [NOISE] why you joined -- went to South Africa or -- 
R:  [NOISE] No, he, um -- [NOISE] he's had a factory there for about eight years and he manufactures, ah, swimsuits, children's swimsuits -- 
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  -- like a sun -- sun protection sun suits.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and he's, like, travelled all over [NOISE] the world and he said it's, like, the most beautiful place [NOISE] and the exchange rate's [NOISE] favorable.  [NOISE] So, he told -- he -- you know, he was telling me about it and I was, like, "All right, let's go" you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [NOISE] we we're there and, oh, my gosh, [NOISE] he's so right.  [NOISE] It's so beautiful there. 
L:  That's the -- 
R:  Everyone --
L:  -- first place --
R:  -- everyone speaks English.
L:  -- I'd always want to go; exotic, you know.
R:  Oh, it's so perfect. 
L:  That would be where I'd want to go, definitely. 
R:  Yeah, ever everyone speaks English perfect.
L:  Mm.
R:  Food's good.  I mean, we had a place right on -- right on the beach and it was like, I mean, cheap; real cheap.  Everyone there has maids.  [NOISE] It's like thirty dollars a week for a live in maid.  She cooks.  She cleans.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [MN] You live like royalty.  It's absolutely insane.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And then you come back here [NOISE] and, you know, you're, like, doing your own laundry again and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, like, and you're s and [NOISE] you get spoiled.  You know, I mean, I've always done everything for myself.  [NOISE] I don't mind doing it, but it's nice when somebody does it, you know.  
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, yeah [NOISE] --
L:  If you could come home and things were done, hey -- no one would cr- I wouldn't cry if -- if I came home and my house was clean and my dishes were done.
R:  Oh, you -- you couldn't mess it up.  The minute something, like, was on the floor, it's picked up.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was so funny.  I mean, it -- it was -- it was actually humorous.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like, "What do you want for breakfast?"  You're, like, "Breakfast?  I just woke up".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you're not even in that mode yet.
L:  Right. 
R:  So, it --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it were -- yeah, I -- we definitely are trying to get back there as fast as possible, but in the same sense all our family is still here.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I have family up in Illinois and, you know, so you got to worry about them in the same sense, too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- we -- we're pretty much all around [NOISE] here.  So, if -- if New York gets hit --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- big, we're all pretty much --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- gone, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  You're all going together.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We're not going to miss each other because we're not going to be here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to miss each other. 
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that'd probably be the best way to go, though --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with all of you, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
L:  Oh, my goodness, so ...
R:  Yeah, so -- I mean -- 
L:  Did you know anyone who was on any of the -- in the buildings or on any --
R:  No.
L:  -- of the planes?
R:  I [MN] -- I didn't.  [NOISE]
L:  I didn't either.
R:  No, I mean [NOISE] -- I -- I remember, like, [NOISE] watching on TV, and I think everyone, the whole country, was numb.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like, absolutely numb.  But it's -- I mean, [MN] it had to be so much worse there.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  I mean, and it's still -- I -- I mean still to this day it gives me chills to think about it, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I wanted to go to ground zero [NOISE] or at least near there to help volunteer do stuff, but I have three little kids --
R:  Oh, yeah, it's hard. 
L:  -- so I wasn't able to.  But I -- my heart was there with them -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to help and ...
R:  The whole country, I mean.
L:  Yep, it was --
R:  I --
L:  -- something else.
R:  [MN] Definitely.  [NOISE]
L:  But, see, then I look at -- I look at the whole world as a family.  That's my thing.  I don't look at just the United States as a family.  The whole world is one family.  We all live on the earth.
R:  I agree.
L:  And so, you know, when they're saying, you know, God is -- is with this country, I don't think so.  He created everyone.  So, it's like you -- y you don't want them --
R:  I --
L:  -- you don't want anyone --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to die.  You don't want them to bomb other countries.
R:  I --
L:  You don't want them to bomb this country.  That's --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- that's where I am.  I -- I just --
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't want anyone suffering because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of anything.
L:  No.
R:  You know, whether we did it or not.  I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I -- I don't -- wouldn't like to see that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they just [NOISE] -- none of the lead -- [NOISE]
L:  Very sad.
R:  All -- all the leaders, they're -- they're more political and they don't really care, you know.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And there's nothing you can do.  I mean, you --
L:  No.
R:  -- they say, "Oh, vote" -- you know, "Voting, your vote counts".  It really doesn't.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  It doesn't at all.
L:  If they want -- they get a bee in their bonnet or whatever they call it, they're gonna do what they gotta do or want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to do or feel they should do for their own benefit or -- 
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] yep, and -- and money talks.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's definitely true.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, that -- I think that's the whole reason Bush has gone to war, because we're in a recession and he doesn't want us to go in a depression.
L:  Right, and the thing is, I mean, this is the same guy that messed with his dad years ago.  This is the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- same group [NOISE] that has the oil.  [NOISE] I mean, he owns an oil company.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Exactly.
L:  Halloo[?].
R:  [MN] Exactly. 
L:  I'm thinking it's --
R:  So --
L:  -- a little personal here, you know --
R:  [MN] Of course his --
L:  -- and his bringing -- 
R:  -- interests are -- are focused on that, and it's just ridiculous, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, look how long they searched for weapons.
L:  Yep.
R:  Look -- I mean, and -- and we're going against the United Nations.  Like, that -- that to me is just --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you're calling for -- to be attacked.
L:  Yep.
R:  Like -- [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  -- by whoever.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And then they're absolutely provoking it.
L:  Yep.  Oh, yeah.
R:  And everyone's saying, "Oh, well, Korea doesn't have the money" or whatever.  You know what?  It doesn't [LAUGH] --
L:  They're going to find it.
R:  -- it doesn't matter.  They have so many people who put money into it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like [NOISE] everyone who's there will put all their money into it.  Here, I'm not going to throw money into the government --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and into terror you know, I'm not going to throw money in to bomb people.
L:  Yep, exactly.  [NOISE] I know, it's -- [PAUSE] but we're just the people.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  We don't really have much say.  [LAUGH]
R:  We -- we just got to look at the news every day and watch and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, and think, "Hey, that's not what I wanted him to do".  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Exactly, and in the same sense, like -- I mean, yeah, I -- I definitely think there would be widespread panic, but -- 
L:  Yeah, oh definitely.
R:  I -- I mean, how can there not be with the hype? 
L:  Right, right.  I agree.
R:  Not looking forward to it.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, exactly.  The next couple of years are going to be very interesting either way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Exactly.  [NOISE] Exactly.  I -- oh, I can't imagine raising kids in this time now, you know.
L:  Yeah, oh -- 
R:  Like, oh -- it's hard.  Like, how do -- they don't understand.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And how do you explain it, you know? 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  But, you know, I -- [NOISE] I -- I always think of like, um, Czechoslovakia or other different countries that are continually living like this.
R:  Right.
L:  How they must feel, the kids and -- they must be numb, continually. 
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know, but they're always in -- in -- being shot at by somebody, some group in their own country.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And [PAUSE] they don't panic anymore.  They're just sort of like, [NOISE] "Well, if I'm going to live I'll just live, and if I'm going to die [LAUGH] pretty [NOISE] much I'm going to die".  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  There's not a whole lot they can do about it either and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I just hope the United States doesn't become like that, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I know my boyfriend does business in Israel, too, and [MN] -- I mean, he was there, like, I'd say a year and a half ago, and -- I mean, they -- it started getting bad, like bombs and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he -- I mean, at the time there was, you know -- he -- he's like, "I got to get out of here" and when that starts happening they don't let planes out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like security wise the they -- [LAUGH] they -- [NOISE] not only that, but then they started looking at the Americans and they're like, "What are you doing here?  What are you" -- you know -- [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  -- questioning. 
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's -- it's a scary time to travel, too.  [NOISE] Not just like getting on and off planes, but [NOISE] you don't know how people feel about Americans [NOISE] when you get there.  [NOISE]
L:  Ex exactly.  Exactly.
R:  And that -- that part's scary, [NOISE] and you can't, like, play it off like you're not.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's pretty obvious, [NOISE] you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm definitely a -- an American.  I can't, ah -- I have no accent or, ah --
R:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that's the hard pa and, I mean, [MN] they know right off the bat.  Even in South Africa they're like, "Oh, Americans".  Now there they love Americans.
L:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they -- they are so fascinated.  They want to know everything about America --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they want to all ...
