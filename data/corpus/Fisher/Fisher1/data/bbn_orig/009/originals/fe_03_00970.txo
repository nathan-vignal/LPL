R:  Hello, this is Shirley.
L:  Hi, this is Tammy -- you should introduce yourself after the tone.
R:  After the tone?
L:  Did you hear the tone? 
R:  I think airport security, yes, I think it will -- [NOISE] 
L:  I believe that airport security has decreased the likelihood of another attack.  What do you think about that? 
R:  I think so also.
L:  How do you think that that's happened? 
R:  Well, I think anybody who might be thinking about it now would think twice because there is security everywhere you go and they check everything now and I think people think twice before they try to do it again.
L:  I don't think that it's necessarily gonna stop something like that from happening again because they're gonna find a way to do it no matter what.  I think those terrorists are smart and like it or not they're gonna find a way to do what it is that they want to do.
R:  Whether it be in the airports, at the bus terminals, on the bridges, like, you know, everybody is having us be aware of now, they will try just about anything and rent cars, rent motor homes.
L:  Yeah, I agree with that too.  I don't know if the increased security has lessened there.  If anything it's motivated them to find even sneakier ways to get into the airport and get in undetected because basically that's what they do.  Terrorists, they operate like that.  So that's just the way that they're gonna do things.  What do you think? 
R:  Yes, that's easily what they do and lots of times I think that some of the terrorists, like the ones that they had caught, were already here and watching us, listening to our news reports and plotting what they could do after listening to the reports around the country.
L:  Yeah, I agree with that too because just like the last guy that they caught, he went to a historically black [inaudible] university, he actually got a degree from a school here so they're everywhere.  There's nothing that we gonna -- I don't think there's anything that we can really do to -- that's gonna curtail them.  We might slow 'em down a little bit but they're gonna do it whether it's in the air or on a train or a bus like they do in -- in Europe, they are always doing it on buses and I don't think it's gonna be long before we are gonna have suicide bombers walking around with bombs strapped to themselves like they do over there in Israel.  So, I mean just trying to narrow the slate, narrow it down to the airport is just not really -- I don't think it's really a feasible thing because there are so many airports and then if they don't go to a major airport, what happens if they go to a small private airport and they charter a plane and then they ram the plane into -- you know, they ram that plane into another plane or something, so it's just kind of crazy the way the -- that the world is right now.
R:  You know, it's kind of scary but what we have to do is put our hands in the, you know, into the hands of the Lord and just go on living our lives daily and be aware, as long as we are aware of all of this, you know, we won't be too shocked when things happen.  We just have to, you know, be on our guard all the time and go on with our lives.
L:  And I don't -- I don't even know if the airport security is all that they are saying it's cracked up to be there because, I mean, they're going to find a way to get the stuff in there.  Somebody is not going to do their job, somebody is going to be slacking or, you know, there's going to be something that's going to slip by because after all it's just -- you know, we are just human and they're gonna find some kind of way to masquerade and they're gonna find some way to hide the explosives and, you know, I just don't know, there's so many people on the payroll that you don't know that haven't been identified.  I mean, that's how terrorism works, you know, you have the people that you least suspect doing these things and then when it all comes out everybody's saying, "Gosh, that was my neighbor, I can't believe, I didn't know that", but that's the whole idea behind it, you don't know.
R:  And these people are so smart, so sneaky, they look just like ordinary Americans walking down the street every day and it's gonna be hard.
L:  Well, I think the whole basis behind terrorism itself is based on terror and, I mean, I think the heightened airport security is just playing into their hands, not saying that we should lessen its security but I don't know, it should have been there all along, just because of the world that we live in today and the increased security, sure it makes your trip longer and it takes hours, more hours to travel and it makes it almost not worth it to fly but you fly and you pay for that convenience because you don't want to drive or you don't want to catch a train so you want to get there the quickest way you can and that's just a part of using the airport.  I mean, the security has to increase if -- if they want to have the conf- -- if they want the consumers to have the confidence in the airports that they will use them and, you know, the airports can continue to make money and then, of course, the country can continue to make money out of the airports making money out of the people that want to make the money to fly, to fly to go and make more money.  So, I mean, it's just a vicious cycle but the increased security is just a part of that.
R:  And maybe soon, maybe if the United States were patting themselves after the way it is overseas in all the foreign countries, they have that security in their airports and they have had it for years.  So, maybe if we keep this up and structure our lives the way they do over there, we might be able to, you know, crack a little bit of it, slow it down a little bit.
L:  Yeah, but the bottom line is that the security is going to have to stay there and, you know, it's unfortunate that we have to go to such lengths to try to protect ourselves from a hidden danger but, you know, I say that it is a good thing that we have the security and it's an inconvenience but when you weigh it out is it really an inconvenience if it actually saves your life?  So, I mean, you know, just like what happened with September eleventh and because they weren't on top of it, you know, there were measures in place then, it just didn't happen.  So, I mean, we can't -- I don't know that the increased security is an overreaction but, I mean, is -- can it be an overreaction up to this point or what, I really don't know.  So what else do you think? 
R:  I don't think it really takes -- it doesn't take too much effort or money to keep the security in the airports, the government is just going to have to get up off that money and pay for that security and we have to pay more taxes, that's just the way it is now.  That's gonna be a part of our lives now that we have to pay that extra tax, extra plane fares so that we can fly and feel comfortable flying, taking our children in the air nowadays.  I don't believe anybody has -- I don't believe that there has been any less people flying than there were before the accident, before nine eleven.
L:  I don't know, I think things kind of died off after nine eleven but I think they're starting to pick up because of the security being put in place.  However, you know, when you said that, you know, the government's not paying for it, we're paying for it, because -- and it's just something that you're going to have to pay for, you're going to have to pay for that convenience.  Once again flying is a convenience, you know, and for some people it's a luxury but you have to pay for those things, you know, and, you know, that's just part of it, that's part of living in this country that we live in, you have to pay.  If you want to play, you've got to pay.
R:  I love to travel and when I'm going like distances I prefer to fly than drive and I go and get on the plane now and just leave earlier and go and so far it's been okay.
L:  Yeah, and hopefully it will stay that way.  But, you know, like I said, it's just a necessary part of the travelling process.  If you're gonna fly, it's just a necessary thing that you have to go through.  So, you know, what can you do except pay it.  Either you pay it or you don't go and if you're trying to get where you have got to get and you want to get somewhere quickly that's what you're gonna have to do so that's just the way -- you know, that's the way the ball bounces.
