L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Carolyn, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  And my name is Daryl.  I'm in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yes.
L:  That is where my company's headquarters-- well, used to be.
R:  What is-- what company is that?
L:  Pharmacy S. 
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. 
L:  Yeah, Upjohn. 
R:  Pretty big place around here.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Pretty big place around here.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, the-- what is the topic again?
L:  [LAUGH]  The topic is bioterrorism. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And what can we do to prevent it?  [LAUGH]
R:  What can we do to -- 
L:  Yeah, so now that we have this lofty task.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just don't do it. 
L:  Right, that's a good prevention measure.
R:  I'm-- I'm not exactly sure because, you know, as far as, you know, with all the things that, like, for example, that happened on nine eleven. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I'm assuming that preventative measures were in place for, you know, something like that to take place. 
L:  Right. 
R:  To guard against, you know, something like that to take place, so I don't know.  I really don't know enough about it to--
L:  Yeah, there's just so many ways that it could be prevented from so many different angles. 
R:  Right, yeah -- 
L:  And [LAUGH] 
R:  Because there's so many different angles you can, you know, approach, you know, the situation. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I mean, I would imagine the first -- first thing I guess that I would-- that comes to mind is water supply. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And I remember-- I remember seeing some things on the news about the food supply also. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, as far as-- as far as whole-- how things are chemically treated, you know, in the, you know, the farms, farm land and things like that. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, you know, I would imagine to-- you know, I guess maybe to get a centralized place, okay, this company-- what is the name of this company?  I'll think of it in a minute, Cargill.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Cargill, have you ever heard of that company?
L:  Um, it sounds familiar. 
R:  I think Cargill is a company that specializes in growing, you know, food and things like that.  
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And I think that's what they do, they specialize in growing food.  They specialize in trying to feed, you know, feed people and I would imagine they would probably have something to do-- something to do with treating, you know, the type of chemicals they needed to preserve food, you know, you know, whatever they do, you know, whatever it does to help.
L:  There's so many situations when you can't control it because first of all you can't grow things on a very-- well, the way that we've always approached agriculture in this country. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, for the past however long we've been here. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Is to grow everything in an open field and --
R:  Right.
L:  There's very few situations where food could be mass produced. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  In enclosures or with some sort of protection from, like, airborne agents or --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- agents in the ground and --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I don't know.  There's so many different angles.  There's really not one person who's ever going to have the answer, and all we can do is just prepare as best we can. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know. 
R:  All right.  You know, as the general public, I don't know, you know, what it is that we can do. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, there's no way to test, there's no way to, you know --
L:  Yeah, it's kind of like, well, once it happens, then you find out. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Yeah, but also like the water supply. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Here we get our water from rivers, from the Chattahoochee River in particular and-- but in other parts of the country --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Like, I'm from California originally and we got all of our water from aquifers that were under the ground and -- 
R:  From where? 
L:  From aquifers, it's like underground lakes that-- like when the snow melts and it goes underground. 
R:  Oh, okay, okay. 
L:  Yeah.  It's just called an aquifer and-- so there's different ways that we get water in this country and I'm not so sure that we could ever be one hundred per cent sure about it not being touched-- 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- by any sort of bio agent, you know. 
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Like I said, I wouldn't even-- I wouldn't even know where to begin. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I don't know how-- what's the word I'm looking for?  I'm not -- I don't know how-- at this point how-- I don't know what the level of desire would be.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  From any terrorist group ifah[?]- ifum[?]- to try something different now. 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  You have to wonder, like especially-- they have to get this stuff from somewhere first of all, so maybe that's a way that it could be prevented by restricting the access. 
R:  Yeah, and -- 
L:  You know. 
R:  And -- and -- and I guess shortly after nine eleven with all the arrests they were making as far as the people in al Qaeda and things like that, you know, at least they were reporting on putting a stranglehold on, you know, their -- you know, passing of information and, um, and, ah, you know, things like that and-- and I think that-- I think that, um, um, you know, the belief was that, um, certain things wouldn't, you know, take place or --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Or couldn't take-- I shouldn't say they wouldn't take place. 
L:  Yeah, no one would dare to do it. 
R:  But, you know, something on that level again. 
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm not exactly sure about that.  I think that, you know, obviously, you know, if you have, like a-- I don the best way I know how to put it is a kamikaze attitude. 
L:  Yeah, exactly. 
R:  You know, you know, you're going to-- in your own country you're going to be a hero, you're going to, you know, die a martyr and, you know, and --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I guess that brings honor and everything on your family and, you know, whoever remains-- all kinds of things I really don't understand but -- but, you know, just like in our culture, you know, you, um, um, you know, the younger generation, I mean, I don't know how young you are. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm twenty four, so --
R:  Okay, really? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Well, maybe even younger than that then. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I have a-- I have a son about your age. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and [LAUGH] my wife's laughing at me. 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] We both have kids about your age. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  But the younger generation in thinking that, you know, they are so heavily influenced by, you know, what they see, what's going on and things like that, so they try to emulate and I was suspected in that-- in that respect that it's no different in some of these Middle East countries that harbour the, you know, large pockets of the terrorist groups. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That they see that, you know, what happened on nine eleven and they grow up, they want to be like that. 
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, and so I really-- the guy-- what is the guy's name who has been appointed with the new position of homeland security? 
L:  Tom Ridge. 
R:  Tom, I knew -- Tom what? 
L:  Ridge. 
R:  Oh, Tom, yeah, that's it, Tom Ridge, the guy from Pennsylvania. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I don't want his job. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no. 
R:  No, I don't want his job. 
L:  And what President Bush is going through right now. 
R:  Mhm, no.
L:  Why would you ever-- 
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- want to have a job like that?  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I think they have to do president by committee next or something like that. 
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  Because if I was running for president, I think I'd-- [MN] I think I'd drop out. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Out of the race because that's--
L:  It's crazy.  There's so much responsibility 'cause you have to figure out everything no matter what it is. 
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Like bioterrorism like--
R:  Yeah. 
L:  We just were asked to ... [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I mean, you have to wonder, you know, when he talks with Colin Powell and what's her name, Rice? 
L:  Condoleeza Rice. 
R:  Condal yeah, and then what's the Attorney General, what's the--
L:  John Ashcroft. 
R:  Yeah, I can't think of none of these guys' names. 
L:  [LAUGH] Because you're on the spot right now. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But anyway, when they go into their, you know, like, sessions or war room or whatever, I can't even imagine what their conversation.   
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, and then they talk with the guy who's-- what is it, Tommy Franks, you know, who's head of the -- you know, right now, who's head of, you know, everything that's-- the build up in the Middle East. 
L:  Yeah, the military, mhm. 
R:  I can't even imagine their conversations. 
L:  Yeah.
