R:  Hello, my name's Liz.
L:  Yes, and my name is Jill.  Did you say Liz?
R:  Yes, Liz, L.I.Z.
L:  Hi, Liz.  
R:  Hi, how are you, Jo?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.
L:  Is this your first time?
R:  It is.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Well good. [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.
R:  I guess we have to keep on the topic then, don't we?
L:  Yes, bioterrorism.
R:  Yes.
L:  A tough subject -- 
R:  Well, what do you think? 
L:  -- with no easy answers.
R:  There's no easy answers and I don't believe that there's any quick answers either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Look how long we've been battling it here in the United States as it is.
L:  That's right.
R:  You are from the US?
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  Are you in the United States?
L:  Oh, yes --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yes, in Florida.
R:  Oh, I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  I hear it's warmer down there than it is up here.
L:  Oh, it definitely, it's nice.
R:  I think that if they are going to attack -- if the people are going to have some sort of bioterrorism attack on some place in the United States, don't you feel uncomfortable living in Florida being that's such a tourist state? 
L:  Well -- 
R:  Does that concern you?
L:  -- to tell you the truth, I hadn't thought about it in that light.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  Although we do have a large military base and air force base which is central command.
R:  Aha.
L:  So that certainly could be a target although other states have them too. 
R:  That's true.
L:  And I think just the idea of it or what they can do or what the experience with anthrax did certainly shows you how easily things could be shut down.
R:  That didn't take much.  That was --
L:  That's right. 
R:  [inaudible] found in two locations and look, the whole entire US mail system got shut down.
L:  I can't say I have a quick answer.  I do think that continuing on the path that this country is following right now, to me increases people's sense that we're arrogant and only know the use of force.
R:  Right.
L:  Even though they can't admit that very low tech things could bring us down, and I think it's very hard for any powerful government to admit that but we're in pretty much a different world the way I look at it.
R:  Right.
L:  And other than trying to find a way to deal with the discontents of people or the anger or hatred of people, I don't know of any method.  I don't think giving us all gas masks or putting plastic and duct tape all around our house -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- is really practical or feasible. [LAUGH] What about you?
R:  I don't think it's very comfortable either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Well, I think it might have been Peter Jennings or Dan Rather on one of the nightly newscasts one night who said apparently there was a bomb in one of the subways over in one of the other countries and he said that it doesn't really seem like it's going to take a big event that can take -- make things crumble, it will just take many small events.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because one guy one bomb can take out one hundred and twenty people.
L:  Well, that's true, we've had the domestic incidents to prove that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But also it's what you do that destroys a lot of what our country is founded on.  In the effort to tighten up I think it deprives us of a lot of the things that make this country what it is or what it was. 
R:  Our constitutional rights or freedom.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, here we are, we're basing all of our livelihood on freedom because we have, you know, it's the Fifth Amendment that we of all these freedoms and rights but here when it comes down to somebody wanting to take those away, we all are pretty frightened.
L:  Do you think that the use of force such as missile defence systems and massing all these troops on the border regardless of what happens there, do you think that will reduce the possibility of terrorism or bioterrorism? 
R:  The only thing that that's going to really work on I believe would be the prospect for nuclear war or a big full scale war, but you've still got the little chemist in the backyard who can come up with something that is bio terror. 
L:  Well, nuclear war is the principle of mutual annihilation.
R:  Right.
L:  Which most sensible people would back away from but if you've got people willing to kill themselves even on small scale terrorism -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- then I don't think they're concerned about nuclear deterrents.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, because these are people who are willing to take their life.
L:  That's right, that's right, that's why -- 
R:  Also, kamikazes. 
L:  Yeah, it's political really.  The article I've been reading says that this so called system now, if you call it that, is really not based on force that will do any good but only on the politics of what's in back of this and until we learn how to deal with that, and I don't mean appeasement -- 
R:  Right.
L:  But ah as long as you say people are willing to blow themselves up on a small or large scale, what good are billion dollar star wars defence systems?
R:  Right.
L:  It's not a missile flying over the ocean we need to worry about.
R:  Right.
L:  It's the guy in the backyard or maybe -- maybe a woman, but probably a guy in the backyard.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's a little prejudiced but -- 
R:  A woman's cooking dinner, the man is taking care of the biological problems. 
L:  [LAUGH] She's taking care of the baby, right.
R:  All he has to do is go to the bathroom and we have biological warfare.
L:  Oh, absolutely, that's true.
R:  In our house.
L:  I think anybody who pretends they have an easy or facile answer for this but I still believe in the sense that it is political until we deal with the issues and it's not because they're poor, deprived.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  Certainly, they're easier fodder for somebody to brainwash.
R:  Right.  But all classes of life are affected.  
L:  That's right.
R:  Whether it's the little mum and pop store down the road or whether it's the big Donald Trumps of the world.
L:  Or even the middle class stock market investors like me.
R:  Exactly, yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's true.  That's why I believe the only way to look for any possible way of diffusing this -- that's a funny word to use.
R:  Right.
L:  Is through a political or human or social context.
R:  Right.
L:  To me that's about the only help you have and you're going to stand there with a big gun blustering our way through it. [LAUGH] I'm sorry, I don't think it's going to work.
R:  And you'd have to have all the parties willing to have that human component.
L:  Right, and there has got to be something that can so to speak get them to the table.
R:  Right.
L:  So what that is I have no idea. [LAUGH] I think most people don't think the method we are pursuing is -- it's like a pseudo solution, like, "oh we'll brandish a big muscle and frighten them", no, I don't think so.
R:  It worked for us in the past but we're technolo- 
L:  That's right.
R:  Technologically more advanced now in the world than we were back then.
L:  That's right and I think it must be very frustrating for those who believe in guns to think that butter might help. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think they're so used to the idea of us being so powerful.
R:  Right.
L:  And it must be extremely frustrating and they're in denial that there isn't a solution based upon armament.
R:  Right.
L:  But I doubt it.  This is a perfect topic. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.[LAUGH] 
L:  I wonder if the computer picked it or do they just randomly do that?
R:  It's a very hot topic.
L:  Oh yeah, as long as you're -- have one eye open, it's bound to be. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, and you kind of have to listen.  I mean, you need to pay attention to the worldly newses to find out, you know, where we are at with -- where is North Korea with their building of their nuclear -- they've got their power plant up and running.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, where do we stand with chemists that are missing or people who may be, you know, things that are happening in the movies are real life today? 
L:  Well, you know, and also, although it may be true these aren't nice people, calling them the axis of evil is like calling a small child difficult names and the child is going to live up to the difficult names -- [LAUGH]  
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that you call them.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  That's a little simplistic but I still think there's some truth to it.
R:  Yeah, plus some of them probably enjoy that name.  They want the recognition.  They want the attention.  
L:  That's right [inaudible].
R:  They want to go down feeling like they're a martyr.
L:  Right, and if you can't get it in a positive way, you'll get it in the most negative way possible.  You'll -- 
R:  And cultural.
L:  You'll get attention.  We can't ignore you.
R:  That's right, "I am here, I will have a temper tantrum whether you like it or not".
L:  That's exactly right, so what do we do with children like that?  You're not supposed to reward negativity.  We'll have to go back to the kindergarten [LAUGH] and figure out how to do this.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Some of our kindergarteners aren't doing so good these days either. 
L:  Yeah, that's, true.  Well, I think the atmosphere -- 
R:  Right.
L:  And I could call it F.E.A.R. atmosphere.
R:  Fear, exactly.
L:  I do think, even if they don't really understand, I think some of that gets through to children.
R:  I do too.
L:  I have grandchildren and I think it's very sad.  Maybe it was never truly an innocent world, only the illusion of it but I tell you what, I'd settle for that illusion just so they could grow up.  I do think it's responsible for a lot of bad behaviour on the part of young people. 
R:  Right.
L:  Because they're trying to escape from that underlying fear even if it's not acknowledged in almost any way they can, usually something that's kind of semi destructive in its own way.
R:  Now, are you guys -- anyone down there getting actual -- starting to get the +smallpox smallpox vaccinations?
L:  I don't know.  I've heard that some of the health care workers, not too many, across the country out of the projected ones, so I don't know specifically if some of the so called first responders or health care people here have taken it.  I really haven't focussed on that.
R:  They've act they've actually started it up here up.  We're just in the northern Ohio region --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- right over the border -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so Toledo, Ohio has actually started getting their smallpox -- smallpox vaccinations.
L:  Well, then it may be all right unless they come up with some other lethal germ that isn't covered by that vaccine.
R:  Right.  Anthrax.  
L:  Yes.  
R:  That's like a baby powder fine formula that -- I don't know -- I guess it's not that hard to create. 
L:  Ooh, evident
R:  Although I would have no clue how to do that.
L:  It's a naturally occurring substance.
R:  I would have no clue how to make that stuff but -- 
L:  They can, as they say weaponize it or whatever the latest terminology, we're all getting very expert in vocabulary. 
R:  Yes.
L:  For what to call everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it is.  
R:  Politically correct wording.  
L:  It's not a fun time.
