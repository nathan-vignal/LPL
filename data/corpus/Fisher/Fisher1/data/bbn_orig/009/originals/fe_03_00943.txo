R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi. [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] How are you today?
R:  Fine.
L:  Good.  Ah, my name's Ann.
R:  You're Ann, I'm Heather.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you, Heather.
R:  You too.
L:  Um, well, so, do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Um, my favorite holiday is probably Christmas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know it sounds kind of [LAUGH] cheesy but -- [LAUGH]
L:  No, that would be mine too. [LAUGH]
R:  I just thi- -- it seems like that seems to be a more important holiday for everybody so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everybody seems to make an effort to get together so ...
L:  Yeah, that would be true.
R:  There's always a lot of family around.  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's, ah -- for us it's just -- we're -- my family's Christian and so, you know, it's -- it's definitely --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a celebration of -- of, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of the basis of what we believe.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a really big deal for -- for our family as well, so, um, you know, just from -- from that perspective.  But ...
R:  Right.  Do you guys spend, like, Christmas Eve at church for a church service or anything, like?
L:  Well, this year we didn't because we're in a new church and they didn't -- they didn't have a service at our church.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, ah, we have a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the past.  How about you?
R:  Um, no.  We used to when I was, um, when I was in the military I was very into, um, my church and they used to have a -- a Christmas Eve service and all the kids would come in their pajamas to sing.
L:  Uh huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  So you were in the military?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  Well, that's, um -- we had, ah, one church that we were involved in one time had the pajama service for -- with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all the kids and everything.  That was so much fun.  We really enjoyed that.  But, [LIPSMACK] um ...  Yeah, we usually -- we enjoyed, um, the candle light services at church that some churches have and that but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's usually been our favorites.  But, yeah, so ...  Um, I -- I think the other question was if -- if there would be a holiday that we could invent. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Do you have any idea on that one?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  That sounds too much like an essay question.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] I'm n- --
R:  [LAUGH] If I could invent a holiday.  I don't know.  I mean, probably, I don't know that I would invent one.  I know the -- the Kwanza holiday --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- kinda has a lot of things, you know, that if I had to invent a holiday would be things, you know, more of a teaching thing and to --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- kind of instill mor- -- you know, and reinforce morals and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and good characteristics and qualities in people.
L:  Right.  That's a -- that's a neat idea.
R:  So that one does a lot with, you know, sharing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] honoring people and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and respect and loyalty and things.
L:  Right.  I- I'm like you, I don't know if I would invent one.  I'm, um, course I'm not the most creative type of person, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I usually take what's given to me and -- and use it to the best of [LAUGH] best of my abilities.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  But, uh, but yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's -- I -- I think, um, I think one of the reasons I enjoy Christmas is 'cause our -- in our family it was -- it always promoted the same types of things that you were talking about with Kwanza.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, you know, it's, um, the idea of sharing and giving --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we always had more fun, uh, discussing those ideas a- and, um, learning about those things and learning about the spirit of giving and about, um, considering others and, ah, know what Christ did for us when He came to earth and -- and how that was the -- the greatest gift and the greatest consideration.  So, I think, probably for the same reasons that -- that you would create, um, the holiday you were thinking of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be the reasons that I enjoy Christmas so much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  But, ah ...
R:  What about -- do you have any d- any specific traditions that you guys celebrate at Christmas?  Things that might be different from the -- the normal typical family?
L:  [SIGH] You know, I don't know if we do or not.  Um, it was always just family gatherings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, reading the Christmas story,  um, really pretty basic traditions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What about you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, no, I don't think that we're any different than anybody else.  We kind of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know when I was growing up we had, um, you know, extended family that we celebrated with and we had a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, a neighbor whose grandson, um, lived with them.  Her daughter and grandson had moved back in with them after her -- after their marriage kinda went.
L:  Uh-huh, mhm.
R:  And um, but the -- the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- son, for some reason, always spent Christmas Day with his father.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So they used -- we used to go down and share with them for Christmas --
L:  Oh, that's neat, yeah.
R:  -- Eve 'cause they opened their gifts.  So then we started the tradition of coming home and opening all of our gifts on Christmas Eve.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it was kinda right when my sister and I were right at the age, we were still really into the gifts.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We would wake up early. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  So my parents kinda got out of the waking up early --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- by letting us opening the gifts --
L:  Hey that worked. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- on Christmas Eve.  But it always extended into Christmas Day anyway, you know, it was technically, you know, after midnight, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  But w- we always did -- ah, my father grew up opening gifts on Christmas Eve.  Santa Claus would come during, um, the Christmas meal on Christmas Eve was --
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- was their tradition and so they would finish eating and then they'd get up and all go gather round the tree.  Well, my mother grew up that, you know, uh, as a child, Santa Claus would come for her  Christmas Eve night while they were all asleep and so --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- ah, when they got married they just kind of combined both traditions.  So we would open, um, family gifts on Christmas Eve --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then -- or we would pick one gift on Christmas Eve and then Christmas morning --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- we would open the rest.  So ...
R:  Right, right.  And that's -- I think that's what we did traditionally up until then --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- up until the time that we, you know, started doing this as a family, is we got one on Christmas Eve. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.  [LAUGH] That's -- I tell you this year I had, um -- I have one daughter and she's just to the age right now where she was starting to really, um, enjoy Christmas and really get into gifts and so this year, it was -- it was very tempting to just let her dig into all of them [LAUGH] Christmas Eve but --
R:  [NOISE] I bet. 
L:  But we didn't, we waited till Christmas morning.  But, ah [MN] ...
R:  How old is she? 
L:  She -- she will be two in May.
R:  Oh okay, so yeah, that'll -- that's a good age. 
L:  Mhm.  You said you had kids?
R:  Yeah, I have one son.  
L:  One son.  How old is he?
R:  He's just a year old.
L:  Oh, how precious.
R:  Yeah, so Christmas was fun this year but he didn't really know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- why he was getting, you know, it's like "What is all this?" [LAUGH] 
L:  That's [LAUGH] right.  That's the way my daughter was last year.
R:  [MN] 
L:  She just wasn't quite sure. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But this year she was a little overwhelmed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with everything.  I mean, she was just surrounded by wrapping paper and toys and she had to get it all cleaned up and tidied before she could really enjoy it, but --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But it was neat to watch her.  She's -- she had fun.
R:  [NOISE] That's good.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] was that your son?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, how precious.
R:  Yep -- he's e- trying to get into all the cookies here. 
L:  [LAUGH] Sounds like my daughter.
R:  Mhm.  And now I see cookie hand prints all over the furniture.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.  [LAUGH] Oh. 
R:  [NOISE] But we were thinking this year about what different things -- what things are we gonna -- you know, traditions, are we gonna create for -- 
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  -- for our family now?
L:  Did you -- have you decided on anything yet or ...?
R:  No, not yet.  It's kind of -- it's kind of silly, you know, we -- we have so ma- so many other family obligations already.
L:  Right.
R:  It's kinda like, "Well, we have to go here with my parents and then we have to do this with your parents" so ...
L:  Right.
R:  We didn't get anything original in this year. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] Well, that's one thing that we established, um, over the past year was, we live quite a ways away from both sets of my parents.  I -- I mean, both sets of our parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my in laws live about eight hours away and my -- um, my parents actually are missionaries and live half way round the world --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so we don't get together with them much, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and so for u- -- for the actual Christmas celebrations, we decided that we were just going to always stay home Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and then try to visit if -- if it was possible, try to visit before and after Christmas.  You know, make sure we visited Thanksgiving or -- or do a New Year's visit or something like that.  So, that's -- that's one thing we established, you know, we just told our families, "You live too far away, just [LAUGH] sorry, but we'll try to do it another time". [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  And that's one thing my mother said.  And she's always so opinionated, it's funny --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the things that she says.  Well, we will not do that [inaudible].
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  But she says, [LIPSMACK] you know, "This Christmas it's okay if you go somewh- -- you know, go visiting for Christmas but from now on, Christmas has -- he has to wake up in his own bed on Christmas". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, Mom.  [LAUGH] So she's like, "You don't ever have to come to my house.  Don't think it's an obligation".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You can tell she's kinda like, "And don't you go to the in laws either". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "If you're not gonna come here don't go anywhere else". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Oh, goodness.  [LAUGH] 
R:  " 'Cause every kid should wake up in his own bed on Christmas morning".
L:  [LAUGH] That sounds like something my grandmother in law would say.  She's very opinionated too and she- she'd tell you the way it is. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, goodness.  [LAUGH] 
R:  This is how it should be. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] Oh well, Christmas is -- Christmas is quite a fun time to be at home, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, we did -- when I was growing up, um, well, I grew up overseas but whenever we were in the States we would always do Christmas Eve at -- at, ah, one set of grandparents and Christmas Day at the other set.  And we were always going, going, going.  And --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I didn't like it.  I remember even as a child I didn't like it.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  But ... so I think that's one of the things that has really made me agree to wanting to just stay home, those two things. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But -- and also the opportunity, you know, if -- if our local church does have anything, you know, the opportunity to be able to be there for it and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, yeah, I- I've always been a homebody, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Prefer being at home.  So.
R:  That's ni- -- it's nice, too, to be able to, especially when people work and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- every -- everybody's busy during the year.  It's nice to -- at Christmas time most people are -- you know, most companies and everything give you the time off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's nice to just sit and -- and be with your family.
L:  It is.
R:  Than anywhere else to be.
L:  It is.
R:  It's a good idea.
L:  Mm.  Ah, you know, we en- we enjoy our extended families very, very much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah
