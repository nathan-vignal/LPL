L:  [NOISE] Hello, my name is Danny.
R:  Danny, this is Debra.  Um, so I guess they want to know if we think that it -- it -- it helps tighten, ah, the possibilities of terrorists?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, I'm sure it -- it does a little something but I don't think it -- you know, they're not -- they're not gonna, you know, they're gonna be smarter than that now.  They d- you know, they're gonna be circuitous in their methods, you know.  They're not just gonna walk in with a knife through the metal detector, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  They already know we're looking for that so ...  I mean, I'm sure it -- it deters somewhat but, you know, it'd only deter, like, the lower level terrorism, not any big high elaborate plans --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't think.
R:  I don't think so either.  I think that they need to do more with the luggage and the way they can  -- they load the planes, more so than [MN] checking people out at the, um, at the, um, security.  You know, when you walk through the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- detectors.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm sure that it helps somewhat.  Um, it doesn't help our air travel any, it slows things down in the process, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, I'm sure that it has helped to a point.  But I think that most of their problems come from the luggage being on there and -- and matching the luggage to the tickets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If that person's not on there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, where they load their -- their, ah, luggage.  And I don't think that they inspect all the luggage now, do they?
L:  Ah, well, I'm not sure.
R:  I'm sure --
L:  I'm sure they -- they run it through some, like, random screening process, but I don't think it's that -- that hard core.
R:  Right, right.  And um -- have you traveled much [MN] since all of nine eleven?
L:  Oh yeah, I -- I just flew, ah, couple of days ago, actually.
R:  And --
L:  And --
R:  -- how did you --
L:  I mean, it wasn't -- it wasn't too bad, ah, you know.  I had to take my shoes off, you know --
R:  Really?
L:  But, yeah, it's kinda ri- the thing I think's ridiculous is, like, okay, like you're about to go through and I know my belt's gonna set it off so I'm like taking off my belt to put it in my bag, you know.  And they're rushing you like, "No, go through now".  You think, "Well, it's gonna set it off right now" and then you set the metal detector off once and you automatically get sent over to the, you know, the body search.  Then, you know, they -- you -- go -- go through your pockets and then, you know, take off your shoes and, you know, like the little -- little metal rings that like, your shoe laces go through?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's sets off the little wand so they take your shoes and put 'em through the metal detector, so you know, send 'em through the x-ray machine.  And so it's just like a -- it's a huge ordeal and -- I didn't -- I didn't miss my flight, I was already late for it anyway but I didn't miss it still, so it was all right.
R:  Well, I guess if you're getting on the -- did you feel more secure getting on the plane?
L:  Ah, no.
R:  Oh.  [MN] I flew right after nine eleven and I didn't really feel much more secure.  But, you know.
L:  But, I mean, I never really -- um, I -- I didn't feel any more, you know -- I -- I didn't think it was any more of a risk flying after nine eleven than it was before, you know, it's just everyone else seemed to be freaking out a lot more --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- than before.
R:  Well, it's --
L:  So ...  I mean, I don- I don't think anybody really cares about my domestic flight from, you know, Dallas to Atlanta, you know.  So ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.  Well, I -- I guess they probably didn't think much about a domestic flight from, um, what was it?  New York to -- to where were they going?  Chicago or Pennsylvania when they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's -- I just don't feel like it's -- it's as secure as, you know -- it's -- it's costing the airlines a lot and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel like it's -- it's -- it's harmed, um, more so than it's actually doing good.  I think there's other areas that they could be concentrating and putting their money towards.
L:  Oh yeah, there's --
R:  And more for the baggage and the -- you know, 'cause you're pretty much so going to set off that -- that trigger anyway, you know.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And maybe checking the shoes is because that -- that guy had, what?  He had a knife or something in his shoe --
L:  Yeah, something like that.
R:  You know, that they caught.  And so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's -- but, ah, I think that they've -- they've gone quite far with the body searches and the different things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that they're doing.  I don't know that much about the subject to be honest with you.  I don't, um -- what did you think, Jo?  [LAUGH] Did they search you?  [NOISE] Yeah.  You see, my sister, it happened the same thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Take your shoes off.  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  [NOISE] Yeah, she said she got patted down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was a white woman, ah, you know, it was a lady, you know.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I didn't -- [MN]
R:  Did they pat you down?  Did they pat you down like -- like? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  No, he -- well, he felt all my pockets and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I had a lighter in one of my pockets --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that s- that set off the metal detector also and I was like "Whoa".  I mean, yeah, they, you know.
R:  They might be abl- --
L:  "Okay, sorry about that".
R:  I would almost think that they would come u- be able to produce some sort of a, well, I suppose x-ray on our bodies is bad, you know --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- 'cause you can- --
L:  --Yeah, I don't think that'd be good.
R:  --you can't do an x-ray machine on a pregnant woman or -- and too much x-ray in with, [NOISE] you know. 
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  But 'cause they only do --
L:  I don't think x-rays are --
R:  -- a random search on the luggage.  They can't possibly search all of the luggage but they need to come up with all these x-rays.  I think every piece of luggage needs to be x-rayed and -- [NOISE] In all of 'em now?  In all the airports?  [NOISE] Oh, good.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well.  I -- I -- I don't think -- you know, I -- I suppose it -- it h- it has helped to a point. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I mean, at least they're doing something but, I mean, it's probably not the -- the best thing they could do.
R:  [MN] I think, yeah, the workers, they need to have heightened, um, regulations for hiring the workers.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  They need to do more checks with the people that are working there.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely for that.  And at least have, like, some kind of, I don't know, a hired -- like, you know, people that are trained a little bit better to do the searching.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, I mean, flying out of certain airports, you know, you'll run into people that, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't really --
R:  Well, most of the --
L:  --they shouldn't really be doing that.
R:  -- baggage checkers and the -- the security were minimum wage people.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's --
R:  You know, they need to be trained security people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They need to have heightened [MN] security for the -- the workers, you know, not just like anybody out there on that field to have access to those planes.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you know, if the -- if the -- if the airline people, you know, the baggage handlers, can steal things out of your bags --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then a baggage handler can put something in those bags.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And so -- and I d- I'm not aware of, you know, how much they have heightened that, you know.  Um, but that to me would be more plausible than, um, you know, patting all the -- the [MN] people down.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Well -- and I think the random searches like, right bef- like, to go actually onto the plane, like right in the terminal --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think that's -- that's a little better idea than, you know, checking peoples' shoes at the, you know, at the very front.  'Cause, I mean, once you're in, once you pass, like, you know, the big metal detectors and all the x-ray machines and all that then, you know, you're just kind of free to do whatev- whatever you want.  You know, you can go in the bathroom and, you know, some- someone that works at the Wendy's on the inside could, you know, inch, ah, whatever, you know, in the stall and then there you go, you're on the plane and you got, you know, whatever he just gave you.
R:  That's true, you're right.
L:  So, I mean, you know, the check right before you get on the plane, that's -- that's kinda -- 'cause, I mean, once you're in the air- -- like, before, you know, once you're in the airport, once you're like actually in the terminals you're, you know, you're in there and they didn't check you for anything.  So you could, you know, fly to some other airport and do whatever the hell you wanted to do and, you know, get on another plane, go somewhere else and do whatever you wanted to do.
R:  I also feel like they need --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to match the, you know, like, if your bags are on there?  They need to match -- if those bags go on there they better make sure that every -- every person that put those bags on there is -- matches -- you know, that there's gotta be somebody -- in other words, if Mr. Smith puts a bag on then decides not to take the flight his bags --
L:  Right.
R:  -- shouldn't go on there.
L:  Right, if he doesn't get on the plane then his bags shouldn't.
R:  Right.  And they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, are they just checking the bags?  Are they just checking -- I mean, they don't actually check every single bag that is loaded on that plane.  They're only random checking your carry ons if they think that there's a problem.
L:  Ah, I -- that's -- I think that's what the -- the situation is.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  So, I don't know.  I mean, at least they're -- they're trying something but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's probably not the -- the best they could do.  [NOISE] 
R:  Correct.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I don't know.  The question was, do we feel like it's more secure?
L:  Ah, hm.
R:  I think to a point, but I feel like it could be a lot more secure.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But then I had -- I'm not -- I don't work there.  I don't know all the changes that they've made.
L:  Right.
R:  So I couldn't [NOISE] justifiably say that they haven't made enough changes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've only flown a couple of times since then and I didn't have any problems [NOISE] but, um, [NOISE] you know, I've heard some -- you know, I didn't fly out of -- I -- I flew from Nashville to Florida a couple of times and I didn't fly in in any [NOISE] major airports.  I didn't go through Atlanta nor --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Dallas or Chicago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I d- I didn't entail any of those problems.  And of course right after nine eleven there wasn't very many people [NOISE] flying so there wasn't too many lines.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I f- I flew --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the weekend after nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] 
L:  But I was -- I was flying home from -- from school
