L:  My name is Geoff.
R:  Hi, Geoff.  My name is Ralph.
L:  Hi, Ralph.
R:  [MN]
L:  How are you? 
R:  Good, how are you doing? 
L:  I'm all right.  Well, would you panic?  [PAUSE] 
R:  I don't think there's a whole lot to do about it, so -- 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I don't think there is either.  [PAUSE] 
R:  You know, I -- [MN] you're I guess from the south, aren't you? 
L:  Ah, yes, I am, from Atlanta.  How about you? 
R:  I'm in Tampa.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  So, ah --
L:  I -- I love Tampa.
R:  Yeah, we have, ah, MacDill Air Force Base here, so ... 
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You know, the central command.  So, you know, obviously -- I'm sure that's on the hit list, if there is such a thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm sure it is.  I'm in a financial tower in Atlanta -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that spans one of the ma key artery interstates, and I'm in the building that is over the interstate.  We've already been told by the FBI we're a target.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean we're to the point, you know, they police the parking, that sort of thing.
R:  Yeah, and with -- 
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- with your airport up there being so busy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Um, I mean, yeah, like you said, I don't -- at the point you get it, it's too late to panic and I -- unfortunately you just learn to live with it.  [PAUSE] At least --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I have, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much the same way with myself.  I just, ah -- [PAUSE] you know, at -- at a point it gets almost redundant.  You know, they're looking for something to -- to report on there.  [LAUGH] You know, it seems like sometimes the news media is a little disappointed something hasn't happened.
L:  You know, that's a good point.  I was just watching the news over lunch and there's no news out there yet.  There's nothing going on, um, plus they're so fixated on the Iraq problem, which they need to be, but there're a lot of other issues out there.  I mean, let's face it, the Iranians have the capability to make a bomb now.  [MN] India and Pakistan are still damn near a hot war, you know.
R:  And there's always the wild card in North Korea.
L:  Well, that's true.  I was an exchange student in South Korea, um. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, my guess is he's insane, but we could probably buy him off for a short period of time.  [PAUSE] So ... 
R:  Well, that's -- that's becoming a little concern of mine too, is that, ah, it -- it appears that we -- we're attempting to fight wars with a cheque book now.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's true, but it's also something we've always done.  [NOISE]
R:  Maybe it just wasn't so blatant.  You know -- 
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- it's like -- like [MN] -- it's like bidding with -- with Turkey to have bases there, you know.  [LAUGH] "We'll -- we'll give you this much money if we, ah -- we can have a base" and they'll come back and say, "No, we want more". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and, you know, the big problem to me there is Turkey is a NATO ally.  We shouldn't be having to bid at all.  I mean, they are a member of NATO.
R:  So -- so is Germany.
L:  Yeah, this is true.  Um, and needless to say, the Germans -- well, it amused me the comment I heard the other day, the foreign minister of Portugal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hold on -- said that he had, you know, if anything happened, he doubted that the French and the Germans would be there to help him, but he knew that the United States would.  So, you know, it's interesting how [SIGH] some of our allies look at it and some of them don't.  Um, and we need to look at the question of how much business do the French actually do with the Iranian -- or Iraqis.
R:  Yeah, I think it's -- it's really a tremendous amount.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Well, it's -- 
R:  You know, they're --
L:  -- it's also --
R:  -- they're looking at, ah -- you know, they -- they finally realized that the Beaujois[?] weren't running Beaujolais[?], so -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- they're a little concerned.
L:  I [MN] --
R:  They have all their oil contracts, ah, that, you know, could conceivably be nullified by war.  If Saddam's gone, whoever comes in just says, "Okay, all bets are off".  [PAUSE]
L:  Well, and if you're the Russians you have the added issue of the fact that they owe -- the Iraqis owe the Russians about eight billion dollars, and as a consequence it's going -- you know, if they're not a part of the post war government, they're probably not going to get paid.  [PAUSE] So ... 
R:  Yeah, I guess that's the -- you know, [PAUSE] we all want to get paid, but I'm sure we've all had bad debts in the past.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I think that's a relatively common problem, unfortunately, especially in this economy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  You say you're in a financial tower.  Are you in the financial markets or --
L:  I am.  Um, I'm with a boutique financial services firm.  Um, basically what we do is we raise money for companies in the one to twenty five million dollar range, either debt or equity financing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Well, I'm retired, but I was in, ah, mortgage banking, mortgage brokerage for quite a while -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I -- I worked on Wall Street.  [PAUSE] As a --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as a matter of fact, I was working on Wall Street when they were building the World Trade Centre.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  [NOISE] From nineteen ninety nine to about two thousand and two I worked at the World Trade Centre.
R:  Did you?  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, [MN] or in the area or there.  So ...
R:  Yeah, I was in and out of the building more than once, I'll tell you that, [LAUGH] over the years.
L:  Oh, were you?  You know, I lived in the World Trade Centre Marriott for a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] I'm just sitting here -- there but for the grace of God could have been I.  You know, I would have been in the hotel about that time of day, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [PAUSE] it's amazing how our world has changed in the last couple of years.
R:  How is it affecting, ah -- you know, back to the terrorism thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have any of your customers given that any thought or are they just -- 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- as essentially start up companies just trying to --
L:  I --
R:  -- look for a niche? 
L:  Well, start up companies looking for a niche, but where I'm noticing it is the companies when we try and place finance, financing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's where we're having the trouble.  People are, you know, concerned, wanting to stay more liquid, stay in safer investments, that sort of thing.  Where we would have been able to place equity a couple of years ago, now we're placing debt instruments, you know, with a guaranteed dividend.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, one structure we're looking at now is guaranteeing everything with life insurance policies.  So, if you put up your investment, you're getting about seventy to eighty per cent back if the company fails.  So, it has altered our perspective somewhat there.  [PAUSE] So ...
R:  Yeah, everybody's looking -- looking for the new angle.  My, ah -- I -- I could do some finance -- you know, not financial --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- work for them; [LAUGH] they're my broker, Morgan Stanley.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah -- you know, they're -- they've come out with -- I haven't really looked at it, but, ah, you know, a guaranteed two per cent return on your money, [PAUSE] but it also rises with the Dow but never goes below two per cent.
L:  Hey, that's nice, especially in an environment where inflation is only one per cent.
R:  Yeah.  You know, so -- you know, it beats the heck out of the money funds, not [LAUGH] [MN] -- but, you know, two per cent doesn't sound like much, but it's double one per cent.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  I mean, it certainly beats a -- you know, just a cash management account which, you know -- um, a friend of mine, I had to redo her Four Oh One K for her the other day because all she had was a cash management account.  Now, granted she's lost no money, but I at least found her a couple of bond funds where she'd get a little bit more return.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] So ...
R:  Yeah, I've been buying a little bit of, ah, what I -- I think are, you know, reasonably defensive, you know, corporate paper.  You know, some preferreds[?] and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things like that.  But I'm sticking with the, you know -- the General Motors, the Dow Chemical.
L:  The companies that are going to be in business, you know, that's -- I've got a client, the only guy I do any retail work with, I moved him just because I said, "No matter who bombs what, the Ford Motor Company is going to be in business".
R:  Yep.
L:  You know, just no matter what.  You're getting Ford for less than the cash on the books.  [PAUSE] So ... 
R:  Yeah, and there's -- you know, it's a place you can still -- you know, still park some -- [PAUSE] ah, some long term money, you know, and not --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Especially -- some long term with -- with a -- a decent call on it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, you can still grab about five -- five per cent, five and a half per cent.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  How long do we talk on this or just --
R:  I -- I haven't been -- I haven't been timing, but, ah, you obviously have work to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I [MN] -- do you think we've talked long enough or --
R:  [PAUSE] I b I believe we probably have and I think we've stuck pretty much to the topic of --
L:  Okay.
R:  I think we both  we both agree that there's not a whole lot we can do about it, terrorism -- 
L:  No, there really isn't.
R:  -- that is.
L:  I mean, a there really isn't.  If it hits, you're done.  I mean -- and it sounds awful to say it that way, but you can't -- terrorists don't give warning.
R:  Yeah, and, ah, it doesn't -- it's not going to do you any -- any good whether you're in pork bellies or, ah, Jenny Maes, you're going to be just as dead.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and [MN] -- panic isn't [MN] -- unfortunately you're probably not going to be in a position to have enough time to panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- well, it was good talking to you.
R:  Good talking to you.
L:  Okay.  Bye bye.
R:  Take care, bye.
