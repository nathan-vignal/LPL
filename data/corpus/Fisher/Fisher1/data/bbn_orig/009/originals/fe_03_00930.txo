L:  Hi, I'm Linda.
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy.
L:  Hi, Nancy.  Interesting topic since the President's talking about it right now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I just got a call from my father actually, to watch it but I didn't have the TV on.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yep, he's talking about it right now.
R:  Really?
L:  And I kinda think I agree with him.  I hate disarming him in every way but war is the best.  I mean, that's the least we want to do but ...
R:  [SIGH] I know.  I -- I -- we have a couple of friends over there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- right now that have been stationed and it's really scary.  I think he should be disarmed, but the whole war thing and the -- the chemical warfare really kinda scares me.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, well, it scares everybody and it's -- but, you know, one thing he brought up tonight was this has been going on for twelve years. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've been trying to get Saddam to disarm for twelve years.
R:  I know.
L:  And he just mentioned that that fourteen fourteen, whatever that resolution that he signed, actually signed something that said he had none.
R:  Hm.
L:  And then he came out and said, "Oh, but, oh yeah, well, here's some and here's this and ..."
R:  Yeah and supposedly they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- destroyed a couple, didn't they?
L:   Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So he started out by having none to, "Oh, by the way, here's ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and then they have the ones that could fly further than they were supposed to.
L:  Right, right.  [NOISE]
R:  So, at the -- weren't those the ones that they destroyed?
L:  I -- I think so.  You know, I don't stay up top of it that closely.
R:  I know, I don't either.  I feel bad but it --
L:  I kn- -- I know.  What a great subject, huh?
R:  I know.  If I watch too much of it though it -- it just scares me.  And I think about --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the people over there and just, oh, it's horrible.
L:  Well, I was commenting too, the President is, ah, looking older.
R:  He is.
L:  Isn't it amazing how that job, ah, um, ages them?
R:  I know, I mean, even right now, I just turned it on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He looks older than he did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when he first came into office.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just nuts.
L:  I know, I just mentioned that to my husband.  He says, "Oh my gosh, just think of the weight that he has --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- on his shoulders" especially with this whole thing with nine eleven and -- and, I mean, that is so heavy on his mind all the time.
R:  Exactly, I can't imagine the pressure but ...
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I know they're saying now that, I mean, I know all the -- they listed all the countries that were still against the war part but it -- I think it's coming down to, "Okay, what" -- [LAUGH] you know, it's like the spoiled child thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He keeps saying, "Okay, then, you know, give up, you know, give up, give up.  Let's do an inspection, give 'em up, give 'em up" and then twelve years later --
R:  Yeah, he's still doing it.
L:  -- he's still doing it.
R:  I don't understand how he thinks he could ever win.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I don't either.
R:  'Cause, I mean, there's all these nations against him.
L:  I know.
R:  And he's just sitting there by himself with maybe, like, one other one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on his side.
L:  I know.  And -- [NOISE]
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- the President was also talking about mak- -- you know, we do have, ah, food supplies ready to go into the Iraqi people and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know that -- what was it the other day?  He asked -- he even said Saddam should step down.  Wasn't that in the paper or something?
R:  He wanted him to go into exile or something.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's what it was.  Yeah.
R:  That -- that would be -- that would be dangerous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I would think because you don't know where he is.
L:  No, you don't.
R:  You -- what could he be doing?  He's probably building another army if he does that.
L:  Oh my gosh, I know.
R:  And just think if he comes back.  I mean, it's really sad to say but if we could just kill him.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know and it -- w- -- like we -- wh- -- we didn't do that twelve years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or whenever it was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know.  And then they s- -- he said what -- what all the evidence that shows, you know, he tortures his own people and --
R:  I know, I know.  And I wonder --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he probably does.  I just wonder if they exaggerate it a bit as sort of --
L:  I know.
R:  -- like, propaganda to make us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- want to attack him more?
L:  Oh, I know, you wonder don't you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  How much truth is in everything?
R:  Exactly.  I mean --
L:  Oh, everything.  Oh, I just -- I -- I'm like you, I -- I try not to listen it a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like watching the news a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I try not to watch news 'cause it's all bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, because it's constantly negative stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Constantly.  And some of the questions these guys are asking tonight, "Why is it -- or how's it affect the economy?"  Well, we know how nine eleven affected the economy 'cause we're still -- it's -- we're still reeling from it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But war boosts the economy.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But then I guess it goes right the opposite.  So then what do you say?  "Oh, okay, that's -- that's the opposite side" but ...
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  I don't know.
R:  It- it's [SIGH] -- ah, they've kin- -- in a way they've put it off for a long time.
L:  Right.
R:  And now everybody's fighting against it.
L:  Right.
R:  But, ah, he's not going to get the UN votes anyway.
L:  Well, you know, that's another thing one of the -- one of the, ah, news people brought up and said, um, "If you have this, this, this country and all this against you in the -- in the Security Council".  He said, "Yeah, but when we voted on the resolution the last time --  [NOISE] I'm on the phone get off now.  [NOISE] Um, when the -- the, um, UN resolution that they voted before and they -- they had a lot of discussion before and they were saying, "Oh, no, I don't know if we agree" when they finally came down to final vote it was fifteen to zero in agreement.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So his point was, okay, when the time came and push came to shove, they all were in agreement.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he said, "Yes, th- the last thing we're looking at is war" but, you know, [MN] I think he's banking on the fact, well, you know, when it really comes down it maybe they see the true color -- Saddam's true colors and all that have back to the fifteen to zero.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I thought it was an interesting comment.  I don't know if anybody --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- knew that.
R:  I hadn't heard that.
L:  Nah.
R:  I mean --
L:  I hadn't either.
R:  -- hopefully, because I -- I'd hate to see him do it with -- with nobody on our side --
L:  Right.
R:  -- except, I think, Britain is -- is backing us.
L:  Yeah, except that they even said -- whoa, was it today?  They even said somebody on the, um, not, um, the usual name you hear over there but ah, another high up in the -- in the UK was -- said something about, um, [LIPSMACK] um, not going to war right away either.  It's, like, "What?"
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Now they're even say- --
R:  How are they going to put it off?
L:  Yeah, now they're even saying that.
R:  Yeah.  And it --
L:  So, what's the answer?  You know.
R:  I don't know what they're thinking --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- because even if they did succeed in taking us out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and let's say they killed everybody in the United States --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're going to go after the next biggest power after that.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, who's next?  It's --
L:  And then they'd be weak.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then they'd be weakened.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They wouldn't have anybody, then they [COUGH] -- it's almost like World War Two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We got involved when we weren't going to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it hit us.  Well, that's the same thing that's going to -- it would happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If Saddam started doing something then all of a sudden people were saying, "No, no, no" then all of a s- -- and everybody would jump in 'cause, "Oh, wait a minute, it does involve us".
R:  Yeah, suddenly they're threatened, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Sort of like nine eleven did to us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We finally realized that it can touch us.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause we'd watched it happen to everybody else.
L:  Right.
R:  And then all of a sudden, oh ...
L:  Oh, oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  But I -- you know, I don't know.  What more can -- what c- -- more can the UN Council do as far as getting him to disarm?  I don't under- -- I don't know -- what I -- you know, another thing I don't understand is, how do they know all this is -- when they -- when they come back and say, "Well, we don't really think he's disclosing everything".
R:  Mhm.
L:  When the- -- what -- what are they walking around and are they getting blueprints of places, and are they -- I -- I guess that -- that's one thing I really haven't paid enough attention to.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's just got to be intelligence, it h- has to be --
L:  It must be, huh.
R:  -- people in there.  Because they have 'em here, we've always had spies here.
L:  Right, right.
R:  They've been found here and there, but --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- he's gotta have 'em.
L:  But, I mean, he's got this UN council, the- there in his country and he's supposed to be disclosing stuff, well then, where do you start?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  How do I know he's not -- how do I know he's not -- not lying to me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do I know he's disclosing anything?  I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like you said, it's gotta be, like, maybe -- secur- -- pictures, maybe?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Photographs taken from radar?  I don't -- you know, all that stuff that we supposedly have the technology.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I g- -- I'm assuming.
R:  It's -- it's gotta be.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, it -- and then again they -- they know of where he's hiding this and that.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, and then they say it on the news that they know where the Scud is.
L:  Right, and --
R:  They should just keep it to themselves and take care of it and --
L:  Right.  Ex- -- that's what I was wondering is, why don't they just go in and then they do find something and the- they -- what was that, one time they just found all those empty shells.  It was a shell for a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for bombs or something.
R:  Yeah, and they were thinking that maybe he was getting ready to arm them with some kind of chemical --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- weapon and shoot 'em over here.
L:  Oh, gosh.  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, that's a scary thing.  Even here in Maine they've started doing the -- the smallpox vaccine. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's kinda creepy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what's -- yeah, what was the story on that I heard the other day, that, um, [LIPSMACK] some of -- nurses or something were having reactions to it and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- President put a fund in place, a small -- to give, um, a little amount of money for death or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anything else caused by the smallpox.
R:  Yeah, they were.
L:  For -- I guess government -- people in government have to take it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what it was, right?
R:  Yeah, I think so, because they make military men --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- and anthrax vaccine.
L:  -- and I think government employees have to, because they might handle mail -- I don't know if it's mail but any of that kind of stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I guess people out -- there are people getting sick from it.
R:  Yeah, I've heard that they -- they had a high reaction rate to it.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And they -- I mean, a lot of people probably already have it though, because they didn't stop it till the -- the, like, mid seventies --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- didn't stop giving it, so --
L:  Oh, so the- -- so they're -- they're stepping up in Maine?  And more people are getting it?
R:  Yeah, they -- I've heard on the news, um, that actually -- I don't know, probably a couple of hospitals have started it and people are volunteering.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, I mean, [SIGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I knew they were doing -- they were targeting, ah, all the government employees first, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Right, and then they didn't want to run out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they had to ha- -- had to cover everybody like that.  So now they're starting the population, huh?
R:  Yeah, I th- --
L:  And that only lasts a certain length of time?
R:  I don't know.  I thought it was forever, like, uh, like they have the chickenpox vaccine now.
L:  Well, but then why are us who are young enough to get the vaccine, having to have another one, though?  That's what I don't sort of understand this.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  There can't be -- it can't last -- must not last forever.
R:  Yeah, maybe not.  I don't know.  Or new strains and stuff?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- that too.  But gosh, [MN] this whole thing is just -- well, I don't think anybody there again, going back to the nine eleven and its -- and Saddam Hu- Hussein, I don't think they took Saddam Hussein serious until the nine eleven thing happened.
R:  No, I don't think they did.  They just thought he was in the -- the woodwork again.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, it's --
L:  Oh good, he's --
R:  -- hard to tell what he's got over there.
L:  Yeah, oh good, he's just staying in his own country, he's just doing his own thing there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, right, he's probably helped financing this and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, man.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, like who he's got backing him.  I'm sure there's plenty of crazy people giving him money and
