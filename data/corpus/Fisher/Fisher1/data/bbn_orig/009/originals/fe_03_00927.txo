R:  Hi, my name is Beth.
L:  Hello, Beth, my name is Wendell.  How are you today?
R:  I'm doing good, Wendell.  How about you?
L:  I'm doing terrific.
R:  Good.  I'm gonna let you open up on this.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they, er, certainly picked a good topic today, didn't they?
R:  Oh yes. [NOISE]
L:  What -- what -- what should the United States do?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, my thought is that we have a very evil person running Iraq [MN] and he pretty clearly has either developed or is about to develop some very bad weapons that would have awful consequences for the world if they were used.  [MN] And I'm of the opinion that he needs to be removed and that if, ah, France and Germany aren't gonna join with the United States, the United States probably needs to go in and do it ourselves.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] How does that compare with your thoughts on the matter?
R:  [SIGH] What is so confusing for me is -- I mean, they've known this for the last ten years since the Gulf War.  Why now?  [NOISE] That -- that's where my confusion comes from, [LIPSMACK] is why do they want to go to war now?  What has happened in, you know, in a relatively short period of time, like -- like, say the last year, to cause them to want to do this?  Y- -- do you understand --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  --  what I'm saying?
L:  Yes I do.  Well --
R:  Because this has been going on for a long time --
L:  Yes, yes it has.
R:  and I really think it has to do with the oil.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, one thing of course that's happened was Nine Eleven [MN] and the recognition that there's a growing number of people who not only hate the United States but are now very actively acting upon those feelings.  [LIPSMACK] And I think perhaps more of us recognize that the threat is perhaps greater than we had perceived it to be a- among some of these people.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think you're right.  I think that brought it to awareness because, you know, America just always thought it was so superior, um --
L:  Well, we --
R:  And untouchable, maybe that's the word I need. [NOISE]
L:  W- we had never really had, ah, we had never been attacked, ah, in the continental United States.  Pearl Harbor had been attacked and that was --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- the only time that happened since, when, the war of eighteen twelve, I guess, when the British, ah, burned Washington.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] for many, many years it wasn't really even thought of that others could hurt us.  [LIPSMACK] And now it's pretty clear that they can. [LIPSMACK]
R:  I mean, I -- I understand what you're saying.  I -- I just don't agree that war is the answer because there is the CIA --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they've always had covert operations and, you know, they've tried to take out, you know, all these bad people here and there, or people that they just didn't, or for whatever reason.  And I don't understand why so many people have to be hurt to do that --
L:  No.
R:  -- when there is a more efficient way of doing it.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, how -- how would you, ah -- how do you think it should be handled?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Like y- y- y- you say -- y- you're suggesting that the CIA go in and -- and what?  Assassinate Saddam Hussein or --
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  -- destabilize the --
R:  -- it would be one way to get rid of him.
L:  [MN] I -- I believe the plan is that the CIA is expected to play a part in the war in any event --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that that's part of the strategy.  But, um, th- th- the people in the Defense Department apparently don't believe that's enough to get the job done alone without conventional forces.
R:  Mm, that may be true --
L:  And it put --
R:  -- but I'd like to see it done that way. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, of course nobody wants bloodshed and loss of American -- particularly American lives or any lives.
R:  Well, a lot of people are going to get hurt, no matter what.
L:  Well, that's -- that's right.
R:  I mean, you know, there are going to be civilians in Iraq that are going to be hurt and again in neighboring countries. [NOISE] 
L:  That's right and if we don't go to war [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] I mean --
L:  -- then --
R:  -- Saddam Hussein is still going to do horrible things to people because we know he's done it in the past.
L:  Well, then, so a number of people would get hurt --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in that event as well.
R:  True, but I think it would be a whole lot -- it would be more cost efficient to take him out discreetly as opposed to mounting a whole all out war.
L:  Well, that -- that'd be a great way to go if it's possible.  They say he has body doubles and [SIGH] all kinds of security around him and [SIGH] ah --
R:  [MN] That's true and you can be very careful but it -- I don't think anything is perfect.
L:  Well, that's true.  After all, ah, several American presidents have been assassinated, haven't they, so ...?  And, ah, we always think we have pretty good security.  Of course we've got an open society here and the President goes around and makes speeches in various --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- places and, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's true.
L:  -- it- it's a little different over there.
R:  [NOISE] But also when the President travels, it's like they close down roads, you know, they inspect everybody that's coming into whatever crowd, they're hand selected.  So it's not like, you know, he just goes in among the people.
L:  Well, that's right and -- and they still get killed.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, so I --
L:  Or -- or -- or wounded.  Reagan got shot and, ah, fortunately survived.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, but there's, ah -- so you're right that, ah, security can't be perfect.
R:  [MN] That's true.
L:  So that -- that might be worth trying and I -- I share your concern about the, ah, the bloodshed that's gonna happen if we go to war.  It looks like we're going to, ah --
R:  I know. [NOISE]
L:  -- barring a -- barring a last minute miracle.
R:  I know.  The President's supposed to go on TV tonight.
L:  Well ... [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] So ...
R:  But it's -- it's just a [NOISE] very frightening thing all the way around.
L:  It's one of these situations where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's no ideal solution it seems.  That whatever -- whether we do or don't go in, [LIPSMACK] um, some bad things are gonna happen.
R:  [MN] Well, yeah.  I mean, hindsight will always be twenty twenty and, you know, once this is all over or years after this is all [NOISE] over, everybody will say, "Well, this should have been done or that should have been done".
L:  Well, and -- I -- I think it'll be known pretty quickly, ah, w- -- if and when we go in.  We're -- we're either gonna find some of these weapons that they've been hiding or we're not.  [MN] And once -- once we take over the country it won't be too long before that's discovered. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, as it is now the inspectors go around trying to find these things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, apparently there're still a lot of them that haven't been accounted for, that it's known that they had and I don't believe they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they just vanished into thin air.  They're -- they're being hidden somewhere.
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely, and I do [NOISE] not want to see that used.  But who knows what war or bombing could do to those things?
L:  Well, it's, ah --
R:  'Cause, I mean, if they're hidden and, you know, they get hit with a bomb, you know, whatever it is, whatev- -- whether it's a biological agent or chemical, will get loosened into the atmosphere.
L:  Mhm.  And that would not be a good thing.
R:  No.  So, I mean, there's a lot [NOISE] -- there's a lot to look at from all ends, I guess.
L:  Well, you're right.  Ah --
R:  And it's -- well, of course, like anything else it's something that you just can't, you know, go into without giving it any thought.  And there is no right or wrong in this one.
L:  Mm.  [MN] World War Two was pretty clear.  [LIPSMACK] Ah --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And, ah, times are a bit more complex nowadays --
R:  True --
L:  Al- although --
R:  -- but then again the United States did not get involved until Pearl Harbor.
L:  That's right and --
R:  Not until we were directly attacked.
L:  -- that's kinda what's happening again, isn't it?  Ah, they, ah, [LIPSMACK] attacked New York and -- and Washington and now suddenly we're --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- more interested in these things.
R:  But it's kinda hard to say, like, how much Saddam Hussein had to do with that.
L:  [MN] Ah, you're right.
R:  You know, it's like, he just became the evil person or the target because we can't find Bin Laden.
L:  [MN] Well, [MN] you could say that.  Or another way to look at it is that there's more than one threat.
R:  Y- -- exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] That, ah, Al -- Al Qaeda are not the only people who are -- who are dangerous to the world.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That, ah, Iraq is as well, and, ah -- and then we have, ah, North Korea causing trouble.  [LIPSMACK] Ah ...
R:  That's true.
L:  The latest I heard yesterday i- is that we're sending some bombers over there to, ah, make a point that they shouldn't be, ah, doing -- ah, getting into mischief, ah, while we're -- while our attention is diverted. [MN]
R:  Wow.  I mean, that's something that's very important because -- [NOISE]
L:  And there's --
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, with a distraction going on, with a war, they could come into power very quickly, or could sneak in under, you know, our radar, so to speak.
L:  Well -- and we lost a lot of American lives in the Korean war last time. [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's true.
L:  And that's, um -- I- Iraq is one thing.  You've got Saddam Hussein and, ah, there's no question if we go in we're gonna win.  But North Korea, now, you're talking, well, is there China behind them or Russia?  Now you're talking about some very big powers and the potential to -- to really, ah, ah, get ugly -- [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, that's very [NOISE] true.
L:  -- if some of these countries wind up, ah, fighting.  [LIPSMACK] So that's possibly even a greater danger.
R:  I think you're r
