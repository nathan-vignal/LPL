L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is, ah, Jim S- Sprague from Rochester in New York.
L:  This Alan, I'm from New Jersey.
R:  Okay.
L:  How are you doing, sir?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  All right.  Um, how far away fr- are you from N- New York City?
R:  Ah, let's see, a pretty good distance I guess.  Ah, let's see, about three hundred and fifty miles I guess, so ...
L:  Oh, really, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, let's s- s- see, h- how does this, ah, whole thing work?  Ah, I thought -- I thought I'd b- be asked a question by an +interviewer.  I didn't know how this whole thing works I guess or ...
L:  Yeah, I don't really know how it works either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, I guess we kind of just talk here.  Ah, I haven't been changing things too much since then.  I'd say it's been more like a psychological mentality that's been different, but I haven't done anything physically different.
R:  Yeah, the, ah, see- here I just, I might have changed -- changed a few of my in- investments maybe, that's about it I guess, sir, yeah.
L:  Really.  Okay, yeah.  I -- I haven't really thought about anything along those lines.  I mean --
R:  [MN] 
L:  I s- I'm in college right now so I'm not --
R:  Oh, I see, yeah, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- looking toward -- not looking towards investments.
R:  Right.  Ah, [SIGH] I guess, ah, I don't know, I j- I just try to have faith in this government.  I- I'm not sure really in the direction they were going.  Ah, I don't really approve of this whole thing.  I th- I th- I think, ah, I think to s- see us work it out by negotiation I guess, sir, you know.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah, I guess.
R:  I really don't approve of the way we're handling it but, yeah.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of people that feel the same way. 
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I d- I don't exactly agree to it too much myself.  [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
R:  Ah, let's see.
L:  [SIGH] But --
R:  So, uh, let's see, how's -- how's this whole thing work?  Are -- are -- are we being charged for this call or?
L:  Um, [NOISE] I don't think so.  They called us so it should be --
R:  Oh, they called us?  Okay and then, ah, what do we report back to somebody or just how does this whole thing work or ...?
L:  I really have no idea.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You had to -- you had to put in an authorization PIN number in, right?
R:  What's that?
L:  You had to put a PIN number in for this, ah ...?
R:  Yeah.  Ah, one -- one three oh four, I guess, sir, yeah.  So yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah, I put mine in so --
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess they know that [NOISE] we had the conversation or whatever.  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay, that sounds good.
L:  Right?
R:  Okay.
L:  Right?
R:  Ah, let's see --
L:  I don't kn- --
R:  So, I don't know what to do from here, I guess, sir.
L:  Yeah, I think, like -- I think we might have to talk for, like, ten minutes, ah ...
R:  Oh, i- it's like ten minutes or something or yeah?
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um -- [MN]  
R:  So w- -- [MN]
L:  What -- what are they asking us?  Um, what would you say nine eleven changed about you? [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, gee.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  Not -- not -- not a whole lot I guess.  I, ah, trust some of the members of the government a little bit less or something, ah, I don't know, I'd say.
L:  Ah.
R:  How -- how about -- how about you?
L:  Ah, I don't know.  Well, like, the town I live in there -- there's a lot of people that commute to like New York City and a lot of them were shell shocked firstly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like after it happened.  My dad used to work in New York City, ah, a week prior to [NOISE] that happening he -- he switched jobs --
R:  Oh, I see, yeah.
L:  -- outside of the City.  But I hadn't -- I didn't even know about that.  So I was a little worried when it happened, I was like --
R:  I can't blame you.  Y- yeah, yeah we got a -- well, see, ah, my, ah, sister's sister I guess is -- is in Washington and, ah, then her other sisters are in Baltimore.  And I guess, ah, she was out walking the -- walking the kids one day and they were pretty close to it when the Pentagon got hit, I guess, so yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  Yeah, that's scary.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] And, um, I -- I worked in New York City last summer.
R:  I see.
L:  [NOISE] And I was talking to some people and there was this guy who was working as an ENC I guess it was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- during it, and h- he showed me some pictures.  [MN] It was really sad basically and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And i- it just hit -- it hit like everyone, it seems like. 
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  No matter how far away from the [NOISE] city you are. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Seems like everyone knew someone.  [NOISE] 
R:  I know.  I see.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know, do you, ah, trust this government or do you think, ah, ah, I don't know, ah, do you think there's any, ah, answer or any compromise to this whole thing?  Or we just have to --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- find some of the terrorists?  Or it's just -- it's just a huge network out there, isn't it?  Or ... [MN]
L:  Yeah, it seems that way.  I mean, [NOISE] [MN] do I trust the government?  I -- I'd say I trust them to do a better job than what I could do.
R:  Right, yeah, yeah, that's true.
L:  And that's why I don't have strong feelings against anything they do.
R:  Right.
L:  It's [MN] a tough situation.  I mean, I kn- I know people who are really against what the government's doing, right now.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm just like, "Well, wh- what's your proposal that would benefit everyone better?"  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [MN] E- everyone wants peace but what do you -- what do you need to do to get peace?
R:  Right.
L:  Stand back and let other people do what they want to do?
R:  I know, yeah.  Ah.
L:  [MN] [PAUSE] Yeah.
R:  I see.
L:  Um, [MN] [SIGH] do you like Bush?  [LAUGH] Do you think he --
R:  I just --
L:  -- as a president in general?
R:  Ah, I guess some of his id- ideas are okay I guess.  Ah, ah, let's see, ah, I'd like to s- see him do more f- for the economy but I guess it's all tied into this thing too or yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well he -- he hasn't -- he made some sort of [NOISE] real pro- ah, proposal for [MN] the budget I guess, wasn't it?  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I think so, yeah, ah.
L:  I -- I don't remember exactly what it was.
R:  No.
L:  My economics teacher was talking about it.  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  What do you, ah, think of him?  Or are you a Republican or a Democrat or ah --
L:  Ah, I'm independent.  [MN] My parents are Democrats.
R:  I see, yeah.
L:  Actually my mom's a Democrat, [NOISE] my dad is a Republican.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, [NOISE] I -- I -- I don't have a problem with him.
R:  Right.
L:  But [NOISE] when hard times come [MN] is when he's supposed to comes through. 
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  And I hope he can.  [MN] 
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  I guess it's a tough spot for anybody there, so yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, d- do you know what, ah, like, France and the other allies, like, what their take on it is?  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I guess, ah, ah, well, France wants to give the +inspectors more time I guess and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Most of them do, I think, yeah.  I think, uh, R- Russia, China's been pretty neutral.  They -- they've been pretty quiet about the whole thing, or yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I don't get much of a read on China at all.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  But I'm, ah -- I'm -- I'm kinda with, ah, some of the o- other countries on this one.  I'd like to s- ah, I'd like to see us work it out before we, ah [MN] I don't know -- the, ah -- I guess, ah, North Korea kinda worries me more that Iraq right now.  But, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Why's that?
R:  [MN] Ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, they seem a -- a little more unstable and maybe a little more dangerous to us personally or -- or than Iraq does, ah.
L:  That's true.  [MN] 
R:  I guess what you're saying about the thing you've gotta worry about, ah, Ir- Iraq is right behind them, Iran is I guess producing, ah, a lot more nuclear weapons that we don't know about, or yeah.
L:  Oh.  [MN] 
R:  [MN] I don't know. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not too aware of everything that's  [NOISE] going on and what exactly is all the facts and the -- what we -- what we think and what we know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, [MN] ah, so therefore I generally stay out of the whole, "Should we go to war or should we not go to war?" kind of th- talks.
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Um.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] But as for nine eleven itself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's a real shame.  [MN]
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [MN] I haven't actually been to the, ah, site.  I'd wanted to go.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  My family went.  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They're proposing there -- I guess they propose, I don't know if they're gon- definitely do it but the new building, World Trade Center that they're putting up?
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Supposed to be the largest building in the world, isn't it?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, that's what I hear, yeah. 
L:  I heard?  [MN] It's quite interesting.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long's it gonna take to put something like that up?
R:  Oh yeah, years. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  I guess -- I guess they're s- s- still at the talking stages or something, so yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So.
L:  [NOISE]
