R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, Phoebe?
R:  Hi, my name is Michelle.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  Where are you located?
L:  I'm in, ah, Texas, the Dallas Fort Worth area.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Okay.
R:  Have you done one of these before?
L:  No, [LAUGH] this is the first time.
R:  Me too.  Where'd you find out?  [NOISE]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  How'd you find out about it?
L:  I found it on the internet, I was surfing [NOISE] and I saw the web site.
R:  Oh, okay.  So we're supposed to talk about reality TV?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Actually I do watch a lot of reality TV [LAUGH] believe it or not.  Ah, my favorite one, of course, is Survivor.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I've watched all of 'em and, ah, I've been watching, I think, now, for, what, the last two years or so, or going on three years.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like The Bachelor. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Actually, I haven't really -- I watched that one a little bit the first time it came on and I hated it.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I thought, you know, the girls were a little much.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I couldn't really [MN] -- so I kinda watched it off and on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I watched a little bit of, uh, what's it?  Joe Millionaire.
R:  That was good.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I didn't see all of those 'cause I kept missing the time that it came on and so I --
R:  Oh, I liked Joe
L:  Yeah, I saw a little bit of that.  What else?  Um ...
R:  How 'bout The Bachelorette?
L:  I saw a few of those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't see all of The Bachelorette either, 'cause, again, The Bachelor stuff just, I don't know, I thought the girls -- I -- I just couldn't do it, and I thought the girls were [MN] kinda after money.  So ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, and the same thing with, ah, Joe Millionaire.  It was just kinda funny and I wasn't as in tune with those as I am with, um, Survivor
R:  Yeah.
L:  Survivor is, I guess, a little bit more wholesome.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely more wholesome.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I miss those a lot.  And one of the ones I've been kinda watching lately, it's on, um, ABC, um, [LIPSMACK] what is it?  The one with the celebrities, I can't even remember the name of it now.
R:  Oh, Get Me Out Of Here, I'm A Celebrity?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That's -- [MN] that's kinda ridiculous, but, um, well --
R:  Yes, but do you know, they had another good one [NOISE] on, that I think was on ABC.  It wasn't Get Me Out Of Here, I'm A Celebrity, it was, um, [MN] Celebrity Fear Factor, maybe?  [NOISE]  Celebrity Mole.  Did you see that?
L:  Celebrity Mole.  No, I didn't see any of those.  I missed that.  I missed --
R:  That was -- that was good.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I missed --
R:  They -- they were, ah, they were really funny. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you watch Fear Factor?  When you say that I thought about Fear Factor?
R:  Yeah, th- -- my sons really like Fear Factor, so we do watch Fear Factor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, whenever they're up we usually watch that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I can't get past the stuff they have to eat.
L:  Yeah, the gro- -- you know what I usually do?  I watch the first one, the first, ah, challenge that they have then  --
R:  And then get rid of the second one.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- usually the second one is usually gross, so I usually --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- go do something else so I don't have to watch them eat something gross or, you know, something really disgusting.  Then I come back for the last [LAUGH] half.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  And, like, it's the fi- the fir -- the last one and the first one [MN], you know --
R:  Right.
L: -- I can watch, but usually the second one is [NOISE] too gross, I can't stomach it.
R:  Yeah, I'm the same way.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't like watching what they have to eat.  All those stuff they make 'em eat just makes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me sick thinking about it.
L:  I know.  [NOISE] On, ah, when was it on?  Last time it was on they had needles going in their arms.  That was instead of eating something gross.  That was --
R:  What was that for?
L:  Um, that was, [NOISE] I think their second challenge.  And they had to endure ten needles being --
R:  Ooh!
L:  I know.  It was kinda disgusting [LAUGH] to watch, but I could watch it because it wasn't, you know, eating worms or something disgusting like that.  [SIGH] But, ah, it was kinda weird how they --
R:  Were they being injected with something?
L:  No, they weren't injected.  It's just the needle going through the skin.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So they would put the needle in -- in their arm, they had to endure ten needles of different sizes.  The needles got larger [SIGH] as, you know, he kept going and --
R:  Oh, that's disgusting.
L:  -- yeah.  They put it, like, in the skin so you had, you know, the si- the two sizes of needles sticking out and it was underneath the skin.  It was really disgusting [LAUGH] but ...
R:  Oh, that's disgusting.
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  That was pretty hard to watch.
R:  I saw that on the previews and I thought, "What are they doing?  Injecting each other"?
L:  No, they had a --
R:  Ooh.
L:  I guess there had to have been a nurse or somebody who was putting, ah, needle through the skin to see if they could endure it.
R:  That's just, like, medically dangerous.  They could get infection or ...
L:  I know, it -- it was kinda disgusting, 'cause the first time -- the first person I saw do it, it didn't seem so bad, but the more I watched, I thought, "Oh, my God!"
R:  Yeah, that's terrible.
L:  Yeah, it was kinda hard to watch after a while but ...
R:  That's nasty.
L: But i- it's, ah, it's somewhat interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I like to -- I like watching Joe Millionaire because the women that were on there that were just there for the money --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  -- they made such fools out of themselves.
L:  I kn- -- especially the last two that was there, not the girl who won but the other one, who thought she was gonna win?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I -- uh -- she was --
R:  And she was totally -- she was totally a gold digger.
L:  I know.  Absolutely.
R:  She just wanted the money.
L:  I know.
R:  But you know, they're not even together any more, the people who won.
L:  So I've heard.  I guess they just split the money and that's the end of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just wanted, maybe the publicity or something?
R:  Yeah, but none o- none of these shows that make up these matches, none of them have even lasted.
L:  [MN]  Um, I know.  But supposedly The Bachelorette, they're still together.
R:  Yeah, but that just --
L:  Tristen.
R:  That just -- that just ended.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That wasn't a real long time ago.  [PAUSE] You know?
L:  B- -- yeah, but aren't they, the couple's still together though?  They're not?
R:  I don't know.
L:  No?
R:  [NOISE] You hear different things, you know?
L:  [MN]  I think maybe they just do it for the money.  'Cause I know if, ah -- I couldn't do Survivor or anything like that.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  'Cause [LAUGH] 'cause, um, I've been thinking, "Would I ever do a reality show and which one would I do?"  And Survivor is certainly not one of 'em and I would never do a Bachelorette or any -- well, I'm married, so --
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- I couldn't do any of those.  But --
R:  You definitely wouldn't be doing. [inaudible]
L:  No, no, not at all.  And then there was another one.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm trying to think.  [NOISE] It was -- it's on CBS in the summertime.  I've watched it the first time.  Um, they're the people who live in the house, or something like that?  I can't -- Big Brother.
R:  Oh, yeah, I like Big Brother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like that.
L:  Yeah.  That's normally on in the summertime.  I watched it pretty religiously the first time out and then the last two times it was on, I kinda, you know, I would catch shows and I would miss a lotta shows.  But that one is kind of interesting and [MN] that's probably the only one I would even attempt. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I like Big Brother, I think that's fun.  But they a- -- they all get really nasty with each other in the end anyway.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  They do.
R:  You know?  They all -- they all start talking behind their backs and making all kinds of, ah, you know, pacts and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ugh.  But, [LIPSMACK] I think -- I think they're a lot better than most of the sitcoms that are on TV.
L:  Well, you know, I'm not a big sitcom watcher.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watch, like, The Practice and I watch some of the reality shows and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L: -- and that -- that's, you know, kinda the stuff when I do watch TV that I kinda watch.  Reality shows though, I mean, they're kinda fun to watch 'cause it's real people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, you know.  Even though some of 'em are kinda silly and, you know ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  Scraping the --
R:  They do things that you normally wouldn't do.
L:  Yeah.  Kinda scraping [LAUGH] the bottom there.  They're still just kinda fun to just sit there and watch, 'cause you watch other shows and they talk about, "Oh, I would never watch that!" you know, on this -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  high horse thing.  But, I mean, [SIGH] I think they're somewhat fun to watch people make fools of themselves. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now what about this new one, um, where America marries these people?
L:  [MN] I didn't -- I missed it.  I wanted to see it and I guess I got screwed up with the times because I used to live on the East Coast and since I've moved here, I'm central time zone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I miss a lot of things [LAUGH] 'cause I keep thinking eastern time and then [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I end up missing it.  But I ended up missing it a couple of n- -- I think it was on a couple of nights ago or something so I didn't see it.
R:  Yeah.  I didn't see it, but I -- I wanna see it 'cause I can't imagine that people are so desperate for publicity that they'll just go marry anybody?
L:  I know.  I wonder if they get any mo- -- they have to get some kinda money.  I -- I ca- --
R:  They have to.
L:  I can't see somebody doing that without, you know, somebody upping [LAUGH] some money somewhere.
R:  Something has to be going on.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  'Cause that's pretty bad when you say, "Okay, just -- I'll marry whoever you want me to".
L:  I know, I know.  But supposedly, I think, isn't a family member or a couple of family members, or somebody they know that's kinda helping to pick out the other person, or something?  I'm not sure.
R:  I don't know, 'cause I -- I haven't seen it, I've only heard people talk about it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they were saying on the radio this morning when I was driving to work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That they had really, really, high ratings.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, really high ratings.
L:  Well, I -- I need to try to catch it, make sure I catch it next week.
R:  Oh, here it -- I'm -- I'm just, ah -- I have the computer in front of me and there's a, um, actually an article about it on AOL's front page.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
R:  I guess talking about the -- the way that Americans are obsessed with reality television.
L:  I know.  They're fun, though.
R:  They are.
L:  They are.  Do you watch American Idol?
R:  No.
L:  No?  Oh, that's good.
R:  No.
L:  That's my other favorite one outside of Survivor.  It's, uh --
R:  But that guy's nasty.
L:  [MN] But he tells the truth.  The -- ah, a lotta people talk and say how bad he is.  I guess the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- way he comes off and the way he says it is really kinda bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But he really tells the truth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I -- I like Simon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't have a problem with him.  It's -- he does -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's a way to tell somebody, "You stink" without saying, "You stink!".
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, he just tells it like it is, straight, no regards for feelings [MN] you know, nothing whatsoever.  And I guess the only problem I have with that is, is because the -- it's, you know, teenagers, I think they have to be eighteen to twenty five or something like that, so you're talking about young [MN] you know, somewhat young people.  I think, to talk to them like --
R:  Yeah, these people could really be damaged.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, i- it's kind of a little harsh for that age group.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So in terms of that I wish he would, you know, somewhat tone it down a little bit or -- or say it a little easier.  But I think it needs to be said, too.
