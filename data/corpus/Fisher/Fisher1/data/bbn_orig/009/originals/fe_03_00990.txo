R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Donna.
R:  My name is Ria, from New York.
L:  Did you say Lydia?
R:  Ria, from New York.
L:  Ria from New York.  I'm in Delaware.
R:  You're in Delaware.
L:  And [SIGH] okay, ah, what do I think.  The question is what do you think the US can do to avoid bioterrorism, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Okay.  I guess this is a little over my head, but I'll try -- 
R:  [MN] I don't -- 
L:  -- unless you can give me your opinion first. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I don't basically think they can do too much because they can't [inaudible] they can't watch everybody and everything and all you need is a little packet, it can contaminate a whole train.
L:  That's true.  That's true [inaudible].  I'm not --
R:  I think if they really wanted to go there they can -- they very much can do it.
L:  I think they might have kind of proved that with the anthrax, you know -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- like, uh, how quickly it can spread and how much damage it can do with so little, but how are they planning to -- you see I don't [MN] know the different types of -- 
R:  That's another thing.
L:  -- uh, bio chemicals -- 
R:  That's another thing.  
L:  -- and how they're -- 
R:  We don't even know what we're looking for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how can they prevent it if they really want to do it, mhm?  It's scary, isn't it.
L:  Well, yeah, it is.  
R:  [MN]
L:  It's -- okay, how much do they know as compared to how much do the -- 
R:  They're letting us know, right?
L:  Do the -- well, no, how much do the terrorists know about -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- getting this stuff across and how to sneak it in and how to, you know, where to place it and what it does to the body, what kind of scientists do we have that, um, [MN] come up with the, you know, the chemicals and know how many people it'll kill at one time and so how much of that does the US know also because wasn't it this case somewhere, I remember it very vaguely about, um, gas.  Ah, they used some kind of tear gas or some kind of gas -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- to get the people out.  It was -- it was a huge amount of people, I think in a theater somewhere. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And -- 
R:  They did it too one time in I'm thinking Japan or China, the subway systems there.
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now that I do remember and it's just so, I mean it's a scary thought because you never know who and, you know, we lead such a busy life that, um, well then again I -- I guess that's, uh, it depends on how much you use public transportation in that sense.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But how -- okay, what can they do to prevent it?  Ah, well, if they're smarter than those guys, then they could try to stay one step ahead of them, maybe.  Maybe the US was being, um, noncha- too nonchalant about, "Oh, they won't do this".
R:  Yes, they start calling their bluff, you know.
L:  Yeah.  They think that those people think like we think -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and you know, no, they don't think like that. 
R:  I don't think they're too civilized myself.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  Mm.
L:  They don't have the morals that the US has and, um, they really, they -- it's -- it's hard.  You know, what makes it so hard is, um, these people want to die -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for their cause -- 
R:  -- and they don't care -- 
L:  -- for what they think.  They're willing to die.  
R:  That's right.  
L:  So, what can you -- 
R:  And they won't mind taking a bunch of us with them.
L:  Yeah.  What can you do with that?  I mean shh -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] I don't see nothing that they -- they can do.  They can keep up their little watch and checking everybody's packages and stuff but the ones that they should be checking they're not doing.  I mean I really think they should have a blocked mail from anybody even coming from that country over here now -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until we get this straight.
L:   Oh boy.
R:  We've got some kind of understanding.
L:  Oh, boy and, you know, and it's -- it is scary because -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't know how much the government tells you.
R:  Right.
L:  It seems like we are on a need to know basis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Okay, like, um, ju- just like this guy that was just here over on this side doing all these killings, the two guys -- 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that were doing the -- just picking people off just at random -- 
R:  Yes. 
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those guys, until they came unto the public and said, "look, the guys are driving a such and such car" and that's when somebody in the public actually said, "well, hey, you know, lookee here", you know, "I found this guy".  But I don't think they would tell us until they abso- -- 
R:  Yeah, like -- 
L:  -lutely have to because -- 
R:  We have to be protected from panic.
L:  -- they really don't want to have any control. 
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  And panic, you know what panic people -- 
R:  Yeah, and panic even more when they do tell us and they tell us also that they can't do nothing about it.
L:  And you know what? 
R:  Mm? 
L:  Mass panic is -- is -- is what they are afraid of because, you know, the police are out here and so forth and the armed forces but they can only do so much when so many people just lose it or something over something like that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like mass panic they cannot control, they don't want -- t- -- it leads to things like r- riots and things, you know, people on the edge.  Even after September eleventh, you know, people were going and being vigant- -- what do you call them, um -- 
R:  Vigilantes?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Vigilantes, you know, [MN] and taking it out on people just because they looked like they were from over there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so, um ... 
R:  And I thought that was going happen here in New York in a big way but in reality they didn't do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They really didn't do it.
L:  So, what can they actually do?  Well, I think the only option they might have is I don't think the question is what can they do to stop it because they can't stop it, but how can they have the least amount of casualties, how quickly -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- can they respond to something. 
R:  That's what I was thinking about right then, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Show us some antibodies, you know? 
L:  Yeah, or something, you know.
R:  Things like that, you know? 
L:  And you know, you see they've done that with the doctors and so forth and everyone -- 
R:  Yes, but -- 
L:  -- getting shots in.
R:  But what about us? 
L:  N- -- yeah.  No, w- --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I think we're casualties, you -- you know, we're those necessary casualties of war, you [MN] know? 
R:  Mhm, yeah, you know.
L:  Somebody is going have to -- unfortunately it's like when a lot of things in life, something tragic has to happen before something is really done about it, even though all the telltale signs point and say, "look, this is going to lead to this, this is going to lead to this, this is going to lead to this", you know, until something actually happens tragic, do they actually move anything.
R:  And then that's when the panic starts because everybody going to try to seek help at the same time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, we all can begin to prepare for this now.
L:  Okay.  So, since they can't prevent it and since it looks like there are going to be some casualties somewhere along the line, why not equip us by giving us the information that we need, um -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to inform ourselves as informed citizens to protect ourselves and our families.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, so let us make that decision [several inaudible words].  Don't play with our lives.
R:  Mhm, and don't keep busting a blind[?] about things that you all already know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know, so -- 
R:  Because some people -- some people can take care of themselves, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and not just physically with the antibodies.  We also need to prepare ourselves mentally and emotionally for this kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Y- --
R:  You know, just, all of a sudden this hit us like that.
L:  [SIGH] Boy.  Well, you know what, I think we kind of got our -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- our eyes and ears open now as far as the public, [MN] y- you know, like w- we're aware that [MN] come on, you know, the United States was in a lull, a sleeping lull, like -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we were this big giant that, you know, no-one would dare -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and here, you know, they show that, no, we don't care about that, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you big, the bigger you are, the harder you fall, [MN] so, um, ah, so I guess I can [inaudible] that there's not -- uh, what they should do is inform the public, they should educate, uh, the public as to what types of chemicals, uh, bio chemicals are out there -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- how they affect the body, you know -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- get some kind of web sites together or something that informs that, you know, people can get there quickly, find this information out and try to at least prepare themselves and be aware of something might -- that might look suspicious now, whereas it didn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you didn't have this information, you know?  Things to kind of be on the lookout for that might look out of place or something or -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or, you know.
R:  And right now they can be doing this to us right now.  We wouldn't even know the side effects and nothing like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  People would be out here walking around with colds, might not be a cold -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know? 
L:  Yeah, and, you know -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- we're so quick to go to work. [MN] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  With colds, go to schools with colds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "go on, kids, go to school". 
R:  And then -- and then there's a -- a -- have a long-term of effect -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they can be attacking us right now.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  So ... 
R:  [inaudible] no way and no one's saying nothing -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the last minute.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And while we've been watching it on the TV that's when we know, right? [LAUGH] 
L:   Well, you know what, I don't even trust so much the -- the news media.  I've learned [MN] over the years that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, [MN] they're not always going to give you the right scoop, either.
R:  Right.
L:  So like I say, I think education is its best, the United States best weapon -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, it'd help -- 
R:  Yes. 
L:  -- you know, it's a -- it- -- since it seems like it can't be prevented, at least, you know, don't -- like if -- if something happens over here, ah, and somebody dies and they say, "Oh, oh, this is what it is" and everybody's running to the doctor like you said, everybody's running, everybody wants to get inoculated now and everybody, you know, and there's that mass panic whereas, you know, if you educate us now we can make our own, uh, uh, decision as to "okay, do I think that this threat is enough for me to go and take this antibiotic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- or enough to take these precautions when it comes to protecting my children" because, you know, [MN] face it, we really take too many antibiotics.
R:  Mm.
L:  And our bodies, my husband says it all the time, you know, our bodies grow immune and -- and so when something really comes along, you know, and we try to hit it with antibiotics [MN] it's nothing, the antibiotics or the -- the germs are mutating into something else, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the -- our systems are so used to that, so, uh, again I say my thought is educate the public, get some web sites together, get some flyers out in the mail, mass -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mailings maybe, make people aware of what type of -- 'cause w- when I first heard this --
