L:  Hey, hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My name's Laurie.
R:  Hi.  I'm --
L:  Who am I talking to?
R:  I'm Patrice.
L:  Patrice?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, hi, nice to meet ya.
R:  Nice to meet --
L:  Where're you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Alaska.
L:  You're in Alaska?
R:  Well, I'm in Oregon right now but I'm from Alaska.  Where're you from?
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Where do you live in Alaska?
R:  Um, well, I live in Juno, but right now I'm living in Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] Well, do you watch reality TV?
L:  Ah, yes, I do. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  I -- well actually I don't watch it now but I watched the first Survivor.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I enjoyed it and, um, the only time I watch it now is if I'm at somebody else's house that has it on.  My -- I have kids and they like that American Idol.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L: And, um, I have some friends that I've visited and they watch, oh, a guy.  What was it?  I guess it was the one with the bachelor -- oh, about the g- -- guy who wasn't really a millionaire.  I don't know what it is.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That show.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't have -- I don't really watch TV or -- I don't know, I don't [MN] -- I don't really like those kind of shows.  Like, I totally don't understand why people would like them you know, but I just [NOISE] I don't know, I kind of, like, hate TV.
L:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I just, like, it makes me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, I just totally [MN] -- I don't know.  I like PVS[?] and stuff but --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of it's like I'm wasting my time.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  Like -- but I can get sucked in, like, if I'm in a bar or something and the TV's on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like a kid.
L:  I found that with the first Survivor.  I wasn't intending on watching that and my mom -- I was over at her house and then it was, like, "I've gotta see the next week" and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I couldn't go watch it it's, like, we taped it.
R:  Yeah, totally. 
L:  Yeah.  But, um, th- -- the [MN] -- the second season was okay but we haven't watched anything after that.  Though now they have so many rea- reality shows it's [LAUGH] unbelievable.
R:  Yeah, it's kinda like, it's like, maybe we're so disconnected from each other, you know what I mean?  Like, I don't know, as a society that we kinda need to see what people are doing?
L:  Uh huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  Just like the way we're all kinda paired off and everything?
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And I -- I think that's maybe why people like those, is, like, even though that it's not really reality, you know what I mean, it's like a total, like, show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like, we still get to see just mundane things that people do, in a way, kinda.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  It's -- I don't know, it's definitely entertainment.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, I just --
L:  It's, ah -- it's -- I- I have to say it is entertaining when I go over there but it was, like, I don't want to get -- I didn't want to, you know, start having to watch it every weekend.  Like, my daughter and I were out to dinner one night and she's, ah -- she's, ah, "Oh, we need to hurry up, we need to hurry up, we need to hurry up".  It's like, "Why, why, what's going on?"  She's like, "Well, American Idol's going to start and I don't want to miss it".
R:  Oh, God.  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see, it's just like -- it's like, I don't know, I don't want to ever be like that about, you know I mean?  Like anything like TV, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Like, "Oh, God, I have to go".
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That's -- yeah, that's exactly it. There's -- we should be spending time with the real live people and family in our lives rather than -- than, ah, um. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, it's like [inaudible].
L:  Okay, yeah, then in- instead, you know, it's pushing them away so we can watch TV.
R:  Yeah, it's like escaping reality --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to watch reality but it's not really reality TV --
L:  Right.
R:  It's like, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, it seems weird but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Have you done this study before?  Like, do you know how this works really?
L:  Nope.
R:  Is this your first time?
L:  Nope, this is my first call.
R:  This is my first -- yeah, me too, and I'm just like, okay.
L:  Yeah, I mean, they called me two nights ago to do it and I -- they -- it was like, "Hold on while I find a participant" and then I held on for like, ten minutes.
R:  Really?
L:  And then they -- you know, they +kept asking me -- [MN] they kept asking me, ah, you know, "We haven't found a participant, do you want to hold?"  And I would -- kept saying, "Yes" and after ten minutes I said, [LAUGH] "Forget it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they called back again later and this -- this time I didn't hold so long.  But, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  Where'd you hear about it?
R:  I saw it on the Internet.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where did you see -- where did you hear about it?
L:  Well, on the Internet too but at a -- at a forum I belong to.  There's a lot of people that signed up and apparently now they're all talking to each [LAUGH] other, so it was kinda funny.
R:  Was it like a -- what kind of forum was it?
L:  It's called Lila's Lounge.
R:  Oh.  Is it some kind of, like, academic thing or ...?
L:  No, it's a foru- forum, um, actually for people who do customer service evaluations and stuff like that.
R:  Ah.
L:  And --
R:  I would like to -- weird.
L:  Yeah.  So -- and I -- I know when I signed up for it I sent information to a couple of my friends an- -- and in fact I had a friend call me the other night at midnight and it's like, "Oh yeah, you want to know what I was doing".  And it's like, "Oh yeah, [LAUGH] I was supposed to get paid ten dollars for talking ten minutes to a stranger".  And he knows I do a lot of really weird things like that so he was -- thought that was really funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, totally.  [SIGH] I don't know, it's weird.  But I don't know what exactly they want to know, I mean, like, about reality television.  It seems kind of weird, like, do they just want to see how people actually communicate with each other?  Like -- 'cause I -- I found it 'cause I was looking up linguistics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --on- online --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like, for school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For this school project I was working on and I was, like, "Sweet, I can talk to somebody for ten minutes and make ten bucks".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't really know what they want to kn-  -- I mean, are they, like, some sort of -- is it statistical information for ...?
L:  I asked --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, when they called me with my PIN number and they said they -- they study and record it, um, for different purposes, one of them to develop voice recognition software.  So I thought that was interesting.
R:  Oh, that's kinda creepy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know we're being recorded. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Huh.
L:  [MN] But, um --
R:  We are.
L:  Yeah, I f- -- i- it's like, I thought it sounded like an interesting way to make ten dollars.
R:  Yeah, except for now it's, like, like they have my [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, and they pick different topics.  The topic yesterday was season and the topic the day before when I was on hold was -- oh, what was it?  I think it was health or illness, or something like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  Illness, illness, was what it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  And I had a lot to say about illness but there was no one to talk to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, maybe it's 'cause it's a later time slot, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking for me.  I mean, you're an hour a- -- oh wait, you're in the same time zone but when you're in Alaska, you're an hour earlier than me, aren't you?
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  Yeah.  So I picked this time because I figured this is the time I'm most at home.
R:  Yeah, exactly and, like, I'm not really doing anything.
L:  Uh huh, uh huh.
R:  So ... yeah, I -- I really wonder what exactly they want to know about people, you know, are they just like how they communicate, or is it some kind of weird government thing, or ...?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I mean, who knows?  And who g- -- I mean, really, who gives a shit about reality television?  I -- [MN]
L:  Well, I would think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sponsors and producers might, but they seem to be doing fine without our input.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they -- they get -- they have those shows.  I can't believe how many people watch those things.
R:  Yeah, it's just kinda like tabloids, you know, or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know but ... [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway ...
L:  It's like you said, it's, um, it- it's, like, addictive and it just sucks you [LAUGH] in.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I kinda feel like it's like -- I don't know, I really haven't watched.  I- I've seen, like, a tiny bit of American Idol and I've heard people talk about Survivor but -- I don't know.
L:  I don't know if Fear Factor is considered one.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I don't know if it is but I -- I've watched that a couple of times too and it's, like, the -- the one where they eat things are so gross --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- or I guess they eat things or they have bugs crawl on you or stuff like that.  And it's like, that is totally gross.
R:  I mean, come one, like -- like, the reality for most Americans is, like, living in a double wide trailer, like, eating greasy food. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  Like driving a truck.
L:  Mhm, like, and no one wants to see that.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, that's -- that's reality, not like --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  I don't know.  It'd be interesting if it was -- if they really wanted to know what real people did, like the majority of people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in our country.  It wouldn't be very interesting, I don't think, so, you know.  But I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]  So you're going to school right now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In Oregon?
R:  Yeah, I'm a student in Ashland in SOU.
L:  What's the name of the school?
R:  It's, um, Southern Oregon University.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause my d- -- my daughter was interested in going to Washington.
R:  Oh, for -- for university in Washington?
L:  Yeah.  We live in California but she said --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- that it was too expensive.
R:  You should check out, um, SOU.  It's a really affordable university.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know where you guys live in California but A- Ashland's right on the border.  It's ten minutes away from Northern California.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, that is close.
R:  So, it's really close and, ah --
L:  Like, close to Humboldt or something? [MN]
R:  [MN] Um, I think it's about three hours away from Humboldt.
L:  Oh, okay.
