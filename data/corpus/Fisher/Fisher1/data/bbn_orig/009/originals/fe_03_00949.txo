R:  Hi, I'm Pamela in Atlanta.
L:  I'm Beth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm in Louisville.
R:  Great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's your favorite holiday?  Mine's Christmas.
L:  First I would like to say that this is the first time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anyone has gotten a hold of me.  Last time I was on hold for twenty minutes --
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  They told me not to talk about anything about this study though.  [LAUGH] So.
L:  Okay.  Anyway, holidays, what is my favorite holiday?  I don't think I have one.  I enjoy anything that does not involve working.  That is a holiday to me.
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.  I like Christmas 'cause that's the time I get to see all of my family instead of just some.  [MN] So it makes it nicer --
L:  [MN] I don't --
R:  -- for me.
L:  I don't get along with most -- like half of my family doesn't get along so we don't see them.  [MN] And I live in a different country than my family, so --
R:  Wow. [NOISE] 
L:  -- we don't see each other very often.  I'm from Canada.
R:  Oh, okay. [MN] 
L:  Um, holidays. [NOISE]
R:  I like Easter too because I'm a Christian, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's kinda [MN] makes it --
L:  That would sense.
R:  -- for me. [NOISE] 
L:  I like Hindu holidays, they're fun looking.
R:  Yeah, I guess if I was going to make a new holiday, I'd make a pet day.  They don't have any holidays for your pets.  Do you have any pets? [LAUGH] 
L:  I have cats and fish and I had an eel and a horse.
R:  Wow.  I have two dogs.  They're my sons, so ... [MN]  I don't know, I just think that there's a lot of pet lovers out there.  It seems like the animals should have a special day since we -- you know, some people don't really know when their birthday is if they've found them [MN] so ...
L:  Oh, that's true.  
R:  So, ah.
L:  I guess I hadn't thought of it that w- way.
R:  Or even, I guess there is a friendship day, I guess I just don't really celebrate it, I guess I should.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't -- I'm not very celebratory in any manner.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There was a Talk Like A Pirate Day.  That was the best day ever.  You got to go around and talk like a pirate for a whole day.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess if I was going to make a day, I would call it Victorian Day, where everybody has to be Victorian for a day 'cause that's my [inaudible].
R:  What would they wear? [MN]
L:  Oh, Victorian clothing, Victorian and Edwardian, yeah.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, I got a -- I have a Victorian dress [several inaudible words].
R:  I'd have to borrow something from you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a -- I got it off eBay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was a lot of money but, ah ...  I don't know, I guess some people would have issues with that.  I think there ar- the average waist size was nineteen inches in the Victorian era.
R:  Wow.
L:  So.
R:  I guess with the corset a- a- anybody could almost [LAUGH] get in one if they just about killed you maybe. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, there's some guy in -- currently in France who makes corsets and he wears them himself and his waist size is very, very small.
R:  Wow, is he gay?
L:  I don't know.  It would be the kind of thing I would picture a gay man doing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE] Well --
L:  But I don't know.
R:  -- if he's good at it, you know, what the heck? [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yes.  [MN] And a- we could do typ- you could do typically Victorian things, like have a Victorian album or learn dances from that age, and maybe you could, um, [MN] make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Victorian food.  I don't know, I'm just -- I'm obsessed with it all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess.
R:  Well, sounds like you could plan a holiday like that real well since you know a lot about it.
L:  Oh yes, everybody would just roll their eyes at me and go, "Beth, you are crazy".
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  And I'd say, "I know".
R:  -- gotta have some fun in life, right? [MN] 
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, we can all adopt English accents --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  Since the Victorian era took place in England [inaudible].
R:  But of course.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] I lived in England.
L:  Oh, did you?  I'm, um, going there this summer to study actually.
R:  Oh, wow.  Well, it's too bad we don't have -- have a holiday for our pets I think, because I love my dogs.  They have that unconditional love, like Jesus, for you and most people unless it's your parents and you have a good relationship with them, or your boyfriend or someone, then most people don't have unconditional love for other people, or for anything --
L:  I would --
R:  -- but themselves.
L:  -- say I have  unconditional love for one or two maybe other humans [MN] excluding my family, maybe one other human being.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And that's my best friend who is in Spain unfortunately.  But, oh -- oh -- oh well.  I -- I d- I'm not big on the whole boyfriend thing, they're all losers.  At least mine was.
R:  [MN] I'm sorry.
L:  That -- that's okay.
R:  Sometimes it's depressing during holidays if you don't have a boyfriend, you see all these couples walking around, you know.  [LAUGH] It can be like, "Oh my God".  But I've been with the same person for eight years so it's been okay for eight years.  But I remember --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- before that it was kind of tacky sometimes.  [MN] Sometimes I di-
L:  I had this -- I had one for six months but he decided he liked to fuck some blond Germans --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- better so ...
R:  Well, you don't want to be with a guy like that anyway.
L:  No, not really.  I would prefer one also that didn't sit at his compu- -- we sh- -- that's a holiday.  We should have a holiday for people like me and other single people who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- need decent human beings that are male, who are not thirty, who can be younger and be mature at the same time.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  That would be particularly interesting.
R:  That's a good idea.  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Ah, I think that's a good idea.  And those of us that have someone, we can always trade 'em in for a newer, more efficient model.  [LAUGH] Just kidding.
L:  There you go.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, i- it would be um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- commercialized like a lot of holidays are.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like that Swedish Day.  I don't -- I think that's silly.  [MN]  I also think this country should honor more holidays of other religions.  That would -- that's -- okay, that's one thing that I w- would say about holidays, that's what I think about holidays.
R:  Like what one?
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  I think we honor so many of other religions already.  What do y- -- which ones are you s- referring to?
L:  There are a lot of Hindu feasts and Islamic feasts that nobody -- you don't get off work for them, for example.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  It's very --
R:  I like having more days off.  Anything for more days off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not that I'd celebrate that but I'd enjoy the day off.  [LAUGH] 
L:  The Europeans get like, six weeks' holiday a year.
R:  Yeah, but they don't have -- they have six weeks -- I used to live in Europe.  They have six weeks' holiday but it's not because of their religion or because of any customs, it's just because [MN] of the way their work schedule is.
L:  So, it's just the way it is.
R:  So maybe we should just have a holiday just for a day off, instead of to have, you know, these government holidays.  It seems like the government people get all the holidays off.  A lot of those holidays I don't get off.  It makes me mad.
L:  Maybe Day Off Day.
R:  Makes me mad they get paid to be off and then I have to work and you don't get overtime and ...  [MN]
L:  Oh, where do you work?
R:  [MN] I work at an IT company.  [COUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  So [MN] we don't get very many holidays.  They don't seem to honor 'em which is kinda --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [MN] depressing 'cause ...
L:  I'm on holiday.  It's spring break.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I guess that's fun.
R:  Lucky you.  But then are you making any money when you're on holiday?
L:  No, I -- I work so much at school I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a job, so no.
R:  [MN] 
L:  But I did work a lot at school this week.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I actually go to school in Cincinnati.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, that -- that's [inaudible].  I don't get Canada Day off.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you could take it.
L:  I know I should.
R:  You know, you won't get paid for it though probably [MN] but ...
L:  No, I -- I doubt that.  That's one good thing about holidays, you get paid a lot more.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I love holidays 'cause, I don't know, I just -- I like all the decorating at Christmas and all the different little cherubic things.  I love angels so I like little cherub things and I like after Christmas better because [MN] stuff's on sale then [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Yeah, I enjoy -- I enjoy shopping for things after Christmas.
R:  Yeah, I like -- I like buying gifts for people for holidays too, like for Christmas and stuff 'cause [MN] I used to be m- I guess more enjoy the receiving part but now I guess 'cause I've gotten older [MN] I enjoy giving more.  And trying to figure out something to get people sometimes is hard though.  [NOISE] If, you know, they have pretty much everything they need.  Not that they're Rockefellers or anything but maybe they just don't need another thing to have to dust off, you know?  It can be frustrating sometimes.  [MN] It's too commercialized, I guess, a little bit.  I used to spend a lot more on Christmas than what I do now.  [MN] Now I don't --
L:  I don't have money to spend on Christmas.
R:  Yeah, this year was a bad --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- year for me too so ...
L:  Should see my bank account.  You know, that whole being a student thing.  I can give art work at Christmas.  I'm at art major, that's probably --
R:  That's great, it's probably better than anything you could buy him anyway.  It's something from the heart.  [MN] So, you don't see -- what do you do at Christmas, where do you go?  Do you go home for Christmas or ...?
L:  Yes, I [NOISE] come back here and I -- we have Christmas and w- occasionally we go visit my relatives in Canada but --
R:  Who's we?  Your --?
L:  My -- my immediate family.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  My mom and dad and --
R:  [MN] So you do see your parents for Christmas?
L:  Oh yes, yes, we do.  And there's always a large debate over who wants turkey and who wants ham --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- who doesn't eat certain types of meat and who doesn't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I mean who does, I'm sorry.
R:  So what do they do?  Do they have both? [MN] 
L:  Ah, we usually have both.
R:  [MN] You're spoilt, that's great.
L:  And one time I think my dad made duck or something like that, I don't know, or goose.
R:  Wow.
L:  Do you remember that?  I think it was duck.  Yeah, my mom nods.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think --
R:  Wow, that's pretty cool
L:  -- it was duck.  Oh, well.
R:  He must be smart if he knows how to make duck.  I don't think anyone knows how to cook duck, except for these oriental restaurant people.  [LAUGH] And they make it pretty -- pretty crispy.  Sometimes it's overcooked.
L:  Like it's usually -- I do a lot of the cooking.
R:  Wow.  That sounds like fun.
L:  Have a national cooking day or something.  [MN] I -- I can't even have time to look forward to holidays.  I will just work and like, "Oh a holiday is here.  That's nice, what can I get done on that day?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I finish it.
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's like another day to do my laundry and stuff.  I know what you're saying.  But I do like g- I like the preparation of meals too.  I love to cook, so [MN] I enjoy doing that part of it [LIPSMACK] and helping out and everything.
L:  If I got to just pick something to do for fun it wouldn't be make up a holiday to do something, it would just be take a day off and do what I enjoy.
R:  Yeah, I'd probably sleep.  [LAUGH] Recoup.  Regroup myself, get more energy.  [MN] Ah, I w- I like more ho- I would like more holidays, so anything to have a day off I guess.  [LAUGH] I guess I really don't want to work [LAUGH] which I guess it's a cop out [MN] but ...
L:  Nobody really wants to work, everybody just wants to play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't -- doesn't work that way, yeah.  I would go horseback riding, I think.
R:  It's too bad that w- that we don't get like certain days off every month or something.  It would be neat if they had like a -- a day to yourself holiday maybe every month or something.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Happy unbirthday to you.
R:  Yeah.  It's so unrealistic that it'd never
