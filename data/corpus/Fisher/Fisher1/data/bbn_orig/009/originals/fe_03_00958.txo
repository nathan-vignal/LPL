R:  Hi, this is Jeff.  Who are you?
L:  Hi, this is Donna.
R:  Donna, hi.  Um, so what do you think?
L:  Well, it's really kind of hard to say.  I think the way it's going I think if a terrorist really wants to, ah, do something it's -- it's going to happen.  I don't think the security is really going to stop them.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Really?  Um, I guess -- I guess what I think is -- is -- I use, um, the security of my house as a little bit of an analogy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, anybody that wants to get into my house, if they're determined enough, will get through.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ah, but the -- the greater the security that I provide, it's gonna weed out the -- the -- the people that are -- are using low level, ah, techniques, um --
L:  Right.  I think it'll --
R:  You know, i- it --
L:  It'll weed out the crazies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think a determined terrorist --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is going to get through.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think -- I think -- I think they'll find a way.
R:  But you can weed out n- you can weed out a large percentage of them.  You can't -- you cannot -- you can never have one hundred percent effective s- security, but I think that, um, um, as you increase security, ah, you're -- you're gonna weed out, you know, more and more of them.  Um, the -- the w- I think the -- the thing that worries me the most is people on the ground, ah, with infra red homing missiles like a stinger --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sitting at the end of a runway as an airplane takes off.
L:  Yes, that's -- that's very true.  There's not a whole lot that can be done about that.  Ah, what do you feel about the -- the pilots having weapons in the cockpit?
R:  [SIGH] I think it's probably a good idea.  Um, I'm a pilot myself.  I'm not a commercial pilot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I -- I think, ah, that if these guys on nine eleven had had weapons in the cockpit none of this would happen -- would have happened.  But it's almost -- it's almost at this point redundant because they've tried this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and now they know that we are watching for this.  They won't do it this way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- again.  If -- if somebody wants to do something to hurt us, ah, they will try to find something that will surprise us, not something that we know about.
L:  Or they may think we're not looking for that.  They may think that's what we're thinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I- I- I don't know.  It's, ah, ah, now I think you're -- you're taking a chance, [MN] but everything you do in life you're [NOISE] taking a chance.  
R:  That's true.  That's true.  But I -- I think -- I think that, ah, giving these guys a hand gun in the cockpit is probably a pretty good idea.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- I would agree with you there.  I think pilots for, ah, for the most part are pretty level headed.  I don't think they're all that gung ho where they're going to make a terrible mistake with it.
R:  No.
L:  I -- I think they'll know what they're doing.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, I know  -- 
L:  But, ah --
R:  I know a lot of pilots and -- and my best friend was a -- a retired pilot from American Airlines, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I -- th- th- th- there are no -- th- if -- if you're a bozo you don't -- you don't g- get through the screen to get, ah, get to be a pilot --
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, a commercial pilot.
L:  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Your -- your statement about, like the stinger missiles and all was very interesting though.  Ah, I wonder if the homeland security has really given that any thought and if they're taking any security measur- measures around airports --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I um -- 
L:  -- for that at all?  If there's anything possible that they can do?
R:  I'm sure they're thinking about it all the time.  Um, [SIGH] i- it's -- it's so hard.  I -- I think it's hard to take security measures, ah, because there is -- i- if you think of the flight path of an airplane, um, on takeoff particularly, ah --
L:  Oh, there is so much ground to cover.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, there's a -- there's a hu- -- there's a huge amount of area under that flight path from which somebody could sit there with a stinger missile.
L:  Yes, yes there is.
R:  And, you know, and how do you police every square inch of, you know, hundreds of thousands of acres ah, off the end of the runway?
L:  Yeah, that would be nearly impossible I'm sure.  Plus, even after the fact I think they would have a hard time even locating the general area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from which it would -- would have come.  Ah, I think that would be something really hard to -- to try to even be secure against.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that -- I think the protection is that, um, you can't go to your local m- Wal-Mart and buy a stinger missile.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, that's true.
R:  Ah, and --
L:  Last time I checked.
R:  -- it would be pretty hard to aqu- to acquire in this country and you would have to smuggle one in and I think --
L:  Is it as hard as you think?  Uh, I'm beginning to wonder.  Ah, all that I've seen and heard lately about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things being smuggled in, ah, I'm sure there's a lot of things going on that, you know, we have no clue is happening.  I -- I don't think it's that difficult any more.
R:  Well, I -- I guess, you know, I -- I c- I hadn't finished, ah, my statement but I --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  -- I think -- that -- that's what I was getting to is, is we don't know.  Ah, that would be the -- that would be -- be the way that it would be done is, ah, somebody would smuggle a stinger or some other type of heat seeking missile in.  And there are a lot of ways to get things into this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I, ah -- I know I have thought about whether or not I would fly somewhere, ah, now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- after what's happened and I'm not sure that I would.  And I used to fly myself.  I was working on becoming a private pilot --
R:  You were?
L:  Yes, I was.  Many years ago.
R:  And what -- what -- what stopped you?
L:  Ah, lack of money.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That'll do it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just ran out of money.
R:  It's an expensive habit.
L:  Yes it is.  And I was flying back when it wasn't that expensive, so ...
R:  When was that?
L:  Oh, back in the, ah, back in the late seventies, early eighties.
R:  I got my license in nineteen seventy five.  I was nineteen years old.
L:  Well -- when then you're aware of what I'm talking about.
R:  Yep.
L:  I was paying fifteen fifty an hour.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah --
R:  That's -- that's what I was pa- -- I was paying fifteen bucks an hour for the airplane and six bucks an hour for the instructor.
L:  Yeah, it was eight bucks for mine.  But, ah, knowing what I know about flying, ah, I really, you know [MN] -- airports at that -- at that time they weren't secure at all, ah, and I haven't been around an airport much lately --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to really experience the security measures that they're going through now.  I'm glad they're doing it.  I think people are, [MN] you know, feeling much safer now, but I wonder if they really are that much safer?
R:  [MN] I think we are some.  Um, I -- I think it would be very difficult to do a repeat of nine eleven.  Um --
L:  I hope you're right.
R:  But there are other -- other ways that people can get into airplanes and cause trouble.  Ah, you know, y- I -- I think we still are not real well protected against blowing up an airplane in the middle of the sky, um, but I think -- I think taking over an airplane and having somebody -- somebody, an evil person, fly an airplane is --
L:  That's gonna be [inaudible] too.
R:  -- a lot less likely.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I agree with you there.  The thought of, ah, you know, a biological attack, even aboard an -- an aircraft, that would cripple an airliner, a- cripple a pilot.
R:  [MN] Well, I don't think a bio- --
L:  You're just releasing some kind of biological --
R:  I don't think a biological attack would because that takes time.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But --
L:  Well --
R:  -- there's an incubation period, but chemicals could -- could certainly, ah, raise havoc on an airplane.
L:  Yes, definitely.  Chemicals and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that could cause as much, if not more of a catastrophe, depending upon where the aircraft would've -- would come down, so that could be bad.  And I don't know if there's anything [SIGH] --any way they could really be secure against that i- if someone got that substance aboard.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, that's the only other thing that I had thought of that would really be difficult.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause you've got your ground crew and ... to be one hundred percent safe I -- I just don't think it's possible.
R:  [MN] No.  There -- there -- there is no such thing as one hundr- one hundred percent safety in life, um, I guess that's the phil- philosophical part is, uh --
L:  I think those days are behind us.
R:  Well, we never had hundred per cent safety though.
L:  But we felt safe.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We felt --
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Before this happened we had -- we had that air of [MN] being invincible, I think.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And, you know, all that's happened now has really stopped and made people think.  Are they that safe now?  And they realize that they're not and they probably haven't been, but, ah, i- it can be frightening if you allow yourself to dwell on it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, um, [MN]  but I think, um, I suspect people had similar feelings right after Pearl Harbor.  Um, people no longer --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- felt safe.  And after a period of time after World War Two ended and, um, we weren't attacked again, people began to feel safe again.  And I think that is what will happen with this, um, is -- I don't think we're going to see a repeat of it, um, [MN]  and I think it will fade into our memories and after a while we'll begin to feel safe again.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] I -- I hope you're right.  Do you know of -- ah, can you think of any way, ah, security could be increased at airports now, from what you have seen?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] I don't think so.
L:  Is there anything that could be done?
R:  I don't think so.
L:  I don't either.  [MN] What I've looked at, what they're doing, I can't think of anything else.
R:  I think -- I think one of the most important things they've done is, um, [MN] made it pretty difficult to get into the cockpit of an airplane, and have trained pilots that, um, it doesn't matter what's happening in the back, you need to fly the plane.  And what -- what happened in -- in this case is that, ah, they started killing members of the flight crew, the s- the flight attendants, and the pilots came back and that's
