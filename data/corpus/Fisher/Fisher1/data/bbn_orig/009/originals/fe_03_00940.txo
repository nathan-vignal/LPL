L:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name's Tania.
R:  My name's Margaret Brian.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  And we're supposed to talk about holidays.
L:  Yes we are.
R:  What holiday do you like?  [MN] Or do --
L:  Well, let's --
R:  Or do I have to talk about it?
L:  [NOISE] E- e- I think we both talk about it and we just --
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, I like Christmas especially now that I've got kids.
R:  Oh yes.  [NOISE] The -- the-- the joy, the marvelous feeling that's around.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I like Christmas, I like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Halloween --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the fun.  I'm a retired teacher.
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  And kids love Halloween.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yes, they do.  This is so --
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I -- I have had three year old triplets the last Ch- -- Halloween and Christmas were the first one they really got into and enjoyed and -- [NOISE] 
R:  Three year old triplets?
L:  Yes.  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, dress up time.
L:  [NOISE] That's right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Boys or girls?
L:  [NOISE] I got two girls and one little boy.
R:  Well, how on earth do you get on Christmas?  [MN] 
L:  Oh, we -- well, th- they just -- they -- they've got so much of everything that one present is all they need.  [LAUGH] So ... and --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- and I think everybody else spoils them more than we do, so ...
R:  I appreciate that.  Holidays have, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a special meaning that doesn't have anything to do with a whole lot of presents.
L:  Right and that's what we try and do is just, you know, my husband takes off from work right around there.  [NOISE] And we do -- go out to lunch or breakfast together and [NOISE] it's like everybody else gets them so many toys and they end up getting [NOISE] broken two days after the holiday or whatever that [LAUGH] we're like ... [NOISE] 
R:  Well, a- a- are you a participant, like me, who just called in to be on the study, or you working with something else?
L:  I -- I -- I do mystery shopping and I found out about it from some other mystery shoppers [NOISE] on a --
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE] -- on a message board I go to and they told --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- told me about it and I was, like [NOISE] I like to talk on the phone, it's adult companionship for ten minutes [LAUGH] every few days -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
L:  -- instead of just talking to three year olds all day long.  [LAUGH] Sure.
R:  How do you think Santa Claus sitting in that chair would be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- day by day by day with all of these -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- little mouths telling him what they want --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and crying at him?
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That would be terrible.
L:  Yep.
R:  But you know, I think that Santa Claus is a marvelous spirit.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I like the way that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he has given, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, a reason for the rest of the world to give.
L:  [NOISE] That's right.  Yep.  Well, that's what we try and do with our kids.  They -- right before Christmas 'cause we know we're going to get a bunch of extra toys and gifts from everybody else, we go through all our toys and given 'em away to other little babies who don't have 'em, so ...
R:  You know what?  I'm in the South.
L:  Uh huh. [NOISE] 
R:  And you know what Christmas is for us?
L:  [NOISE] What?
R:  Well, a lot of the men go hunting and stuff like that.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And that's pretty traditional here.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But it's family get togethers.
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  It's families and take --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something to the shut in.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's dark days, short days, and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- heavy winter.  And Christmas around here is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gifts for those who can't -- 
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  -- you know, do for themselves.
L:  [NOISE] Right, that's right.
R:  What is it -- what is it where you are?
L:  We- we- we're in Texas and it's pretty much [NOISE] you know, that's our big thing is to get together with family and stuff and -- [NOISE] 
R:  Middle, south?
L:  [NOISE] We're in north Texas.  [NOISE] 
R:  North Texas?
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  So you pretty well do the same thing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that Oklahoma and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh huh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And -- and you probably celebrate --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with Christmas trees with icicles?
L:  Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  But down towards the Alamo --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't believe they do that, do they?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, we lived in Austin for a long time and some of [NOISE] them do, it just depends -- it just depends on I think --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I mean, 'cause like, I was an air force brat --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- growing up, so I've lived all over the place and stuff and there's so many --
L:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- in Austin and stuff there's so many peoples [NOISE] that transplanted [NOISE] from other parts of the country [NOISE] that, you know.
R:  Can you hang on just a minute?
L:   [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  I have -- have [NOISE] somebody at the door.  [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay?  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.  Hey, guys, I'm on the phone so -- [NOISE] hey, Sarah, Heather, I'm on the phone so you gotta be qui- quiet, okay?  Please.  Thank you very much.  [NOISE] Guys, don't throw your crayons and break 'em all up or you won't be able to play with them another time.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  He- Heather, do you want to play crayons later?  [NOISE] Then you can't throw 'em like that, they break real easy.
R:  [NOISE] It was my neighbor.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
R:  "My dad's right there and he wants to borrow your ladder".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I said, "Get it, Cody".  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, no, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the holi- the holidays in the southern part, you were talking about Christmas in the southern part --
L:  Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of Texas?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  What did you say?
L:  I said, I think I -- it just kinda depends.  There's so many different [NOISE] I guess it -- there's so many people transplanted from, like, all over the country, you know, like from Minnesota for Three M and -- and different -- you know, IBM from all over the place and stuff that nobody actually came from central Texas.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  So it's whatever their -- you know, whatever their traditions they had growing up they brought with them.  So there're are so many different things people do.  It seems like, you know.
R:  What about the Hispanics there?  How did they celebrate the holiday?
L:  They do tamales an- an- and rice and beans and get together a lot of family.  It's, you know, I mean, so many of 'em live so close to their family anyway, it's just, you know --
R:  Well, with us it's --
L:  -- another excuse to get together.  [LAUGH] 
R:  With us it's chicken breasts and -- and, uh, uh, [SIGH] some googey cake and, ah, sweet potato pie --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- and, uh, things like that.  We're in the south you know.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And those good peas and beans from the freezer with corn.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Just a feast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And take it to shut ins.
L:  That's right.
R:  Make 'em a plate if they can't come.
L:  That's right.  So ...
R:  Mhm.  I think this is supposed to be ten minutes and I didn't -- I didn't set a time, did you?
L:  I- it was -- I think it was three thirty nine, I looked at my watch, so we've got, like, three or four more minutes, I think if I ...
R:  Well -- well, I would like for whoever's out there studying our speech --
L:  Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to really know that Christmas is a spirit.  It's not a day and it's not one particular day.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's [SIGH] a feeling that should be throughout the year. 
L:  [NOISE] That's right.
R:  And it shouldn't be just one time.
L:  That's right. [NOISE] 
R:  And that's Christmas to me.
L:  Yep. [NOISE] 
R:  And I think Cody's here at the door.  Cody?  Hang on just another minute.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] 
R:  We're gonna have to talk extra.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Cody?
L:  [NOISE] I don't know, sweetie, why don't you all roll it back and forth together?  Okay?  Jessica [inaudible]. 
R:  Okay, that one wasn't Cody, that was my husband came in, so I --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:   [NOISE] But Christmas is more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to me than a day.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't celebrate it as Christ's birthday.
L:  That's right.  [NOISE] 
R:  I celebrate it as a [COUGH] a time to be with family.
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh. 
R:  And to be serving others. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I t- I think that's -- that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, really the best --
L:  That's right.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- attitude to take toward it.
L:  [NOISE] That's right.  How long were you a teacher?
R:  Thirty two years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Thirty two years --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and loved it.  Ah, I didn't have, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my career all in one place.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And if the folks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that are talking would like to know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that are -- that are -- that will be listening to us would like to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know, probably one of the most interesting --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- things we done is visit places like Ukraine, my husband's a preacher.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Visit Ukraine --
L:  Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- visited South Africa, been in Nigeria.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's cool. 
R:  People --
L:    I- I lived in England for three years.  My dad was an air fo- -- in the air force so we moved all over [NOISE] but England was the most [NOISE] exotic place I lived.  And then we visited -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [NOISE] like, Paris and Denmark and stuff [NOISE] while we lived there.
R:  Oh, so you've seen the Eiffel Tower?
L:  Uh huh.
R:  I wonder what the French do for Christmas?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I wonder what, uh, type of celebration.  I know that Father Noel comes along and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  -- and gives toys but I don't know how -- how [SIGH] -- how --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --um, how much they give and how much emphasis.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] In, ah, Ukraine, ah, Santa Claus has a granddaughter.
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  And -- and I can't say her name --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but she is [SIGH] a part of the celebration I think.
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  And they have a different day --
L:  [NOISE] Uh huh.
R:  -- to celebrate.  And they celebrate, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- much the same with feasting and presents.  But it's -- it's a different, you know, main people.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  In other words, they don't have Rudolph over there.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And, ah [SIGH] that's -- that's the difference there.
L:  Right, yeah.  [NOISE] I don't remember it, so -- I was young.  I'd love to go back to England and all those places [NOISE] to see how much I remember of the -- I was, like, six years old [NOISE] when we lived there so I don't have that, uh, good a --
R:  I love the guards outside of the palace.
L:  Uh huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yep.  Ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] That was cool and my brother was a baby when we lived there.  He was, like, one or two when he left and he really enjoyed 'em too.  He -- he thought they were really cool.  And I'd love to take my kids [NOISE] over there and let them see it and stuff.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] I figure that's a long trip to make on a airplane [LAUGH] with --
R:  Can -- can you tell where the speech is coming from?
