L:  Daniel.
R:  Laura.  So I guess they wanna know if I watch reality TV, or you do?
L:  Yeah, do you wa- -- have you seen Survivor?
R:  I saw the first one but I didn't see any one after that.  Um, I don't think I saw, but maybe like one of The Batchelorette or any -- I -- or The Great Race, was that another reality?
L:  That was -- that was another one.  Um, now I saw the, um, th- only I think it's the second Survivor, we had a girl from -- ah, I'm from South Carolina and we had a girl from, um, Winsborough, um, South Carolina who was on there.  She was, I think, the third one to get voted off.  And then this, um, recent one, Amazon, um, there was a girl from Orangeburg, which is, like, thirty minutes south of me, that was on it.  So ...
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, i- it's pretty cool, you know, when you kn- when --
R:  Yeah, I guess that would make a difference.
L:  -- someone from where you're at.  Yeah.
R:  No, I didn't know anybody.  I live in Pennsylvania but I didn't know anybody and --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I didn't know 'em, I just -- it was -- it was kinda interesting --
R:  Yeah, from the same state.
L:  -- that they're from here.  And he was talking about being there.  There was actually a guy from Colombia, where I live -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that was on there, but he only won a thousand bucks so that don't say much for South Carolinians.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's still pretty good, though.  [COUGH] I don't know why th- -- I think they're so popular 'cause, like, you -- it's like people you know, like you say, you know, i- it could be you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess.  But I -- I can't see myself on -- on an island though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wh- what was the first one that you remember seeing?
R:  Ah, the original Survivor, I think, probably.
L:  The original Survivor?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you re- -- do you remember the Big Brother?
R:  Kinda, yeah.  They lived in a house?
L:  Yeah.  And then they -- 
R:  Yeah, I kinda remember that one, yeah.
L:  They had one that I wasn't really crazy about.  It was called Temptation Island and that's where they took the couples on this island and -- and they tempted 'em with other, um, other women or men against 'em to see if they, um, their love would hold.  And now that was -- [MN] I -- I wasn't too crazy about that one.  But ... [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Did the love hold for any of them?  I'm curious.
L:  Um, I -- [NOISE] I think -- I think two of the couples made it. [LAUGH]
R:  They must have thrown a lotta temptation in there.
L:  Th- th- -- yes, they did.  Uh, my wife was crazy about that one.
R:  I don't remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that one, no.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  The only one I think I watched consistently was the first Survivor.
L:  First Survivor?
R:  Yeah, I don't really remember where the second one was, um.  [MN] But then they've had so many others, like the [SIGH] the one where they went from one point to the other and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And then I think they had another Big Brother.  Didn't they have more than one?
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think they had a -- I think they had three Big Brothers, I do believe.  Now that race you was talking about, that -- that one was pretty cool 'cause they had to go from, um, from point to point --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they had to get a clue and solve the clue and whoever got there first.  That -- that was interesting too.
R:  I don't know if that's exactly the same thing like a Survivor or --
L:  It's really not.
R:  Or even that island thing you're talking about.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that the same kinda thing, do you think?
L:  It's, um [SIGH] -- it's [MN] -- to me when they say reality TV I think of Big Brother, because they put them all in a room.  They put twenty five of 'em [MN] or was it twelve?  They put them in there and see how they would react with other people.  Now me, ma'am, my idea of reality TV is to put twenty five men --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in a room during football season and have that forty game ticket playing on there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With one remote.
R:  Oh, that would be interesting.
L:  And -- and -- and that would be interesting to see how that end come would be, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  I think there'd be a mass homicide probably.
L:  I do believe that would be -- I do b- -- I believe a mass suicide, more or less. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That would be pretty interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, now, ma- maybe -- maybe they use this recording for that, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  But [MN] they were talking about a show where, like -- I think it was kinda reality TV where you -- if somebody, like, hurt you or did something to you, you could get back at them or -- or something like that, like, ah, like, scare them.  Or I do- -- I don't ever know what happened with that, but it was kinda --
L:  Well, they -- they were talking about putting something like that on this season.
R:  I haven't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't seen anything on that.  I wo-
L:  And then -- and then they have all these, um, celebrity, um, I think they had a celebrity Boot Camp.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that's still going on.
L:  I- is it still going on?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think it might be.
L:  Because I saw the first --
R:  Like I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here?
L:  Yeah, that was -- that's one too.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe that's to see if they can rough it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  They can afford it, can't they?
R:  I guess so.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  An- and actually some of the people from -- from the -- like the Survivor shows have gone on to do other things.  So, [MN] y- y- you know, on TV and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other places, so ...
L:  Now, have you s- -- did you -- have you ever seen that Fear Factor that comes on Monday nights?
R:  I -- yeah, with the bungy jump, bumping, and eating worms and --
L:  Yeah, like, when they get to the eating worms part's where I --
R:  Ooh, I don't know about that.
L:  [LAUGH]  'Cause I don't -- I don't know if they -- do they -- do they consider that reality TV?
R:  I don't know. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I don't really know if they do or they don't.
L:  That's more, um, a games show, I do-
R:  In a way, but it's kind of a really strange one.
L:  It is, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess if they're real, I don't know, you know, real people, not actors, then it is reality TV.  I- I'm not really sure.  I mean, the li- [MN] as they keep making more of them it's like the line gets more blurry, what is and what isn't?
L:  Yeah, it does.  It -- it -- I mean, um, when they came up with Survivor and Big Brother, to me that was -- that was good.  But then they started making everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and all of that.  And that -- that was to, um, try to match up.  And they [MN] they called it reality TV because they were seeing if, um, a man could choose out of  twelve strange women --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, who he wanted to marry.  Then they had Who Wants To Marry a Millionaire?
R:  Then they had that Joe Millionaire.
L:  They had Joe Millionaire, which he was on -- he only made, um, thirty thousand a year.  [LAUGH] And now he -- then they said he's got his brother, they're making one about his brother.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Ah.
R:  I don't know if they're reality ones or not.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, how real is being on an island where you have to -- I guess that is real, I don't know.  It probably is.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's like you have to just start from scratch and --
L:  Well, n- -- you know, Surv- -- now, the first Survivor, they -- they supplied 'em with stuff and so with the second one, but with this Amazon, they didn't give 'em anything.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No, they didn't give 'em anything.  They had -- they had to start from scratch.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause that w- -- that was a big thing about it.  They had to build their own shelters, find their own food, and -- [MN] I think they helped 'em as far as medical wise and stuff like that, but [MN] when it got down to, you know, they had to build their own shelter.  Now, that's real survival to me.
R:  That -- that is, that is.  H- how did the person from -- from your state do though, on that?
L:  I really don't know that.  Now, like I said, the girl from the second one, um, Cathy, she -- she didn't last very long.  I think she lasted, uh, what was it?
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Two nights?  [LAUGH]  And then they voted her off, 'cause she was -- she was a little bossy.  And she was too -- too m- --
R:  Was she on the first one, or one of the ones --
L:  I think it was the second one.  She was the one that worked at the, ah, Mack truck factory.
R:  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
L:  You know which one I'm talking about?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  And, um, she w- she was from Winsborough, Tenness- -- um, South Carolina. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  So you've had a couple from your state then, two or three?
L:  Yeah, we -- there w- -- I think so far there was two.  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  That's pretty neat.  I -- I don't know [MN] -- like, truthfully, any more is -- to me it's getting boring.  Like after the first and second and third one, then it's -- it just seems like it's, like, copying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I don't know, um, I don't know.  I don't know if they're to me, they're still as popular as they were, but they must be or they wouldn't keep making them.
L:  They- they're definitely making more and more of 'em.
R:  [MN] So I -- I can't really think of any right now that I'm -- that I [MN] even thinking of watching.  I -- I like -- I don't know, I mean, to me [MN] they started back with, like, Star Search.  That's -- that's, um, I don't want to say that's reality, 'cause that's not really reality, but they started that show back and  ...
L:  Well, how about the -- how about the, um, American Idol?  Would they consider that reality TV?
R:  I don't know.  I -- yeah, in a way.
L:  And then this Nashville Star, you know, about the country music.  It-
R:  No, I -- what i- -- I haven't heard of that one.
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- that jus- -- I think it come o- -- started last night.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what's that one supposed to be about?
L:  Um, it's -- it's -- it's the same thing as American Idol but th- there's, um [MN] d- -- only one person can make it as a country star.
R:  Oh.
L:  And ...
R:  I don't know if that's -- would you consider that a -- a survival show though, or a reality show?
L:  Well, then [LAUGH] if you're no good there's no reason going, is there?  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] That's true.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Whereas, like, the survival shows or the first one, they just [COUGH] took people from who made the cut.  But I guess in a way it is the same thing.
L:  Well, see, you get those people in Survivor and they've got wives or husbands and they got kids --
R:  Mm.
L:  And they're leaving for [NOISE] thirty days.  I don't believe I could do that.  I'm [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't th- -- I don't know but --
L:  I mean, I've got -- I've got a wife and kids [NOISE] and I don't know if I could leave 'em long enough.  [NOISE] But [MN] -- and then especially if they don't make it.
R:  Yeah, that's gotta be rough.  Though some of the ones from the first show that didn't make it, um, have gone on to do other reality shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know about the second or third.  Which one was -- the Amazon was like the third one or?
L:  The Amazon was the third one 'cause --
R:  The one from Australia or something?
L:  [MN] So, what you had -- you had, um [MN] Australia, then you had the, um, African, the, um, th- the one in Africa.  That was the last one.  And then the third one.  Or was -- hold on, which one, let me see.  You had one in Australia, [MN] then you had one where they were living in the desert and Ethan won that one.  And then the Amazon one, I believe.  Or -- or -- or I think there might be four of 'em, to tell you the truth.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are they gonna do ano- -- are they doing another one?
L:  I don't kn- -- they're doing the Amazon one right now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  This is the Amaz
