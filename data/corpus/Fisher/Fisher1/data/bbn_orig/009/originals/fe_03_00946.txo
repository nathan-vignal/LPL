R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Constance.
R:  What is your name?
L:  [NOISE] Constance.
R:  Constance?  My name is Elizabeth.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  My name is Elizabeth.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, hi.
R:  How're you going?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I'm kind of in a -- I'm kind of in a loud place here so, ah, I may have to ask you to repeat some things a couple of times.
R:  Okay, I wasn't quite sure if it was just, ah, static on the line or what was going on.  I think we're supposed to talk about holidays.
L:  Yeah, that's, ah, I think that's what it said.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Ah, so, what's your favorite?
R:  I don't know, I'm thinking Christmas is probably the best.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I like the tree, I like all the -- the decorations.  I love shopping.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  And I'm thinking -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's uh, that's what Christmas is for I guess, all those things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I don't know, I mean, um, I think Thanksgiving is, ah, probably my favorite one.  Um, I, uh, I live, ah, pretty far away from my family and that's kind of the one that I've picked, uh, you know, ah, as the one to go back, uh, home and rejoin them for, so that's probably the one that I would, ah, I would pick over anything else.  And I think it's -- and I think also it's not as commercialized as pretty much every other one, so ...
R:  Pretty good, I like your reasons.  Where do you live?
L:  [NOISE] I live in Florida.
R:  Oh, in Florida.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, where do you live?
R:  Oh, upstate New York, Poughkeepsie. [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Huh, really?  I grew up in Newburgh.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I tell you we had another eight inches yesterday and it -- I'm ready to pack it up and move where you are.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, you know that -- that's something.  Let me tell you a secret.  That's -- that's exactly what we've bred down here because know it -- we're laugh- -- you know we laugh at, like, all the snow boarders you get?
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, we know that, basically once the snow melts down we're going to get a nice deluge of refugees from up north moving down here --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and ah -- which is good and bad I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it -- it was horrible.  It was horrible.  We had um --
L:  [NOISE] I heard.
R:  Speaking -- speaking of the holidays --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I had planned to have, um, twenty three for dinner on Christmas Day --
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  -- and we got hit with the snow storm so I had food for twenty three people and nobody came. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Yeah, that's right, I went up there for Christmas and, ah, I almost -- I lucked out because I almost left for, ah, [NOISE] -- well, I was going to go up there for Christmas and I almost left on Christmas Eve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And all the snow came down on Christmas Day and I would have basically you know, been snowed in for a day or two [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, at least.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Yeah, well, then we left --
L:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE] my brother was -- when he came up from New York he actually did get, like, you know, snowed in for a night 'cause he had to go back down straight away, so ...
R:  Oh, it was bad, it was really bad. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] yeah.
R:  -- we lived in Ohio for twelve years and even, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the holiday time out there still was not as bad as it was this year here in New York.  [LAUGH] so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, that's why I came down here, so ...
R:  How long have you lived down there?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, basically for, how long is it now?  I guess thirteen years.
R:  Oh, so, yeah, we were in Ohio for twelve.  [MN] 
L:  Far out.  [inaudible]. 
R:  Uh, it's a different kind of, uh, life.  Well, I like the change in the, um -- I like the way they celebrate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff up here.  I don't -- I was -- it's a little bit different in Ohio, the way --
L:  How's that?
R:  -- they celebrate holidays.  They, like, they do Easter parades for every little town and that kind of thing.  Um, decorate your own Easter bonnet.  Uh, you can't be in the parade if it's store bought.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  You have to go out and make your own.  But the weather is, um, unpredictable, as it is up here.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  So y- we've had the kids out where they were marching in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the parade in the snow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But it was an Easter parade.  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was different, it was different.
L:  I don't know if it's that, ah, [NOISE] you know, ah, unique down here.  I mean, ah, you know, the holidays are the holidays, it's just, ah, you don't have any snow basically.  Um, you know, there's unique, um, holiday traditions [several inaudible words].  Ah, there was something that just happened a couple of weeks called Gasparilla[?] which is sort of a mini Mardi Gras for this area, ah, you know, floats, parades, up and down, um, up and down the streets pretty much, ah, for a couple of days.  Um, and, ah, you know, just a way of, ah, celebrating the, ah, unique, ah, history of this area. [NOISE] 
R:  That's pretty neat.  We lived in Delaware, Ohio, and one of their celebrations there is for horse racing, harness racing.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  The little brown jug.  [MN] And --
L:  Yeah, I heard of that.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in Delaware it's a holiday.  The kids have off school, and, uh, you know in the town, in the city of Delaware, it's a city, it's twenty five thousand people, it's not like it's a thriving metropolis [LAUGH] but it --
L:  [NOISE] No, that sounds about right, ah, [several inaudible words].
R:  Mhm, mhm.  But the kids have off school and they have, uh -- and everybody who has everything from four age to, you know, thoroughbreds, ah, comes out, and the guy from -- that does the weather on Channel Four comes out and waves and he's the master of ceremonies. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That sounds [inaudible].
R:  It's kinda cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Ah, well, what, ah, what other holidays do you [several inaudible words]?
R:  Um, those are -- those are my biggest ones.  I -- I think, uh, birthdays I'm not too -- I'm not too choked up about, I don't go get too excited about them.
L:  [NOISE] Your own or others?
R:  Say it again?
L:  [NOISE] You- your own birthday or others?
R:  Nah, I don't think any of them are really [MN] w- I do something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for the kids, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Right. 
R:  I don't ignore the birthdays.
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  But +it's not, um, [MN] -- it's not a big -- if I'm a day late I'm not too pushed about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  So ... [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, I thought Valentines Day was [inaudible] kinda nice, another good one. [NOISE]  Ah, you know, ah, I've been known to forget it [LAUGH] but, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's, ah [NOISE] [several inaudible words] but it's one that, ah, that I think is kinda nice.  [NOISE] 
R:  No, I think -- I don't know, I don't like Valentines Day too much.  I think everybody is sitting there waiting to get a card or something.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Even an email [LAUGH] and if you don't. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, well, I don't send cards they --
R:  -- you sit there going, "Oh my God, I -- nobody loves me". [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well, yeah, that's the down side of it, I guess there's equal parts exhilaration and, ah, ah, disappointment.  [NOISE] But, ah, [inaudible] I don't think it's that bad.  I think it's -- I think it [several inaudible words] [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] I like Saint Patrick's Day except I don't like --
L:  [NOISE] Paddy's Day?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words]. 
R:  I like marching -- ah, well, [LIPSMACK] not really marching.  I like watching the marchers in the parade.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  Ah, I used to work down town in the city and, um, to go and all the guys were out selling flowers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the sidewalks and because it was all com- spring was coming and everybody had daffodils --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and all kinds of stuff and green carnations and I -- w- when I was in high school, um, the Irish kids always wore green for Saint Patrick's Day and then the Italian kids decided, um, they needed a holiday too, so they had red carnations on, um, the feast of Saint Joseph which is March nineteenth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So the florists by our school did a great business in March. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'll bet.  Ah, yeah, I remember that. [NOISE] But ah --
R:  I grew up in the Bronx.  Ah --
L:  Oh.  Oh, you went to school in the Bronx? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, so you were born in Poughkeepsie but you didn't grow up there?
R:  No, I -- I was born in the Bronx and we moved out to Ohio and then we moved back to Poughkeepsie.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I see, okay.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE] I got it, got the order. [NOISE] 
R:  And [LAUGH] it was -- it was different. Being up here is even different [NOISE] than living in the city. [MN] 
L:  Oh, yeah, I bet.  [NOISE] Ah, you know, there's, ah pluses and minuses I guess.  [NOISE] Ah, I've never lived in the city although I kind of always thought I'd be [inaudible].  I kind of thought it would be fun but I'm sure maybe day to day it would be -- there'd be [several inaudible words] things you'd have to go through.
R:  Well, we kinda liked it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I -- I find it kind of boring up here.  Um, there's --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, stuff closes, there's nothing much to do, you can go --
L:  Oh yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- to the movies or you can go out to eat or maybe bowling.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, oh, bowling's big [inaudible]. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  And there's like -- 
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's a small town.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, it's a small town, I mean, that's just how it is.  It's, ah, you know, ah, things shut down around, what, eleven o'clock?  If you're lucky.
R:  Oh, god yes, uh-huh.  Ah --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's um, that's how -- that's how it is.  I mean, if you really want -- you know, if you want variety around the clock stuff y- you gotta be in the city.  And then if you're in the city you gotta take a lot of the, ah, you know, shit things that come with that, I guess, which is [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, you know, at times I think when you're younger you, ah, you, ah, [COUGH] really tend to not mind the, ah, the negatives as much.
R:  I was kinda thinking that up here though it would be a little more hopping with so many schools, you know with Vassar and, um, [MN] and Marist and the, ah, Institute and West Point isn't that far away.  You know?
L:  Yeah, well, West Point, they'd never get out though.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're, you know, they don't go anywhere.  But, you know, I grew up there, I know it's not -- you know when I was growing up we went to the city to have fun, flat out.
