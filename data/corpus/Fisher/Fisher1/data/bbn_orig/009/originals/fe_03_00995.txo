R:  Aha.
L:  Well, with the rebates and the coupons I've bought -- I have bought sixty one or sixty five dollars and ten cents worth of stuff and they paid me a dollar ten to take it.
R:  Wow!  So how do you get into this couponing?  Is it a club, you got to pay?

R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And there's, you know, it -- it's -- there's -- there's -- we actually have two men -- [NOISE] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and, you know, if -- we get a lot of different, y- like cool savings and smart source and, oh, nine megs[?] and I mean there's all kind of coupons -- 
R:  Wow.  Interesting.
L:  -- places you can go, you can print coupons [inaudible] and you just got to have a printer and a computer and, you know, and -- and you got to watch, you know, I mean I could send you the information to teach you how to get your stuff for free.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, cool. 
L:  You know, there's a lot of sites, a lot of sites.
R:  You could spend your whole time on the computer. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I get up at six or six thirty in the morning and that's the first place I go after I start making coffee.
R:  Well, if you get savings on your groceries and stuff, it's really worth it, right?
L:  Well, it is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, what I -- what I spend in ink and paper is nothing compared to what I save.
R:  Whoa.
L:  Just like we have a Martins[?] grocery store here.
R:  Aha.
L:  They have Hershey milk or milk shakes on sale for eighty nine cents this week. [NOISE]
R:  Aha.
L:  I got a coupon for eighty five cents each.
R:  Oh, wow! 
L:  So I'll pay four cents a piece.
R:  Wow! [NOISE] 
L:  And see, all this, all the cou- -- most of the coupons that I get that are really good deals are off of this web site.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So you said is gate keepers one word or two words? 
L:  Gate keepers angel.  It's -- it's all one word.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Ca- capitals on the gate, the [MN] keepers and the angel.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  That makes a big difference because I'll be signing on and -- and I won't know what to cap it.  Okay.  So, anyway, I -- I -- 
L:  So just, you know, send me -- send me your email address.  I'll -- I'll, you know, get the -- get the moderator from Why Pay For It to, uh, send you an invitation and you're in -- [NOISE] 
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- because right now it's a closed group [NOISE] and it's by invi- -- [NOISE] no, you can't, honey -- [NOISE] it's by -- it's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know she thinks it's my mother.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's by invitation only.
R:  Oh, I see.  I see.
L:  And, you know, that's how -- that's how you get in but, see, there's also another group called CADMS.
R:  Cattle?
L:  CADMS, C.A.D., uh, C.A.D.M.S.
R:  Okay.
L:  CADMS and that's -- that's a big, huge board.
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, it's got all kinds of reef- rebating and refunding and coupon info and -- 
R:  Wow! 
L:  And then there's another one called All[?] but, anyway, you know, that's what I do with my time, you know, I'm a stay at home mum, I've got a seventeen year old son and a four year old and I -- I -- that's the way I do it.
R:  Wow, and i- -- and if it brings you in savings, it's worth it, it's better than going out there to work. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it's the truth.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can make more money using the coupons than work in a grocery stores than I could a job -- 
R:  Wow, that's a good idea.
L:  -- you know, in this day and age.
R:  I'm glad we- -- we've talking. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, this is -- this is how I got into this Fisher study, was through that group.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I collect on, you know, they posted a link, you know, because they have to post once a month -- 
R:  Aha.
L:  -- and if you don't post something once a month, they boot you out.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean it's just a participation kind of thing, you know, just an incentive to participate, but there's, you know, there's people that know all kinds of tricks and everybody's putting coupons in, you know, and I mean, there's -- if somebody finds something -- 
R:  Aha. 
L:  -- they post it to the board so everybody knows about it.
R:  Ooh.  Okay.
L:  The only other requirement is you have to get a -- a -- it's -- it's a daily email log.
R:  Aha.
L:  I mean, you'll probably get fifty to one hundred emails a day.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it's worth it because you'd miss something if you didn't.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] That's the only thing, but that's about to change.
R:  Oh, all- --  
L:  Everything's going to go on one board and you'll have to go to the new board -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to, uh, you know, view --
