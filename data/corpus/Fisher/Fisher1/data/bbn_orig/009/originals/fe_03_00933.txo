R:  Hi, my name is Jay.
L:  Hi, ah, my name is Lynn.
R:  Hi, Lynn.  Ah, yeah, [LIPSMACK] well, my opinion on the, um, [NOISE] um, inspectors in Iraq is that, um, I just got to finish listening to the Presidential address and I kinda agree with him that [NOISE] the, um, inspectors -- if -- if Saddam really wants to disarm he would take the inspectors and take all his weapons or whatever he has and then in a parking lot and just destroy everything right there in front of them.  But he hasn't done that and it's taken them twelve years just to disarm.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  That is true.  As far as, you know, that he should have already done it before but, um, [MN] I don't know.  I -- I -- I guess I'm just so nervous about the whole thing that I [COUGH] I hope that the arms inspectors certainly know what they're doing.  I mean, I -- I'd really hope that they do and assuming that they do, um.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think that they, ah, actually know what they're doing and that he's not getting away with --
R:  Well [LIPSMACK] --
L:  -- some kinda deceiving?
R:  I think Saddam's dece- -- um, deceiving them by moving, um, his weapons around, you know, when the inspectors supposed to be at this place, you know, they move stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  The- the- they move the stuff to a diff- -- you know, they just moving it all around to, you know, play the cat and mouse game with the inspectors.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and then, you know -- and you know, everything that I'm saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm going off what the President is telling me so, you know, who's to say if that's the truth but --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- he's also said, President Bush I'm talking about, he's also said that, um, the scientists have been bugged, so when they interview these scientists, you know, they don't say anything, ah, you know, against Saddam 'cause they'll be killed or their families will be killed.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I, um, [LIPSMACK] I know.  I mean, i- i- it's like, ah, you gotta read all the papers and -- and like you we watch the -- the President, listen to him speak, watch all the news.  And I just wonder how much of it -- it is -- is for -- is truth and how much of it is just, um, stuff that they've fabricated to make it look better or ...  I -- I don't know, I mean, it's so hard to pick and choose I guess.  And like you say, he's our President and I guess we're supposed to believe what he says is true, and I certainly hope so but --
R:  Well, I hope they're sharing the intelligence that they so call have that they're not telling us --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- with the inspectors --
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, and i- if that's true then why haven't the inspectors been able to, you know, go into these so called places that the United States knows where these biological weapons are?  Why haven't they just gone straight directly to those places?  And maybe they have gone to those places and, like I said earlier, you know, Saddam's playing the cat and mouse game and he's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, moving the weapons out of the pl- -- the places where the United States, you know, know they're -- they're there that one day but, yo- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the next day they're in a different place.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Well, there was that incident too where apparently, before all this started to happen there was a cargo ship or whatever, some type of, uh, ship like that, that -- that was seen leaving the country or that area of the country, and so the ports have been, you know, like --
R:  Yeah, I remember that.
L:  -- what was on it?  Do you remember that?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's kind of -- it's kind of scary because, you know, a lot of people can certainly suffer but, ah, yeah, I don't know.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Well, I pray for Bush 'cause he has a tough decision to make 'cause the world's not u- united, you know, against this, uh, with this.
L:  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I know, during this --
R:  But he's determined.  He's, like, you know, we gonna do it with or without UN --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, um, [LIPSMACK] approval.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I know.  And then y- -- well, you know, I guess it's -- it's also bad too because then the other countries and that are [NOISE] not against us, but against what we're, you know, supposedly gonna do here.  And it just makes a rift between all the other countries, so it all kind of snowballs down or around all the other countries and the whole world.  I mean, it's [NOISE] a terrible thing but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you know wh- -- do you know what, um, countries make up the inspecting team?  Is it -- yo- -- do you know that?
L:  [MN] All the different countries?
R:  I'm asking if you know the -- the particular co- -- um, countries that represent the, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- inspector team?
L:  [LIPSMACK] The inspection team?  You know, I don't know that off hand.
R:  I know they're --
L:  I -- I -- I thought it was --
R:  I know there are no Americans on that team.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really?  [LAUGH] Um, I thought it was, um, representative of the UN, um, of all the different countries that are in the UN.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, [NOISE] you know, I might have read that once [LAUGH] upon a time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when they first went out but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I didn't know that.
L:  I don't -- yeah, pretty ri- -- I -- I do believe so.  Um , [NOISE] yeah, I don't know.  But, uh, [SIGH] the other thing too, I was kinda just hoping tha- -- of course I know he won't now because he said he wouldn't, was that Ira- -- Iraq [LIPSMACK] -- that, um, Saddam Hussein would just, like, leave the country, you know, and go into exile or something to save his hide but, ah --
R:  I don't even see that happening.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right, wouldn't that have been great.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But then on the other hand I -- we would never have found him probably, kinda like Bin Laden, you know, you'd never find him either so ... 
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, um --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  [MN]
R:  What was I going to say?  I was going to say something about the inspectors.
L:  Um.
R:  Will we need to send those same inspectors over there to South Korea?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that's another thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  There's -- there's always something any more.  Of course I guess there always has been it just seems like it's worse 'cause we hear about it so much.
R:  Well and then --
L:  You know.
R:  And then September eleventh brought it closer to home so ...
L:  Right, right.  Absolutely, absolutely.  Yeah, I wouldn't want to be any of those inspectors.  That's -- I mean, that's gotta be a horrible job.  I --I can't even imagine --
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I --
L:  -- you know, trying to do that.  Jeeze.
R:  I wonder what --
L:  Poor people.
R:  -- the salary is on that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really.  [LAUGH] Not enough.
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's like -- yeah, and then -- and then you're -- like, nobody likes you no matter what you do, [LAUGH] you know, if you find it you're in trouble and if you don't you're -- you know, I don't know.
R:  Well Saddam making sure they don't find anything, you can best believe that.
L:  Yeah, you don't think he will at all?
R:  [MN] Se- -- and see -- okay, now he's all of a sudden, he's -- he's, ah, destroying these missiles that he so called didn't have.  Now he has them, okay?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, wow, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So now we go to war, you know?  He's gonna use those biological weapons that he so called didn't have.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Well, we don't want him to do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, we don't want him to do that but --
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
R:  Because I'm afraid of what Bush is gonna do after that 'cause he's -- I've heard him say that if Saddam decides to use his chemical weapons [MN] during the war that he will, um, have to suffer the consequences, so I don't know what that means, but it's [MN] -- he left it open for something terrible. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Was he on today?  Ah, you were saying that you -- you listened to him today?
R:  Yeah, he was on today.
L:  Whoops.
R:  You -- yeah --act- --
L:  I didn't even hear it.
R:  Yeah, it was a special -- it was a special report came on at eight o'clock --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- and h- -- and the reporters asked him different questions.  They asked some good questions and, ah, he -- he just, um, answered.  I -- I think Bush did a good job of answering the questions but there is a lot of people in this company -- I mean not company -- this country --
L:  Country.
R:  -- that -- that think that he should be dealing more with the economy than, you know, Saddam Hussein.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well, yeah, sure.  'Cause they're worried about right here, at what's going on at home, I know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I know.  Oh, I'm sorry I missed that tonight.  I haven't even had the news on which is unusual, but I would've liked to have heard that.  [MN] But, uh, I'm sure it'll be on.  Maybe it's on CNN --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or something.  I can catch him there.  But, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hopefully they'll get to an end and --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- just be done with it quickly and before anybody gets hurt more than they already have. [MN]
R:  [MN] Now this -- you know how long this conversation's supposed to last?
L:  Ten minutes and according to my clock it's been nine.  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Okay.  My -- according to mine it's been ten.
L:  Oh, it has been ten?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was wondering if th- -- if it was gonna --
R:  I got a timer on my --
L:  -- come in and interrupt or --
R:  Yeah, this is my second time doing it and it's never interrupted.
L:  Oh, it is your second?  Okay, this is my first and I'm, like, ah, I don't know what's going on, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right, well, it was nice talking with you --
L:  Great.
R:  -- it was good conversation.
L:  Well, it was nice talking with you too, sir.
R:  Take it easy.
L:  You take care, mhm.
