L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Cathy.
L:  Hi, my name's George.  I do watch reality occasionally.  Um, I think people watch it because it's something they can't do.  Takes 'em out of the realm of everyday life.  [MN] Um, they don't have to worry about paying the bills, watching the kids or anything else.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I only watch it if my guys are watching it and I can't escape.
L:  [LAUGH] You can't?
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  Oh, because they're going, "Ra, ra, ra"?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, because the sound will follow me wherever I go.  Um, [MN] I think they're, um, staged.  [LAUGH] And -- and even if they're not, they're still incredibly stupid. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I ah, don't really watch it.  You know, I flip through 'em.  They keep -- [several inaudible words] I -- I kinda keep in touch with it --
R:  Uh, huh.
L:  But I don't sit there and watch the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I do think it's kind of, like, how can they get all these ratings?  You know, I don't understand.  What are people doing?
R:  Oh, I -- I think it's what you said that, um, it's exciting, it's something that they can't do.  Um, but what I can't understand is why people are so willing to be totally exposed or for people to believe things that are, um, shown on the shows, because you know people believe that that's true.  You know, it's kind of like, um, [LIPSMACK] Jerry Springer and some of the other talk shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  But those people are compensated for that.  So --
L:  [MN] Well, I -- I don't understand how -- I don't understand that.  You know, are people that naive or are they just that bored, or are they just thirsty for something that -- I don't know, I don't get it.
R:  Well, television is --
L:  I'd rather watch Leave It To Beaver. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm serious. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Me too.
L:  It's down to earth, ah, you know --
R:  It tells a story.
L:  [MN] You know, it's -- yeah, it's got a -- something behind it, it's not, ah, you know, if you watch -- if you watch the shows do you see any people that are forty years old, ah, overweight, um, you know, have regular, ah, work at Ford Manufacturing?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, is there any background for that?  I -- you know, it's like, "So it's all a fantasy thing".  And I would have to agree with what you said.  It's got to be staged.  You know, I -- I can't imagine that, well, maybe nobody else goes and -- and tries to get on the show except the most beautiful people in the world, um, you know?  If like -- where do they -- where do they come up with this?
R:  Yeah, it isn't --
L:  Ar- are they the only ones that go there?
R:  I don't think it's real reality TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, how realistic is it, um, like the millionaire thing?  I haven't seen any of the episodes but you can't avoid --
L:  Was it that, Joe Millionaire?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You can't avoid hearing about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And h- how likely is it that a group of women are going to vie for the attention -- I mean, a whole group of women are going to vie for the attention of a single man, you know, in a concentrated situation like that?  That i- -- that just isn't realistic.  You -- you're around lots of other people all the time.
L:  Well, why do people watch it?
R:  Oh, why do they watch it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man.  I think it's like you said, I think it's just escapism.  You know, it's kinda like --[LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's got to be.  I'm thinking, I'm watching this Joe Millionaire and he's going, "Ah, yeah, I really like you but, hey --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you know, my hair's still a little damp but, ah ..." you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Was it really that bad?
L:  And this was -- you know, I'm just flipping.  I never watched the show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All I had to do was listen to the radio on the way to work -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause there was an update on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  And then I saw the guy and he was like, "Oh, yeah, well, I hate to tell you this but I'm not a millionaire".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What was our first clue?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's like, "Okay, well, you know, [MN] maybe you owned a construction company down in Texas, hell, I don't know".
R:  Yeah.  I do think people watch it though because they're -- they're looking to escape whatever.  I mean, I know people who will sit and watch anything, ah, on television, or -- or what I would consider nothing, just because it's an easy way to zone out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- it's relaxing to them because it -- it fills their brain and they don't have to think.
L:  Yeah, they don't have to think about anything else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't have to think about their work or, you know, if they're a supervisor they don't have to think about, "Well, this person did this.  Now I've got to go over to Human Resources and do this with them and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, I always get knocked all the time because I don't watch sports.  [MN] I don't watch TV.  I mean, I do watch TV but I don't sit there for three hours, you know, I have other interests.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  You know, like I'll paint, or I'll work on a model car, or just something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, play with my son or whatever.  [MN] But you always get knocked for that because it's like, "Well, you know" and you feel like odd man out or odd woman out because you're not watching KU Basketball.
R:  [MN] Right.  You're not keeping up with what's going on, um, what's the latest and greatest thing that's on television.  But, hey, I just prefer to be out of the loop.  I -- I -- I really don't have time to watch television myself.  I'm usually, ah --
L:  What?
R:  -- wo- working. [LAUGH]
L:  How can people watch TV like that?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  If you're always working and I'm always working, who's watching TV?
R:  I don't know that.  Uh, well -- you know, I -- i- it's -- it's hard to say.  I -- there're a lot of things that, um [MN] that people talk about on -- on television an- and it's like they get consumed with it, [MN] with these reality shows.  It's not just that they watch it once in a while or in passing, you know, while they're looking for something else or maybe between commercials or whatever.  I mean, there are people who are almost like they're addicted to these things.
L:  Well, they are.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's -- a -- a reality show is sports also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but people don't -- you know, a reality show is a +sport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's football, basketball.  Um, it could be, ah, you know, Survivor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Joe Millionaire.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, those were the ones that I thought of immediately.  I didn't think about sports, I guess.
L:  But -- but they are, if you think about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, they're more real than the false situations.  I mean, at least we know we're watching a real game with a real outcome and there's --
L:  But, hey --
R:  -- a score and --
L:  But those are real -- tho- those are real situations.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I hadn't thought about sports.  I'd thought about other talk shows.
L:  All the other stuff, you know, it's just like the talk shows and everything else, they're all supposed to be real situations.
R:  I'll tell you what's really scary is, that our news, ah, newscasts have taken on that reality TV flavor.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, it's -- it's -- they've become so, um, enamored of having to entertain people when they deliver the news that -- that I feel like I don't get, um, real honest to gosh news.
L:  What do you get out of the news?
R:  Oh, what do I get?  U-
L:  Yeah, what do you get out of the news?
R:  Oh, n- nothing.  I stopped watching.  I don't watch television news.  I get all of my news, ah, from radio driving back and forth to work.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah.  I am.  I'm forty five minutes in the car, ah, one way and, um, I figure they can give me all the -- the headlines, you know, on the hour and on the half hour, because when I watch television news they've turned it into realit- reality TV.  They sensationalize everything and they editorialize all the time.
L:  So, essentially, the question was, "What are reality shows?"  And we've come to the conclusion that reality shows just aren't what's on TV, that they say Joe Millionaire, Survival.  Everything is now turning into a r- reality show.  Live sports ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  News ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Program TV's which are supposed to be true --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- live reality.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So all of those things are a way for everybody to escape.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why people can sit there and watch MBA basketball on cable TV, and you have seventeen stations to choose from and you can pay for it, and you can sit there and watch that all day long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a reality TV.
R:  It's scary.  It makes me think of Foreign -- Fahrenheit Four Fifty One.
L:  Oh, my God, no!  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You know, where the people just -- they had the big wall TV and they just watched that all the time, no matter -- I mean, you know, it was their news and their entertainment and all that sort of thing was all mixed, or alter- alternated.  And -- and they watched that all the time.  They didn't get their information from any other source.
L:  Right.
L:  And it became so, so real, they were so dependent on that, it told them what to think and feel.  And -- and to some extent I think there are a lot of people who are -- who are living that way.  And the really scary part is, I don't think they realize it.
L:  Y- -- d- -- so you don't -- y- y- you don't think reality TV is really real?
R:  No, no.
L:  You don't think that whe-
R:  I think news is a real reality show.  I think sports are a real reality show.  The other ones, I think are fictionalized.  I think they're staged.  I think they're planned.  Um, I -- I think it's all about the bottom line.  It's all about the money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, show me the money.  And to s- some extent, y- you know, news and some of the other shows are -- are that way too.  If the -- if the news cast is not making the ratings then they can't attract the commercial, ah, support and, you know, they go down in the ratings and then the -- the network suffers.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so they have to find a way to bring the viewers back to their particular TV show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, talk about not seeing anybody over forty and unfit.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah,  no kidding.
R:  I mean, Jiminy Christmas.
L:  Yo, isn't that true?  Yeah, that -- th- that's true.  That -- it's -- it's -- it's so true.
R:  Well, and at the risk of sounding sexist, you know, we are a
