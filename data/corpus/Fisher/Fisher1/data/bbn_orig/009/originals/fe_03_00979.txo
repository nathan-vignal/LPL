L:  Hi, I'm Allison.
R:  Hi, I'm Audrey.
L:  Hi.  So who -- do you want to go first or should I?
R:  You can go first.  Go ahead.
L:  Okay, thanks.  Basically I just got an email a couple of days ago about bioterrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it made me feel a little bit more comfortable because it was talking about how the reality of anything doing as much damage as the media is portraying is pretty slim.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So that made me feel better and as far as like subway attacks that have happened in the past, most of the people didn't die.  There's so many ways to protect yourself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it still scares me a whole lot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Actually out of all of them, that scares me the most.
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm originally from Manhattan.
L:  Oh.
R:  Actually twenty blocks from the World Trade Centre.
L:  Oh my God. 
R:  And I watched the original World Trade Centre attacks, so -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- it brings things home, you know. 
L:  For you, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  In fact, my old building is right on the cover of one of the books.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  Of September eleven. 
L:  Wow, that is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's got to be horribly disturbing.
R:  So this is close to home but that's one of the things that really scares me and I think that's because it's insidious, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's not something you can really see.
L:  Right.
R:  Not that you could stop a bullet or a bomb, but -- 
L:  But with anthrax and all those things, I mean that -- those people were just opening mail and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, where are you?
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Okay.  I actually went to Ohio State for one year. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, we're up at -- by Cleveland.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Florida, in Miami. 
L:  Oh, lucky you.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's so nice.
R:  How -- what's the weather there?
L:  Actually today was like the first day of sun for a long time.
R:  Oh.
L:  We had -- we beat Seattle out for the most cloudy days. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But there's snow starting to melt, well -- is it in the seventies there? 
R:  It's eighty six. 
L:  Oh.
R:  It's a little bit very -- it's very hot.
L:  I bet, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have kids?  
R:  No, I have two cats.
L:  Oh.
R:  How about you?
L:  I am pregnant and I have a two year old.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  So-- 
R:  Well, congratulations.
L:  Thanks.  But so then I'm paranoid about all kinds of germs especially -- 
R:  You are?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So have you heard any new -- news updates or anything?
R:  Actually, I was just watching the news and they were just going back and forth about the Security Council and it's very frustrating.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if -- are you pro war or ...?
L:  I -- I'm definitely not pro war. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I know we have to protect ourselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whatever we -- it's kind of hard.  I mean, I'd much rather us not have to do that especially, you know, right now at any time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's kind of like if we don't do anything, I don't know what's going to happen either.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, part of my background is I've worked in law enforcement, I'm a therapist.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So there's a lot of criminal thinking involved here.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and I also know a lot of, um, federal people who deal with terrorism and stuff.
L:  Uhuh.
R:  So you put the two together and you have to act.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's how I feel.  I know I'm, you know, totally to one side.
L:  Yeah.   
R:  But ... 
L:  It's horrifying.  It's funny because I was a flight attendant for eight and a half years.
R:  Oh my God. [LAUGH] 
L:  So we're both like in the same, like, I'm the airplane aspect, that's so funny. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, and that in itself, I mean, I would have -- I actually was on maternity leave um, planning on quitting when September eleven happened. I was supposed to --
R:  Uhuh. 
L:  My daughter was born December of two thousand and my maternity leave goes up December of two thousand and one and I -- if she had -- hadn't been born and I wasn't going to stay home with her, I would have quit. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Because flying isn't what it used to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's just too close to home.
R:  Oh, this -- it's amazing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who did you fly for?
L:  Continental.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So my husband's a pilot too, so for me I absolutely really had to quit 'cause somebody had to stay home.
R:  Aha.
L:  And he's still flying.
R:  So he's still flying, how does he feel about all that?
L:  He -- well, I mean, he -- there's been so many crazy things that happen.  I've had situations even where I had a passenger with a loaded gun on one of my flights. 
R:  Uhuh.
L:  And so weird things do happen. 
R:  Uhuh.
L:  But I mean, the security -- it's like now with all the talk about possibly carrying weapons, he's a co captain.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you know, the possibility of some of those guys carrying guns and the cockpit doors are so sealed now, and -- but I mean, it's his job and he's got to do it.
R:  Mhm.  You're -- you're very close to it too then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Amazing.
L:  Yeah, I know, isn't that funny?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  To get two people who, you know, have -- 
L:  Both sides of -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, just experiencing it.
L:  The whole thing, right, of being able to relate to those people, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Well, tell him, you know, I feel for him and, um -- 
L:  Thanks.
R:  You know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what to say.  You don't say "Good luck" to somebody like that.
L:  No, but I mean, but then I think of all the people who are fire fighters who are, you know, nats[?] they have to be in the scariest place because I mean as an airline pilot, like me and my husband have to deal with it, but that's only one aspect of what they can do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, police officers and fire fighters have -- I mean, no matter what they do, they have to be on the scene.
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately a lot of the guys who were in that we knew.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because we had to deal with them, you know, living in that area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that was their job and they would have given, you know, their left leg for it so -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  People do what they love doing.
L:  Exactly, and, yeah, and if -- I mean, thank goodness for those people because what would this world be like if there weren't people dedicated and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  We'd be really in big trouble.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have CMRT teams in Ohio?
L:  Say that again?
R:  CMRT teams?   
L:  No, I haven't -- 
R:  They're community emergency response teams that -- 
L:  I haven't heard of that. I know --
R:  Really?
L:  They're talking about, you know, different plans. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I haven't heard of anything specific like that.
R:  Because that -- they started them here, it's just -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a way for the community to get involved too and my husband and I did that.
L:  Oh that's great.  I should look into that.
R:  It helps you like -- well, you're in -- you know, you're right on the plane and stuff anyway so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You guys are right in the middle of it, but for people -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who have like no sense of control.
L:  Right.
R:  It helps people have a sense of control.
L:  Yeah, just the community I think it helps to talk with other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Because fear -- I mean, it really -- it's like a fog has blit[?] every time they talk about on the news, something coming close to home, and when they were -- we were on high alert and everybody is buying duct tape and vialed water, I mean, it really -- you need to kinda talk to people because otherwise it's the stress levels -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm thinking I'm nervous enough about going through labor again in like with the hospitals who knows what they can do there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, there's just so many things that you could be afraid of day to day.
R:  That's true but at least at the hospital you have security and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm sure they'd beef that up.
L:  And if it's going to happen -- I mean, it's like you think about -- 
R:  Yeah, that's the other side of it.
L:  Yeah.  There's -- you're powerless over it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So why, you know, worry about it? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because there's absolutely nothing you can do.  You can take every precaution but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, when you think about all the people in the World Trade Centre, I mean, they're all angels, they didn't -- they had no idea either.
R:  That's exactly how I think of them.  I mean, we know a few of them.
L:  Wow.
R:  But nobody actually -- family or anything.  Family did work down there.
L:  Wow.
R:  But they didn't, you know, it's just like, um, colleagues of my husband's sisters.
L:  Oh.
R:  Dying, classmates and stuff like that.
L:  I just can't imagine.
R:  I can't imagine that I did go down there. I had to.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah. I had to go to New York for a funeral so I made -- I dragged my mother along down there.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And just stood there with our mouths open.
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  You know.
L:  I can't -- my husband flew over it and that was hard enough to be -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean to be right there, ugh. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's just something I don't think anybody is ever going to get over.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's so scary and you wonder what would make -- what goes through those people's minds. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I know that they're from a whole other world but I can't imagine a human being, isn't that weird?
R:  Thinking -- you mean to hurt all those people?
L:  Right, yes.
R:  Yeah, that's the criminal thinking again.
L:  It's so frightening that people think that way.  Well, and I'm real into, like I watch Law and Order every week and all those shows. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And now Boomtown and I'm thinking how do people -- how -- what makes a person like that?
R:  It's a whole -- it's a ... 
L:  Chemicals and ... 
R:  Yeah, it's actually a form of addictive behaviour but, um -- 
L:  Ugh.
R:  It's hard to explain but it is a whole other way of thinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like I kept saying to someone, you know, they put all the effort we put into leading our daily lives into getting over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On people, you know that term, to get over on people.
L:  Uhuh.
R:  So I guess bin Laden thinks he got over on the US.
L:  Right.
R:  Or something, I don't know.
L:  And that's so sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's going to be interesting in the next year what happens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hopefully next year at this time everything will be peaceful.
R:  Yeah, and your daughter will be born, right or your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said daughter like -- 
L:  It is.
R:  Or son. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I have another daughter coming so -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  Definitely.  My two year old kept saying that it was going to be a sister and we had a -- I actually had to have a few ultrasounds so they confirmed it but it's funny how she just knew.
R:  Ha.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  It's exciting.
R:  Yeah.  So you think you -- you'll go back to flying or ...? 
L:  I don't think so.  Sometimes my husband and I talk about it like when the kids are grown up and, you know, he's flying and I can be a flight attendant.  I -- I --
