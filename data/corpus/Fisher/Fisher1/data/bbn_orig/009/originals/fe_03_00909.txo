R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Yes, my name is Julie.
R:  Hi, I'm Stacey. [COUGH]
L:  Hey.
R:  [LAUGH]  This is the first one of these I've done.  What about you?
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is very strange.
R:  Well, we'll do the best we can. [COUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Let's see, I've got the time here, so I want to make sure that we do this right.
L:  Okay.
R:  All right.  [SIGH] Okay, well, let's talk about it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you watch any of 'em?
L:  Not really.  Once in a while I'll watch the Survivor or something but ...
R:  That's me.  It's by accident if I end up watching it.
L:  Me too.  I don't watch much TV at all.
R:  Really?  Well, I -- I didn't up until my daughter was born about a year ago and she's still what I consider an infant, a toddler --
L:  Oh.
R:  So I'm kind of stuck in the house. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] But I've been watching -- I think it all started with that Real World that was on MTV.  Do yo- you --
L:  Mm.
R:  Are you familiar with that program at all? [MN]
L:  Not really.
R:  It's been around about ten years or so and, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's -- was a kids' television station.  But, ah, [LIPSMACK] I've watched, ah, Bachelor, a few episodes.
L:  [NOISE] I think I watched maybe one of The Bachelorette, right when she was down to picking the last guy or something. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Me too, me too.  I saw her talk with that little baby voice and I thought, "This is not for me".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, which -- which Survivor did you watch?  Do you remember?
L:  [MN] I watched one about a week ago.  [MN] One of the shows.
R:  Okay.  I don't even know which one that is.  I guess it's The Celebrity.
L:  Yeah, that's what's on now is The Celebrity.  I watched about ten minutes of it the other night. [MN]
R:  Yeah, I -- I was, ah, I'm -- I'm just not too thrilled with it.  I don't think it looks very realistic.
L:  No, no, me either.
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean --
L:  I didn't -- I didn't see nothing on Joe Millionaire.
R:  Now, I did watch that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I did watch probably, I don't know, two or three episodes?  I don't watch any of 'em from front to end but [SIGH] I watched about two or three episodes of that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that was -- that was pretty cute.  The women were pretty catty though.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But I would've loved to have gotten the gifts that they got.
L:  Well, I did see on the news afterwards that him and the girl he picked got a half a million dollars, so ...
R:  They did, they did.  I saw that episode.
L:  [MN]
R:  He got a -- [MN] they weren't supposed to get anything.  You know, the las- -- did you see the last episode?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  The last episode, you know, he made his decision and he sent all the [MN] other girls that he didn't want home [SIGH] and then they came out and -- and he had told her just before, you know, "I don't really have any money, I don't have anything".  And he said, you know, "If you can agree to this, you can come back and meet me here in the ballroom" or wherever in the house that they were at.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um [LIPSMACK] and he said, "Then we can decide where we want to go from here".  And so she came back and you know they kind of led you to believe in the movie that she may or may not come back, and when she did, he told her that he really liked her and gave her this great big giant ring.  It was like two carats.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And then the butler, whatever his name was.  Paul Hogan, that was his name.
L:  Oh.
R:  He -- he told them that he was gonna present them both with a surprise that nobody knew about, even -- even the -- the Marriott guy, the Evan guy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so he presented 'em with a million dollar check.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, I mean, they were both just floored.
L:  I saw it on the Today Show or something.  I saw that part of it. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  So -- so where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Paduka, Kentuck- -- well, I'm in Benton, Kentucky, which is in the western part.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Alabama, near the Alabama Georgia line.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Near Columbus, Georgia.
R:  Ha, well, that's -- it's interesting how they grab from all these different places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was just wondering 'cause maybe you get different shows than I get, but I guess these are all nation wide shows.
R:  I think so.  I think so, because [MN] this is, ah -- the first time I stayed on hold quite a while, waiting for -- waiting for them to find me another caller.
L:  Oh, and they didn't find one?
R:  They didn't find one.
L:  Huh, that's --
R:  And then this time it was quite a bit quicker.
L:  I think they called me over here tonight because I had a message.  I think my son had wrote -- well, ah, my kids are older, they're in college --
R:  Right.
L:  And I saw a note [MN] -- note that he had written with a one eight hundred number and it said -- forget the name of this study we're doing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it had that on there, and I said, "Oh, I missed my call".  So maybe you was holding for me. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's automated, no, no, it's [SIGH] -- I think they just start trying to call and --
L:  And whoever they get?
R:  Right, right.  So ...
L:  So where'd you find out about this study at?
R:  I found out about it on, um [LIPSMACK] on one of the mystery shopping --
L:  That's where I found out about it.
R:  Exactly.  So w-
L:  So you do the same thing? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I just started, I just started not too long ago, so ...  And I thought -- I thought, "Well, why not sign up?"
L:  I figured it doesn't hurt if [MN] -- if you don't get paid, you [MN] -- you know, if you do it's good.
R:  Yeah, and if you don't, you're not out anything.
L:  If you don't, you've wasted ten minutes of your time, that's all.
R:  Yeah.  Really.  So ...
L:  But I saw it on the same place.  I've been doing that type of shopping for about two years now so ...
R:  Oh, really?  Do you stay busy?
L:  Not really.  It's not that much around here.  I -- sometime I can get anywhere between twenty and forty a month.
R:  Oh, that's quite a few.  I work a full time job, so I don't work ...
L:  Oh.  I work full time too, but I -- but, see, I -- I have to drive a long ways to get to work, so I try to get something that I can just stop on, on the way home.
R:  Oh, that would be perfect.
L:  So I'm not [MN] -- so I'm not going out just to do that.
R:  Right, ri- -- yeah, if you were going just to do it, you couldn't.
L:  [MN] If -- to me, it wouldn't be worth it anyway.
R:  They need to make a reality show about mystery shoppers.
L:  Yeah, that would interes- [LAUGH]
R:  Wouldn't it be funny?  It would be so funny.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 'Cause that's what we're supposed to be talking 'bout anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah [LAUGH].  We can talk about how funny that would be.  [LAUGH]  I know mine would be, because I feel like Inspector Gadget when I go in.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  I'm hiding behind this and looking out behind that and --
L:  Es- especially the grocery stores.
R:  I haven't done a grocery store yet.  There haven't been any offered in my area.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I've heard that those are pretty good but they're rather in depth.
L:  They -- they're good 'cause you gotta go shopping anyway, but ...
R:  Right.  I've done a co-
L:  But to try to get all those names, [MN] I have trouble reading name tags.
R:  Oh, well.  Let me tell you, I did a casino.  My goodness.
L:  Oh.  That must have been interesting.
R:  It was interesting, but I- -- like I say, it was -- it was very, very difficult.
L:  Mm.
R:  And you had to have eight different names.  [MN] And, ah, the only place you can write anything down is in the bathroom in the stall.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm telling you, it'd make the perfect TV show.  It'd be a comedy.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it would be. 
R:  It would be a comedy because [LAUGH] I was run- -- I bet I went to the bathroom sixteen times --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for eight different names.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R: But, I mean, it paid unbelievably well.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, it was ninety dollars --
L:  I-
R:  -- for about an hour and a half.
L:  And where was it at?
R:  It was in Metropolis, Illinois.
L:  Oh, they [MN] gamble out there?
R:  They have one of the boats, right.
L:  Oh, on the boats.
R:  Right.
L:  Tha- -- I bet that was interesting.
R:  It was, it was, so ...  I liked it quite a bit.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And then I did one of the carpet cleaning shops in the house, you know, where it's just the reimbursement?
L:  Oh, I haven't --
R:  But I needed the -- I needed the carpet cleaning anyhow.
L:  Yeah, and if they come into your house ...
R:  It was wonderful.  It was wonderful.  That was through Sears.
L:  Oh, I would --
R:  But that guy showed up.  [MN] Like I say, here we have another comedy.  That guy showed up and in my paper work it said that it'd be two people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and that I wouldn't have to do anything.  This man showed up by himself.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then they are not supposed to dump the waste water, and he dumped it right out on the driveway.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, I'm telling you.  I mean, he did a really good job, and we live on a farm so it wasn't a huge big deal, but still ...
L:  It's just the idea if they're not supposed to do it.
R:  Right, and you know.  And you know what they are and aren't supposed to do before they ever get here.  You know, because you've got the insider information.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so ... [MN]
L:  Well -- well, the grocery stores are a little easier because you've got to write a shopping list anyway.  You can pretend you're writing your shopping list. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that would be good.
L:  So i- -- that he- -- that helps out.
R:  I've seen some Winn-Dixies, you know?
L:  Yeah, those are the ones I use [inaudible].
R:  See, we don't have any Winn-Dixies up here.
L:  Oh.
R:  Not -- not in my end of the state.  So that kind of puts me --
L:  [MN]
R:  That kind of puts me in a bind there.  But, uh ...
L:  I guess we better get on topic [LAUGH] before they cut us off.
R:  No doubt.  Now, what else can we say about it?
L:  Well, it would be g- -- a good reality show to do the mystery shopping.
R:  It would be.  It would, because I would be more than happy to be on the cast.
L:  [LAUGH] Me too.
R:  [LAUGH] Especially if it paid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  Well, actually I just came back from doing one at a restaurant with my son.  [MN] And [MN] I've only been back home for about five minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  So I got lucky to get this call.
R:  Well, let me tell you, if you don't answer, they call every hour.
L:  Oh, I'm glad I answered this.
R:  [LAUGH] I went ahead and I thought, "Well, there's nobody to talk on this topic tonight, because i-
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It- it's not a -- reality TV to me doesn't appeal to anybody much over the age of twenty.  So --
L:  [MN] It -- it doesn't appeal to me at all really.
R:  [NOISE] It doesn't me either.  I'm -- you know, I see it, like I say, I'm at home and I'm kinda trapped here, now, because my daughter's so little and we've had such cold weather, but I'm twenty eight and still I'm not that interested in it.  I watch it and I think, "Why?  Why is so much app-
