L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name is Sheila.
L:  My name's Nathan.
R:  Hi, Nathan.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is a loaded, ah, topic, isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just watching, um, the news, ah, tonight, or the -- oh, I guess it was Oprah I watched, ah, about, ah, Iraq and Saddam Hussein.  So, ah, what is your take on all that's going on?
L:  Well, I'm still a little undecided on it.  Um, [MN] I kind of -- I mean, I do definitely have the -- I don't know, I feel like the US does have a special interest in going over there and making sure that we're not in danger.  The whole idea of the war, though, doesn't really appeal to me.
R:  Ah, I have to agree.  I have to agree.  But I think that the man needs to be taken -- taken out, ah, but, ah, it would be nice if it could be done without a war.
L:  Right.  I --
R:  Um, he, ah, you know, like, he's a -- a dictator where there's a lot of people and if they do anything wrong they get killed so --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- there's no- -- they can't mount much of a -- of a, ah, [NOISE] protest or -- ah, h- [MN] he's got such control of them.  So -- so what do you do, you know?  Like I -- I really don't think that -- I really don't think that Iraq is a threat and I think using that, ah, the [NOISE] World Trade Center and Osama is probably not -- ah, I mean, that's just, ah, a good excuse, I guess, to go back in and finish what should have been finished in the first place.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's, uh, I c- -- I agree with that.  Um, I do see some of the threat as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know for me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not necessarily that Iraq intends to attack the United States because that was -- I mean, the retribution that he would receive for that, ah, would just be -- you know, more than he would be wanti- -- I think more than he would want to take on.  But, er, the threat that I see there is if he is, you know, developing the -- the weapons of mass destruction, um, ah, the, ah, possible sale t- -- of those to terrorist factions whether he is necessarily involved in -- okay, and I mean, I really don't have an opinion on that, haven't seen any evidence to show necessarily that he is or not.  But, um, I per- -- I personally don't think that he would have any qualms about selling those to terrorist groups --
R:  Oh, for sure --
L:  -- who would be willing to use those.
R:  -- for sure not, yeah.  Tha- that's -- that's true.  That's true, but it just seems like there could be a better way of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of accomplishing what he wants to accomplish.  [inaudible]
L:  I've actually been --
R:  You know?
L:  Are you there?
R:  Yeah, I'm here, I'm -- I'm just moving --
L:  Kinda breaking up.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm moving.  I've got a -- a hand held phone --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I'm moving around.  I have -- I was over in another building when the call came and I had to run over and get my PIN number.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah, I -- there was somebody else that was -- I -- I don't know that a lot of people -- i- i- it bothers me that a lot of Christian people are, you know, out for -- for blood.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I just don't see that as, uh, um, really the way it should be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, oh --
L:  Like, I don't know, I see part of it as being -- I mean, we hear about the things that he does and again we don't have a whole lot -- at least I haven't seen a lot of evidence, just kind of rumors about, you know, the mass graves and the weapons testing that he does over there, biological weapons testing and things on, you know, on his own people.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't really know, you know, how much of that is true and how much of that is just sensationalism.  Um, but if -- if part of that is true then I do kind of see a -- I mean, I -- like a need -- moral need and ethical need.  Um, I don't know if I want to say it's a Christian need because, ah, Christianity tends to be much more passive than -- than anything.
R:  Yeah?  What Christians have you been talking to?  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess the ideal --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- maybe that's what I'm thinking.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Christ Himself was, ah --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you know, like, I get a lot of them quoting from the bible that, ah, you know, that that's the thing to do.
L:  Right.
R:  To go over there and wipe him out but, ah --
L:  It's funny now that I mention that I think about the -- the best passive, you know, ideal that I've ever seen was Gandhi --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who, you know, Hindu, rather than Christian.  Maybe it's -- [LAUGH] anyway ...
R:  Yeah, well bas -- uh, yeah.  The --
L:  My, ah, my personal opinion, I was thinking about this the other, like earlier this week, you know, like, what would be a better way than to -- of going in there rather than just starting a war?  And, um, my feelings on it were that the only really way if we could reach Osama or, ah, Saddam Hussein, ah, was just to, you know, stop importing oil which would create -- I mean, a -- a need for -- in complete unity within the United States to stop using oil to the extent that we have been, ah, you know, enough to get by with the exports we can get from Venezuela or some of the other Arab countries that we don't feel so hostile towards.
R:  Well, my thing is, is why not, ah, develop alternative, ah, other alternative powers and -- and, uh --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- and -- and, also -- or if, um -- [LIPSMACK] I didn't mean power but, ah, s- -- you know, sources for, um, electricity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like the -- [COUGH] there's, um -- ah, I've -- I've seen things on the, um, the Internet, ah, that, um, ah, I don't know if you ever heard of, ah, Nikolai, ah, Nik- Nikola Tesa- -- Tesla?
L:  Ah, no, I don't think so.
R:  No?  Well, he -- he was, um, he was kind of an eccentric, uh, inventor who, um, ah, thought of -- I -- I guess he was the inventor of DC power.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he felt that, uh, direct current was better than, um, alternating current and Edison had a bigger, ah, following.  I think it was Edison and so y- -- and had, you know, people of, uh, with money and power behind him so that was the one that was developed.
L:  Mm.
R:  And [COUGH] so, uh, and, you know, to me, um, [MN] I just -- I look at it and I think that, ah, the United States needs to, ah, you know, to maybe pull back.  Like th- -- her- here's another scenario that's very scary about all of this, is here are all of these troops over [MN] in the Gulf ready to -- to go, ah, and, you know, take out Hussein and yet, um, you know, there's this problem with Korea and then there's the problem in the Philippines.
L:  Right.
R:  Plus all of the other things that the United States has got their nose stuck into and, um, ah, you know, is there enough to, um, to go around?  You know, are there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- enough troops?  Is there enough manpower?  And then -- and then there's, uh, the, uh, obligation to, um, support this country if -- if they, ah, you know, if -- if Bush acts unilaterally.  [COUGH]  So that's, um, you know, is -- is this the -- the way to -- to bankrupt the US and to break it, is by spreading -- you know, because it's like the old saying, um, let's see now, what is that?  Ah, [MN] "Toge- --" oh, let's see, "Divided --" no, what is that one?
L:  I don't know.
R:  You never heard that quote?
L:  Something about spreading yourself too thin, is that [inaudible].
R:  Well, yeah, th- that part, but there's the one, ah, um, about, ah, "Together we stand, divided we fall".
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So ... [NOISE] and then -- and that -- I mean that -- you can still be divided in a common interest but if you're -- I mean, to -- um, together in a common interest but if you're spread out too thin then that's as bad as not -- not agreeing.  So I kinda wonder about that, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] I don't know, um, it's, ah -- did you watch that, um, interview that Dan Rather did with him?
L:  No, I -- I didn't.  I didn't hear about it until after it was over.
R:  Yeah.  Well, th- -- I didn't get to see the interview, I just saw today, um, what, ah -- on Oprah they talked to Dan Rather and he was talking about how, ah, he figures he won the -- the -- the war in ninety because he, um, because h- he's still alive.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, I guess it depends on what your -- what your goals are at the end of that.
R:  Yeah.  So he figures that he's going to, um, that no matter what happens he's still going to be, ah, standing when it's all said and done.
L:  Mm.
R:  But how -- I -- what I -- what boggles my mind is how can somebody do, th- -- you know, [MN] do the, um, things that he's done, perpetrate the atrocities that he has upon the people, on his -- his own people, and, um -- that he's supposed to be protecting?  A- -- how c- --how can he, ah, you know, like, uh, th- -- that kind of mentality is just -- oh, I can't -- I c- -- it's hard for me to fathom.
L:  Right.
R:  Because it's just, um [MN] just like, for why?  I -- I like
