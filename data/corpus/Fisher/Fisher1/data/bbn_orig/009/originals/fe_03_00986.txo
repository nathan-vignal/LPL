R:  Ah, this is Snow. 
L:  I'm sorry, what was your name? 
R:  Snow. 
L:  Snow?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  My name is Wanda.
R:  Wanda. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  How are you doing today? 
L:  I am doing quite well.  How are you doing?
R:  Ah, nervous about this call. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  First time I've done it. [LAUGH] 
L:  My first time, too.
R:  Okay.  [inaudible] 
L:  So, we don't need to be worried, we can just relax and talk.
R:  Yes.  Do you think Hussein will use bioterrorism on the troops? 
L:  I really have mixed emotions because I really don't believe that, ah, you know, it will do any good to have any kind of a war.  It never does.
R:  No. 
L:  It never solves any problems.
R:  I agree with you on that. 
L:  I don't know, I just see that, ah, the problems still remain, sometimes they take on a new name, but basically we don't accomplish anything by going to war except killing off our people.
R:  Yes. 
L:  And I think that is a wrong thing to do.  Do you have --
R:  Well, do you have any idea as wha like they said what we could do to prevent it, the attacks on the US or either our troops? 
L:  I don't really think it would make any difference for us to try because I don't feel that, you know, Bin Laden, it would give us that opportunity and he's not out in the open where we can talk to him and try to reach a compromise.  What do you think?
R:  Well, personally I think that, ah, like you said, no matter what we do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that, uh, if we ever attack Iraq, that he's going to use it. 
L:  Right.
R:  It's not going to accomplish anything but he's going to use it, and as far as trying to prevent it here in the United States or either what we could do with it, they say use, uh, plastic, the duct tape and all --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- I don't see where that would do anything -- 
L:  Do you think -- 
R:  -- because you still have to live. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And once you take the duct tape and the plastic down or either go outside, then you've defeated everything you you know. 
L:  Do you think we are going to be at war over there or do you think that the United States is going to be attacked over here and we would have problems here?
R:  Oh, definitely.  If we ever attack over there they're going to hit us here. [PAUSE] I don't see --  
L:  Are you real worried about that?
R:  -- any way out.  I worry about it.  I have a son that's a career marine. 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Uh.  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, and where do you live?  You sound like you're from the south.
R:  I'm at Alabama. 
L:  Alabama? 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  But, um, as I said, I don't see any way out of it. 
L:  No.
R:  If Hussein doesn't get us to me, in my opinion Korea will, so we're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going to have a war no matter what. 
L:  Well, I think that is unfortunate, but I really do think that's where we're headed.
R:  But terrorism, especially with the germ warfare, all that, there's nothing you can do to prepare for it. 
L:  No.
R:  The anthrax, I mean this has now been proved with [inaudible] when I was four -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  And I don't even think that you can get into any kind of a, uh [MN] like, what do they call those, you know, underground bomb shelters and things like that?  You can't live there, you know -- 
R:  Well, now that, the air still gets to you, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's where it's at. 
L:  So, I guess we're just kind of stuck with it and try to make the best of it and, uh, you know, hope that, um, we do survive and I don't worry about it quite so much.  I worry about it more for other people than I do myself.  Um.  We live in Hawaii and I don't think that that's going to be attacked as readily.
R:  No, I don't think. 
L:  So, I don't worry about it quite so much, but I hate to see any of our troops going in, any of our young, you know, young people going in to fight it because I know a lot of them won't come home and --
R:  This is true. 
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  This is true. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  About the young people.  I mean you got all these -- I talk to my son.  So far he hasn't gone over.  
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  He's been in there, he doesn't have not four more years to go before he retires. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But so far he hasn't been sent over there but he sees all the young guys that's got the babies and the wives and he says it's heartbreaking. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I do have a neighbor who has a son already over there and, um, you know, they've already had to send the family home.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And they're, you know, contemplating I guess closing down the embassy where he is, at least somewhere in that area and, you know, she's being very guarded as to where he is and what's going on because he can't tell her very much. 
R:  No.  No. 
L:  And so it's hard to know but you just know that, you know, that it is not good.
R:  Definitely is not, anything that's going to -- just like w any of the wars we've had, nothing come out of it good. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Yes, we did keep our freedom and that is worth fighting for, no matter what. 
L:  That's true.
R:  And when the guys sign up for the military, like my son said, they know the possibility's there [PAUSE] and he's upset because he hasn't been sent, but [SIGH] come on, give mum a break, I went through Desert Storm with him. 
L:  Yeah.  Do you really kind of hope that they can stay home?  And I do hope that all of them, you know, in the long run will be able to stay home, but I do not see that --
R:  No. 
L:  -- occurring.
R:  I don't. 
L:  And it looks more and more every day like, you know, it will go on.  Um, do you think that there is any kind of a solution at all? 
R:  Personally I don't because there's between Afghanistan and Iraq, Iran, I mean is -- they've done this for years and years, this is their way of life, is fighting, war. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, I just don't see any solution to it.  They're not going to stop because of us. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Living in the United States. 
L:  No, because we differ in our ideas --
R:  That's it. 
L:  -- and a lot of that has to do with either religion or language or geography or, you know, [MN] there's no way we could all agree on the same things because of our history and, you know, our surroundings, our environment, and therefore we will have different, you know, differing opinions.
R:  Well, I don't understand the Islam religion.  I mean I haven't read up on it that much but they they're saying, you know, they're doing it in the name of their religion.  Well, our religion does not teach us to go to war. 
L:  No, but, you know, it doesn't matter which of the religions that you would pick, none of 'em would dictate that, so even basing it on a religion or basing it on politics or, you know, no matter what they're basing it on, it doesn't seem like a good basis for attacking a whole another country or not even being able to work out your differences with them.  You know, the saying "live and let live", it would seem to me would be that you could kind of say, "Okay, you are entitled to disagree with us, just don't try to, you know, pawn your ways off on us" [MN] --
R:  Well, that's just like with the pledge of allegiance and the prayers in school and all this, this is what's happening.  I mean this is our way of life, we've always been that way, but now it offends this religion, it offends this and that, you know, and we can't do it any more, and I disagree with that completely.  If I want to stand up and say the Lord's Prayer I think I have the right as a person, not just an American, to stand up and say it. 
L:  Well, the [inaudible] is their religion and they --
R:  But they are imposing it on us. 
L:  Yes, they are, and that's, you know, where I'm saying they shouldn't.  It should be, you know, the type of thing where they say, "Hey, this is what we believe, that's what you believe, but let's leave religion out of it".  This is more of two countries that should be able --
