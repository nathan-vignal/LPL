R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hi, I'm Peter.
R:  Hi, Peter. [LAUGH]
L:  How're you?
R:  All right.  Um, I'm not really familiar with the reality shows.
L:  Oh, that's like, ah --
R:  I think I -- I'm probably the only person in the United States who has never, ever, seen an episode of Survivor.
L:  Oh, I watched a few of 'em, the first ones --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- and it got a little ridiculous.  Th- the last one I watched was, ah, ah, [MN] Joe Millionaire, I think it's called?
R:  Oh, yeah, see I didn't see that one either.  The only one that I watched is, um, the I- I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.
L:  That was just on.  I -- I -- that seemed a little stupid. [LAUGH]
R:  It was stupid, but [LAUGH] it's stupid but it's -- it's funny.  And it's for charity so it- -- it's different than the other ones, kind of.  A little bit, because they're not trying to, um, you know, just make themselves richer. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I -- I think they're cute.  Well, I like to look at the, er, I like Joe Millionaire because he's like a nice guy and --
R:  Yeah, what happened with that?  I -- did he end up staying with the girl after she found out that he wasn't a millionaire?
L:  Well, ah, it seemed that way but there, I think, I believe there was an article in, ah, TV Guide or something like that who said that they had broken up and they'd --
R:  See, it's funny.  Even though I've never seen the show it's, like, I know what it's about [LAUGH] because it's advertised all over the place, you know, Joe Millionaire. [MN]
L:  Yeah, it's advertised all over the place and, ah, everybody's talking about it and it r- really gets big, big, ah, audiences watching these types of programs.  And m- my daughter-in-law goes, ah, ah, sh- -- you know, she had -- she was out that night, th- the night that he, I think he picked the -- the final girl.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she said, "Oh, you have to tape it for me, you have to tape it for me". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's really, um -- th- th- they're interesting and th- they're doing more and more and more and more.  I guess, soon they'll -- they'll burn that out like they did with the other pro- -- you know like, uh, ah, How Would You Like To Be A Millionaire, you know the, ah --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] Where they ran --
R:  Yeah, it's just another fad that'll pass, I'm sure. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I'm sure it will.
R:  You know, I pro- -- if I probably, like, was whipping through the TV and saw one of them I'd probably end up getting hooked like everybody else.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's the only one I really ever watch, because, um, ah, there were, you know, [MN] good looking young ladies and he -- and he was a [MN] nice looking guy and he looked -- he didn't seem too serious about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A- and you really wanted to know, you know, [MN] all the -- the girls thought, "Hey, this guy's a millionaire" and you can see how they -- they connive and ah ...
R:  Yeah, gold diggers, right?
L:  Yeah, r- really.  And the -- and the one that he picked, uh, wasn't a gold digger and, ah, and --
R:  Oh, see, that's sweet.  I probably would've liked to watch that show.
L:  Well, I'm sure they'll play it again.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  I know my mother is addicted to American Idol, where they --
L:  Oh, there's an -- oh, there's an --
R:  -- they go up and sing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and get insulted by the panel of judges.
L:  Yeah, I -- I guess, ah, that's -- that's a -- a take off on, ah, ah, what was that one with the Englishwoman came over and, ah, she would insult everybody?  Ah, that quiz program was on the same time as --
R:  I -- I don't even know.
L:  -- ah, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?  Another one I've been watching is, ah, You Think You're Hot, or something like that.
R:  Oh, I saw one episode of that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we-
R:  One episode was enough. [MN]
L:  Yeah, well, [MN] you know, maybe I'm -- I'm more, ah ...
R:  Well, you're a male, so ...
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And --
R:  Men like to look at women in bikinis. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  An- an- and then you see some of these ones they pick and they give how, "You're a ten, you're a five, you're a two".  And you're looking at it [MN] -- you know, their heads are up their somethings because some of these people are really, you know, guys or girls, they're really cute and they're very personable and they give 'em mediocre marks and -- and some people, ah, they give good marks and so what are they looking at?  You know, who are they -- you know, who are they looking at?
R:  Well, the one show that I watched, the -- the blond guy on the end seemed to just like everybody. [MN]
L:  Oh, that's -- that's Fer- -- that's -- that's --
R:  It didn't matter if you were pretty or not, he was like, "Oh, yeah, baby, you make me hot" you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's Lamas.  That's, ah --
R:  "I'll give you a nine".
L:  --Fernando Lamas's son, I think.  You know, the guy with the car who used to do the Chrysler commercials?
R:  Oh, I have no idea.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't watch enough TV. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that was a long time ago.  [LAUGH].  He was the guy that was on Fantasy Island.
R:  Fantasy Island?
L:  Remember Fantasy Island?
R:  Yeah, I used to watch that, but I don't remember ...
L:  He was the guy, Mr. whatever he was, the guy with the white suit, with the --
R:  Mr. Riccardo?
L:  That's correct.  That's his --
R:  No.
L:  I mean, that's his father.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That was his father in, ah -- that was a g- -- that was a good pair.  That was, ah, I think Arlene Dahl and Montalban, ah, or Lamas.  I think that they were -- and this is the -- the outcome of th- --of the family.  He- he's a good looking guy. [MN]  Ah, I don't know  about all his tattoos, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess they had to play act a little, too, to be, ah, ah, interesting to the, ah, audience.
R:  Yeah.  I just don't find it all that interesting.  I -- 'cause I always feel bad for the people that get insulted.  You know, but I think a lot of people like to see the other people get insulted, you know?
L:  I th- -- I think you're right.  I -- I think --
R:  It's like watching a car crash, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  You- you're right.  Oh, a lot of people watch, ah --
R:  Morbid curiosity.
L:  A lot of people watch, ah, racing for -- for the crashes, I guess.  That's a s- -- maybe it's the same, ah,  thought process there.
R:  It's the same thing 'cause they know that somebody's going to be humiliated or, you know?
L:  Well, I don't watch it for that, I just li- [LAUGH]
R:  You just like the pretty girls. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess I'm an all American guy, I just want to look at the girls.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I'm sure -- I don't know, I presume a lot of the audience does.  But I think you get a -- a lot of women watching these programs, a lot o- -- a lot of the females.  Ah, I don't kn- -- like -- like you said with the, ah --
R:  Well, for like the marriage shows.  I guess there's -- that's probably, like, you know, like a fantasy thing, you know, like they're gonna meet somebody and he's gonna be rich and handsome and [SIGH] you know, live happily ever after.
L:  Yeah, except one, what was it?  The one with the, ah, conjurers.  She married the guy, or  she was -- [MN] but sh- -- did she marry him?  Or it turned out he was divorced and, ah, [MN] wh- -- the first rea- -- one of the first reality shows where the, ah -- ah, the guy w- was supposed to have been a millionaire and he -- and he married, ah, I think he was marrying her or they were gonna get married to, ah, th-
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They were gonna get married and, ah, I think it came out that he was married before and -- and -- and he had, ah, beaten up on his wife or something [MN] like that.
R:  Oh, lovely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I'm surprised the whole thing didn't die out right there, after such a --
L:  Well it sort of did but then Surv- -- but the Survivor programs kept going.  You know, th- they kept it up and then they s- I don't know.  A- A- Americans s- like, ah, they like this type of programming.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Apparently.  I don't know, I just -- I don't find it that interesting.
L:  Well, yeah.  Well, e- everybody's tr- -- what do you like to watch if you don't like to watch reality programming?
R:  [MN] You know, I really -- I really don't watch TV that much.  The only thing that I'll really, like, stop what I'm doing and turn the TV on for is Buffy The Vampire Slayer. [LAUGH]
L:  I've never watched that program.
R:  Which is like, as far away from a reality [LAUGH] TV show as you can get. [MN]
L:  I've never watched that program.
R:  I watch [NOISE] that and -- and the news, basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's it.
L:  Fox news?
R:  Huh?
L:  Fox news?
R:  No, no, ah, Channel Seven. [MN]
L:  Wha- -- er, what's that?
R:  Channel Seven, um ABC.
L:  ABC?
R:  ABC I think it is.
L:  Where are you located?
R:  [MN] I'm on Long Island and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't have cable, so we don't even get Channel Five, it's just a mess of static for us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that -- that's Fox for us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be Channel Five, so we don't even get that.
L:  It's pretty cold up there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it has been lately, yeah.  We got, like, two feet of snow.
L:  I know.  I -- I was from that area.  But let's get back to reality programming.  But, ah --
R:  I know a lot of people who lik- like to watch, like, the disgusting ones, like Fear Factor ...
L:  I -- I I've never --
R:  Where they make you --
L:  -- watched that [MN] 
R:  -- eat disgusting things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do disgusting things.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, I -- I never watch that and, uh, I think they had the one ti- -- they had a couple where they were, ah, diving off, bungy cording off of something and --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- Bungy roping off.  No, that -- that -- that's -- I'm ju -- I'm very basic.  Just show me the pretty  ladies.
R:  "Just show me the girls in bikinis and I'm happy". [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.  Well, they can wear dresses or whatever they're wearing, you know.  I -- I like pretty people.  I'll put it that way.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] Long as they're pretty.  They don't have to wear bikinis.  And a lot of the pro- -- well, they do come out with some of these weird outfits, I'll tell you that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I guess it perks everybody's interest in, ah -- I guess the producers, you know, want th- the out- -- a lot of the outrageous stuff so -- to get the audience, ah, interested in the programs and the co- -- and to keep watching it.
R:  [MN] Yeah, but do you find, like, any of that interesting?  Or, you know, is it just to -- to look at the people?
L:  I just look at the people, I could turn off the sound. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, well, see [MN] I'm not interested in -- in them bashing anybody.  You know th- the, ah, The, ah, Panel, that has no interest for me.  Ah --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause I think that's the favorite part for most people, you know? 
L:  I think it could be, it could be.
R:  What mean thing is this guy going to say to this person? [LAUGH]
L:  That could be.  You know, maybe I'm missing the program.  [MN] I'll have to watch it again and -- and -- and -- and tune in onto, ah, the nasty comments.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't even
