R:  Hello there.  My name's Carl and you are?
L:  I'm Lisa.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing all right.
R:  Uh.  First time I've participated in this, so it's kinda weird.
L:  Okay, me too. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  So, we're supposed to be talking about this Iraq thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, what's your general take?
R:  You know what?  I keep going back and forth.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- personally I think Bush is pushing to f- fast but, um, Saddam isn't playing the game right either.  [NOISE] How about you? [SIGH]
L:  Well, I said at nine eleven when it first happened that Saddam had his hand in it.  I always believed that he did.  [NOISE] Um, as far as [NOISE] what he has over there and what he's hiding, you know, I listened to Colin Powell and I believe what he reported was accurate.  [MN] Um, but then again I try to think about how they might view us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because we are somewhat arrogant, um, towards the rest of the world.  However I don't know that we should wait and see whether or not he's going to do it.  [NOISE] And I think for the safety of everyone, um, [LIPSMACK] nuclear weapons need to be policed unfortunately.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um ... [MN]
R:  I -- I would agree with you there and, ah, also the, ah, chemical and biological, ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  And that's the problem is, I -- is, I think our government has taken a -- wr- -- a -- a -- ah, how's that?  They don't enough foreign policy experience.  They don't understand how the Europeans think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think instead of constantly pointing it to, um, -- you know, we all know Saddam is playing a game.
L:  Right.
R:  And I saw Colin Powell's speech yesterday too and I -- the whole -- a- as much as I could watch and, ah, I -- I do think, yeah, he's hiding them.  He's -- he definitely has them.  Where he's hiding them is the question mark.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Europeans unfortunately are -- are you f- -- are you familiar with what, ah, Prime Minister Chamberlain did with, ah, Nazis before World War Two?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.  [MN] There was a policy of, [SIGH] ah, of co-operation.  Adolf Hitler took over part of Poland and said, "Oh, I'm just re- recapturing part of Germany, not a problem".  And Chamberlain said, "Oh, yeah, no problem".  And of course that led to World War Two getting out of hand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think the Europeans are being foolish in thinking that this inspection is actually going to yield results --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of the way that they're going about it.  If they put a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- firm deadline and said, "This is absolutely the deadline" they might get results.  But Saddam is playing his game.
L:  Mhm, mm.
R:  And they're playing it with him, unfortunately.
L:  Yeah.  So now it has come to mind, I did think about World War Two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and think about how a lot of people turned the other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cheek so to speak --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- or look the other way and things really got out of hand.  And, [MN] um, there are people over there suffering even right now --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and so, you know, I guess [MN] somebody has to unfortunately be the bad guy or be the policeman --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it looks like it's fallen to us.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I would like to see other countries take a more active role, especially those that are closer to him because they're in a greater danger really, than we are.
R:  Right.
L:  But they don't seem to recognize it.
R:  You're absolutely right an- an- and the, ah, Arabic neighbors to Iraq who are on his side have forgotten he's attacked other Arab countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the past.  In fact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he's attacked two of his neighbors.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Trying to invade them and successfully invaded one.  So, yeah, disarmament, I think, is necess- necessary.  The problem occurred earlier on though when Bush --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- initially talked about regime change --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before he talked about disarmament and that was a -- ah, a gaffe, an error in his part.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because the Europeans and certainly, I think, a lot of, ah, Arab states, feel this is strictly about a, ah, regime change. [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  And not disarmament.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Because that's what -- that's the foot he led with.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN]
R:  But as for the central question on here, I do think we need to [MN] do something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I guess, you know, I can think back -- you think back to the sixties and you [NOISE] think about the things that our government was involved in that we do know about and the things that happened as far as assassinations that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we suspect, um, [LIPSMACK] a- -- but then again y- you think, "Well, if we have all this technology to see all of this and know all of this, why can't we send somebody in there and just take him out?"  If they can come over here and blow up four thousand, two thousand, however many thousands of people they blew up in the World Trade Center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [SIGH] so I don't know, I don't know.  Um, a lot of people are going to die if something's not done quickly.
R:  Yep.  Um, o- on the issue of, you know, why don't we send somebody in directly.  I thought about that in the first Gulf War and I think it has something to do with the leadership not -- the leadership of any country not liking the idea of sanctioning, removing by that manner, the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- leaders of other countries.
L:  Right.
R:  Because about as easily as we could get somebody over there to get Saddam --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in fact possibly more easily, they could get somebody over here to get Bush.
L:  I see, mhm.
R:  And that's why I think they don't want to go, ah, down that path [LAUGH] because --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- that's one way.  They don't have a, ah, military super- superiority, you know? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I see, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, an- an- and again, demonstrated by the fact that nineteen people were able to take out so much.
L:  Yes, yes.  That's true.
R:  It's all hard questions. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How long have we been talking now?
R:  I don't know.  It seems like an hour, doesn't it?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Are we supposed to time, or are they gonna come in?
L:  Um, I heard that they will actually cut in on us if we go over but if we hang up before the ten minutes is over we don't get paid, so ...
R:  Oh, then I'll just keep jabbering.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what?  I'm -- actually, you know what?  We've been talking for about seven minutes because my cl- -- my phone, I had to take a look --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- has a little counter, so it took me about a minute to get connected, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- oh, we have probably two, three minutes left. [SIGH]
L:  [MN] Okay.  Um, what else can we talk about concerning Iraq? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, well, actually, we could talk about the timing, if we think was going to war.
L:  Yeah?
R:  My brother in law had an interesting point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that is that the US will probably move during a new moon when there's no moon out.
L:  I see, yeah.
R:  And looking at that I would say that somewhere around April first is the strike date.
L:  Oh, I see, mm.
R:  'Cause I -- as soon as I heard Powell yesterday, I mean I -- Powell pretty much clearly said, "We're going in".
L:  Mhm, mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And I looked at the calendar and I'm like, "Mm, we're about three days past the new moon this time".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm sus- -- judging that they're going to wait for the next --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one to come around.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Is that yours or mine?
L:  No, that's me.
R:  Oh, okay.  No problem. [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I guess I wonder, too, with this guy that they just caught --
R:  Ooh, interesting, yeah.
L:  -- that, uh, I -- I wonder if he's going to give up any information concerning Iraq's involvement.
R:  Um, you know, I've a feeling he's going to, whether -- whether or not he thinks he's going to.  Because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- these people won't keep their mouth completely shut.
L:  Mm.
R:  They'll brag about something.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I see, mhm.
R:  And that's an interesting point.  They might want to give a little time to sweat this guy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Find out something about i- if not necessarily the sleeper cells themselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they also captured a lot of intelligence with this guy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They captured a lot of material.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they may want to sift through that material, get a clue, if not who is gonna be doing something, what's gonna happen, what's the tar- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what are the targets this next time around?
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  So that might be something that they might be well worth waiting --
L:  They might try.
R:  -- a few weeks on.
L:  [MN] Now, I had heard some things about Saddam and all these doubles he supposedly has.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Do you think we know which ones are the doubles and which one is really Saddam?
R:  Um, I have a feeling we know -- we're better at knowing it than they think we are.
L:  Ah, ahah.
R:  You know, I -- I -- in fact, if I -- i- if I put any cr- credence on our military intelligence we're probably a lot better than they think we are, because even though they're gonna send out doubles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm also willing to bet that there's going to be two more cars in the entourage that go with the real Saddam --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- and the car and the double.  They're not that smart.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, not -- not meaning to belittle 'em that much, but I don't think they figured that one out.
L:  Hm.
R:  But that's good.  You know, I have never thought about that till now when you've brought it up.
L:  Well, you know, I was thinking about the fact that -- because right now what's going on in the news, if they're telling all this information --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- it's psychological warfare.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But then you wonder what's the real truth. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  To go off topic on that issue, um, you're familiar with the Iran contra affair, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  I used to live in Madison Wisconsin and during the eighties there was talk about this who- -- essentially the Iran contra thing.  The militant press, the -- the left wing stuff, it was talking about all of that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] And I said, "Oh, come on, this is outrageous.  Yeah, our government has a secret thing to funnel arms to Iran or Iraq or whatever" and then --
L:  So th- -- the news was out but nobody believed it?
R:  Yeah, 'cause it was so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- outrageous.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When Iraq contra broke I'd already knew the story but I didn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- believe it.  [LAUGH]  I -- I kid you not.  I mean, I had heard al- -- most of the details, especially the parts involving the actual smuggling in South America.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] And then I hear it and I'm like, "Oh my God!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Those crazies were right.
