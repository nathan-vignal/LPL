R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How are you?
R:  [MN] Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Althea. 
R:  I'm Jill. 
L:  Hi, Jill.  Um, so we're going to talk about terrorism. 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what I was thinking when they said that about terrorist attack, I guess they mean locally, like, nearby you. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Okay.  So, I'm definitely thinking most people are going to panic. 
R:  That's what I would think, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, how could you not?  I think in any major catastrophe people are going to panic. 
L:  Um, I'm probably -- I would definitely be afraid, um, and -- but tend to do better in a crisis than I do actually in long term --
R:  Do you really?
L:  -- type things.  Yeah, I'm -- 
R:  Like --
L:  I'm better in that. 
R:  That -- you're better under pressure?
L:  A little bit, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you know, I was thinking because, um, just as a, um, tie in, you know, we've heard about those club explosions and --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- fires, and I was telling my husband, I said -- I used to live in Chicago, and I said the last thing I would have done was to run out the f door.  Everybody else was -- I just would've not done that. 
R:  Right. 
L:  That's just -- [MN] but that doesn't make -- that doesn't mean I would've got out alive, but I just think that way.  Um, but I definitely think people are fearful and afraid and -- and Americans, we've been really cushy. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, so -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- um, you know, we're not too tough in that -- in that level.  So ... 
R:  I think, um -- I have two little girls. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I think that probably before I had them I might have reacted differently than now. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And especially if they are with me -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and something tragic happened, I would probably keep my head a lot better for their sake, you know --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- to try to get all of us safe --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- somewhere, yeah. 
L:  Right, yeah, that's a good point.  I -- I have, ah, four children and, you know, your -- that's your first thought, "How can I --"
R:  Right. 
L:  "-- protect them?" 
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, so, I have no idea.  I think it's a -- some of the things that could happen, I don't think there is any really way to protect yourself.  I mean, bioterrorism, duct tape and plastic I don't think are going to do it, ah, [LAUGH] if they drop something really close by.  So, some things, um, you might not be able to really do that much about. 
R:  That's true.  Whether you panic or not doesn't -- doesn't make a difference.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, for some things, um ... 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But, um, if you look at some of the other things that go on in other countries, um, like my -- we were watching the news and my daughter was kind of watching it, um, this morning, um, and just some of the things that other countries live with just with the buses being blown up, um -- you know, not big, widespread but enough to scare -- you know -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- have your life be a lot different. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, um, so ... [PAUSE] 
R:  I know that there are some, you know, little kids that have to dodge bullets to get to school. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And that would make you -- if you had to live with it every day, you definitely would not be surprised if it happened. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And you may not panic when it happened. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, you'd be prepared emotionally to handle it, which is pretty sad actually to think about. 
L:  Mm.  That's a good point because, you know, I guess it -- it may fall down between those who are going to choose to survive and -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and try to live with -- in spite of fear.  I mean, you're going -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- to be afraid -- the sniper scared a lot of people.  That was scary.  Um, but at some point you're either going to stay in your house or you're going to come out. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, and -- and -- and you have to, um, make those decisions. 
R:  That's right. 
L:  So ... um ... 
R:  I talked to one lady a few years ago who was, um, assaulted in her home. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  A man came through her bedroom window. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And she -- I asked her how did -- if she had any advice for people -- for other women or people in general, you know, "How do you handle a situation like that?" and she said, "Think about it.  What -- think about it before it happens and -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  "-- what would you do."
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, formulate a plan before it ever happened, and it may not ever happen, but if it does happen then you have a plan --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and you're -- you're prepared to, you know, do that plan.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LAUGH] And I think -- I don't know, I'm a worry wart, um, because of my kids. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- the bus was late yesterday and I was just about ready to call the school, you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  "What happened to them?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And every time there's something on the news about the terrorists and --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you just -- but if -- [MN] I think if you think about it and say, "Okay, what would I do if this happened?" -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know, if it actually did happen, you'd keep a cooler head about -- or maybe get out of the situation a little better. 
L:  Right, and you know what they say about worry.  A lot of things we worry about, they either -- most of them don't happen or they don't -- they're not nearly as bad.  I mean, that's just in simpler things, not necessarily -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- terrorism, but, um --
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, of course your first thought is, you know, you don't want to die, you know. 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And -- and -- and you don't want anybody else to die that you love, and, um, that was, of course, the worst case scenario, and so I always thought worst case, and for -- probably what kinda keeps me from being too really, um, worried, um -- I'm concerned but not worried is because I know what's going to happen when I die, I know where I'm going to go, and so, um, that kinda takes something out of it.  It doesn't mean that I want to. 
R:  Well, and it's -- yeah, and it's how you're going to die. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  That's what scares me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm. 
R:  It's not -- after you're dead is okay, right, because you said you know where you're going.  [LAUGH] But it's how you get there [LAUGH] to that point.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you know, I don't really want to have a lot of pain. 
R:  [LAUGH] Right, or something very tragic or, you know -- and I'd -- I don't know.  I worry about leaving my family. 
L:  Right.  [PAUSE] Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's a concern.  You know, it's -- I was thinking about that.  My -- I have, um -- I've been remarried and my, ah, first husband died in nineteen ninety six.
R:  Oh --
L:  And that was --
R:  -- I'm sorry. 
L:  You know, yeah [MN] -- you know, and that -- that was really sad and it just lets you know, "Wow, things can happen to you".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. 
L:  And, um -- but -- and so sometimes I think I concern myself with it just because I think, "Oh, I'm the only other, you know, natural parent they have".  But -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, there [MN] -- a lot of, you know -- I have to trust God f to do --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- the things, you know [LAUGH] -- things that he --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sure he can handle it. 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you know, you make your plans.  Like you say, you get a plan and you try to make plans and have somewhere for them to go and someone to -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- live with and -- and then, you know, I think you can't really worry about it.  It's not really going to, um -- [NOISE] not a lot you can do. 
R:  Are all four of your kids from your first husband?
L:  Oh, three of them are. 
R:  Three. 
L:  And [NOISE] then I have one stepson.  So ... 
R:  That's great.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, you know, they're -- they're -- they're pretty cute.  [NOISE] Getting ready to -- [NOISE] I'll go pick them up very soon and, ah, it'll be -- 
R:  They're at school?
L:  -- quite lively.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Get back home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have a six year old and a three month old and [LAUGH] my house is lively now.  I can imagine when you have four.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, six months and -- six years and -- 
R:  Six years.
L:  -- three months.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  Yep. 
L:  That's cute.  They talk a lot at six. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Very catty.  Um, but, um -- yeah, I don't know.  You know, I -- I know as -- as far as this war on terrorism, I'd like for us all make up our minds what we're going to do. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [MN] Go to war or not, you know, or -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- whatever, and I'm sure military wise the families would probably like that as well, um, and it's -- it's complicated.  I mean -- y you think -- you hear about the celebrities talking about, "Let's not have war" and all these people that don't want war, and yet I don't think we're really as informed at how, um, really treacherous some of these people are. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And how they're really horrible to their own -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- countrymen, and [NOISE] it's just mind boggling.  I think, um -- it was in -- one of those night time news shows had on Saddam Hussein's son and how much worse he is than his own [NOISE] father.  Just -- I -- I couldn't hardly watch a lot of it.
R:  No. 
L:  But some of it was just horrendous, the kind of things that [NOISE] he does, you know, and it's just -- 
R:  Right.  [NOISE] 
L:  It would be nice if we could just [NOISE] kinda get some of those people out of power, you know, and -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  But -- 
R:  Well, I certainly, um -- I am an air force brat, and my -- 
L:  Are you?
R:  -- my brother is still in the reserves and my brother in law is and -- they have not been called back to active duty --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- but it's very possible that they could be. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But I know that their response to this is, "You know, let's get over there and take care of it". 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I certainly don't want them going, but [NOISE] my response is, "Yes, let's go and take care of it" -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- because this is -- enough is enough. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  He has been a thorn in our side for a long time. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And he -- and he's evil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, he's truly an evil person.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, there're -- 
R:  You know. 
L:  -- there're some scary people.  I think --
R:  Yes. 
L:  -- and I think Americans, we have really cocooned ourselves. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Um, and turned our, ah -- a deaf ear and a blind eye to a lot of things.  We're just aren't -- aren't aware.  We don't even know what we're talking about.  These people -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- are crazy and, um -- and -- and their -- their countrymen, they're people that we keep saying ...
