L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Kristy.  Um --
R:  Hi, Kristy.
L:  I'm in Louisiana.
R:  Hi, Kristy and I'm Sylvia and I'm in California in Sacramento.
L:  Oh, okay.  We're supposed to talk about bioterrorism. [LAUGH]
R:  Bioterrorism. [LAUGH]
L:  Not a subject I'm very familiar with.
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH] Anyway, it is pretty scary.
R:  You know, it is and it's something that I wish that we hadn't become this familiar with.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Um, I remember during the, um, anthrax scare I opened all of our company mail and we were told, you know, if you don't want to open it, don't, you know. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Just give it to the person it's addressed to and let them decide.
R:  And let them deal with it, oh my goodness, yeah, it's very scary and, gosh, what can we do to [SIGH] what can our country do to avoid a bioterrorist attack?  Is that what they were saying? 
L:  Yeah, I think so and, you know, as far as I'm concerned I think they're on the right track trying to find the, you know, the weapons, track them down -- 
R:  Continue to look -- 
L:  -- is a good way to start.
R:  -- you know, hope that they can get Saddam Hussein to -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- disarm.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It doesn't look like he's making much of an effort.
L:  No, it really doesn't, so ... 
R:  So I don't know.  I'm in favor of going to war if that's what it's going to have to see.
L:  Me, too, you know.  A lot of my friends are very anti war and they have tried to convince me, you know, that Saddam has done nothing to us, but I mean, you know, and that we shouldn't have a war because he hasn't done anything to us, but I don't [MN] --
R:  So, you know, I have to say and of course I'm -- being in California there's [MN] many, many people against the war.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And I'm sure that's all over the country but I mean what do they think, you know?  Are we going to wait until he attacks us?
L:  Right, it's kind of too late -- 
R:  I think so.
L:  -- once he has done something.  But I mean according to their perspective then war's only justified I guess after somebody has attacked us.
R:  Mm.  I see and I just -- and I feel like and I can understand that way of thinking but I do feel like, um, you know, if we don't, he's going to.
L:  Yeah, and I watch CNN a lot and, you know, he's very supportive of terrorism so I mean there's no proof I guess that he would give weapons to, um, al Qaeda, but [MN] what's to prevent him from doing that?  I mean -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- he's anti America and, um, pro terrorism, so -- 
R:  It's amazing how these people are so anti American.
L:  I know.
R:  You know, I really wasn't aware of that before nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, it is very scary and I don't know, I think that we are on the right track, I -- I'm -- I'm hopeful that they will find something and be able to really act on it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm hoping that war can be avoided, too, but I think there has to be the threat of war or he'll just do whatever he pleases, you know.  I mean ... 
R:  Yeah, I think that's very true.
L:  And then, you know, my bad  the thing too is that we're kind of ignoring North Korea, not that they're a bio bioterrorism, but, you know, they're out there firing missiles and stuff and we're just pretty much ignoring that, so ... 
R:  You know, I -- yes, that's very true. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you kind of wonder wha, you know, that's a loose cannon right there. 
L:  Yeah, what's going on with that?  I mean we're so concentrated on Saddam Hussein that we're just letting North Korea do whatever it wants.
R:  Certainly do what they want to do.
L:  Right.  
R:  Um [SIGH] 
L:  I think hoping that somebody else will make them stop -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and that [LAUGH] we don't have to get involved. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but, you know, you know, [MN] I was listening to the radio just a few minutes ago on the way home and [SIGH] they were saying that, you know, [SIGH] the perception out there now is America at one time was definitely a war, I mean a world leader -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now the perception is that they're -- is that we're just kind of war hungry.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And that's so sad to me because, ah, I think that's so far from the truth --  
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.
R:  -- it's more just protecting us, protecting Americans and our land and our interests.
L:  Yeah, and I think we have to.
R:  We don't [LAUGH] who's going to?  I mean that was pretty obvious with nine eleven.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Who would have ever thought.
L:  Of, yeah, who would have thought.  I didn't even know about that until about four o'clock in the afternoon when the kids came home from school.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  I felt like such an idiot.  I had been out and around and everybody was real jumpy that day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But nobody said anything.
R:  But nobody said anything.
L:  No, and I hadn't put the TV on.  I had been out in the morning and then I came home and cleaned house and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my next door neighbour was a cop and he had slept all day, he had worked the night shift and slept all day and we were the last two on earth to know anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, how funny.
L:  The kids came home screaming "we're at war" and we were going "yes, sure we are" -- 
R:  [MN]  You're like "what?" 
L:  -- put the TV on -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he came over and said, "Ma'am, do you know what's going on?", you know.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  "So I'll look at CNN and find out", you know.
R:  My daughter -- I had just -- I do consulting work and I had just finished a contract and [MN] decided to take a week off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I was sleeping in, you know, trying to relax and my daughter called at, you know, gosh, seven -- I don't -- early in the morning and said, you know, "mum, turn on the -- get up, get up, turn on the TV" and, um, she said "I'm on my way over" so she dropped the kids at school and came over and we were just glued to, uh, to the TV the rest of the day, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that was the beginning of a whole new world for us.
L:  Yeah, it was.  I remember that right after when everybody was so paranoid about everything and then, um, right after that the President was a hundred -- I mean we live in a little -- I'm in West Monroe[?], I'm in North Louisiana, nobody ever heard of it, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so what do we have to worry about terrorism, but the President was in Shreveport, which is less than a hundred miles from here -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and we were like "please go home", [LAUGH] we don't want you.
R:  No, [LAUGH] that's right. 
L:  Not right now [LAUGH]. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that was kind of making everyone paranoid that the President was a hundred miles away -- 
R:  Because that's right [LAUGH].
L:  -- because otherwise al Qaeda don't know who we are [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, he'd never find us, so [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] and that's kind of -- I keep thinking, well, we I'm in Sacramento and it's okay, it's not San Francisco or LA -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it is the state capital [SIGH] and -- 
L:  Yeah.  We don't even have a World Trade Centre [LAUGH].
R:  Right, so you just -- you know what?  Who knows, though?  Who knows what's going in -- on in their minds? 
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- and that's exactly what's so scary.  I just think that, you know, all this increased, um, you know, security and, you know, heightened awareness is definitely what we have to do, we have to continue that.  Um, I don't know, I actually have heard of a couple of instances where reports were made that weren't taken seriously right after nine eleven.
L:  Ahah.
R:  My daughter was -- I guess somebody that works with her husband or, I don't know, something, somebody that they knew maybe through one of the kids said that there was a McDonalds here in town, that if the kids go to -- or people go to apply for jobs and if they don't have green cards, um, they tell them to go to this particular address in, you know, one of the nearby cities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they'll fix them up -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and get them the documentation that they need.  Well, that was just very frightening [LAUGH] you know, it's that easy.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is.
R:  -- and so she called the FBI hotline.  Remember there was -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they were publicizing if you hear and they were like, "okay, fine, thanks".  They just were not, you know, they didn't ask any details or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that was a little scary but, you know, who knows, maybe they did get enough information, you know.  We don't know how they follow up on these things.
L:  Yeah, hopefully, you know. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I got an email a while back.  It was forwarded to me and it was from -- written by somebody that was in the military that supposedly knew a lot about bioterrorism but, you know, I don't know how legitimate it was, but he says, you know, it's really hard for them.  He went in, you know, went into great detail to explain all of this different stuff.  It's hard for them to get enough of it into the environment to really hurt very many people and supposedly, you know, according to him most of it you can just wash off or, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just get out of the area. 
R:  Yeah.  I actually did hear something about that recently.
L:  Yeah.  He -- he made it seem like it wasn't nearly as serious and, you know, I try not to panic about things like that, too, I mean, you know.  Of course if you have respiratory illness or, you know -- 
R:  Well, that's right -- 
L:  -- a bad immune system or something. 
R:  -- and some people are going to be more susceptible -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- but in general -- 
L:  My son and I are very healthy, so -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- you know.
R:  I think it's just a matter of knowing, you know, of -- of -- of being aware like I said.  I mean, but they -- I have heard that, too, that it's going to -- if they hit, it's not like, it's not like it's going to wipe out the city.
L:  Yeah.  I was originally picturing something like the plagues of the olden days, you know -- 
R:  I know [LAUGH]. 
L:  -- everybody was just croaking left and right.
R:  Right, yeah.  Well, you know -- 
L:  That's probably the best thing to do, if it's on your skin, you know, it has to get into your blood stream or you have to breathe it or something like that.  It's the best thing to do is, you know, get out of the area, don't breathe in the confined space if you can help it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, get into fresh air and take a shower -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as quickly as possible.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  I don't know, you see all these people that are stockpiling gas masks and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But, I don't know, we haven't gone that far [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and then what was this?  The government was saying go out and buy duct tape and oh -- 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my goodness. 
L:  -- plastic wrap.  What were we supposed to do with the duct tape and the plastic wrap?  I don't get that [LAUGH].
R:  I guess seal up your houses, but then wouldn't you suffocate eventually [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, you know [LAUGH]. 
L:  Yeah, if you make it so airtight that the chemicals can't get in, how are you going breathe? 
R:  That's right, yeah.  Exactly. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You need fresh air too, so ... 
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  I don't know, I mean I think it's just an unknown and people jump to conclusions and make announcements and even the government, you know, they are people [SIGH] but, um, it is scary, that's for sure.
