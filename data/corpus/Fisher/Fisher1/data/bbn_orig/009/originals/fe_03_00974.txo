L:  Hi, my name --
R:  Hi -- [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] my name is Elisha, what's your name?
R:  Diana.
L:  Diana. 
R:  Did you say Elisa? 
L:  Elisha. 
R:  Elisha, okay.  This is my first time so --
L:  This is my first time too. 
R:  Oh, wonderful. [LAUGH]  
L:  Yes. 
R:  He said airport security what? 
L:  Does it heighten -- is there less of a chance of an attack, I think. 
R:  With the airport security? 
L:  Mhm.  You go first. 
R:  [LAUGH] Possibly so.  I do believe that there will be, um, if they follow certain safety measures, then we can feel more secure if they do have heightened security but if someone is intent on doing something they will find a way.  That's my opinion.   [LAUGH]  
L:  I agree and I think it also helps them to be a little bit more creative about how they can cause harm. 
R:  About how they can what? 
L:  How they could cause harm. 
R:  Yes, that's true. 
L:  You know, and hopefully it will -- all this extra security [NOISE] will cause them to not want to -- I'm not saying that, you know, America should be attacked because I live here and I don't really want that but it would cause them to want to go different avenues perhaps, you know. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, because of what happened, September eleventh I thought was very, very sad. 
R:  Right, I agree.  That's true because like I said, if somebody definitely doesn't want -- definitely wants to cause harm, they will find a way. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  If it's not through airport security, it will be -- I mean through the airport system, it will be through something else. 
L:  Yeah, because I think there's a lot of, um -- I mean, I really don't want us to become more like a socialistic or more military type of society where everywhere you go that's on public means of transportation you have to go through all types of different, you know, channels and things. 
R:  So, would it bother you to have more security at an airport? 
L:  I refuse to fly now. 
R:  Do you really? 
L:  Well, because it was -- it takes three hours just -- I live in Atlanta and it takes three hours just to get to your plane. 
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  Aha, because they have got so much over at Hartsfield -- over at Hartsfield they have so many, you know, so many things you have to do and it takes three hours just to get to, you know, the place where you can even be able to get on the plane. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Me, I mean I could drive three hours. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, rather than have to go through all that hassle. 
L:  And my trip would be more ... you know, I could drive three hours and still get there in the amount of time it would have used -- you know, it depends on where I'm flying of course but, you know, I haven't flown.  Have you flown since then?
R:  No, no, but I'm not a big flyer.  I mean, the last time I flew in an airplane was when we went to Disneyworld.  I mean, it's like I've probably flown like three or four times in my whole lifetime.  To be honest with you, just because I heard you tell me that it takes that long, if I really wanted to go somewhere it wouldn't stop me but, you know, I would consider if there is another method to get there, I'm sure. 
L:  For instance Georgia and Florida are right beside each other. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it wasn't anything, you know, a few years ago to just fly, you know, to Florida because they had all types of nice little discount rates and things like that. 
R:  Right. 
L:  But there's no way now because, you know, those three hours I could be in Florida. 
R:  That's true 
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, that's true. 
L:  So, there's no way now and I think part of it is hurting the --
R:  Economy. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I think it is. 
R:  Do you think -- do you think it's the heightened security or the fact that people don't want to get on the planes because they are scared? 
L:  I think it's both. 
R:  Both? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I think it's both.  I think, um, people don't, um -- well for the one thing it's like what I said to you before, because, um, I was at a party, or it wasn't like a company party but there was a lot of Delta employees there. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And they were saying that a lot of people don't want to fly because of the wait in order to fly. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah, it takes to fly. 
R:  I wonder if we are having the same problem here in Houston.  I live here in Texas but I don't ever hear about any massive amount of wait time.  Does that mean that they are not really heightening the security here? [LAUGH]  
L:  No, they probably are.  You know, um, you know, if -- you know, here things are -- you know what I mean.  I mean, they probably are. 
R:  It was on the news [MN] shortly after all that happened on nine eleven that they did like a run here and they found out that it wasn't.  They had to -- remember when -- I don't know if that happened over there in Atlanta but they had to hire certain security companies, they could -- I believe they had to hire them from the -- somebody from the government or something like that and a lot of people got laid off and they had found out a lot of people working in the airline industry were illegal people and stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah, they found -- yeah, that was here in Atlanta.  I think that was all over the country. 
R:  Yeah, that was pretty wild. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's like that was kind of scary, you never know.  But then again you still never know, it could be an American person that's going to do that, it can be anybody. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  If they want it, that's just my opinion, you know, if somebody is that wicked, horrid and evil there's no measure of security that's going to stop them.  It's just going to make it that much harder or, like you said, they are going to think of another way to harm everybody. 
L:  Yeah, you know, because just in general, not just, you know, if there is something -- this is just humans I think.  If there is something that we really want to do --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- or that you really want to do, you are going to go after it and do it --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and you're not necessarily going to -- I mean things are going to come across to cause, um, like obstacles and things like that are going to happen.  But if you're really focused and if it's something you really want to do you are going to go after it. 
R:  That's true. 
L:  And I think that's -- it's sad to say but I think that's how,  you know, the terrorists are, I think there are probably a lot in this, you know, I think --
R:  Oh, my goodness, if they are willing to give up their lives like that. [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh yeah, there's just no way. [LAUGH] 
R:  I just couldn't do that.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  You couldn't pay me enough, my family enough or anybody for me to do that.  
L:  I heard they didn't know they were going to die. 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  They didn't find out until they were up in the planes and they were flying the planes. 
R:  Really, now that is one thing I never heard. 
L:  But I also had heard that when they were being taught in Florida how to fly --
R:  Mhm, right. 
L:  -- they weren't interested in learning how to land, they just wanted to learn how to fly an airplane. 
R:  So then what did they think? 
L:  I don't know, I mean a clue could have gotten there somehow. 
R:  No kidding, if you're that intelligent. 
L:  You know, but [inaudible] I wouldn't, I'm sorry.  I wouldn't sacrifice my life for it. 
R:  No, [LAUGH] not for that kind of cau-, not for any cause.  I mean, you know, I would die in a second for my child or anything like that but, you know, not for that, not knowing that I was going to bring pain and suffering in killing all those people, you know, for that kind of -- I don't know, to me common sense but, you know, we don't live there, we don't know what they go through, you know, we don't know what was in their minds other than hate.  That's what it just boils down to me. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Like I said, no measure of security, heightened airport security, you pay somebody and they'll -- people are greedy and they will be bought out. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I mean, how do you think they get -- got past all that, I mean, I don't know.  I just feel like some-, somewhere along the line people will -- you know how you hear about people betraying their country and stuff -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and it's like, you know, they are bought out and if people are greedy enough they will take it. 
L:  I agree, I agree; they will, they will.  What's so terrible about that whole thing that happened is that -- what was so terrible about it was that they were just doing the things that they do every day. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  They were just, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they were taking the train or they were driving to work but, you know, and then -- but in New York pretty much everybody takes the train and they were walking, and, you know, they were doing the things that, you know, you and I do --
R:  Right, that's the scary thing. [LAUGH]
L:  -- every day and it was that very thing that they hate, that they try to, you know, they try to threaten. 
R:  Right. 
L:  It wasn't -- I mean it wasn't -- I don't know, it wasn't like a -- I know that they went after some political -- they were trying to go after the White House or that's what they say and they had gone after the Pentagon. 
R:  Right. 
L:  But it was almost -- it was -- to me it was an attack to the American people deliberately.  It wasn't just our government. 
R:  No. 
L:  It was to us and that was what was so --
R:  Scary. 
L:  And terrible about the whole sit-
