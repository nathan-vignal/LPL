R:  Hi, I'm Bernie.
L:  Hi, I'm Willy.  How're you doing?
R:  Fine, how're you?
L:  I'm okay.  You want to start over?
R:  No, you can.  Go ahead.
L:  Ah, well, actually, ah, my favorite holiday is, ah, Thanksgiving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I guess, but you know, um, the things that it -- we are reminded of during Thanksgiving in terms of how this country was founded and, you know, wh- what it brings forth.  Ah, then it's a great time t- to eat for me 'cause I love --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I love to eat.  [LAUGH] I love food so, ah, you know, I really, ah, I really look forward to it every year and, you know, especially in terms of going around visiting other households, and -- and, you know, seeing what people have on the menu and then just seeing how, um, just seeing how happy and -- and joyous people are.  Ah, what are your -- what are your thoughts about it?
R:  I have to say Thanksgiving too, because Thanksgiving is usually the one time of the year that my whole family can get together.
L:  Right.
R:  I come from a very small family [COUGH] and it -- it just seems that someone's always working on a holiday so Thanksgiving it seems to be the only one [several inaudible words] you know, like to get together, get caught up, eat, my sister in law is a wonderful cook.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That sounds good.
R:  And, um, but my other o- my other holiday just for, like, decorating --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is I love -- I love Halloween.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  My house is, like, the scariest house on the block.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Ah, I -- I think, well, another holiday for me would be, ah, Fourth of July.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I guess I'm kind of patriotic, you know.  Ah, just thinking about all the great things about this country and , ah -- I mean, I know that might sound corny to some people.
R:  No, actually I don't think it does at all.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, but it just, uh, you know, it just brings forth a l- a lot of good memories and -- and then I -- I like, ah, you know, especially the kids, they get so excited about the fireworks a- and going to the shows a- and seeing the fireworks go off and you know, things of that nature.  So I -- I kind of look forward to that every year.  Ah, it's always kinda crazy here in Atlanta, ah, because they, ah, they have a, um, a couple of locations where they shoot off the fireworks and there's always a massive traffic jam on the highway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So if, you know, usually if you don't get out there early it's kinda crazy.  But, ah, you know, it- it's still a joy to -- and a great time.  So. uh, you know.
R:  It's the same thing in Duluth.  If you go see the fireworks w- they shoot 'em right over the lake.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  'Cause we're right on the tip of Lake Superior so if they shoot off the fireworks everyone wants to get up to the top of the hill to see the fireworks go over the lake.
L:  [MN]
R:  And if you stay there long enough you can see -- Superior Wisconsin's right across the lake so you can see their fireworks too.
L:  [MN]
R:  But to try and get home [LAUGH] you got a long wait.
L:  [LAUGH] So you gotta -- gotta sit back and wait -- wait for the ride, huh?
R:  Pretty much, and if you're sitting by the lake it's not so bad 'cause you can look at the lake while you're doing it but [LAUGH] if you're sitting in the middle of downtown traffic it gets a little old.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Ah, what about if you w- were to create a holiday, uh, what k- what -- what would you probably have in mind?
R:  [SIGH] You know when I was little, as an adult I don't know, but when I was little I always thought there should be kids day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause when you're little you celebrate Mom's -- Fathers Day, Mothers Day.  And I th- I always thought and I -- when I had kids, when I nannied for kids, I always thought a kids day would be good.
L:  Right.
R:  Everyone says that every day is kids day but I really don't think it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I thi- I really think that, um, kids -- a lot of people s- set kids aside, I think kids are a lot more important than what people think.
L:  Okay.
R:  Even tho- even though I don't have any of my own.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think it would be a really neat holiday to have a day that's just kids day, you know, um, celebrate, you know, "Here's a cake and let's talk about y- just all about you".
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that- that's interesting because I -- I saw this movie the other day called, uh, Ring and ther- and there was a episode where, ah, the mother was talking about, uh, k- what kids have to say is very important.  And, you know, me being a counselor, I deal with kids and -- and I love kids, you know, it's like, I mean, I can see no wrong with them you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's like, ah, you know, I have never sat down and thought about what you just said but, you know, that probably would be pretty important because -- I mean, we -- we have to -- ah, I think we take kids for granted and -- and -- and we, ah, we don't give them enough, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what's the word?  Um, well maybe just credit just for being who they are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, a lot of times kids are very perceptive --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and -- and we -- we tend to say, "Well, we're older and we're more, ah, ah, um, [MN] accustomed to -- to dealing with things in this world so we have all the answers as -- as -- as -- as adults" you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  A lot of times when you just sit down and talk to a kid and just get down to the basics, I mean, they can just make you feel so good, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Just make you feel so good so  I -- I kinda agree with you.  I'd never thought about it.  That -- that probably would be something good to have.
R:  I don't -- I don't think people take a lot of time to listen to what their -- you know, they listen to the kids yammer but I mean how many times -- I know I did it myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like when my niece and nephew are over, you listen to them talk.  But while you're listening to them talk you're thinking, "Groceries". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  "Is that burning on the stove?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Is he done now?"
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  And what's really funny is I was talking to a girl friend about this just last night, that her son, he's thirteen and he rattles and rattles and rattles and bless his heart, the kid couldn't hide a thing to save his soul.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, some kids have street smarts and, you know, sneak things from their parents.
L:  Right.
R:  This poor kid's always going to get nailed.
L:  Right, right.
R:  For even just something basic he's going to get nailed [LAUGH] for it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, um, it's -- if you listen, if you actually sit and listen, even though they're telling you something really basic, sometimes they let something slip out and you're like "Oh, wow, never thought of that" or "Wow, maybe we should expand on that".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  Well, you know, another thing about it they're -- you know, they are so innocent and, ah, I just love kids, I just like to watch them.  I used to go by this day care and they used to bring the kids out, ah, you know, at the regular time, ah, ah, for their little afternoon recess or what- whatever and I used to sit -- sit there and watch them and just, you know, just the little basic things that they would do and they used to be so happy and so carefree, you know, and it's like, sometimes I wish I could go back to that time, that period, you know? 
R:  Oh, don't you though?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just wish I could get back to that, you know, without all these headaches out here and -- and, you know, all the other problems, you know, we're confronted with every day.  So it's like, ah, I think that would be a real good holiday.  I -- you know, I could -- I could probably -- we probably need to write our congressmen and see if we can get that pushed forward, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That sounds like that would be something great to do.  But another thing that -- [SIGH] I don't know if, ah, we can, ah, we'll talk about it if you like in terms of Christmas.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm kinda get- I've kinda gotten turned off to Christmas 'cause --
R:  Oh, I have too.
L:  You know it's -- but they've -- it's been so commercialized and -- and I think people just have the wrong concept of it like, you know, you can give gifts all year round to show somebody that you love them and it's just not about going out, you know, 'cause you know there's a -- going out and buying what you can buy and that's going to, you know, make everything better for somebody.
R:  Oh, I totally agree.
L:  And then you know, you ha- I -- I also look at a lot of people that I know personally.  They go into debt behind Christmas and -- and I -- sometimes I still just can't -- can't comprehend that.  It's like, me, I mean, this [inaudible] it doesn't even make sense but it's like, you know, thinking if you know, you have to buy a kid this and buy a kid that to make them happy, and knowing full well that sometimes just quality time with them and just things that you can do with them during the normal course of the year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know would -- would just make their year, so.
R:  Well, and heck, even if they're little enough the box would make them happy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  An empty box would make them happy if they're little enough.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I ended up working for this organization, ah, ah, it was like a Christmas fund but they, um, they're out at North Carolina.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I forgot what ministry they- they're affiliated with but they sent, um, presents to kids all over the world.  And this was, ah, my first exp- year -- year, ah, dealing with that.  But I was so amazed at some of the things that people were sending in as gifts.  I mean, they were very good items and -- and just the little simple things that, you know, kids in these foreign countries, these war torn countries would be receiving and knowing that this is gonna put a smile on their face.  They showed a, ah, a documentary, ah, excuse me, initially when we went to, ah, our orientation and it -- it just brought tears to my eyes.  I mean, I -- you know, things that we've -- we take for granted in this country and that k- kids, ah, world wide don't -- don't have.  I mean, they were just so happy.  I mean, those -- those little smiles just, you know, it just melted my heart.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  A- and it's -- I mean, this is something I really look forward to doing every year, I mean, not so much, y- ah, you know what I need to go out and buy, you know, I have a daughter.  She's small, ah, going out and buying for her, but you know, just the little things that you can do for kids outside this country and -- and knowing that you can bring some happiness and some brightness in their lives, you know?  So I -- y- you know, if we could do away with Christmas in terms of the commercialism I'd be all for it.
R:  I -- I totally agree.
L:  I'd be all for it.  But, you know, otherwise, ah, I -- I don't know what other holiday I could come up with that would probably could -- could replace it.  Um, have -- have you done this study before?
R:  No, this is my first time.
L:  It's the first time, okay.  Ah.
R:  Have you?
L:  No, this is my first time also.  Matter of fact earlier I gave the wrong PIN number so I didn't know if they were going to call me back.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, ah, I guess we're supposed to carry on for another what, ten minutes?
R:  I -- I -- guess you carry on, talk for like ten minutes --
L:  Okay, uh, yeah.
R:  -- and I guess they cut you off from what I understand.
L:  Yeah.  Um, but, um, holidays, ah, oh, I kinda lo- usually look forward to them, you know.  I mean especially Memorial Day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, Labor Day, you know 'cause usually right here in Atlanta the weather's always pretty good so we end up doing a lot of barbecuing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And a- again a- as I said, I love to eat.  I mean, oh man, I -- I just love food and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I j- --
R:  I -- when I lived in New Jersey I used to go, um -- one of my girl friends and I, we used to go camping every Memorial Day weekend up in the Pocono's.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was a real nice tradition for the week, you know.  I- it was almost like feeling like, you know, summer's starting and it's a good way to usher in summer.
L:  Right.
R:  And it was nice because it was so quiet and you could think about, you know.  To me I think, like, Memorial Day --
L:  [MN] 
R:  Memorial Day almost seems like the year's starting or at least the summer's starting.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  There's so much to look forward to and then even when Labor Day happens I still feel like a little kid and I'm thirty three years old --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I still feel like a little kid, like, I'm going to have to go to school --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- as soon as -- oh, I don't want Labor Day to come.
L:  [MN] Ah, ah, yeah, yeah.  I -- I'm pretty much the same.  But, you know, I wish it could last all weekend you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's just something that you know i- is not set up to be that way so you just try to make the best out of it.  Ah, I was kinda looking at the time.  I think we sta- I started at nine
