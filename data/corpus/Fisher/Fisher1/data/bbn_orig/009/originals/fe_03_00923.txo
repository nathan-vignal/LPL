L:  Hi, this is Margaret in Massachusetts.
R:  This is Cathy from Atlanta, Georgia. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Cathy.
R:  Hi, how are you doing? [NOISE]
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Good. [NOISE]
L:  You know anything about the subject today? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um, ah, well, a little bit.  Um, [MN] I think they should, um, disarm, ah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Iraq but not at the price of, ah -- I think war should be the last resort.
L:  Yeah.  I agree with you completely.  Um, I think a lot of different compan- -- countries should be disarmed also.
R:  Yeah.  Mainly, ah, o- -- ah, ah, North Korea.  They seem to be, ah, overlooking them.  I think they are more afraid of North Korea than they are of, ah, Iraq.
L:  Right, they're not -- they're not leading everyone to believe that though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, um -- I don't know, I -- I just think we're in a very precarious situation here and I think that if he goes ahead on and attack Iraq, that he's gonna get more than what he, ah, he -- he bargains for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think he's gonna set off a chain of events that he's not just -- no one is gonna be able to stop.
L:  And if he's not ready for it yet and ...
R:  Yeah.  So what all are we supposed to say? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I liked yesterday's topic on TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Much better.  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so you -- you -- have you been called for this study before?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, how --
L:  We talked about survival TV.
R:  -- how's it working for you?
L:  Mhm?
R:  How's it working out for you?
L:  Really well.
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well that's good.  [LIPSMACK] And this is my first time -- 
L:   [LAUGH]
R:  So, I, ah -- I --
L:  First time and they give you a tough topic.  Oh, my.
R:  Yeah, and I -- you know, I didn't expect for them to call today.
L:  Yeah, I just -- uh huh.
R:  You know, so ...  But, ah --
L:  You have to be ready all the time, I guess.
R:  Oh, I guess so.  So, ah, but, um -- [MN] I do- -- I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, you hate to go against the President of -- of the United States --
L:  Right.  We're supposed to stay in behind him but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] But in this case, I mean, [MN] our lives are at stake too and so is the life of peoples' sons and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- daughters and --
L:  Lots of family members so ...
R:  -- so forth, you know?  And, ah, if -- if he -- if he's so interested in -- I always joke around with the kids and I'm not so sure that I'm really joking, but if he really wants to fight with Iraq why don't he be the first one to hit the ground over there?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] you see, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  That would be [inaudible].
R:  Uh huh.  He in such a hurry, you know? 
L:  Yeah, like it's --
R:  You know.
L:  It's got to be done immediately.
R:  It's pretty easy to sit back and give orders [MN] to tell someone else to go and put they life on the line.
L:  Right.  I think he's got to do a lot more convincing of people. [MN]
R:  Well, he's -- he's pretty arrogant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he doesn't seem to, ah, really, ah --
L:  But it doesn't seem like the rest of the c- -- [MN] the country is following him.  I mean --
R:  No, and he doesn't seem to care.
L:  They don't seem to be jumping in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he wants to do it all himself so ...
R:  Yeah.  [MN] I mean, he just seems to, ah, judging from, ah, some of his other, ah, statements that he's made, ah, he feels that he's the commander in chief and what he says go.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so he -- he really is to me, coming off no be- better or no worse than Saddam Hussein.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, because he's -- he's not listening to the people that he was elected to, ah, serve.  And everyone is warning him, including people within his own ranks, that this is a mistake for him to, ah, continue down this road.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  We'll see where it'll take us in the next couple of months. [MN]
R:  If we have a couple of months. 
L:  Everyone's been on [inaudible], yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They said -- ahah, they said something about that, ah, the United States was probably going to go ahead on attack sometime next week.  And something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about, ah, the moon.  They have to do it before the moon, ah, loses light or something like that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah, doesn't provide as much light.  If they don't go ahead on an attack now it'll be much more difficult for them to, ah --
L:  I hadn't read that.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, why are we giving them notice [MN] like a week?  Aren't sneak attacks supposed to be better? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I don't underst- 
L:  I mean  --
R:  I don't understand that.  I mean --
L:  Is there --
R:  -- it seems like to me that they tell them everything that they're going to do and I don't see, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't really understand this --
L:  I mean, if we're really going in to do it --
R:  -- because Saddam has CNN, ah, he watches a lot of the news channels so he -- he's aware of everything that's going on and it's just like they might as well just invite him, ah, to the White House and just tell him what their next move is.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't try to keep anything hid or -- or, you know, they just seem to be too open with it, to me.  I don't know what's going on. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know more than I do. [LAUGH]
R:  It's ju- -- I know it's a mess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a mess and, ah --
L:  Not a very good place to be right now.
R:  [MN] No, and then, ah, they said that, ah, with that North Korea incident, at first they had said that, ah, ah, if North Korea shoot -- shot out the missiles that, ah, it would strike California and, ah, Hawaii.  Well, then they later, ah, went ahead on a release that, no, that not only were the missiles, ah, capable of striking California and Hawaii but they would, ah, strike the entire United States.
L:  So they really don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think they knew all along.
L:  They knew all along, huh?
R:  Yeah.  To me, they -- they lie a little bit, put out a little bit, lie a little bit, put out a little bit, but they -- they know [inaudible].
L:  That's the problem.  They -- they let so much out that you wonder how much more they really do know.
R:  I think they know a lot.  I think they know a lot.  And then we're just little peons just sitting here 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, what are we going to do?  We don't run a government.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, it's just -- I don't know, like I just said, I -- I guess I'll just get up some canned goods and rice and ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  That's right.  And that tape we're supposed to have.  [MN] We're all supposed to have duct tape.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I don't believe that's going to do any good.  I mean, one doctor -- and that -- and that struck me as strange, too, that they showed that doctor.  Um, he got on TV and he said -- and they only showed him once.  He said that, ah, duct tape and sheeting paper was not going to do any good.
L:  [LAUGH] I can't see where it would, either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, you'd be, um, too- +taken in before you even know what happened anyway. 
L:  I think it might make people feel more comfortable thinking maybe they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have a chance but ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  And -- and -- and --
L:  And to think they're prepared but I don't think [inaudible].
R:  He's telling everybody to get duct tape and all this kind of stuff and, you know, he's going to be up under the ground in his bunker.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, that'll be the first place, before anything starts up, where he'll be.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I wonder what happened to all the fallout shelters?
L:  [MN] I haven't seen any of those signs.
R:  'Cause I remember back there in my day, I'm fifty -- fifty two and I remember back there in my day, ah, we used to have fallout shelters in the schools and --
L:  Right, in all the school buildings in the basements --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the p- --
R:  Post offices and--
L:  Any government office, yeah.
R: Mhm, [LIPSMACK] but I haven't heard anything about that.
L:  I haven't seen any of those signs lately either.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  They used to have the black and gold signs and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Well, I think we just in for a -- I think we in for a rocky road and it's a lot of uncertainty but as soon as he push that button [MN] he's gonna go off into something that he's not gonna be able to -- to get us out of.
L:  And there won't be any stopping it probably. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  And it's gon- -- it's not gonna only happen over there.  I feel like it's -- I feel like he's gonna set off a chain of events right here on our own soil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And the thing about it is that you don't know where these people are and what they're capable -- well , yeah, you know what they're capable of.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But you don't know where they're at.
L:  Right, they could be anywhere.
R:  You know, they could be your next door neighbors, your doctor, your -- I mean, you just don't know because they've come over here and they've set up, you know, lives.
L:  That's right, we've let everyone in for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all these years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and didn't check anything.
R:  So, it's just, um -- and it's kinda, you know, you -- you don't know what's said to the kids, although they seem to be taking it better than the adults. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  But you were [inaudible] --
L:  I think a lot of the kids are -- now are just thinking it's TV and it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- happening somewhere else to someone else, and kids don't seem to care as much about things in other places.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I know, I -- I asked my, uh, grandchildren.  I said, "Well, do you all have any, uh, uh, escape plans, or do they talk to you all about anything possibly happening in school?"  She said, "No".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, even fire drills and that are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, just looked -- overlooked in school.  They all know it's the drill and they get out of class for a few minutes and they're back in.  They don't think about it could really happen sometime or ...
R:  No, and the type of people that -- that we're dealing with, these people, you can't threaten them or anything like that because they truly just don't -- [SIGH]
L:  They don't care about their life.
R:  Uh-uh.  They don't care about life itself.
L:  Right.
R:  They have no respect for life so you can't, you know, turn around and threaten them with that because they don't care.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So this here's just a very interesting, uh, catastrophe that --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- we're come -- are approaching here.
L:  One to go down in the history book. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think it's going to do more than go down in the history book.  I say -- I say I'm not even --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  My birthday's in June, I'm not even looking forward to it.
L:  Yeah?
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Mine's in June too. [LAUGH]
R:  It's just -- oh really?
L:  Yeah, the twenty seventh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, mine is June the fifth.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, I'm not even looking forward to it, I mean, it's just so --
L:  If we're here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And those [inaudible] -- 
L:  It seems that you have to live your life day to day and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go on with things as normally as you can and ...  [MN] I don't know what else you could do.
R:  Well, you can't -- can't worry about it 'cause there's nothing that you can do about it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  It's nothing one individual like us could prevent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  I mean, you can --
L:  -- [inaudible] voicing your opinion.
R:  -- if it'd make you feel better you probably could get out there and protest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so forth but, ah --
L:  I don't think that'd get you anywhere.
R:  -- he even said he didn't care what they said.  No, he said he didn't care.
L:  No.
R:  He said he respect the fact that this is America and that they're
