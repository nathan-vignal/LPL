R:  Hello, my name's Megan.
L:  Hi, my name's Fay.
R:  Hi, Fay.  How [LAUGH] are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, this is my first time to do this, so I'm not too sure.
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah.  You haven't done this before?
R:  No, this is my first one.
L:  Oh, okay.  So we're supposed to talk about holidays.  So what's your favorite holiday?
R:  My favorite is Halloween.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Halloween?
R:  I love Halloween, you get to dress up and go around and get candy from people, you know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love to decorate for Halloween too but I haven't been able the last couple of years to find any kinda scary Halloween decorations.  They're all, like, cartoony, happy --
L:  Happy, yeah.
R:  -- Halloween dec- -- yeah, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  When I was little we used to do all sorts of scary stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Halloween was my favorite.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But see, you gotta understand, you know, uh, Halloween was my father's birthday.
R:  Oh, was it?
L:  Yeah, and he died and it's -- you know, I just really haven't gotten over it yet and it's been five years and I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- still just -- I was real close to my father so ...
L:  [NOISE] That can be tough.
R:  Yeah, I really don't have a truly favorite holiday.  Ah, any time I'm off from [LAUGH] work is a holiday for me.
R:  [LAUGH] What do you do for a job?
L:  Oh, I teach fifth grade. [MN] 
R:  Oh, okay, so you're off for most of the holidays, so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, I am off.
R:  That's good.
L:  I mean, I have -- I have time off --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for, like, stuff like that and I don't have to [SIGH] worry about, you know, not having time to [MN] get ready for the holidays 'cause, you know, I get home early in the afternoon.  But it's -- it's pretty panicky around at school during Hallow- Halloween and Thanksgiving --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and +Christmas and Easter time 'cause it's spring break and ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I can imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, what part of the country are you in?
L:  Florida.
R:  Florida.  I'm in, ah, like, just outside of Washington DC.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, all the kids in our schools are -- are freaking out a little bit because they, ah, ran out of snow days this year.  [MN] 
L:  Ooh.
R:  So --
L:  That means they have to make up days.
R:  Well, yeah, that's just the whole thing is that they -- they bank for three, I think they bank is what they said.  And most of the school districts around here have used up a whole, like ten or eleven days.
L:  Gee.  [NOISE] 
R:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're looking in- -- they're looking into their summer time then.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  So they're petitioning the state to, like, let the kids, like, you know, ah, like, forgive them a couple of the days so ...  Because otherwise they're not going to have a spring break and they're going to go past the Fourth of July, so ...
L:  Whoa.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that's rough.
R:  Not so good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So you --
R:  I don't imagine you have any snow days in Florida, though.
L:  No, we usually have hurricanes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, that's -- that's the real fun time too, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nothing like, you know, having a hurricane.  So, well, if you were to create a holiday, what would it be? [MN] 
R:  Oh, gosh, I don't even know.  Ah, that's such a hard one.
L:  Ah.
R:  I don't -- I don't know 'cause there's so many holidays where you get together with family.  I mean, that's like, I guess another reason why, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I like Halloween is 'cause it's not necessarily something where you have to get together with relatives --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you don't necessarily get along with. [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Well, that's true.  You don't have to do the family thing.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's such a hard one.
L:  I don't either.  Um, not off the top of my head.  It's -- yeah, I don't know.  We have [SIGH] -- oh, well we --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- don't have a national dog day.  [COUGH]
R:  That -- that's a good point.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  That is a good point.  Do you have dogs?
L:  [NOISE] Huh?  Oh yeah, I have five.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of dogs do you have?
L:  Ah, two pound puppies and three schnauzers.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I grew up with dogs.  My parents have right now, three labs.  They used to have four but my sister moved out and took hers with her, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I thought four was a m- a bit much.  [LAUGH] I can't imagine --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- having five.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, it -- it's interesting around here especially -- we've -- we've been having a lot of rain here and one of m- one of our dogs, little did we know, does not know how to swim.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And he fell in, um, I'm in the process of making, like, a, oh, a pond area --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- you know, just a small water feature.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he fell in there today and of course schnauzers are pretty close to the ground anyway.  And, ah, couldn't get out and he couldn't swim.  Fortunately we were home and got him, you know, out of there --
R:  Really?
L:  -- before he drowned and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- had to teach him how to swim.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That was different.
R:  [LAUGH] Really?  I don't know that I -- I've ever seen a dog that didn't quite know how to, at least like paddle a little bit, you know?
L:  Well he -- 
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:   -- he just totally freaked and didn't know what to do and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and couldn't get out.
R:  [LAUGH] How funny is that? [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] Poor little guy.
L:  It was pathetic actually.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This real pathetic little thing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He did not know what to do with himself.
R:  That's too cute.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, what would you do on your -- on your dog day holiday?
L:  Well, let's see.  Ah, we could have a parade [COUGH] and everybody could show how cute their babies are.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, make dog treats, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, cheap and inexpensive or something, I don't know.
R:  Oh, I totally hear you.  I grew up around Buffalo and, ah, one of the -- the local supermarkets used to get involved with the SPCA and every summer they would have a day in one of the big parks down town --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and everybody would bring their dog and they would give out little treats and things like that.  And it was -- it was similar to that.  Like a little parade.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There was little outfits on half the dogs, so it was a ton of fun.  I actually worked it a couple of years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I worked for a company that handed out some of the stuff at the things.  But, you know, it was so much fun, all the people bringing their dogs out.
L:  Yeah, we had uh -- here where I live we had a -- they called it, ah, doggy poker.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I said, "What is doggy poker?"  And, ah, the animal shelter humane society, the animal shelter, ran this event, and you would take your dog and you ra- walked for, I think it was, like, a mile and a half or something like that or maybe two miles at the most.  And there were different stations around and when you got to each station you picked out an envelope.  And inside that envelope was a card, a playing card.  [MN] And then when you got back to the animal shelter, you had five envelopes.  And so they'd open the envelopes and see what kind of hand you got.  So it was just total luck of the draw and I think they gave away, like, a hundred dollars or something, for the best hand.
R:  Oh --
L:  And that was --
R:  That's kind of a really good idea though.
L:  Yeah, it made 'em money and it was just fun and everybody was out there with their dogs, walking their dogs and --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and doing that kind of stuff.  So it was -- it was -- it was g- it was fun.  I'd do it again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's -- I think that was the second annual doggy poker.  So I think it --
R:  And now who did that?
L:  It was the, uh, humane society, you know, the animal shelter and the humane society together.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is a great idea.  I've never heard of that before.
L:  Yeah, I hadn't either, and it- it's just kinda interesting to see what you do, you know, you just -- you may get something.  I got nothing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Did you take all five of your dogs?
L:  Ah, that -- no, we just took two.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L: 'Cause there was only two of us.  We weren't -- we got one, um, one of the pound dogs.  She -- you never know how she's gonna be.  Ah, sometimes she's real nice with everybody and the next time she just wants to fight everybody and mess round like that and just be, you know, try to be the boss dog and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, y- you know, it's not a good thing to take her out in public.
R:  They all have their little personalities.  It's so funny how, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ah, my parents' labs, they're all just, you know, there's one really sneaky one and then there's one that just has to have everybody's toy when they're n- you know what I mean?  They -- they'll walk around collecting all the toys and, you know, can't have any of the toys that that dog has.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so funny.  So ...
L:  [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, ours are real funny.  They just totally -- you know, we got one -- we ha- -- we got one schnauzer, we bought him at, like, ah, Pet Land and he had been there for like, four weeks, so he was, like, three -- he was -- maybe he'd been there eight weeks.  And so he's so needy.  He's gotta be petted and reassured all the time because he's just a real needy boy.  And we got another one that, you know, she's just a character, just a total hoot.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you know, they're so -- and the schnauzers are so different from the other dogs because the schnauzers love to eat fruit.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  They'll eat strawberries, bananas, apples.  I mean, to --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to them, that's just a total treat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They will stand there and beg for fruit.
R:  [MN] That's so interesting.  Our d- -- my parents' dogs, like, they won't eat anything green, it's so funny.  Like, you know, you'll -- my brother will feed them grapes and they'll roll them around in their mouth and spit them out.  [LAUGH] It's just so funny to watch them do it but it's just about -- just about anything green they won't eat
