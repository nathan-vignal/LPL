R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes?
R:  My name is Cherie.  What's yours?
L:  Cathy.
R:  Cathy. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm in Georgia.  Where are you from?
L:  Michigan.
R:  Michigan, oh my goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what's the weather up there?
L:  Not very good. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, we're having rain and thunder and storms, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, not very good there either.
R:  Not very good here either. [MN]
L:  So, do you watch reality TV?
R:  No, I do not.
L:  Oh.
R:  I do not like it.  Do you?
L:  Um, some of 'em I like a lot.  I -- I love The Bachelor and The Bachelorette and I love watching American Idol.  Some of 'em I think are kind of stupid though.
R:  Well, that -- that's me.  Now, I have watched American Idol a couple of times and The Bachelor maybe one time. [MN] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But some of those others.  I [MN] -- I told somebody the other day, I said, "Seeing somebody eat bugs or crawl around in snakes is just not my idea of entertainment".
L:  Yeah, that -- that's Fear Factor.  I didn't like that one either but I -- I did like Joe Millionaire.  Did you ever watch that one?
R:  [MN] No, I didn't.  Ah, my daughter in laws did though and they liked it.  [MN] I just -- I don't know, I've just never been able to get into anything like that.  Now, my little grandson likes the Survivor show.
L:  Uh-huh, that's a very popular one.
R:  But I just -- I don't know, I've just never gotten into it.  I -- it  just for some reason doesn't appeal to me.  Bt that's just about all that's on TV now.
L:  I know and -- and there's one that was just coming on tonight that was called, um, [LIPSMACK] Married By America or something --
R:  Um.
L:  -- where America actually picks the two to get married to one another.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, I think that's going a little too far. [LAUGH]
R:  I do too.  Now, if -- if that's the best they can do to find a mate, they're in trouble.  [LAUGH] I don't know what --
L:  You know, these reality shows are very, very popular now.  Um, Joe Millionaire had more viewers watching it when it was first on than any other show, which is amazing.
R:  It really is, because that -- like I say, I wasn't that crazy about that type of show, but evidently everybody else is because, like you say, they are very popular.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I wonder -- I wonder what actually, you know, draws everyone to 'em?
R:  [MN] I don't know, ah, that -- that's [MN] kind of, um, I guess of the amazement with me as to why they're popular, because to me they don't appeal to me, so what -- why is everyone else so, you know, involved with 'em?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they just get really upset with 'em sometimes.
L:  I wonder if people just put themselves in that place and it's more like, um, a fantasy type thing, you know, where -- where they can actually fantasize and pretend that that's them in that -- that actual position or something?
R:  [NOISE] Hm, well, I've never thought about it that way.  Now that may be it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I like soap operas.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  But -- but now to me --
L:  Now, that's not reality TV at all. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's not reality TV and -- and -- and -- well, but to me these reality shows are not really reality either.
L:  No, it's a good point.
R:  I mean, who would -- who would go on TV and have someone else pick a mate for 'em, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I know they -- I think they must have to be desperate or else they're hoping to get a lot of money [LAUGH] out of it or something.
R:  Or -- or like, you know, when they -- like The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, you know, you keep narrowing them down.  I wouldn't want to be under that much scrutiny I guess is what I'm saying.
L:  I know.  I really -- I liked -- I specially liked watching The Bachelorette.  I thought that one was pretty good and she actually picked the guy that I liked the best, too.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But now I wonder if anything will come of it, that -- that's the thing.
L:  Well, they're already engaged, so they -- they've shown 'em on some other shows like, um, Entertainment Tonight and Extra and stuff and, you know, they've caught 'em, like, skiing in Colorado and -- and they said they're just, you know -- they're having a -- a little bit longer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- engagement so they can get to know each other better, but they're definitely going to have a marriage, so ...
R:  Oh, okay, wow, that --
L:  That's, like, the first one of all of those that has a- actually worked out, 'cause the two Bachelor ones didn't, they broke up. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Did they get anything money wise at the end of that, like Jo- Joe Millionaire did?
L:  Yeah, they got a -- they got a million dollars to split between the two of 'em.
R:  Oh, okay.  Now that would be a big incentive. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't think they knew about it.  That was, ah, a, like, a total shock to both of them at the end. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And you could tell they were very surprised.  The producers gave 'em a million dollar check and it was to be split and they -- they had no clue that that was coming.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, now, that [MN] -- that would be a nice surpli- -- surprise, wouldn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And then course if they got married they would have the whole thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Now, the one that --
R:  Course --
L:  The one reality show I really don't understand the rationale for is -- is the Fear Factor.  Why people -- you know one person's going to win money in the ending and that, but why people do get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on there and do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of the ridiculous things they do.  And some of the things I think are actually dangerous.
R:  [MN] Well, they look like it.  Whether they really are o- or they're just made to look that way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] Ah, I'm like you, I -- I d- -- I can't understand why some women would get on the TV and do that.
L:  I know.  I think I've watched that show two or three times and one time they actually had to jump off the back of a boat going forty miles an hour, onto another boat that was going forty miles an hour and, you know -- I mean, they're jumping and they're, like, ten feet apart.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And a couple of them hit those and like flipped back into the water, and I thought, "They could kill themselves, you know, if they hit wrong".
R:  Or end up being paralyzed --
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  -- for the rest of their life.  And would that be worth it? [MN]
L:  I know, I could not believe that they actually had 'em do things like that.
R:  I'm sure they had to sign all sorts of releases and all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, to -- they wouldn't hold the network responsible and all of that.  But sometimes that type of agreements don't hold up in Court so ...
L:  I know.  I know, 'cause I know the one, you could tell he was stunned when he fell back into the water.  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That show doesn't appeal to me.  And -- and Survivor, I've only watched it when it got to the very ending just to see who --
R:  Well, now, that's when I watched it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't -- didn't watch -- didn't watch the others but then my little grandson watched every one of 'em.
L:  Yeah, well, it's like my sister-in-law.  She gets really into it.  She loves the Survivor shows.
R:  And there's one now, something about [MN] Celebrity, something Celebrity, um --
L:  Oh, the Celebri- -- where they have the celebrities out, like, doing stuff.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I only saw like maybe ten minutes of that show but it's like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's all that's on TV now is reality shows.
R:  I know it.  If you -- if you don't watch that, there's not a lot to watch.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, reruns or ... [SIGH]
L:  Right, flip through the channels and that's all there is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think all the networks are just trying to like get in on, you know -- some of 'em become very popular so now they're all --
R:  They're all getting in on it.
L:  They're all trying it.
R:  Trying -- trying to --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- trying to compete and -- and [MN] wha- what they don't know is everybody -- th- -- you know, a lot of people are turning off of all three channels because of that or all the channels.
L:  I know, not even watching. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, I know I'm definitely not, let's put it that way. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that I do some, but it's -- I want to have a variety, I don't want to just have to watch that, you know, I want to watch other things too, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  I think they're getting into it just a little too much.
R:  [MN] I do.  I think they're getting just a little too extreme with it [NOISE] too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think it's -- they have to have more and more things so people will watch it, you know, otherwise they're gonna get bored with it.
R:  And I think they have to get just a little bit more extreme to outdo what they've just did --
L:  Right --
R:  -- or done. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.  To -- to get the audience to come back --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and watch more.  I know.
R:  Ah, to keep -- to keep 'em.  [MN] I- it's kinda like at -- at fights and things like that, you know.  It seems almost like the crowd is bloodthirsty. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, the more dangerous it is the more they want. [SIGH]
L:  But people are like that, I know they are.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, really they are and -- and that's the sad part. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it definitely, definitely is.
R:  [MN] But [MN] I don't know, I just -- like you're saying, ah, that's all that's on TV so you either watch it or you turn it off. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, we just turned it off just before this phone call came through because they had that one, um, Married By America.  I said, "I don't want to watch this, this is stupid".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, America votes on, like, which guy or -- is gonna be engaged to this girl.  Ugh. 
R:  And isn't there one where the parents --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- are picking or -- or [MN] something about the parents of either The Bachelor or The Bachelorette one?  It's -- it's The Bachelor, I think, is supposed to be picking who's -- who's their choice for him.
L:  Yup.  I've -- I've watched that a couple of times just 'cause there was nothing else on to watch and they actually even make 'em go through a, um, lie detector test.
R:  Oh, you're kidding? [LAUGH]
L:  No, and then they ask 'em some, like, really ridiculous questions, you know, and --
R:  How deep into their past does that lie detector go? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, th- -- some of 'em had asked some very, very personal questions about stuff, you know, and I think some of it doesn't even have anything to do with their life now.  If it's something that happened, you know, years ago.  But I don't know.  I know I [MN] -- the one on -- on that one they actually give the couple a trip to Hawaii, that's what they're going for.
R:  Oh, that -- that's the big prize?
L:  Yup.  Just so you can have a date in Hawaii, you know, and they get I don't know how long, just a week, or how long it is but ... I have watched that a couple of times and it -- it's kinda cute to watch.  It's not something I'd -- I would, like, drop everything else for to watch. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Not something you'd make it a point to be in front of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the TV set to watch.
L:  Now, Joe Millionaire I made a point and The Bachelorette, I had to watch that every week. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was there.
R:  I guess that's what they're hoping is that you'll pick one and get hooked on it.
L:  Yup.  It's 'cause once you do, and I started talking to my daughter in California about it, you know, and she started watching and she got hooked on it too, and she didn't like it in the beginning.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  It's like you watch it --
R:  -- maybe I should have give it a chance then.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you watch it and you got to see what happens next.  You know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's sort of like your soap operas, they just, you know, they leave you hanging. [LAUGH]
R:  And so you -- so you want to go back.  Well, I guess that's what it is.  I just didn't watch it long enough. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I think I'd -- I don't think I watched any of the earlier ones, I -- I kinda got in on the last few.  And that was mostly because on Entertainment Tonight they kept having Joe Millionaire --
L:  Constantly, didn't they?
R:  -- on it talking about what's going
