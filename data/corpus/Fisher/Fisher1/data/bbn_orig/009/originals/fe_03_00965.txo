R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi, how are you, my name's Bethany. 
L:  Bethany?
R:  Bethany with a B. 
L:  Hi Bethany, I'm Caroline from California. 
R:  Oh, I'm in California as well. 
L:  What area?
R:  Riverside County. 
L:  Riverside, I'm up north of Sacramento. 
R:  Oh, okay, long ways away. 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, the topic of the hour, well, you know um -- 
L:  Have you flown any?
R:  I have flown since nine eleven a couple of times and I experienced, you know, going through the long lines and what not at the airport and the extra security but [SIGH] I think just like everyone else, I'm questioning whether that security really is heightened. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, when we went it was ... I think it was afterwards, yeah, I think it was last year. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  It was a couple, three months afterwards. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  We went to -- we went to my daughter's in Virginia and it's like the um -- what do you call those guys um -- 
R:  The security. 
L:  The uniforms.
R:  Right.
L:  National guardsmen. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  They were just standing there looking around. 
R:  Right, with their guns. 
L:  I mean it's like they weren't even prepared if anything were to happen, they weren't paying any attention to anything that was going on or anything and they did make -- it was funny, I was in a wheelchair, 'cause I can't walk great distances. 
R:  Yes.
L:  And my husband had pushed me up and he had me hold his coffee and they checked me with their little wand and stuff and all the stuff went through the thing but since I had his coffee I had to taste it and I'm not a coffee drinker. 
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] And it tasted awful, it was absolutely terrible. 
R:  Interesting.  That is interesting.  You were holding his coffee so they made you taste the coffee to make sure it was safe. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Hm.
L:  And it's like uh -- it was just [COUGH] it was just weird. 
R:  Unusual, not something that we expect when we are travelling. 
L:  And they did check some people but -- over at the side but it really didn't make me feel -- you know, it seemed like a joke, it was like they were there just for, for --
R:  For show. 
L:  Just for looks. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, how much long since they put in the dogs and, you know, they seriously started checking the luggage and stuff. 
R:  Right.  Well it's interesting that you say that 'cause I flew actually in and out of Sacramento the following month after the nine eleven event and there was definitely heightened security at the airport and one of the passengers that we were -- one of the people we were travelling with got searched at all three check points.  When they were checking into the airport their bags got searched and when they went to the -- [LIPSMACK] the detector that you walk through, they got checked there and when they got to the gate they had to have -- be searched at the gate as well before they got on the plane and this is your average every day caucasian female.  So we were all kind of blown away that she got searched -- you know, got checked three separate times.
L:  The same here --
R:  And she was so embarrassed because she was like the lead of the conference that we had gone to so here's all the people that we had been at the conference with and she's being checked.  So, you know, I thought that was interesting and then I also travelled to Hawaii just last June and on my flight out, you know, there was extra security at the airport down in Ontario but I didn't feel like it was very strict at that point at all and then on the way there I had a corkscrew, a wine bottle opener in my purse and on the way back from Hawaii to come back to the States they caught it in the detector and they took it from me. 
L:  A bottle of wine?
R:  No, a wine -- a corkscrew. 
L:  A corksc- oh, yeah. 
R:  A wine opener I had in my purse but I had travelled with it or, excuse me, with it in my purse from California to Hawaii and on the way back they confiscated it so they said, "Sorry, I'm sorry, you can't take this with you". 
L:  They told me -- I put all my stuff in carry on.  
R:  Right.
L:  Have you heard about the lady knitting an Afghan, the granny knitting an Afghan?
R:  No. 
L:  They took her knitting needles away. 
R:  Oh, heaven's to Betsy. 
L:  They thought she was knitting an Afghan. 
R:  Oh, shee. 
L:  It's a joke. 
R:  Oh, that's not --
L:  I said it wrong. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How funny. 
L:  Yeah, it was right after nine eleven sometime, it was just like -- it was scary though, my God, you know, it was just the whole idea but then I just prayed and I figured well when it's our time it's our time. 
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean fear definitely plays a big factor in the whole scenario and bit, especially with all the rumors running around that there's going to be something else, there's other -- that there's another chance of another attack and that they had other things planned, I'm sure, it definitely makes you worry and be concerned about security when you're travelling, it does for me. 
L:  Yeah.  I'm like um, you know, it's like everyday life.  It's like -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  When we went to Sacramento, because we are mystery shoppers, and when we went to Sacramento to do some work my daughter's like "Be careful, stay away from the airport, stay away from these business areas", you know.  I'm like, I can't run my life in fear. 
R:  No. [NOISE]  
L:  You can't --  
R:  No.
L:  Do that, you've just got to keep going. 
R:  That's true. 
L:  And that. 
R:  [NOISE] It's definitely an interesting subject. 
L:  Yeah, I wish it seemed more real.  You know, I mean the security. 
R:  Right. 
L:  I wish now maybe -- maybe now it is.  You know, when I flew we thought it was a joke. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  We didn't think it was any more secure than it had been any other time in our lives that we had flewn, flown. 
R:  Okay.  No, I definitely felt like that security had been heightened [NOISE] but again, like you said with the national guardsmen being at the airport [NOISE] that almost made me more fearful than safe. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because these guys at the airport with guns, I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh if someone does pull something we are going to have a gun battle in here and if there's a bomb what in the world good is a guy with a gun gonna do you.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean honestly.  Maybe that's just my sideways way of looking at it but I'm thinking what difference is it going to make [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- if there is a hundred guys with guns.  If someone has a bomb and they want to do something they will be able to do it.  God willing they would not be able to get on a plane again -- 
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Like they did before.
L:  Maybe they figured the bomb -- if they had a gun they could keep 'em off. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Stop them from getting on the plane with a gun, you know, blow 'em up before they got there or something. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, it's the thing that, you know, if they actually did anything, if they saw him it's like -- I don't know, I think the military is more likely to do it though than our regular police are. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Because the military guys are more trained to actually go get 'em and the police have more into the thing [NOISE] is if I miss he's going to sue me, 'cause the way they get off so much now, the criminals, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The police have to be careful of being sued if they actually did -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- any damage to 'em, you know.  It's like when your home invasion robberies, you know, protecting your home.  It's like if you don't shoot 'em and kill 'em then they're going to come back and sue you for shooting 'em when they are in your house, you know. 
R:  Oh, it is crazy. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, I think there's definitely more work to be done I think on airport security.  I think that they can definitely -- there's definitely more focus that can go in there.  I know we have much more technology.  We don't need guys with guns, we have better technology than that but, you know, I don't know what the answer is because that's money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] That's a lot of money to put that kind of technology in all of our major --
L:  I like the idea that they have got the dogs in their now. 
R:  Sure, sure. 
L:  Especially the dogs.  I mean now I'm one that, um, ... [COUGH] I'm one that [COUGH] when I was in high school they had race riots on campus and the only time I felt safe was when the policemen are there.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yet the other students were madder, people -- somebody was mad, probably people off campus, because the police were on campus. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, because of the police presence but yet a lot of the time we felt safe was [NOISE] when we were there and sometimes, you know, the sight of a policeman we are trained to think we are safer even if it, you know, didn't do us any good because it didn't really look like they were seriously watching what they were doing. 
R:  Right. Mhm. 
L:  So what do you do?
R:  I'm actually a student and I do also mystery shop. 
L:  Have you?  Are you on Lila's list?
R:  I'm sorry? 
L:  Are you on Lila's list, in Lila's lounge --
