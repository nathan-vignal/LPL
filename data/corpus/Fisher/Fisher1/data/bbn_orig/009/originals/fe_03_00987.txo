L:  Hi, my name's Sharon.
R:  Hi, my name is Debbie.
L:  Um, where are you at?  I'm in Vancouver, Washington.
R:  I'm in Greenvale, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, well nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Um, I'm going to have to [NOISE] almost claim ignorance a little bit on bioterrorism.  I'm a kind of a -- I'm a stay at home mum so I don't -- haven't kept up a whole lot on -- on even what it is, um, I don't know if it's -- if it's talking or maybe it's general, if it's chemical or if it's, uh, the disease that they're talking about. [NOISE]  What do you think on that?
R:  I believe it's probably chemical.
L:  The chemical?
R:  I believe it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean that's just my own belief.  I don't know what they're talking about, but [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I don't know really either.
R:  -- I think bioterrorism in my mind is [NOISE] chemical warfare.
L:  Um, what do you think -- where do you think [NOISE] anthrax, [NOISE] is that considered a chemical?  
R:  I would think that would fall in that category.
L:  Yeah, where smallpox would be the -- would be a different one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] Right.  
L:  Um -- 
R:  Well, I d -- it might be -- 
L:  I mean I don't think our government's, um, prepared for as far as if w if it's going to take place [NOISE], you know, what protocol would need to be done at the local level [NOISE] to -- 
R:  Mm, I -- 
L:  -- prevent it.
R:  I don't think it's fathomable in the --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- United States of America.
L:  I don't either.  I think that, um, our government even thinks that there's a way to prevent it, I'm not sure that it -- that there is [NOISE].  I don't know if it's just something that will happen whether we want it to or not, or if it's more of a threat, um, use of a threat from these other countries.
R:  I believe that it could happen.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I believe strongly that it could [COUGH] as in, um, uh, [NOISE] my phone is crazy, I don't know what that's about.
L:  I do think it's easier for that -- for this kind of a threat more even so than the [MN] World Trade Centre tragedy.
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  Because it c I mean you can get a little charter plane and, you know, and dump, you know, dump something off, there's no [NOISE] you know, these people they access or whoever doesn't have to crash the plane or, you know, they can go home.
R:  You could have a crop duster -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and do that.
L:  I think its, um, airport security has improved quite a bit and the -- I think the Federal Government has done a good, you know, maybe a good part on doing that but I think they have almost [NOISE] it -- maybe [NOISE] they make the population feel like its -- they're doing something, but yet the, um, the bioterrorism -- 
R:  I think that's like having a burglar alarm in your house.  It's a false sense of secu- -- of security.
L:  It is.  I think it is too.
R:  I don't think, I'm not quite sure that I agree [NOISE] about that but -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't -- I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know if the President if we go into this war, if, um, with Iraq, if I'm not sure, I mean I'm almost afraid to have us do that and I'm al I'm even afraid of our military being, you know, out of our country and being [NOISE] where they can be exposed to all these different agents too.
R:  Well, and -- and if you -- if you want to go even farther and think about it, there possibly could be people in our military that were the same kind of people that were US citizens -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that bombed the World Trade Centre as well.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I mean how -- I'm not quite [NOISE] 
L:  That's true.  There's um, I mean there's no -- 
R:  -- check identification for people that are -- are in our military.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  There's no way to know.
R:  How long do you have to be a US citizen or, you know, on and on and on.  If you are, can -- can you join the military and you probably can.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I mean in our [MN] as a country we can't, [NOISE] you know, back down I think from the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from these radical, you know, the other countries that are -- and I do, I mean I don't think Saddam Hussein should be allowed to, you know, they've got evidence of any kind of, um, nuclear weapons or -- and they've been stockpiling, you know, they've shown since the mid nineties, I guess [NOISE] that he's been stockpiling, you know, all the different things it takes to -- to make those bombs or dirty bombs or whatever, however they distr- -- you know, distribute those.
R:  As a mother of young children you must be terrified.
L:  It is, it is scary and we try -- we don't talk about it with them and, because you don't -- they really can't absorb a whole lot -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're little and you don't want to get into the panic of, you know, stockpiling duct tape but yet you want to be prepared because I think that you have to be, um, somewhat prepared but the only -- the only information that I gain is what you hear on the news and I don't, I mean I -- 
R:  I'm not quite sure that that's always the true information.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ahah. [NOISE] 
L:  It's kind of like the newspaper.  You read it but you don't really know if it's true.
R:  Right.  Well, [MN] I think [MN] that probably most of what you read is not -- it -- it's for a readership. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  For that you always kind of wonder, you know, how much, you know, Meredith[?] is all this taking and -- but I do think [NOISE] we have to be, you know, prepared.  I was reading something, oh, I don't know, a week ago where somebody was saying, you know, we -- we probably never need to let -- let our guard down so we're not prepared to be [inaudible], you know, barricade ourselves in our homes for a week, we should have whatever we need not even knowing if that's going [NOISE] to be any good to us.
R:  On bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the -- I think the, um, if it's an anthrax or a -- the -- I mean when you find out that you -- you have anthrax people think you have the flu --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something, so that -- I know it throws everybody off, I know, that my husband is in the medical industry and I know that they're not trained, they've just barely touched the topic, you know.
R:  Because it's unfathomable -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for -- for us as Americans to comprehend that.
L:  It is.
R:  It's unfathomable.  [MN] I mean I -- I don't even [NOISE] if you knew and someone said, um, we're -- there -- we have war that there is going to be a biological warfare -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- within forty eight hours and it's going to hit Washington State or North Carolina -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as in us [NOISE] how could you prepare?  How -- I mean duct tape isn't -- 
L:  I'd be praying.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Really.
L:  I'd be praying really, really hard.
R:  There you go.  I mean --
L:  I mean I don't -- that's my view.
R:  It goes back to basics and I'm not quite sure.  I -- I mean the only thing [NOISE] the only thing the war would do in my opinion is to reinforce it, you know, that -- that we're very strong, as Americans we're very strong people -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and very proud people but does that stop anything now?  It didn't stop nine eleven.  
L:  No, and --
R:  -- didn't stop anthrax. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, that's very true.  [NOISE]  I think that, um, these other -- the thinking of the [MN] in the Middle Eastern countries, their thinking is so different from ours because of -- their countries are different, their living's different.
R:  It's inbred in 'em.
L:  I mean even don't -- they don't -- they don't care the way we care about, you know, some things [NOISE] but yet there's, you know, little villages.  They've got, you know, babies and kids and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're -- I'm sure they're very afraid too of the prospect of the war and -- 
R:  Well, maybe that's what, you know, maybe as Americans we should focus on those types of things, too, to make it for comforting to us.
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  I have adult children. 
L:  -- they're not all the terrorists that you see, you know, on TV and the -- and the men and there's, you know, mamas and grammas and babies.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  And that's sad, too.
R:  They're still ch children are children, no matter where they're from.
L:  [inaudible] Exactly.
R:  And families are families no matter where they're from.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm not quite sure how you go about that.  I do believe that [NOISE] probably need to make a stand with regard to war -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I hate to even think of myself saying that because I have adult sons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I certainly would never want to live to see them have to go to a war, but [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- 
R:  I don't think that it's a frivolous war and -- and I guess back to the subject of bioterrorism I believe is what we're supposed to be talking about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think we're prepared.
L:  No, I don't and I don't know what -- I don't know what our government can do to prevent that I think is what [NOISE] I don't know what they want us to discuss, too, and -- and I don't know what the government can do.  I don't know what -- what's even an option that's available.
R:  Well -- 
L:  Um, I mean we can't cower.
R:  I would guess from in the beginning would be, um, and what I would think and -- and I could be totally off base and maybe you can help me with that is [NOISE] with regard to our medical field being trained properly -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how fast can you train someone.  If you -- I mean, an MD has to go to school for twelve years, fifteen, sixteen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How fast can they be trained in [NOISE] in bioterrorism.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you can't.  I mean you can't do it in a short amount of time.
L:  It's actually, um, you can't predict what it -- if it's bioterrorism or not and if there's no, you know, because the symptoms are so, they cross over to other things, to a lesser [MN] you know, they're not going to know that it's a -- unless it's a nerve, I don't know, a nerve kind of, um, destruction, something like that, but a lot of these things that doesn't sound like it -- they start affecting your body for two or three days.  There are some that are, you know, the plague or there's so many different things that happen to our bodies that it would be [NOISE] hard to know what they're treating and then they're breathing, you know, the same things and [SIGH] I don't even know where they can -- where they can start.  We're -- I would be in a mode of panic all the time and we -- I don't think we as Americans we want -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- we want -- we won't live like that as Americans.
R:  No.  We can't.
L:  We just won't do it.
R:  We can't.  We [NOISE]
L:  No [NOISE] so I don't -- I wouldn't want that load that our President has on his shoulders.
R:  No, I certainly wouldn't either.
L:  And --
