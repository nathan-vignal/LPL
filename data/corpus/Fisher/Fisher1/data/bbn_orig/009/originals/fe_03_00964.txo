L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Veevee[?]
R:  My name is Stanley Bush.
L:  I'm sorry, what was it?
R:  Stanley Bush.
L:  Stanley, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  And we're supposed to talk about airport security?
R:  Yes. 
L:  Okay.  Go ahead.
R:  Ah, what do you think about airport security at this moment?
L:  Well, I think it's probably a pretty good idea with everything that's going on in the world.  What do you think?
R:  I think i- -- [MN] I think really it's kinda too late.
L:  Too late?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, we've certainly had disasters.  You know, a year and a half ago everything --
R:  Yeah.  Plus a -- ah, me, I think they public [inaudible] the public.  We talk too much about what we're gonna do.
L:  Oh yeah, that's true, that's really true.  Because, you know, you see it on the news and they -- and, you know, they're watching the news just like we are.
R:  Mm.  So they, like, anything we seem to know that we're gonna do it like security wise, they would know anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that give 'em a chance to, ah, bypass it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's probably true.
R:  And I think, ah -- I also think, ah, you know, our rights, you know, to, ah, you know, privacy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I think they've been violated too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause like they got security now where they can see everything straight through you. 
L:  Well that's pretty bad too, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  To y- to, you know to the skeleton bone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's invading privacy.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I think you're right.  They're looking at ways to get around it because they know what we're doing and that guy with the bomb in his shoe, he came from France.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So all they have to do is come from a different country instead of coming from the US, and then they just -- you know, it doesn't matter what we do 'cause France didn't screen 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or whatever it was.  [MN] I think he came through France or England and they didn't screen him, and that he was on his way to Chicago or somewhere like that.
R:  Well, I think if they're going to, um, [LIPSMACK] beef up security, you know, then that should, um, open more jobs up for people also.
L:  You mean like at airport security?
R:  But I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause, you know, they're going to do more airport security and that, you know, that gonna put a lot of strain on a lot of people that already there for security.
L:  Mhm, that's true.
R:  Plus the thing is, you know, a lotta airports going bankruptcy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [inaudible] even though I don't really think people are really looking for, you know, trying to catch a plane. [NOISE] 
L:  That's right.
R:  You know?
L:  That's right.
R:  [NOISE] And that one thing I did not agree with, that a pilot having a gun.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause a p- a pilot can't do nothing, really --
L:  No.
R:  -- 'cause he's flying a plane.
L:  That's right and somebody could get the gun away from him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they would have the gun.
R:  Plus they p- you know, advertised that on the news --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- where a pilot's going to start carrying a gun, so that's like telling them, "Okay we got a pilot going to have a gun".
L:  Mhm, that's pretty scary.
R:  And plus if he shoots the gun and it penetrates the airplane --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, then there's more disaster.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think they should do a better w- [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  Have you flown on an airplane since, um, nine eleven?
R:  No.
L:  [MN]  I've flown --
R:  I haven't been on a plane since then. 
L:  Mhm, yeah, a lot of people are avoiding it now.  We were -- ah, my husband and I were going on vacation and, um, they stopped l- little kids.  An- and I know you could put a bomb on a little kid if you wanted to but that's not the people who we need to watch out for.  And they were stopping old ladies and stuff, just like you hear on the news, they were stopping people like that.  And they're letting other people go through who looked a lot more suspicious to us.
R:  Mm.
L:  There was a guy getting on the plane behind us and he was -- apparently he had some sort of mental condition and he was like, muttering and spluttering to himself --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and everything, like a -- like a kind of a mentally disturbed person.  And they didn't stop him, he just walks right on and -- not to say that he's a terrorist but he could have had -- you know, he could've kinda gone crazy and tried to hurt somebody.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And they didn't stop him and then they were stopping little kids.
R:  [MN] They were stopping little kids?
L:  Mhm, [MN] little kids, little kids with -- checking out their stuffed toys and stuff.
R:  [MN] 
L:  So maybe they need to do some, I don't know, thinking about who they're stopping or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, I understand like, the one guy they stopped going on had a knife in his umbrella.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah, he got on board with it.
L:  I didn't hear about that.
R:  When he got to where he was going, near where he was going, then they caught him.
L:  So that was too late.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  It would've been too late anyway.
R:  [NOISE] You know, but the only -- you could make a weapon without, um, using metal though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, still, you know, bypass their security.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure that you could really -- if you were really bent on it you could use your shoe string to choke somebody or, you know, anything.
R:  [MN] You know, y- you're talking about a pilot having a gun, you -- you could use something else and if you get the gun away from him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] -- you know.  I just think they should not advertise about what they gonna do with airport security.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just keep it between the, ah, people who're doing security. 
L:  That's probably a good idea, I think that's right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know anybody who works for, um, airport security, do you?
R:  No.
L:  No.  I guess they were going to be hiring some new people.  But I don't know if they did or they just changed the jobs, the existing jobs over to federal jobs 'cause that's --
R:  Well they -- I guess they gonna, um, do a lot of background checks [NOISE] also with people, y- you know [NOISE] before they hire --
L:  That's probably a good thing.
R:  -- security 'cause I -- you know, a security guard can, um, you can pay h- someone off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, easily.
R:  Then, you know, they can plant something you know, someone could come pick it up.  
L:  Mhm, yeah.  I'm certain they're going to get -- think of ways to get around it if they want to.
R:  But I think [inaudible] should -- should, you know, not publicize on the news about what they gonna do about security wise for the airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, just keep it a hush hush.
L:  Right.
R:  You know. 
L:  That'd probably be a better idea.
R:  Then the people just have to deal with it, you know, when they go into the airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Long as they don't say nothing, you know.
L:  I guess that's what people were complaining about, the lines being so long at the airport.
R:  [MN] Yeah, a lot of delays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Having to take off their shoes and stuff.  But you know what?  If it saves their lives I think that's probably worth it.  [MN] You just have to leave earlier to get to the airport, get where you're going.
R:  Yeah, a lot of people would be in a rush, wait till the last minute then want to try and get up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then when they get down there, when they get checked for -- you know, through security, then, um, then they're complaining 'cause they had to be there so long. 
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN] But I figure they should do -- have, [MN] you know, figure better ways, you know.
L:  You agree with the background checks though?
R:  The background checks?  Yes.
L:  [MN] On the people, the people who work there?
R:  [MN] Yeah, but you o- you have to have a bad background if you're surely gonna do something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they find the people they had for the planes, you know, they brought 'em in, took 'em to sch- -- you know, went to school and everything. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but they had a -- you know, they knew what they wanted to do.  They had clean backgrounds.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know.
L:  Mm.
R:  And still, you know, did nine eleven.
L:  That's right.
R:  But the thing is, I don't know why people, [MN] you know, [NOISE] you know, I don't know.  It's just hard, you know, how they having things now, they just making it harder.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to me they just, [NOISE] you know, talk too much.  You know, I've been in the military for eight years.  [NOISE] To me they just talk too much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- about what they gonna do instead of doing it.
L:  Are you in the military right now?
R:  [MN] I'm trying to go back.
L:  Oh, okay.  What branch?
R:  [MN] Army. [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.  So you're trying to see if you can get back in?
R:  Yeah.  Already getting my paper -- trying to get my paperwork together.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even this time of everything going on, that's why you want to go back?  Because of a- all the -- the war coming up?
R:  No, it's just how things are at this moment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Mhm.  Is that your best decision for right now?
R:  [NOISE] Female.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, oh, we're talking about the wrong thing.  [LAUGH] Well, we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] I can't think of anything more to say about it.  [MN] Let me see.  Um.  [NOISE] Um, well, [MN] I know, um, my husband and I have actually been to a foreign country s- I mean, it's not a big foreign country but it's the Bahamas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, since nine eleven and, um, it seemed real easy for Americans to get back into the country, which is fine, you know, it's -- they had two different lines, one for a passport -- if a -- ah American passport, and one for a non American passport.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And our line went real fast.  And that's -- that's okay, except for I suppose a terrorist could get an American passport.  I don't know, they could probably fake one.
R:  How was the security on the, um, overseas?
L:  It wasn't bad at all.
R:  The airport security?
L:  It wasn't bad at all.  It was pretty lax 'cause we were coming on and I guess they just figured we're all Americans and, you know, nobody wants to attack the Bahamas.  So I guess they feel like they're not at risk.  So there was, um, you know, there w- there was really hardly any to tell you the truth.  And -- but I -- you know, I don't think that they're -- they're probably right, the terrorists don't have any reason to target them because it's America that they're mad at.
R:  [NOISE] Mm. 
L:  Not, ah, not the Bahamas.
R:  You heard anything lately on the security?  [NOISE] The -- any updates on airport security?
L:  Mm, no, not lately, and you'd think you would because of the, you know, probably things are going to start happening maybe in about a week.  You know, 'cause that's what Bush is saying, that there might be a war in about a week.  [MN] You'd think that.  I work at a VA hospital and they're talking about, um, a red alert coming up pretty soon.  You know, th- you have all those different levels of alert?
R:  Yes.
L:  And we were on orange alert for a while but now we've gone back down to -- and that's like a medium level and we've gone do- back down to, like, hardly any.  But they're talking about going up to the highest level.  So that's about the only thing I've heard.  I suppose if we're on high level, ah, airports are on a high level too, high level alert.  [MN]  So, but that's, you know, that's probably going to be in about a week from now.
R:  [MN] How about the, um, you hear about the n- -- um, that new sc- -- um, [MN] the new detector they have?
L:  Uh-uh. 
R:  The one when they, ah, you walk through it screens your whole body?
L:  Yeah, I heard about that a -- a while ago.  Is there something new on that or are th- are they actually using that?
R:  [MN] I head they was doing tests on it.  They had it o- o- at one airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's all I heard of it. 
L:  And i- they didn't say whether it was um
