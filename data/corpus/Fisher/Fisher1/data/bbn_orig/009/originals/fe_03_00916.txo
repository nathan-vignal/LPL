L:  Hello?
R:  [MN] Hello?
L:  Ah, my name's Alexis --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what's yours?
R:  Um, this is Caitlin.  [MN] Where do you live?
L:  [MN] I live in Ontina[?], Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, I'm from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay, I know where that is.
R:  Um, I guess our topic is reality TV.
L:  Yes, yes.  I love reality TV shows.
R:  [LAUGH] I do, too.  [MN] 
L:  Uh-uh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I, uh --
L:  That's crazy, which ones do you watch?
R:  I'm really nervous. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You're nervous?  Why are you nervous?
R:  I don't know, um, [MN] well, I watched every single episode of Joe Millionaire --
L:  Did you?
R:  Did you?
L:  Yes.  Well, okay, see I am on a dance troupe at -- at college and --
R:  Oh, awesome --
L:  Yeah, and I --
R:  I'm thinking about joining one too actually.
L:  Oh, that would be awesome.
R:  All right, sorry.  You can go ahead.
L:  Um --
L:  Okay.  So, I didn't get to see all of the episodes but I would always make sure I knew who got kicked off and everything.  And I hated the girl with the, ah, bushy brow- -- black hair.
R:  Oh, I know  --
L:  What was her name?
R:  Oh, what -- Melissa.
L:  Melissa.
R:  Melissa.
L:  I hated Melissa.
R:  I hated her.  Oh, my God.
L:  And Mo Jo?  We hated Mo Jo too.  We must say.
R:  Yeah, the girl with the poem?  The love poem?
L:  Yeah, yes, she was --
R:  She was freaky.
L:  She was conceited, very conceited.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I'm so glad that Zora won.
L:  I know , I know.
R:  She was so right for him.
L:  But I heard that they aren't together any more.
R:  [MN] What?
L:  I heard that --
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  I heard that Joe and Zora aren't together any more.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  Kinda crazy.
R:  Well, I'd heard that the -- The Bachelor guy wasn't with Helene.
L:  Helene?
R:  Erin and Helene broke up.  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah, I didn't like Helene.  I thought that he should have chosen --
R:  Brooke?
L:  Not Brooke but the one before Brooke.  I forget her name.
R:  Oh, I do not remember.  I didn't -- I didn't watch that one as much.
L:  Oh, you didn't?  You didn't?
R:  No.  [NOISE]
L:  I did watch The Bachelorette.  I really liked that one and I was very surprised she picked Ryan.
R:  I only watched that a few times.
L:  Didn't you like it? [MN]
R:  It was -- I just couldn't really get into it.  I don't think I -- I didn't watch the first --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- episode and then -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wasn't really interested after that as much, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.  So [NOISE] -- yeah, but that was a really good one.  However, I think I like The Bachelor better than The Bachelorette.
R:  I will agree with that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't like critiquing, like, all of the different guys.  I'd rather critique, like, girls.  I'd rather watch --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the g- -- The Bachelor, like, kick girls off and stuff because they're not, like, I understand girls better and I know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, which ones [LAUGH] he should be pick- -- like, kicking off and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's -- that's why I like The Bachelor too.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, [NOISE] did you -- I'm eating right now, I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's okay.  I'm --
L:  I mean -- I mean --
R:  -- [MN] having a Pepsi.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Fun.  [NOISE]  Pepsi's good.
R:  So, how old are you?  Do you go to college or anything?
L:  I am nineteen years old and I go to college.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  I go to college too.  I'm eighteen.
L:  Eighteen?  When's your birthday?
R:  October third, nineteen eighty four.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] My friend's is on October second.
R:  Are we going to get in trouble for not talking about our topic?
L:  I think we need to talk about it.
R:  Yeah, we should talk about it.  So what do you think?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That reality sho- -- do you think they will continue to be popular in the future?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I do too.
L:  Well, I watch other ones too.
R:  Real World was, like, it's had how many seasons?
L:  Yeah, Real World --
R:  Like, so many.
L:  Real World, I think, is like the original s- -- the original --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- re -- reality TV show.
R:  I -- I agree.  That -- that was, like, the first one on MTV.
L:  Yeah.  And I've al- -- I really w- -- enjoy watching that.  However the drama in that is crazy.  I would never ever want to go on it.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  I watch Survivor, too.
R:  Survivor --
L:  I was really big on Survivor for a while.
R:  My parents watch that a lot.
L:  My mom --
R:  I never really did.
L:  My mom still watches that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  And I really, really wanted to go on it but [MN] I'm a diabetic --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and I don't think I would be able to go on it because of being diabetic, but I think that --
R:  Now are you type one or type two?
L:  I have type one diabetes.
R:  Oh, [MN] that sucks.
L:  Mhm.  So [NOISE] I don't know, but --
R:  Survivor was pretty interesting, had a few good, like, challenges that they had to do.
L:  Yeah, I think it's -- they burn out on that, though.
R:  They what?
L:  Survivor.  They burn out on it.
R:  Oh, y- -- yeah.
L:  Like, like, the public's burning out on it.
R:  I can see that.  Well, we're talking about reality TV in my one class right now , my mass --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- communications class .  And th- -- my teacher thinks that they'll continue to be -- get more popular --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they're so cheap to make because they don't pay the people.
L:  Mhm.
L:  They don't pay actors, so they save a lot of money but they still get, like, so many ratings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's crazy.
L:  And it's weird because, like, I think once you watch, like, the first episode it's always about, like, elimination and that's what gets the viewers hooked too.
R:  Yeah, I got --
L:  Because, like --
R:  -- I got hooked on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  ABC Family always had marathons and even if I'd already seen, like, The Bachelor, I would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, I would be, like, "I don't remember who he kicks off this time" so I'd have to watch it.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  It's addictive.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and they just get people to come back every week because of the suspense of everything, [NOISE] you know?
R:  Yeah, and that, like, yeah, they'll have, like, review shows, like Joe Millionaire.  They made us wait, like, an extra week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, they always do these little tricks to get us to, like, keep tuning in.
L:  Mhm, mhm [NOISE] mhm.
R:  They're so sneaky.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know.  Um, I never really watched The Mole.
R:  I didn't either.
L:  I think I've -- I think I've watched it, like, one time.  I didn't really understand it.  I think they're like --
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  You had to, like, figure out who the mole was or something.  But I've als- -- and what's that one that was always, ah, what was it called?  Cele- -- oh, it was Celebrity Mole.  Never mind.
R:  Celebrity Mole I had in the background --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of what I was doing one time and I was just, like, annoyed with it.  It didn't make sense --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, we [LAUGH] had it on and it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I wasn't paying attention but that one --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  That one, like, no one really -- no one I know really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watches that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  M- most people I know have watched [LAUGH] Joe Million- -- I mean, my boyfriend even watches [LAUGH] Joe Million- -- or did watch Joe Millionaire [SIGH].
L:  Yeah.  Um, comparing Joe Millionaire to Bachelorette, though, the girls on that seemed to be very, very petty, like, they had a lot, like, very materialistic and petty girls.
R:  You mean, like The Bachelor?  Like, all the contestants?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.
L:  The contestants were completely different.
R:  I agree.  I was -- I was thinking about that the one time, because the contestants on the one show not only were, um, more, like, petty and stuff.  I thought on The Bachelor they were a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more attractive.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  -- and, like, classier seeming.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  Whereas, like, on Joe Millionaire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they seemed like skanks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not all of them but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the way they were acting was a little bit, like, more immature.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  [MN] And I wonder --
R:  I noticed that.
L:  I wonder, like, who picks the people that they put on it.  You know what I mean, like?
R:  Yeah.  I -- well, they said --
L:  And how do they read the people, like, and what they're like?  Do they have to take, like, personality tests, or what?  Come in.  [NOISE]
R:  Whoever did the ones for Bachelor, I think, did a great job, because the g- -- I could deal with those girls, like --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- there weren't girls that I hated, really.
L:  Yeah, uh huh.
R:  I mean, some.  But on Joe Millionaire, I, like -- I really didn't know who -- which one I would like because they all had little perks, like, about them that were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --just like --
L:  E- except for Zora.
R:  Yeah, except for Zora.  Zora had, like, was flawless, she's perfect.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's a good person, like, Melissa -- I mean, all of 'em -- almost all of 'em smoked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cigarettes, which --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, isn't --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE] isn't exactly good for you. 
R:  Yeah.  And they all, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I couldn't believe when they crashed that girl's date, Zora's date.
L:  That was really rude, that was very rude.
R:  That would never happen on The Bachelor.
L:  And he was a jerk about it.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.  I agree.
L:  [NOISE]  Like, he was, like, "I think she is a little upset but, hey, you know what --"
R:  Yeah, he didn't --
L:  "-- I'm in the hot tub with all these girls."
R:  Right, right, he took advantage of the situation totally.
L:  And I totally [MN] thought that they were going to trick America. [NOISE]
R:  What do you mean?
L:  [MN] I'm, like, "Is this going to be a trick to America that he was really a millionaire?"
R:  Oh.  [MN] But no one --
L:  But I guess they kinda did 'cause they gave 'em a million dollars at the end, you know?  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  That surprised me.  I mean, I -- I knew it would be a good twist, like, that they were saying, but I just didn't -- I didn't think they would have like, "Oh well --"
L:  [MN]
R:  -- this didn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I -- I just had a good feeling --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- about it.
L:  Oh.  I have another thing, too.  Okay, the thing about them being, like, real -- like reality TV shows, like, [MN] um, I know there's this new show coming up, like, kind of like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Bachelor and Bachelorette.  How they --
R:  Married By America.
L:  Married By America.  That is so unrealistic.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L: Like I really -- and I'm sure I'll watch it but the --
R:  I do-  -- I refuse.
L:  -- fact that you, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fall in love on America and people picked your spouse, that's, like, why the divorce rate is so high.
R:  I know.
L:  And also --
R:  I- -- that tells other cultures that America is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't care about our marriage.  And, you know --
L:  And love, mhm.
R:  Other -- other countries tune into our programming and they're going to be, like, "Oh, these Americans --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think that th- there's no value placed on marriage."  Except, you know, sometimes there's, like, arranged marriages --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, in cultures.  But this -- this is out of hand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't think I want to give that show ratings, like, it'll really make a difference.
L:  True, true.
R:  But I -- I was actually annoyed when I saw that commercial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, when it came on, I was just, like, "How far is this
