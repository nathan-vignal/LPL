L:  [MN] Hi, this is Chuck. [MN]
R:  Hi, this is Annette.
L:  [MN] Uh, say again?
R:  Um, yeah.  So, ah, so which reality shows do you watch?
L:  Well, my room mate is a, ah, he is a reality show junkie.  We've had to watch, uh, uh, Bachelor, Bachelorette, Survivor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, ah, [LIPSMACK] Who Wante- -- Who Wants To Marry, ah, Jo- Joe Millionaire, we watched a few times.
R:  Yeah.  I've watched every single reality show myself that exists. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my golly gee.
R:  So I'm a big junkie myself, I love reality.
L:  Holy.  [MN] call -- call -- call -- call her Ms Reality.
R:  Oh yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, we- we- we-
R:  I don't miss any of them. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what do you think of them?
R:  I love them.  I mean, it -- it's just something different, you know.  Regular TV you've got scripts, people telling you what to say.  Reality is real people, just like our neighbors, you know, our relatives, and it's people doing real things.  That's what attracts my attention, you know?
L:  Well, I -- I -- I don't know, I mean, I watched this -- this, um, Joe Millionaire thing and you've got this really studly guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and these twenty gorgeous women, I mean ...
R:  Right.
L:  That's -- th- the g- -- I -- I don't know any girls [MN] well, maybe one girl at work, [LAUGH] that comes close to that.  I mean, they're all models, ah, actors, actresses.
R:  Well, yeah, they -- they -- of course they selectively [MN] -- was really selective about the women on that show and --
L:  Yes.
R:  That's more for just entertainment purposes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, in my -- in my opinion that's more like a TV that they're -- they're telling 'em what to do, even though it's real people, they are, like you said they're -- they're more selective with those shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that is just more for just laughable.  You know, "Ha, this is funny.  I can't believe that people would be ch- -- pining over somebody like this".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So that's the reason I like those, just for the pure fact that I can't believe people would do this, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh --
R:  So that's what drives that.
L:  Now -- now, what do you -- have you thought of Survivor so far?
R:  Um, it depends on the season.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Each season is different.  The last season I did not enjoy.  It was rather boring.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I stuck through it.  You know, I -- I'm just that -- I'm loyal to a show.  If I like the first two or three seasons I'm gonna stick with it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and try another one.  And, ah, this season I like it again.  It's --
L:  Well, I, ah, I --I like the fact -- I liked, you know -- I watched the first Survivor mostly all the way through and, ah, I like when they have people on there, like, ah, well, I li- -- I liked Rudy ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Because he was -- he was a regular kinda guy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, when you think of a survivor, that's what I think of. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  He could've [LAUGH] survived anything, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  I w- -- I do wish they would do it a little bit more survivalistic towards personally --
L:  Right, where --
R:  Everything is such a group effort but that doesn't mean you can actually survive.  What if you went out there and -- and had them ha- had to make their own beds, you know?
L:  [MN] Sure, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I mean, that's one thing I think that if they did a reality show they could improve on it by simply making it be more of a personal issue with Survivor --
L:  [inaudible] yeah.
R:  -- who really are true survivors --
L:  Yeah. it's --
R:  -- you know.
L:  It's now more like Gilligan's Island.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's just, "Ha ha".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Although this season the men and the women against each other is making it harder for the women.  It's making them have to learn things that they're not used to having to do.
L:  Right, that --
R:  So, obviously they're not making good beds.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, they're having a problem.  But it makes it more interesting because they're -- they're not expected to do this.  They didn't expect to have to do this.
L:  Right.  I --
L:  And it's, like, fallen into their hands, "I've gotta make a fire, I've gotta make a, you know, shelter".
L:  I think that was a great idea --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on [inaudible] part to, ah, separate it into guys and gals.
R:  Mhm.  I loved the idea.
L:  I think he, uh, that was a real, uh, winner because you get the, ah -- you -- you -- you, ah, got a lotta the guys watching [inaudible] "Hey, the cat fight.  Oh, they're yelling at each other again".
R:  [MN] Ah, and -- and -- and of -- of course people like the flirting and you don't get that when they live together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Guys and girls live together in reality don't get along as well as if they're separated and they're wanting to be near each other, so you're getting more flirting in that kinda --
L:  Unl- unless you get with the one gay girl in there, or whatever, yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  I [MN] -- I didn't even realize there was.  Um ...
L:  No, I'm just -- I'm kidding.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  I don't think there is any but ...
R:  I don't think it would be a problem anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, they're too busy worrying about surviving and trying to, like I said, they're trying to stay dry every night.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  Um, did you watch Big Brother?
L:  Ah, no, no Big Brother.
R:  No Big Brother?
L:  I watched some of, ah, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.
R:  Oh, did you?  [LAUGH]
L:  I watched some of that.
R:  And how are you liking that show?
L:  It's all -- it's all right.  I watched some -- I think I watched the first episode of A Surreal Life --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- with -- with -- with --
R:  That -- that was one of the funniest reality shows that I've enjoyed.
L:  Mm?
R:  The Surreal Life to me was one of the most interesting ones so far.
L:  Oh yeah.  I liked, ah, I liked it when the first episode they were -- they were eating the -- the food off the gal and the other guys were like, "Well, I don't know about this" and Vince Neil's like, "I don't care, [LAUGH] you know, this is great" you know.
R:  [LAUGH] It didn't seem to bother the girls though.  I --
L:  [MN] Yeah.  And I think that if it doesn't bother the girls it's cool because they were cool with it, you know?
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  You know, yeah, whatever.
R:  It's all in good fun.  It's -- we're trying to have fun, it's something different.
L:  And this lady, this is her job, this is what she does for a living.
R:  Yeah.  She didn't mind it.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. Yeah.
R:  Um, she -- she probably was enjoying it herself, so ...
L:  Sure, she got to be on TV, huh?
R:  Right.  But yeah, it -- it was fun to see how all those different people interacted with each other.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  And it's, like, you didn't expect these people to end up friends by the end of the show but they were.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, they actually kinda had a friendship and it was pretty cool.
L:  Well, how about The Mole?
R:  I loved The Mole.
L:  Did you watch some of The Mole?
R:  That's a good show.  I mean, that's ...
L:  I watched the last one where the -- the -- the German model was the mole.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, she was a great mole.
R:  Th- -- I never guessed her.  I never guessed her to be a mole.
L:  Well, she fo- foo- fooled them all.
R:  She was excellent at it.
L:  Ah, I tell you.
R:  [LAUGH] I should've guessed it --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- from the -- some of the things she did.
L:  Mm.
R:  But that's a good little show because you have to -- if -- at home you can't really do that show.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's not something you can guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you can't, like, write down on a piece of paper everything about everybody.
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  But, ah, that would be difficult to be on that show.
L:  Yeah, we- -- I wa- -- I wa- -- I wa- -- I want to be on a show where I get dated, whe- where -- where I get matched up with some girls.
R:  Matched up.
L:  I think that would be cool.
R:  Yeah.  I'd like to be on Amazing Race.
L:  Oh, oh, the- they have the new Amazing Race now for, uh, engaged couples.
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that coming out soon?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, if you're engaged they're gonna come to your town and try to get on Amazing Race and then whoever wins gets this super duper wedding.
R:  Oh, now that is a really great idea.
L:  Mhm.  So you have these --
R:  That would be great fun to watch.
L:  -- engaged couples go in -- in the Amazing Race.
R:  And see which couples actually make it through it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] Because that's -- that's strenuous and that's tiresome.
L:  Sure and it -- it -- it --
R:  [inaudible] a lot.
L:  -- works hard on a relationship too.
R:  Yeah.  It's a really good relationship tester.  It'll either bring you closer or rip you apart, shall we say?
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  All righty.  Well, fab, it was great talking to you and all that.
R:  You too.
L:  I think we've talked a lot and had some good times.
R:  All right.
L:  All right.  Take care of yourself.
R:  Do they just hang it up themselves?
L:  Yeah, yeah, we just hang it up.
R:  All right.  Thanks.
L:  Thanks.  Bye bye.
R:  Bye bye.
L:  Okay, yeah.  [NOISE]
