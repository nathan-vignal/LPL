R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Ah, my name's Beverley.  How're you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  My name is Alta, A.L.T.A.
R:  Oh good, hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Did you see that they wanted us to talk about Iraq and, ah, the [LAUGH] way the US government is supposed to deal with Iraq?
L:  Yeah, that's what I understand.  This is my first time.
R:  Yeah, it's mine too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I guess we're supposed to talk for ten minutes --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- on that particular subject.
R:  [MN]
L:  Do you have some opinions?
R:  Well, [SIGH] I have some opinions.  Ah, I think that we need to follow what the UN said and try and give them a little more time.  H- how do you feel about that?
L:  I'm very, not very, but I'm sort of opposed to the US starting a war --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when someone hasn't actually started one with us.
R:  Yes, I agree with you.
L:  I don't know that necessarily giving him more time -- I'm not at all sure that giving him more time is going to do any good because I think he's very adept at hiding what he wants to hide.
R:  Right.
L:  But yet again I don't want to start a war.
R:  I agree with you completely.  You know when I was at my dentist the other day, believe it or not, or actually a couple of weeks ago, the hygienist was talking to me and somehow -- I don't know how she started talking about it, and she said that her nephew was going to be sent to Kuwait.  He ha- -- he is in the reserves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he's be- being sent out to Kuwait and saying how -- and this is actually a little before all this talk got so strong, and she was saying how nervous she was and how nervous he is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how it's not, right now, like, going into a peacetime situation or a peacekeeping situation, it's, like, really possibly going into full blown war.  Um.
L:  And what's going to happen if --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we win it?  We haven't won the last couple --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that we've gone into.  Even if we win it, it's going to be years and years and we're not going to be making any friends over there.
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  Not at all.  We're going to be making more enemies.
R:  That's right and the thing I'm so afraid of is that it's going to increase the terrorist actions.  Don't you think so?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  I'm afraid so.
R:  Me too.
L:  And I'm just afraid that, ah, what friends we do have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are only friends because they need to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we're going to make so many more enemies.  It will be the first time in history as far as I'm concerned --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we actually started a war --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- with no real provocation against us, because there's been no proof -- 
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- that he had anything to do with nine eleven.
R:  That's right.  Thank you for your opinion, 'cause I got to tell you that you're one of the only people that I've talked to that feels the same way I do and I appreciate that, because so many people are talking the opposite way.  I [LAUGH] really feel that, yes, where's the provocation to cause this degree of reaction?  [LAUGH] Right?
L:  And the thing is, I'm not a pacifist.  My husband's a re- --
R:  No, me either.  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband's a retired military officer.
R:  Oh, good for him.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So it's just [MN] I think we need to have a really good reason --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be on the attack.
R:  Right.
L:  I'd be firmly behind if we were attacked first.
R:  Of course.  Absolutely.
L:  And I'm firmly behind going after any of the terrorists.
R:  Absolutely.  I agree.
L:  But I'm just afraid of starting a war.  I'm afraid of what's going to happen.  And my own personal opinion is that George Bush --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- is traveling a path that is --
R:  He can't turn back very easily from once he takes it, do you know?
L:  No, but I- -- what I'm afraid is that he's sort of taken this path for personal --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- reasons.
R:  Or --
L:  I don't mean --
R:  -- political?
L:  Uh, maybe political in a way, however politically it's not doing him a whole lot of good right now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think.  But, I mean --
R:  You may be right.
L:  -- it was like, "He insulted my father."
R:  Ah.
L:  He has said that.  Ah, "My father was insulted, I'm not going to take it" and it's just gone on from there and there and there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Course I'm not a real friend of the Bushes anyway.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  I happen to be a Democrat.  [LAUGH]
R:  I am too.  [LAUGH] Welcome.
L:  How interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Welcome to the party.  [MN]
L:  Are we allowed to say where we live?
R:  Ah, well, I don't see why not.
L:  Or shouldn't we?
R:  Yeah, it's up to you, I mean --
L:  What state?
R:  Ah, I'm in Connecticut.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I- I'm in Florida but we're originally -- well, we've lived all over but we're originally from Ohio.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Yeah.  So, we retired in Florida.
R:  Uh huh, that's nice.
L:  So, my daughter told me about it.  She lives Virginia --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and, ah, told me about this and so I signed up the other night and ...
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] that's g- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I just signed up this morning and --
L:  Well, mine was just like --
R:  -- and I was astonished --
L:  -- last night I think.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean it- it's happened so quickly.
R:  Weren't you surprised when they called you?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In fact we'd been gone all day and luckily I said, "From eight to ten at night".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, because we've -- and we just happened to get home at, like, ten minutes before [LAUGH] the phone rang.
R:  Well that's good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, [LIPSMACK] well, um, let's see, do we have a -- ah, we have to talk for ten minutes --
R:  [MN] Yeah, for ten minutes.
L:  -- so um --
R:  I don't actually know how long it's been yet but -- 
L:  They say -- well, they say that they tell you.
R:  Yeah, they do but I guess they're going to -- somebody's going to -- um, the robot is going to tell us [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Tell us when we're finished.
R:  [LAUGH] As she told me, she said, "A robot is going to call you."  I said, "A robot?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, a robot".  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm trying to think of some other aspects of this that we could --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Well, I j- -- I feel that -- ah, well, one thing that I would say is I feel very, very sorry for the Iraqi people because I think that they are stuck in a position, mm, so many of those people are so poor.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they've gotten just poorer.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't think necessarily --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that we're going to help them.
R:  Oh, no, and that's so sad.
L:  I think it's going to be much, much worse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Either way, they're going to be in bad shape.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  I'm afraid so.
R:  And I don't think it's going to do anything good for us really in the long run.  [SIGH]
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I noticed our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gasoline prices started going back up --
R:  [MN] Oh, my --
L:  -- again in the last couple of days.
R:  My God.
L:  They'd gone down a little bit, now they're back up.  How are they in Connecticut?
R:  Horrible.  What are your gas prices there, around the --
L:  Well --
R:  -- dollar sixty, seventy, eighty?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, ah, this past week it had gone down to about one sixty seven, one sixty eight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, coming home this evening I saw it was up to one seventy two, three, four.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's about what it is here --
L:  Yeah and --
R:  -- which is pretty awful.
L:  -- and just gone like that in a day or two.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, isn't that terrible?
L:  Yeah.  But it had been up in the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mid hundr- -- dollar seventies.
R:  Yes.
L:  Then it went down a little bit.
R:  Yes.
L:  And now it's back up again.
R:  It actually got down to the dollar fifties here and then it went back up again, yeah.
L:  And the stock market of course is not doing anything.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, we got out of the stock market, ah, the -- well, actually [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after nine eleven actually, when --
L:  Yeah, well, we couldn't because that's our retirement I think.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But I'm very conservative and, and we try to, ah -- ah, we're trying to ride it out.
R:  Yeah and I hope it does take a good turn for you because as you --
L:  Well in the long term but, of course, we- we're old enough that the long term [LAUGH] might not be long enough.
R:  [LAUGH]  Ah, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so.
R:  No.
L:  But, ah, ah --
R:  Hopefully it --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- it will, though.  It will turn better.  I think this is just a bad patch that we've all got to get through as a country and as people, you know?
L:  That's right, and I think as far as this country is concerned and the people in it, we've got -- we're really very patriotic --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We're very, um --
R:  I think as a whole, more than anybody even realized, right?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, more than we all realized.
L:  Right.  Ah, I think certain things made us sit up and say, "Hey, isn't it about time we started thinking in that direction again --"
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  "-- instead of being so complacent?"
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, it just happens that because -- you know, when you're successful, when you have something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all of the have nots hate you.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's --
L:  And Americans hate to be hated.
R:  Yeah, that's true, yeah, and don't understand it, I think.  You know --
L:  No, they --
R:  I think that when people come --
L:  -- we don't understand why we're hated --
R:  Right, right.
L:  But yet again, it's a fact.
R:  But it -- and it's a natural reaction unfortunately, it really is from --
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  -- people who don't have.  Right?
L:  It's human nature.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right, so ...
R:  But it's difficult for u- -- for us to deal with as a country, I think.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  You know?
L:  It really is.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So how's the weather down there in Florida?  [MN]
L:  It's great right now.
R:  Now we've got about a foot of --
L:  In fact it's up in the, ah, oh, high eighties.
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  Mid to high eighties.
R:  My goodness, we've got about a foot of snow today, so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we had an unusual cold snap a couple of weeks ago --
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  -- very cold for here.  See, we live in southern Florida which is, you know, about as far south as you -- almost as far south as you can get.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, we don't want to have any more New England or Mid Western winters --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- believe me. [LAUGH]
R:  We actually wondered up here how you [MN] -- you all had weathered that.  We had that very bad storm a few weeks ago --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when it came from the south and I know there was a lot of, ah, damage in the south from the cold and I was wondering how -- how it turned out down there?  [NOISE]
L:  It -- it didn't hurt, ah, the fruit growers -- 
R:  Right, the orange crops --
L:  -- in Southern Florida
