L:  Hi, I'm Dee. 
R:  Hi, Dee.  I'm Dan.
L:  Oh, hi, Dan.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Oh, okay.  How are you? 
R:  Good, thanks.
L:  I see you got the late -- the late shift like me.
R:  I did.
L:  So what -- so what is the topic?  What can the US do -- 
R:  -- to prevent -- 
L:  To prevent bio terror- -- 
R:  -- bioterrorism attacks, I think is what it said. 
L:  Well, how about close the borders? [SIGH] 
R:  Well, that -- that's a good idea, yeah.  I [inaudible] --
L:  Let's start -- let's start with -- with close the borders and then figure out who's here. 
R:  That might not be the best idea unless it's -- are you saying like a temporary thing -- 
L:  Well, yeah.  
R:  -- or are you saying like permanent? 
L:  You can't -- you can't be, I don't think you can, um -- you know, it's sort of like pouring water into a bucket.  You're never going to know how much is in the bucket until you stop pouring water.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, first -- first you gotta stop the people coming in, then you figure out who's already here, then, you know, from that point, um, I don't know, because after that [MN] then I guess you have to get into like profiling or something.
R:  Yeah.  It's going to -- big brother -- 
L:  How else could you -- 
R:  Big brother is going to come out. [LAUGH] 
L:  How else could you and then all of ACLU will be out going, "Oh, you're -- you're, you know, stopping their rights, but, you know what, the whole point of society is that you have -- everybody gives up some freedom in order to make a safe s- place for everybody else, for everyone.
R:  I think -- I think closing the border would be pretty hard because -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't notify -- notify people that you are going to do it because then those people that are up to no good are going to leave.
L:  But you know what?  If they leave -- 
R:  But if you don't, then you're going to trap travellers here, you know.
L:  Well, you would -- no, you could leave.  I mean, you could go out but you can't come back in, you know what I mean?  You just stop people from coming in for right now and then -- 
R:  Even -- even our -- 
L:  If the bad people -- 
R:  Even our own citizens are somewhere else?
L:  No.  Citizens can always come back.  I'm talking about people who aren't citizens or aren't -- 
R:  But there's many -- there's many citizens that are involved in -- in that big -- the big issue of the, you know, terrorist attacks and such.  Many of them are -- 
L:  Well, we're not saying they have to come back, either.  Wherever they are -- 
R:  Oh, I -- I know, but they could still, is what I'm trying to say.
L:  They could still, yeah.
R:  They could -- they could bring it back somehow, bring something back or -- 
L:  Well, but then --  
R:  I don't know. 
L:  But, you know, but now -- now we have a treason problem -- 
R:  True.
L:  -- if that's the case.
R:  Well, I mean that's definitely what's going on, like no doubt about it.
L:  Well, we don't really have that much, I mean the threat is not really treason so much.
R:  Oh, no, but --  
L:  Do you really think -- 
R:  -- if you've got infighters everywhere.
L:  -- there's a lot of -- yeah, you can never tell what [MN] anybody is actually doing, but -- but I think -- I think the main threat of bio terror- terrorism isn't really coming from within.
R:  Right, I understand what you're saying.  I agree on the -- on the -- I agree on that issue, but I am just suggesting that there's ways to continue that threat. 
L:  Well, how would you start, you know, how would you start a prevention program? 
R:  Honestly, I don't know, like -- I don't have any idea, like I'd -- 
L:  So you'd have to start somewhere.
R:  I don't think a war is going to prevent any future attacks.  I think it might -- 
L:  Well, I don't -- 
R:  Prevent an immediate -- an immediate, you know, um, risk.
L:  Right.
R:  But it won't prevent them long term because they will always happen, so -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- if you're just looking at the immediate, yeah, this is probably a good idea -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but long term it's not really going to help.  It may just slow it -- 
L:  Well, yeah.  
R:  -- slow it down.
L:  I -- I kind of agree with that because [SIGH] it doesn't -- it doesn't matter how -- what you do outside if you're not protecting your own borders inside.
R:  Right.
L:  It doesn't matter, because, look, those guys were here and how did they get in here?  They just l-, you know, BSd the INS[?].
R:  They just walked right in.
L:  Yeah, they just walked.  If have you enough money, you can get in.  That's already been proven.
R:  And -- and many of them had been here for years.
L:  Yeah.  So -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, really we have to -- we have to revamp all of the INS people -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the ones th- -- and, really, I don't think it's fair that there's people who are waiting to come in in a legal way and people just, like, run over the border and stuff -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they overstay their visas and they do all these other things.  I mean, I understand -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they want to be here but, you know what, everybody -- there's a lot of other people who are just as deserving who are following the rules, so I don't think that's very fair for them because that gives everybody -- that's like rewarding the bad people.
R:  That's true.  I agree with that, that point.
L:  And don't you think if you were going to be a bioterrorist, do you think you'd be following the rules? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the -- actually that's -- that was what I was talking about, like why, you know, maybe closing borders isn't the best idea because so many people will follow the rules and they will be able to get access, you know, thr- -- if you were able to keep the borders open to citizens, you know, so many of those people that are following the rules will be able to continue that threat because of that, because they are following the rules and that's why it'd be hard -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- hard to weed out those people.  I think they are doing a pretty good job right now of just following leads and -- and, you know, making arrests, like there was a big arrest either last week or the week before of -- 
L:  But that's because -- 
R:  -- of one of the instigators, you know.
L:  But that's because they've already cracked down on the borders.
R:  Right.
L:  They haven't closed -- they haven't closed them -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- but all of a sudden now they're making -- they're actually looking at these people and stuff.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  So -- because they have to because they know every eye in America is watching them.
R:  Right.
L:  And God forbid something happens and it turns out to be another, you know, some -- where someone has come in.
R:  It's only -- it's only a matter of time.  There's going to be some way.  I don't think [inaudible] there's a hundred per cent, like -- 
L:  I don't think -- 
R:  -- guarantee that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that nothing's going to happen.
L:  It's more containment --  
R:  I think it's more probable.
L:  -- than anything else --  
R:  Right.
L:  Don't you think?  Because you -- you probably won't be able to stop it.  There's always going to be some nut job out there.
R:  For sure, and it's just -- 
L:  So, because it -- yeah.
R:  -- that one person that it takes.
L:  It only -- and -- and with bioterrorism you only need one guy.
R:  Right, but it's going to be -- 
L:  And they don- -- it's not even like they're in danger themselves, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  They take it and dump it in the water supply or wherever and take off.
R:  Right, or the air, you know.  There's airborne --
L:  Oh, yeah, you know.
R:  -- viruses and all kinds of things. 
L:  And since we're just -- we're, you know, have been so friendly giving it all away to people -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- "Oh, here, please, have some anthrax".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, so, you know, tha- I understand that -- that is also a problem, but, you know, how else -- how else would you go about -- [MN] you'd have to start somewhere you -- and -- and maybe what they're doing now is good.  The- -- I mean they haven't really closed the border but they've really cracked down on who gets to come in -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and who's leaving.
R:  There's a lot more, um, security -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- like national security going on.
L:  And that's how they're catching these people -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- because there's no other real -- I mean, well, I guess what they're doing is they're catching these people and they're not torturing them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But they're, you know -- 
R:  They're trying to get information.
L:  -- encouraging them to talk. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right, [LAUGH] and whatever means are necessary.
L:  Exactly.  Well, what say we caught one?  I mean, would you -- would you support s- torturing him to get, like, more information out of the guy? 
R:  I -- I personally don't know how far I would go.  I -- I don't think I'd -- I would torture the person.
L:  I know.
R:  Maybe -- 
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  Maybe, like, you know, s- starving them for a while or something, you know, making them go hungry for a while, but I don't think I'd want to inflict pain upon them.
L:  Exactly.  I don't want to be cutting off any body parts or -- 
R:  I'm just glad --  
L:  -- anything like that.
R:  I'm glad I don't have to make that decision.
L:  Yeah.  I'm with you there -- 
R:  You gotta -- 
L:  -- although I kind of like the tactic they're using now which is just sleep deprivation.
R:  Yeah, like, I understand, like that's something that's not like a -- like a permanent physical -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um -- 
L:  But what I worry about is you know -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- how when you wake up and you're like all dopey because you haven't had enough sleep? 
R:  You don't know what you're thinking. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you don't even know what you're saying. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  Because they're like going, "wake up, tell us stuff". [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.
L:  And they're like, "do you know [several inaudible words]"?  "Oh sure, aha. [LAUGH] Yeah, sure, no problem, aha." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words], you know.  I think maybe they should just, like, hook them up to a lie detector and load them up with sodium pen- pentothal and see what happens, um, because that's not, you know, that's not really dangerous, I don't think.
R:  Probably not.  Of course, the lie detector -- 
L:  I don't think that would kill ya.
R:  -- people -- people are trained to be able to pass those, like the military.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  [inaudible] you know, so some of them may not be able to have much --  
L:  Yeah.   
R:  -- of an effect on ...
L:  That's true.
R:  And they're not a hundred per cent accurate anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  They're not -- no, they're not. 
R:  But -- 
L:  And you can -- you can fool them if, you know, you've been trained. 
R:  Yeah, good actor.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think it has to do with how much you believe in what you're actually saying or -- or, you know, and then they -- you can give false, um, [LIPSMACK] you can make it jump by, like, sticking yourself with a needle and stuff -- 
R:  Oh, right.
L:  You put like pins in your shoes and stuff.
R:  Yeah, I see what you're saying, yeah.
L:  So that, you know, it makes your -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- heart rate go up and stuff and then they think, "Oh, he must be telling a lie here when his name is Joe".
R:  I hope -- I hope somebody's a lot smarter than I am so they can figure out how to -- how to solve this problem.
L:  Yeah.  I'm glad it's not me. [LAUGH]  So, this -- because this is -- it's not -- it's not really solvable.  I mean, it's -- it's not like you could really [MN] do more than contain it, because you're ri- -- I think you're right.
R:  But, yeah.  I see -- 
L:  There's always going to be -- 
R:  I see what you mean.  Like, probably like the only -- only guarantee is to contain any external influence but then we have to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worry about our own internal, crazy people.
L:  Right.  Right, because -- 
R:  At least they'd be -- they'd cut the -- the, um, the number of people we worry about [MN] by a great number. 
L:  Yeah.  At least that way we'd have a kind of a set kind of number that we're looking at -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I -- i- if you were going to do that kind of stuff, it seems to me at some point you would slip up, you know.  Doing something you would kind of slip up somewhere where someone might go, "hm, we oughta maybe check that guy".  I know that sounds like --
