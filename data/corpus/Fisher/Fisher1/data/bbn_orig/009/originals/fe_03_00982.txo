R:  Hi, my name is Melia[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Carrie.
R:  Hi, Carrie.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  [NOISE] No, she's not, that's not it.  So, our topic is ... 
R:  Ah, bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think?
R:  What do we think the government can do to prevent this?
L:  Yes.
R:  The whole thing is absolutely so frightening to me that, [SIGH] I mean, do you have children?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Yeah, so you're probably feeling the same way.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's just -- I mean, it's -- [SIGH] I was talking to my husband the other day about it and I said, you know, "Living in the United States of America we've never really had to deal with this kind of thing".  So as far as what I think the government can do about it, [SIGH] obviously I think there's probably a lot we can do.  I think our borders need to be tighter.
L:  So do I.
R:  I think that to me is, you know, I mean, I think just about anything and anybody has been able to get through our borders, and even since September eleventh, I don't think that we've probably tightened them as much as we should.
L:  No, we haven't.
R:  So, I don't know.  What else comes to mind?
L:  Yeah, just like you, the whole thing is just so scary you almost want to dig a hole in the ground and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Put your whole family down there.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know, absolutely.
L:  'Cause, you know, they're talking about everybody's out buying, you know, air masks and, you know, get duct tape and -- 
R:  I know.
L:  And plastic wrap your house.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  You know. I don't ...
R:  I know.  I mean, it's -- I don't know if you look at it from of the government's standpoint, I guess making people aware is very important, um, but it seems like it's almost a borderline, you know, where you're pushing the button a little bit to where you're almost pushing people into a panic.
L:  Right.  
R:  So I know for myself I haven't gone out and purchased duct tape or any of that.  We always keep extra water in the house simply because we live in California and there's always the threat of earthquake. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But other than that, I -- you know, I mean, we have a little emergency kit and that's about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know, what else do you think the government could do?
L:  I don't know.  We have enough milit[?] people in the military that they should be able to guard our borders, you know. 
R:  Yeah, I agree with that and the other thing is what about all the other -- I mean, we have agencies, CIA, everything that you could imagine, you know, all these secret service agencies and I think one of the biggest problems and why September eleventh was even possible was that they don't communicate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they're all looking out for themselves and rather than have open lines of communication and supporting each other, they're basically looking at what they can do to, you know, to get promotions and whatever it is.
L:  Right, because, you know, with the September eleventh thing, somebody had to have heard something.
R:  Absolutely.  
L:  You know.
R:  No doubt, absolutely.
L:  So, I mean, you would think if something like the bioterrorism, what happened, somebody would have to hear something before it happened.
R:  Well, I think now they're being a little bit -- they're a lot -- actually, they're probably a lot more aware of the kind of conversations that they're intercepting and I think that has to do with, you know, how the alert went up recently to an orange. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I think that had to do with them overhearing -- some of the secret service agencies overhearing conversations.
L:  Which can make you even more nervous.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  When a terror alert goes up.
R:  I know, oh, I know.
L:  And nobody knows why.
R:  Nobody knows why.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And what do you do, keep your children home?  What do you do?
L:  How old are your children?
R:  My children are too old to keep home.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My youngest one has just turned eighteen and she's getting ready to -- she's been looking at east coast colleges and she's getting ready to actually go spend a week at NYU.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And I'm in a major panic over here.
L:  Yeah, I probably would be too.
R:  Yeah, I don't want to let her go, and then my older daughter, she goes to school locally -- college locally, she just turned twenty.
L:  Oh.
R:  But she likes to pretty much stay close to home.  When she's finished, she's heading down to San Diego State, so she wants to stick close to home.  The other one wants to travel the world. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I want her to, but it's just -- everything is so uncertain right now.
L:  Yeah, you kind of want them all close by. 
R:  What else do you think the government can do?  
L:  Um.
R:  Besides tightening the borders, having the agencies work, you know, more interactively together?  Do you think there's anything else that can be done?
L:  My only opinion -- you know, I ask my husband all the time why we just don't go over there and bomb their whole country and get rid of it.
R:  I know.
L:  You know. [LAUGH]  
R:  I know.  It's called politics.
L:  I know, but, you know, it would just make things so much easier.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, now, you know, we don't have a hundred per cent support thanks to France.
L:  Yes.
R:  They've decided that they are not going to be in our corner, so, yeah, I don't know.  I'd like to think that we can go in there and do what we need to do with Iraq and that will put this all to rest but I think it's probably bigger than that.
L:  Yeah, because, you know, we have the guys over there looking at all their, um --
R:  The UN Security? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  And you know there's millions of stuff they're not seeing.
R:  Of course.  They're only seeing what Saddam Hussein wants them to see.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, there's stuff all over the place there.
R:  I know.
L:  They're not seeing, so ... 
R:  Yeah.  But as far as bioterrorism, I mean, gosh, I just -- I mean, look at all the -- 
L:  The thought of it, it's --
R:  I know, and look at all of the -- think of all the tankers that come in and from foreign countries, foreign lands, you know, with all of our -- the imports that we have, everything that comes into our ports, that's always scary too.  I mean, something could come off of a port and have a bomb on it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So I don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's just, ugh. 
L:  It's almost too much to grasp.
R:  Really?  And I think part of it is that we've never really had to deal with this before.  We've had the luxury of living in the USA and the USA never had to deal with those kinds of things.  I mean, we used to look at other countries with terrorist attacks, buses that were, you know, bombed and things like that and go "Oh, my gosh, they are uncivil".
L:  Could you imagine living like that?
R:  No.
L:  And now here we are.
R:  And here we are, right.
L:  Here we are and, you know, we don't know whether the bioterrorism would come from, you know, it could come from Korea.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely.  I think one of the things that's really scary is, you know, like nerve gas and some of that stuff that they've been talking about and then what do you do if they go to a code red?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I mean, what do you do, sit in front of your television? 
L:  Right. 
R:  Ah.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, jeez Louise.  I don't know.  I -- you know, it's always in my mind now unfortunately.  It's always in the back of my mind.  I'm always watching things that may look suspicious and I guess that's good, um.
L:  Yeah, it's just that you never thought you would have to live that way.
R:  No, really.
L:  You know.
R:  And I'm really sick of the news.  I put the news on for a few minutes and it's like it's the same old thing, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Just the same old thing, pictures of Saddam Hussein, pictures of President Bush, and maybe, United -- you know, Nations Security Council, and are we moving towards war or away from it?  It's just -- I don't know.  I think part of it is you feel somewhat helpless.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You really do because your, you know, your future is in the hands of others so ... [SIGH]  
L:  And there's nothing you can do about it.
R:  Yeah.  I really do think though that tightening the borders is one thing and also looking at the people -- I mean, we have so many people in our country illegally.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  And this whole thing about -- I just learned the other day that someone could actually -- an illegal alien could actually commit a crime in our country, go to goal, and the INS is not informed.
L:  Oh.
R:  I thought that was very interesting.
L:  Yeah, I didn't know that either.
R:  No there's some -- yeah.  So there's just -- I think there's so much, you know, they walk a fine line with this whole, you know, with our whole doctrine being what it is, the land of the free, but people that -- I don't know, I just feel that people that come in here from another country and haven't earned that right -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't deserve it.
L:  Well, I mean, even right now, even with all of the security tightened, just about anybody can get in here.
R:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean, we live very close to the San Diego border that -- which is, you know, close to Tijuana and we have border patrols throughout this -- that area coming through and even as far as about thirty five, forty miles inland, but a lot of times, we'll come back through and they'll be closed.
L:  Hm. 
R:  And I know that they work together with the other border -- 
L:  Right.
R:  --  you know, the other border patrol checks so some are open and some are closed.  But nonetheless, I don't know, I just can't help but think that, you know, the only way those terrorists got in our -- got in an aeroplane was because we let them in our country.
L:  That's right.  And I live -- I live in Florida and, you know, it scares me to death because we're like hanging off here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Our little state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  By ourselves.
R:  Yes, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  And it's pretty much get rid of our whole state with -- 
R:  I know.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  So, you know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I really don't know -- and with all the brains, the power they have in the government, you'd think they would have already figured it out, you know, of -- of what they could do.
R:  Yeah, and you ask yourself is it just the red tape that it -- that is preventing, you know, them from taking quicker action?  Is it kind of like running a big corporation where you can't turn on a dime?  Is that basically what's involved here?  You know, that they don't have the freedom?  I thought this whole homeland security thing was supposed to free up one government agency so that they could make decisions.
L:  Right, and only -- 
R:  You know, very quickly.
L:  -- do that.
R:  So I don't know, other than tightening up the borders and really paying close attention to who's already in the country -- 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I mean, it's like maybe they need to do some sort of spontaneous --
