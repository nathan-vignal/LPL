THAT'S KINDA 'CAUSE I MEAN ONCE YOU'RE IN THE AIR- LIKE  (fe_03_00960-A-0052)
BEFORE YOU KNOW ONCE YOU'RE IN THE AIRPORT ONCE YOU'RE LIKE ACTUALLY IN THE TERMINALS YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE AND THEY DIDN'T CHECK YOU FOR ANYTHING SO YOU COULD YOU KNOW FLY TO SOME OTHER AIRPORT AND DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANTED TO DO AND YOU KNOW GET ON ANOTHER PLANE  (fe_03_00960-A-0053)

RIGHT  (fe_03_00960-B-0005)
NO  (fe_03_00960-B-0006)
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO DO MORE WITH THE LUGGAGE AND THE WAY THEY CAN THEY LOAD THE PLANES MORE SO THAN  (fe_03_00960-B-0007)
[MN] CHECKING PEOPLE OUT AT THE  (fe_03_00960-B-0008)

UM I'M SURE THAT IT HAS HELPED TO A POINT BUT I THINK THAT MOST OF THEIR PROBLEMS COME FROM THE LUGGAGE BEING ON THERE AND AND MATCHING THE LUGGAGE TO THE TICKETS IF THAT PERSON'S NOT ON THERE  (fe_03_00960-B-0012)
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY LOAD THEIR  (fe_03_00960-B-0013)

UM  (fe_03_00960-B-0033)
MORE SO THAN IT'S ACTUALLY DOING GOOD I THINK THERE'S OTHER AREAS THAT THEY COULD BE CONCENTRATING AND PUTTING THEIR MONEY TOWARDS AND MORE FOR THE BAGGAGE AND THE  (fe_03_00960-B-0034)
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH SO GOING TO SET OFF THAT THAT TRIGGER ANYWAY YOU KNOW AND MAYBE CHECKING THE SHOES IS BECAUSE THAT THAT GUY HAD WHAT HE HAD A KNIFE OR SOMETHING IN HIS SHOE  (fe_03_00960-B-0035)

BUT 'CAUSE THEY ONLY DO A RANDOM SEARCH ON THE LUGGAGE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY SEARCH ALL OF THE LUGGAGE BUT THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH ALL THESE X-RAYS I THINK EVERY PIECE OF LUGGAGE NEEDS TO BE X-RAYED AND [NOISE]  (fe_03_00960-B-0053)
IN ALL OF 'EM NOW IN ALL THE AIRPORTS  (fe_03_00960-B-0054)

UM  (fe_03_00960-B-0060)
REGULATIONS FOR HIRING THE WORKERS THEY NEED TO DO MORE CHECKS  (fe_03_00960-B-0061)
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING THERE  (fe_03_00960-B-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_00960-B-0063)
[NOISE] WELL MOST OF THE BAGGAGE CHECKERS AND THE THE SECURITY WERE MINIMUM WAGE PEOPLE  (fe_03_00960-B-0064)
YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO BE TRAINED SECURITY PEOPLE THEY NEED TO HAVE HEIGHTENED [MN] SECURITY FOR THE THE WORKERS YOU KNOW NOT JUST LIKE ANYBODY OUT THERE ON THAT FIELD TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PLANES  (fe_03_00960-B-0065)
AND AH YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE IF THE AIRLINE PEOPLE  (fe_03_00960-B-0066)
YOU KNOW THE BAGGAGE HANDLERS CAN STEAL THINGS OUT OF YOUR BAGS  (fe_03_00960-B-0067)
THEN A BAGGAGE HANDLER CAN PUT SOMETHING IN THOSE BAGS  (fe_03_00960-B-0068)
AND SO AND I D- I'M NOT AWARE OF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY HAVE HEIGHTENED THAT  (fe_03_00960-B-0069)
YOU KNOW UM BUT THAT TO ME WOULD BE MORE PLAUSIBLE THAN  (fe_03_00960-B-0070)
UM  (fe_03_00960-B-0071)
YOU KNOW PATTING ALL THE THE  (fe_03_00960-B-0072)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_00960-B-0074)
THAT'S TRUE YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_00960-B-0075)
I ALSO FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO MATCH THE YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOUR BAGS ARE ON THERE THEY NEED TO MATCH IF THOSE BAGS GO ON THERE THEY BETTER MAKE SURE THAT EVERY  (fe_03_00960-B-0076)
EVERY PERSON THAT PUT THOSE BAGS ON THERE IS MATCHES  (fe_03_00960-B-0077)
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEBODY IN OTHER WORDS IF MR SMITH PUTS A BAG ON THEN DECIDES NOT TO TAKE THE FLIGHT HIS BAGS SHOULDN'T GO ON THERE  (fe_03_00960-B-0078)
RIGHT AND THEY UM  (fe_03_00960-B-0079)
ARE THEY JUST CHECKING THE BAGS  (fe_03_00960-B-0080)
ARE THEY  (fe_03_00960-B-0081)
JUST CHECKING I MEAN THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CHECK EVERY SINGLE BAG THAT IS LOADED ON THAT PLANE  (fe_03_00960-B-0082)
THEY'RE ONLY RANDOM CHECKING YOUR CARRY ONS IF THEY THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM  (fe_03_00960-B-0083)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_00960-B-0084)
[NOISE] CORRECT  (fe_03_00960-B-0087)
BUT UM [MN]  (fe_03_00960-B-0088)
I DON'T KNOW THE QUESTION WAS DO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE SECURE  (fe_03_00960-B-0089)
I THINK TO A POINT BUT I FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE A LOT MORE SECURE BUT THEN I HAD I'M NOT I DON'T WORK THERE I DON'T KNOW ALL THE CHANGES THAT THEY'VE MADE  (fe_03_00960-B-0090)
SO I COULDN'T [NOISE] JUSTIFIABLY SAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T MADE ENOUGH CHANGES  (fe_03_00960-B-0091)
I'VE ONLY FLOWN A COUPLE OF TIMES SINCE THEN  (fe_03_00960-B-0092)
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS [NOISE] BUT UM [NOISE] YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD SOME  (fe_03_00960-B-0093)
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T FLY OUT OF I I FLEW FROM NASHVILLE TO FLORIDA A COUPLE OF TIMES  (fe_03_00960-B-0094)

ATLANTA NOR  (fe_03_00960-B-0096)
DALLAS OR CHICAGO  (fe_03_00960-B-0097)
