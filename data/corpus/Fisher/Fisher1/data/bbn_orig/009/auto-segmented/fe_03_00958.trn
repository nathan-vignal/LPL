AH DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_00958-A-0003)
IT'S IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I DON'T THINK THE SECURITY IS REALLY GOING TO STOP THEM  (fe_03_00958-A-0004)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_00958-A-0005)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_00958-A-0006)
RIGHT I THINK IT'LL IT'LL WEED OUT THE CRAZIES BUT I THINK A DETERMINED TERRORIST IS GOING TO GET THROUGH  (fe_03_00958-A-0007)
I THINK I THINK I THINK THEY'LL FIND A WAY [MN]  (fe_03_00958-A-0008)
YES THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT AH WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE THE PILOTS HAVING WEAPONS IN THE COCKPIT  (fe_03_00958-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_00958-A-0010)
[NOISE] [NOISE] OR THEY MAY THINK WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT THEY MAY THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING  (fe_03_00958-A-0011)

AH NOW I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING A CHANCE [MN] BUT EVERYTHING YOU DO IN LIFE YOU'RE [NOISE] TAKING A CHANCE  (fe_03_00958-A-0013)
[LIPSMACK] YEAH I I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THERE I THINK PILOTS FOR  (fe_03_00958-A-0014)
AH FOR THE MOST PART ARE PRETTY LEVEL HEADED I DON'T THINK THEY'RE  (fe_03_00958-A-0015)
ALL THAT GUNG HO WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE WITH IT I I THINK THEY'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_00958-A-0016)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_00958-A-0018)
THAT'S TRUE [LAUGHTER] THAT'S VERY TRUE YOUR YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT LIKE THE STINGER MISSILES AND ALL WAS VERY INTERESTING THOUGH  (fe_03_00958-A-0019)
AH I WONDER IF THE HOMELAND SECURITY HAS REALLY GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT AND IF THEY'RE TAKING ANY SECURITY MEASUR- MEASURES AROUND AIRPORTS  (fe_03_00958-A-0020)
FOR THAT AT ALL IF THERE'S ANYTHING POSSIBLE THAT THEY CAN DO  (fe_03_00958-A-0021)
OH THERE IS SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00958-A-0022)
YES YES THERE IS  (fe_03_00958-A-0023)
YEAH THAT WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE I'M SURE PLUS EVEN AFTER THE FACT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME EVEN LOCATING THE GENERAL AREA FROM WHICH IT WOULD WOULD HAVE COME  (fe_03_00958-A-0024)
AH I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING REALLY HARD TO TO TRY TO EVEN BE SECURE AGAINST  (fe_03_00958-A-0025)
[LAUGHTER] YES THAT'S TRUE LAST TIME I CHECKED IS  (fe_03_00958-A-0026)
IT AS HARD AS YOU THINK  (fe_03_00958-A-0027)
UH I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER  (fe_03_00958-A-0028)
AH ALL THAT I'VE SEEN AND HEARD LATELY ABOUT THINGS BEING SMUGGLED IN AH  (fe_03_00958-A-0029)
I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO CLUE  (fe_03_00958-A-0030)
IS HAPPENING I I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT DIFFICULT ANY MORE  (fe_03_00958-A-0031)
I'M SORRY  (fe_03_00958-A-0032)
MHM  (fe_03_00958-A-0033)
I KNOW I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD FLY SOMEWHERE AH  (fe_03_00958-A-0035)
NOW AFTER WHAT'S HAPPENED AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD AND I USED TO FLY MYSELF I WAS WORKING ON BECOMING A PRIVATE PILOT YES I WAS MANY YEARS AGO  (fe_03_00958-A-0036)
AH LACK OF MONEY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00958-A-0037)
I JUST RAN OUT OF MONEY  (fe_03_00958-A-0038)
YES IT IS AND I WAS FLYING BACK WHEN IT WASN'T THAT EXPENSIVE SO  (fe_03_00958-A-0039)
OH BACK IN THE AH  (fe_03_00958-A-0040)
BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES  (fe_03_00958-A-0041)
WELL  (fe_03_00958-A-0042)
WHEN THEN YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I WAS PAYING FIFTEEN FIFTY AN HOUR [LAUGHTER] BUT AH  (fe_03_00958-A-0043)
YEAH IT WAS EIGHT BUCKS FOR MINE BUT AH KNOWING WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FLYING AH I REALLY YOU KNOW [MN]  (fe_03_00958-A-0044)
AIRPORTS AT THAT AT THAT TIME THEY WEREN'T SECURE AT ALL AH AND I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND AN AIRPORT MUCH LATELY TO REALLY EXPERIENCE THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH NOW I'M GLAD THEY'RE DOING IT  (fe_03_00958-A-0045)
I THINK PEOPLE ARE [MN] YOU KNOW FEELING MUCH SAFER NOW BUT I WONDER IF THEY REALLY ARE THAT MUCH SAFER  (fe_03_00958-A-0046)
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_00958-A-0047)
THAT'S GONNA BE TOO  (fe_03_00958-A-0048)
[LIPSMACK] YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THERE THE THOUGHT OF AH YOU KNOW A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK EVEN ABOARD AN AN AIRCRAFT THAT WOULD CRIPPLE AN AIRLINER  (fe_03_00958-A-0049)
A- CRIPPLE A PILOT  (fe_03_00958-A-0050)
YOU'RE JUST RELEASING SOME KIND OF BIOLOGICAL [NOISE]  (fe_03_00958-A-0051)
WELL  (fe_03_00958-A-0052)
YES DEFINITELY CHEMICALS AND AND THAT COULD CAUSE  (fe_03_00958-A-0053)
AS MUCH IF NOT MORE OF A CATASTROPHE  (fe_03_00958-A-0054)
DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE AIRCRAFT WOULD'VE WOULD COME DOWN SO  (fe_03_00958-A-0055)
THAT COULD BE BAD AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING [SIGH]  (fe_03_00958-A-0056)
ANY WAY THEY COULD REALLY BE SECURE AGAINST THAT I- IF SOMEONE GOT THAT SUBSTANCE ABOARD  (fe_03_00958-A-0057)
SO THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT WOULD REALLY BE DIFFICULT  (fe_03_00958-A-0058)
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR GROUND CREW AND TO BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE I I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE  (fe_03_00958-A-0059)
I THINK THOSE DAYS ARE BEHIND US  (fe_03_00958-A-0060)
BUT WE FELT SAFE [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00958-A-0061)
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED WE HAD WE HAD THAT AIR OF [MN]  (fe_03_00958-A-0062)
BEING INVINCIBLE I THINK AND YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S HAPPENED NOW HAS REALLY STOPPED AND MADE PEOPLE THINK ARE THEY THAT SAFE NOW AND THEY REALIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT AND THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN BUT  (fe_03_00958-A-0063)
AH I- IT CAN BE FRIGHTENING IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO DWELL ON IT  (fe_03_00958-A-0064)
[LIPSMACK] [MN] I I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT DO YOU KNOW OF AH CAN YOU THINK OF ANY WAY AH SECURITY COULD BE INCREASED AT AIRPORTS NOW  (fe_03_00958-A-0066)
FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN  (fe_03_00958-A-0067)
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE  (fe_03_00958-A-0068)
I DON'T EITHER [MN] WHAT I'VE LOOKED AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE  (fe_03_00958-A-0069)
HI THIS IS JEFF WHO ARE YOU  (fe_03_00958-B-0001)
DONNA HI UM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_00958-B-0002)
[LIPSMACK] REALLY UM I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I THINK IS IS I USE UM THE SECURITY OF MY HOUSE AS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANALOGY UM ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO GET INTO MY HOUSE IF THEY'RE DETERMINED ENOUGH WILL GET THROUGH  (fe_03_00958-B-0003)
BUT THE THE GREATER THE SECURITY THAT I PROVIDE IT'S GONNA WEED OUT THE THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE  (fe_03_00958-B-0005)
ARE USING LOW LEVEL AH TECHNIQUES UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0006)
YOU KNOW I- IT  (fe_03_00958-B-0007)
[NOISE] BUT YOU CAN WEED OUT N- YOU CAN WEED OUT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM YOU CAN'T YOU CANNOT YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT EFFECTIVE S- SECURITY BUT I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0009)
UM AS YOU INCREASE SECURITY AH YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA WEED OUT YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE OF THEM UM THE THE W- I THINK THE THE THING THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST IS PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AH WITH  (fe_03_00958-B-0010)
INFRA RED HOMING MISSILES LIKE A STINGER  (fe_03_00958-B-0011)
SITTING AT THE END OF A RUNWAY AS AN AIRPLANE TAKES OFF  (fe_03_00958-B-0012)
[SIGH] I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA UM I'M A PILOT MYSELF I'M NOT A COMMERCIAL PILOT UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0013)
BUT I I THINK AH THAT IF THESE GUYS ON NINE ELEVEN HAD HAD WEAPONS IN THE COCKPIT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAPPEN WOULD HAVE HAPPENED  (fe_03_00958-B-0014)
BUT IT'S ALMOST IT'S ALMOST AT THIS POINT REDUNDANT BECAUSE THEY'VE TRIED THIS AND NOW THEY KNOW THAT WE ARE WATCHING FOR THIS THEY WON'T DO IT THIS WAY AGAIN IF IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_00958-B-0015)
TO HURT US AH THEY WILL TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL SURPRISE US NOT SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW ABOUT  (fe_03_00958-B-0016)
YEAH  (fe_03_00958-B-0017)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_00958-B-0018)
THAT'S TRUE BUT I I THINK I THINK THAT AH GIVING THESE GUYS A HAND GUN IN THE COCKPIT  (fe_03_00958-B-0019)
IS PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_00958-B-0020)
NO  (fe_03_00958-B-0021)
[LIPSMACK] NO I KNOW I KNOW A LOT OF PILOTS AND AND MY BEST FRIEND WAS A A RETIRED PILOT FROM AMERICAN AIRLINES SO  (fe_03_00958-B-0022)
AND I I  (fe_03_00958-B-0023)
TH- TH- TH- THERE ARE NO TH- IF IF YOU'RE A BOZO YOU DON'T YOU DON'T G- GET THROUGH THE SCREEN TO GET AH GET TO BE A PILOT AH A COMMERCIAL PILOT  (fe_03_00958-B-0024)
I'M SURE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0026)
[SIGH] I- IT'S IT'S SO HARD I I THINK IT'S HARD TO TAKE SECURITY MEASURES AH BECAUSE THERE IS I-  (fe_03_00958-B-0027)
IF YOU THINK OF THE FLIGHT PATH OF AN AIRPLANE UM ON TAKEOFF PARTICULARLY AH YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A HU- THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF AREA UNDER THAT FLIGHT PATH FROM WHICH SOMEBODY COULD SIT THERE WITH A STINGER MISSILE  (fe_03_00958-B-0028)
AND YOU KNOW AND HOW DO YOU POLICE EVERY SQUARE INCH OF YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AH OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY  (fe_03_00958-B-0029)
YEAH I I THINK THAT I THINK THE PROTECTION IS THAT UM YOU CAN'T GO TO YOUR LOCAL M- WAL-MART AND BUY A STINGER MISSILE  (fe_03_00958-B-0031)
AH AND IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO AQU- TO ACQUIRE IN THIS COUNTRY AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO SMUGGLE ONE IN AND I THINK [NOISE]  (fe_03_00958-B-0032)
WELL I I GUESS YOU KNOW I I C- I HADN'T FINISHED AH MY STATEMENT BUT I I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING TO IS IS WE DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_00958-B-0033)
AH THAT WOULD BE THE THAT WOULD BE BE THE WAY THAT IT WOULD BE DONE IS AH SOMEBODY WOULD SMUGGLE A STINGER OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF HEAT SEEKING MISSILE IN  (fe_03_00958-B-0034)
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO GET THINGS INTO THIS COUNTRY  (fe_03_00958-B-0035)
SO I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_00958-B-0036)
[NOISE] YOU WERE  (fe_03_00958-B-0037)
AND WHAT WHAT WHAT STOPPED YOU  (fe_03_00958-B-0038)
THAT'LL DO IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00958-B-0039)
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE HABIT  (fe_03_00958-B-0040)
WHEN WAS THAT  (fe_03_00958-B-0041)
I GOT MY LICENSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD  (fe_03_00958-B-0042)
YEP  (fe_03_00958-B-0043)
MHM THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS PA- I WAS PAYING FIFTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR FOR THE AIRPLANE AND SIX BUCKS AN HOUR FOR THE INSTRUCTOR [NOISE]  (fe_03_00958-B-0044)
[MN] I THINK WE ARE SOME UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0045)
I I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A REPEAT OF NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_00958-B-0046)
UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0047)
BUT THERE ARE OTHER OTHER WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INTO AIRPLANES AND CAUSE TROUBLE AH YOU KNOW Y- I I THINK WE STILL ARE NOT  (fe_03_00958-B-0048)
REAL WELL PROTECTED AGAINST BLOWING UP AN AIRPLANE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SKY  (fe_03_00958-B-0049)
UM BUT I THINK I THINK TAKING OVER AN AIRPLANE AND HAVING SOMEBODY SOMEBODY AN EVIL PERSON FLY AN AIRPLANE IS A LOT LESS LIKELY  (fe_03_00958-B-0050)
[MN] WELL I DON'T THINK A BIO- I DON'T THINK A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK WOULD BECAUSE THAT TAKES TIME BUT THERE'S AN INCUBATION PERIOD BUT CHEMICALS COULD COULD CERTAINLY AH RAISE HAVOC ON AN AIRPLANE [NOISE] MHM  (fe_03_00958-B-0051)
MHM MM  (fe_03_00958-B-0052)
[MN] NO THERE THERE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ONE HUNDR- ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFETY IN LIFE UM I GUESS THAT'S THE PHIL- PHILOSOPHICAL PART IS UH  (fe_03_00958-B-0053)
WELL WE NEVER HAD HUNDRED PER CENT SAFETY THOUGH  (fe_03_00958-B-0054)
WE FELT  (fe_03_00958-B-0055)
YEAH  (fe_03_00958-B-0056)
[MN] [LIPSMACK] YES UM [MN] BUT I THINK UM I SUSPECT PEOPLE HAD SIMILAR FEELINGS RIGHT AFTER PEARL HARBOR  (fe_03_00958-B-0057)
UM PEOPLE NO LONGER FELT SAFE AND AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER WORLD WAR TWO ENDED AND UM  (fe_03_00958-B-0058)
WE WEREN'T ATTACKED AGAIN  (fe_03_00958-B-0059)
PEOPLE BEGAN TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS UM IS  (fe_03_00958-B-0060)
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REPEAT OF IT UM [MN] AND I THINK IT WILL FADE INTO OUR MEMORIES AND AFTER A WHILE WE'LL BEGIN TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00958-B-0061)
I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_00958-B-0062)
I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_00958-B-0063)
I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THEY'VE DONE IS UM [MN] MADE IT PRETTY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE COCKPIT OF AN AIRPLANE  (fe_03_00958-B-0064)
AND HAVE TRAINED PILOTS THAT UM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BACK YOU NEED TO FLY THE PLANE  (fe_03_00958-B-0065)
AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN IN THIS CASE IS THAT AH THEY STARTED KILLING MEMBERS OF THE FLIGHT CREW THE S- THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS AND THE PILOTS CAME BACK AND THAT'S  (fe_03_00958-B-0066)
