HI DENISE MY NAME IS LAURIE  (fe_03_00936-A-0001)
HOW ARE YOU TODAY  (fe_03_00936-A-0002)
GOOD  (fe_03_00936-A-0003)
THAT'S AN INTERESTING TOPIC ISN'T IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0004)
[LAUGHTER] AT LEAST IT'S FUN [LAUGHTER] AH  (fe_03_00936-A-0005)
OH  (fe_03_00936-A-0006)
RIGHT AH I THINK MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY IS CHRISTMAS 'CAUSE IT BRINGS OUT THE CHILD IN ME WHAT'S YOURS MHM  (fe_03_00936-A-0007)
YES [LAUGHTER] IT IT IT UM IT'S SO MUCH FUN BECAUSE ALL THE LIGHTS AND JUST THE EVERYBODY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S SO FESTIVE AND AND THEY'RE EVEN BETTER THAT TIME OF YEAR  (fe_03_00936-A-0008)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_00936-A-0010)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00936-A-0011)
I AGREE WITH THAT IT'S AN EXCUSE FOR ALL THE FAMILY TO GET TOGETHER [NOISE]  (fe_03_00936-A-0012)
MY DAUGHTER LEARNT UM SHE JUST REALIZED ABOUT CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR SO UM ALL THIS YEAR SHE'S BEEN ASKING IF SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TODAY [LAUGHTER] I HAD TO SAY NO SOON BUT NOT RIGHT NOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00936-A-0014)
RIGHT UM I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION WAS IF WE COULD CREATE A HOLIDAY WHAT WOULD THAT BE  (fe_03_00936-A-0015)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00936-A-0017)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0018)
AND THAT WAS THE CROSSING GUARD  (fe_03_00936-A-0019)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0020)
[LAUGHTER] I THINK UM A LOT OF THE TIME AH PEOPLE REALLY GO INTO DEBT FOR THESE BIG PRESENTS FOR CHRISTMAS  (fe_03_00936-A-0021)
AND I FEEL IT'S REALLY UNNECESSARY  (fe_03_00936-A-0022)
THAT'S A GOOD ONE I LIKE THAT ONE  (fe_03_00936-A-0023)
I THINK MINE WOULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH CELEBRATING UM CHILDREN  (fe_03_00936-A-0024)
JUST UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0025)
MAYBE PARENTS AND RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF CHILDREN JUST TAKING THE DAY OUT TO SPEND TIME AND REALIZING HOW SPECIAL THE CHILDREN ARE  (fe_03_00936-A-0026)
I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF TIMES UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0028)
OUR CHILDREN GET KIND OF LOOKED OVER  (fe_03_00936-A-0029)
YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THAT PHRASE HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR CHILD TODAY  (fe_03_00936-A-0030)
AND I THINK UM A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0031)
UM [LIPSMACK] I THINK OH GOODNESS [LAUGHTER] NOW YOU PUT ME ON THE SPOT I CAN'T THINK  (fe_03_00936-A-0032)
YES DEFINITELY NO SCHOOL UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0033)
RIGHT NO WORK FOR THE PARENTS THAT'S A GOOD ONE AND MAYBE JUST UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0034)
GOSH I WANNA SAY TAKE 'EM TO THE ZOO [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] BUT JUST AH MAYBE HAVE A DAY OF FAMILY ACTIVITIES UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0035)
MAYBE CALLING RELATIVES THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE STATE TO GET TOGETHER MHM  (fe_03_00936-A-0036)
UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0037)
I DON'T KNOW GOODNESS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0038)
[LAUGHTER] AND JUST KIND OF SPENDING TIME YOU KNOW TALKING WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND AND JUST UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0039)
LETTING THEM KNOW [NOISE] HOW SPECIAL THEY ARE  (fe_03_00936-A-0040)
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN CHILDREN MAYBE A [NOISE] CHILD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT  (fe_03_00936-A-0041)
MIGHT NOT HAVE A LARGE FAMILY OR OR THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00936-A-0042)
SO  (fe_03_00936-A-0043)
RIGHT IT HELPS BUILD THEIR SELF ESTEEM  (fe_03_00936-A-0045)
AND UM I THINK THEY END UP BEING MORE OF A A ROUNDED PERSON  (fe_03_00936-A-0046)
UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0047)
A LOT LESS  (fe_03_00936-A-0048)
UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0049)
[MN] LESS RELIABLE ON OTHER PEOPLE FOR THAT  (fe_03_00936-A-0050)
[SIGH] YEAH BECAUSE THEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE  (fe_03_00936-A-0053)
PUT SOMETHING INTO IT  (fe_03_00936-A-0054)
WELL THAT'S A GOOD ONE I KNOW MY DAUGHTER REALLY UM ENJOYS  (fe_03_00936-A-0055)
WELL SHE'S ONLY THREE BUT SHE REALLY ENJOYS HELPING AROUND THE HOUSE AND HELPING ME DO THINGS AND SHE'LL SAY MOMMY CAN I HELP  (fe_03_00936-A-0056)
SO I THINK MAYBE CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAVE THAT KIND OF BUILT INTO THEM WHERE THEY WANT TO HELP JUST SOMETIMES UM THEY DON'T KNOW HOW OR WE DON'T GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY  (fe_03_00936-A-0057)
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING  (fe_03_00936-A-0058)
MHM YEAH  (fe_03_00936-A-0059)
YEAH I THINK A LOT OF TIMES UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0060)
LIKE YOU SAID MAKING SOMETHING LIKE A CRAFT OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S MORE OF A HANDS ON INSTEAD OF JUST UM I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WE  (fe_03_00936-A-0061)
LET THE CHILDREN SIT IN FRONT OF THE T._V. OR SUCH INSTEAD OF [NOISE] HAVING THEM DO THINGS  (fe_03_00936-A-0062)
LIKE WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER I THINK WE DID MORE WITH OUR PARENTS YOU KNOW WE WERE  (fe_03_00936-A-0063)
OUT ACTIVE DOING THINGS INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0064)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0065)
[LAUGHTER] OH YES THE COMPUTER GAMES I TELL YOU [NOISE] THAT'S REALLY GONE OFF [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00936-A-0066)
UM LET'S SEE HERE CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER HOLIDAY YOU WOULD WANT TO DO  (fe_03_00936-A-0067)
[NOISE] [MN] OH THAT'S REALLY GOOD [NOISE] BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A WAY OF PASSING ON UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0068)
[SIGH] MAYBE DIFFERENT TRADITIONS OR A FEW [NOISE] IDEAS THAT THEIR ANCESTOR HAD [NOISE]  (fe_03_00936-A-0069)
YOU KNOW A WAY OF KEEPING THEIR FAMILY SPIRIT ALIVE  (fe_03_00936-A-0070)
DEFINITELY I THINK UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0072)
A LOT OF TIMES  (fe_03_00936-A-0073)
WE TEND TO  (fe_03_00936-A-0074)
MORE [NOISE] CONCENTRATE ON THE [NOISE] GRIEF OF LOSING SOMEONE [NOISE] THAN  (fe_03_00936-A-0075)
CELEBRATING THEIR LIFE [NOISE]  (fe_03_00936-A-0076)
THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE  (fe_03_00936-A-0077)
YEAH THAT WOULD THAT REALLY WOULD BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0078)
WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0079)
ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHERE IF WE DID HAVE THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_00936-A-0080)
YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF I DON'T MEAN TO BE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY'VE AH LEARNT IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND DIFFERENT PRACTICES THAT THEY HAVE BUT I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN ABOUT SOME OF THAT STUFF  (fe_03_00936-A-0081)
TEN MINUTES IS A LONG TIME WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK  (fe_03_00936-A-0083)
[LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] UM  (fe_03_00936-A-0084)

AND PEOPLE COME FROM OUT OF TOWN AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE DINNER WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN  (fe_03_00936-B-0011)
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT MY SON AND MY NEPHEWS LOOK FORWARD TO FOR MONTHS IN ADVANCE WHICH IS REALLY FUN  (fe_03_00936-B-0012)

I WOULD AH I WOULD HAVE LESS SHOPPING AND BUYING AND GIVING PRESENTS I THINK  (fe_03_00936-B-0018)
'CAUSE I THINK RECENTLY PEOPLE H- HAVE STARTED REALLY GOING OVERBOARD ON PRESENTS LIKE THE CROSSING GUARD IN OUR TOWN NEAR THE SCHOOL SHE HAD THIS HUGE PILE OF PRESENTS [LAUGHTER] I JUST THOUGHT THAT'S A BIT MUCH  (fe_03_00936-B-0019)
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME AND PEOPLE ARE BUYING HER STUFF  (fe_03_00936-B-0021)
