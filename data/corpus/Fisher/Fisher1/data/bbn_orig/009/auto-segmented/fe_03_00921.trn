SADDAM ISN'T PLAYING THE GAME RIGHT EITHER  (fe_03_00921-B-0009)

ALSO THE AH CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AH  (fe_03_00921-B-0014)
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS I IS I THINK OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A WR- A  (fe_03_00921-B-0015)
A AH HOW'S THAT THEY DON'T ENOUGH FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_00921-B-0016)
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE EUROPEANS THINK AND  (fe_03_00921-B-0017)
I THINK INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY POINTING IT TO  (fe_03_00921-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_00921-B-0019)
YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW SADDAM IS PLAYING A GAME  (fe_03_00921-B-0020)
AND I SAW COLIN POWELL'S SPEECH YESTERDAY TOO AND I THE WHOLE A- AS MUCH AS I COULD WATCH  (fe_03_00921-B-0021)
I I DO THINK YEAH HE'S HIDING THEM HE'S HE DEFINITELY HAS THEM WHERE HE'S HIDING THEM IS THE QUESTION MARK  (fe_03_00921-B-0023)
THE EUROPEANS UNFORTUNATELY ARE ARE YOU F- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WHAT AH  (fe_03_00921-B-0024)
PRIME MINISTER CHAMBERLAIN DID WITH AH NAZIS BEFORE WORLD WAR TWO  (fe_03_00921-B-0025)
OH [MN] THERE WAS A POLICY OF [SIGH] AH OF CO-OPERATION  (fe_03_00921-B-0026)
ADOLF HITLER TOOK OVER PART OF POLAND AND SAID OH I'M JUST RE- RECAPTURING PART OF GERMANY NOT A PROBLEM AND CHAMBERLAIN SAID OH YEAH NO PROBLEM AND OF COURSE THAT LED TO WORLD WAR TWO GETTING OUT OF HAND AND I THINK THE EUROPEANS ARE BEING FOOLISH  (fe_03_00921-B-0027)
IN THINKING THAT THIS INSPECTION IS ACTUALLY GOING TO YIELD RESULTS  (fe_03_00921-B-0028)
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING ABOUT IT IF THEY PUT A FIRM DEADLINE AND SAID THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE DEADLINE  (fe_03_00921-B-0029)
THEY MIGHT GET RESULTS BUT SADDAM IS PLAYING HIS GAME  (fe_03_00921-B-0030)
AND THEY'RE PLAYING IT WITH HIM UNFORTUNATELY  (fe_03_00921-B-0031)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_00921-B-0033)
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AN- AN- AND THE AH ARABIC NEIGHBORS TO IRAQ WHO ARE ON HIS SIDE HAVE FORGOTTEN HE'S ATTACKED OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES  (fe_03_00921-B-0035)
IN THE PAST IN FACT HE'S ATTACKED TWO OF HIS NEIGHBORS  (fe_03_00921-B-0036)
TRYING TO INVADE THEM AND SUCCESSFULLY INVADED ONE  (fe_03_00921-B-0037)
SO YEAH DISARMAMENT I THINK IS NECESS- NECESSARY THE PROBLEM OCCURRED EARLIER ON THOUGH WHEN BUSH  (fe_03_00921-B-0038)
INITIALLY TALKED ABOUT REGIME CHANGE BEFORE HE TALKED ABOUT DISARMAMENT AND THAT WAS A  (fe_03_00921-B-0039)
AH A GAFFE AN ERROR IN HIS PART  (fe_03_00921-B-0040)
BECAUSE THE EUROPEANS AND CERTAINLY I THINK A LOT OF AH ARAB STATES  (fe_03_00921-B-0041)
FEEL THIS IS STRICTLY ABOUT A AH REGIME CHANGE [NOISE] AND NOT DISARMAMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE FOOT HE LED WITH SO  (fe_03_00921-B-0042)
BUT AS FOR THE CENTRAL QUESTION ON HERE I DO THINK WE NEED TO [MN] DO SOMETHING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00921-B-0043)
YEP UM O- ON THE ISSUE OF YOU KNOW WHY DON'T WE SEND SOMEBODY IN DIRECTLY I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN THE FIRST GULF WAR AND  (fe_03_00921-B-0045)

THE LEADERSHIP NOT THE LEADERSHIP OF ANY COUNTRY NOT LIKING THE IDEA OF SANCTIONING REMOVING BY THAT MANNER THE LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES  (fe_03_00921-B-0047)
BECAUSE  (fe_03_00921-B-0048)
ABOUT AS EASILY AS WE COULD GET SOMEBODY OVER THERE TO GET SADDAM IN FACT POSSIBLY MORE EASILY THEY COULD GET SOMEBODY OVER HERE TO GET BUSH  (fe_03_00921-B-0049)
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY DON'T WANT TO GO  (fe_03_00921-B-0050)
AH DOWN THAT PATH [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE  (fe_03_00921-B-0051)
THAT'S ONE WAY THEY DON'T HAVE A AH  (fe_03_00921-B-0052)
MILITARY SUPER- SUPERIORITY YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00921-B-0053)
AN- AN- AND AGAIN DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT NINETEEN PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO TAKE OUT SO MUCH  (fe_03_00921-B-0055)

WELL ACTUALLY WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE TIMING  (fe_03_00921-B-0062)
IF WE THINK WAS GOING TO WAR  (fe_03_00921-B-0063)
MY BROTHER IN LAW HAD AN INTERESTING POINT AND THAT IS THAT THE U._S. WILL PROBABLY MOVE DURING A NEW MOON WHEN THERE'S NO MOON OUT  (fe_03_00921-B-0064)
AND LOOKING AT THAT I WOULD SAY THAT SOMEWHERE AROUND APRIL FIRST IS THE STRIKE DATE  (fe_03_00921-B-0065)

I'M SUS- JUDGING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME AROUND  (fe_03_00921-B-0069)
IS THAT YOURS OR MINE  (fe_03_00921-B-0070)
OH OKAY NO PROBLEM  (fe_03_00921-B-0071)

THESE PEOPLE WON'T KEEP THEIR MOUTH COMPLETELY SHUT THEY'LL BRAG ABOUT SOMETHING  (fe_03_00921-B-0076)
AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT THEY MIGHT WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE TIME TO SWEAT THIS GUY  (fe_03_00921-B-0077)
FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT I- IF NOT NECESSARILY THE SLEEPER CELLS THEMSELVES BUT THEY ALSO CAPTURED A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE WITH THIS GUY  (fe_03_00921-B-0078)
THEY CAPTURED A LOT OF MATERIAL  (fe_03_00921-B-0079)
SO THEY MAY WANT TO SIFT THROUGH THAT MATERIAL  (fe_03_00921-B-0080)
GET A CLUE IF NOT WHO IS GONNA BE DOING SOMETHING WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHAT'S THE TAR- WHAT ARE THE TARGETS THIS NEXT TIME AROUND  (fe_03_00921-B-0081)
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT BE WELL WORTH WAITING A FEW WEEKS ON  (fe_03_00921-B-0082)
MHM  (fe_03_00921-B-0083)
UM I HAVE A FEELING WE KNOW WE'RE BETTER AT KNOWING IT THAN THEY THINK WE ARE  (fe_03_00921-B-0084)

I'M ALSO WILLING TO BET THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO MORE CARS IN THE ENTOURAGE THAT GO WITH THE REAL SADDAM  (fe_03_00921-B-0087)
AND THE CAR AND THE DOUBLE THEY'RE NOT THAT SMART YOU KNOW NOT NOT MEANING TO BELITTLE 'EM THAT MUCH BUT I DON'T THINK THEY FIGURED THAT ONE OUT BUT THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT TILL NOW WHEN YOU'VE BROUGHT IT UP OH GOD  (fe_03_00921-B-0088)
