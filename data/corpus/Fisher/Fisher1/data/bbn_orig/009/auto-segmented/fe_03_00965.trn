I HAVE FLOWN SINCE NINE ELEVEN A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I EXPERIENCED YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THE LONG LINES AND WHAT NOT AT THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_00965-A-0008)
AND THE EXTRA SECURITY BUT [SIGH] I THINK JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I'M QUESTIONING WHETHER THAT SECURITY REALLY IS HEIGHTENED  (fe_03_00965-A-0009)
THE SECURITY  (fe_03_00965-A-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00965-A-0013)

INTERESTING  (fe_03_00965-A-0018)

RIGHT WELL IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY THAT 'CAUSE I  (fe_03_00965-A-0024)
FLEW ACTUALLY IN AND OUT OF SACRAMENTO THE FOLLOWING MONTH  (fe_03_00965-A-0025)
AFTER THE NINE ELEVEN EVENT AND  (fe_03_00965-A-0026)
THERE WAS DEFINITELY HEIGHTENED SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT AND ONE OF THE PASSENGERS THAT WE WERE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE WERE TRAVELLING WITH GOT SEARCHED AT ALL THREE CHECK POINTS WHEN THEY WERE CHECKING INTO THE AIRPORT THEIR BAGS GOT SEARCHED  (fe_03_00965-A-0027)
AND WHEN THEY WENT TO THE [LIPSMACK] THE DETECTOR THAT YOU WALK THROUGH THEY GOT  (fe_03_00965-A-0028)
CHECKED THERE AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE GATE THEY HAD TO HAVE BE SEARCHED AT THE GATE AS WELL BEFORE THEY GOT ON THE PLANE AND THIS IS YOUR AVERAGE EVERY DAY  (fe_03_00965-A-0029)
CAUCASIAN FEMALE  (fe_03_00965-A-0030)
SO WE WERE ALL KIND OF BLOWN AWAY THAT SHE GOT SEARCHED YOU KNOW GOT CHECKED THREE SEPARATE TIMES  (fe_03_00965-A-0031)
AND SHE WAS SO EMBARRASSED BECAUSE SHE WAS LIKE THE LEAD OF THE CONFERENCE THAT WE HAD GONE TO SO HERE'S ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAD BEEN AT THE CONFERENCE WITH AND SHE'S BEING CHECKED  (fe_03_00965-A-0032)

YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING AND THEN I ALSO TRAVELLED TO HAWAII JUST LAST JUNE AND ON MY FLIGHT OUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS EXTRA SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT DOWN IN ONTARIO  (fe_03_00965-A-0034)
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS VERY STRICT  (fe_03_00965-A-0035)
AT THAT POINT AT ALL AND THEN ON THE WAY THERE I HAD A CORKSCREW A WINE BOTTLE OPENER IN MY PURSE  (fe_03_00965-A-0036)
AND ON THE WAY BACK FROM HAWAII TO COME BACK TO THE STATES THEY CAUGHT IT IN THE DETECTOR AND THEY TOOK IT FROM ME  (fe_03_00965-A-0037)
A WINE OPENER I HAD IN MY PURSE BUT I HAD TRAVELLED WITH IT  (fe_03_00965-A-0039)
OR EXCUSE ME WITH IT IN MY PURSE FROM CALIFORNIA TO HAWAII AND ON THE WAY BACK THEY CONFISCATED IT SO THEY SAID SORRY I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS WITH YOU  (fe_03_00965-A-0040)

RUNNING AROUND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ELSE THERE'S OTHER THAT  (fe_03_00965-A-0049)
THERE'S ANOTHER CHANCE OF ANOTHER ATTACK AND THAT THEY HAD OTHER THINGS PLANNED I'M SURE IT DEFINITELY MAKES YOU WORRY AND BE CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELLING  (fe_03_00965-A-0050)
