HI CARRIE  (fe_03_00982-B-0002)
GOOD THANKS  (fe_03_00982-B-0003)
WHAT DO WE THINK THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO PREVENT THIS  (fe_03_00982-B-0005)
THE WHOLE THING IS ABSOLUTELY SO FRIGHTENING TO ME THAT [SIGH] I MEAN  (fe_03_00982-B-0006)
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN  (fe_03_00982-B-0007)
YEAH SO YOU'RE PROBABLY FEELING THE SAME WAY  (fe_03_00982-B-0008)
IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S [SIGH] I WAS TALKING TO MY HUSBAND THE OTHER DAY ABOUT IT AND I SAID YOU KNOW LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE'VE NEVER REALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF THING  (fe_03_00982-B-0009)
SO AS FAR AS WHAT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO ABOUT IT [SIGH] OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT WE CAN DO I THINK OUR BORDERS NEED TO BE TIGHTER  (fe_03_00982-B-0010)
I THINK THAT TO ME IS YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND ANYBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH OUR BORDERS  (fe_03_00982-B-0011)
AND EVEN SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE PROBABLY TIGHTENED THEM AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD  (fe_03_00982-B-0012)
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE COMES TO MIND  (fe_03_00982-B-0013)
YEAH  (fe_03_00982-B-0014)
EXACTLY I KNOW I KNOW ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_00982-B-0015)
I KNOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0016)
I KNOW I KNOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0017)
I MEAN IT'S  (fe_03_00982-B-0019)
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STANDPOINT I GUESS MAKING PEOPLE AWARE IS VERY IMPORTANT UM BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALMOST A BORDERLINE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE PUSHING THE BUTTON A LITTLE BIT TO WHERE YOU'RE ALMOST PUSHING PEOPLE INTO A PANIC  (fe_03_00982-B-0020)
SO I KNOW FOR MYSELF I HAVEN'T GONE OUT AND PURCHASED DUCT TAPE OR ANY OF THAT WE ALWAYS KEEP EXTRA WATER IN THE HOUSE  (fe_03_00982-B-0021)
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE THREAT OF EARTHQUAKE [LAUGHTER] BUT OTHER THAN THAT I YOU KNOW I MEAN WE HAVE A LITTLE EMERGENCY KIT AND THAT'S ABOUT IT  (fe_03_00982-B-0022)
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT COULD DO  (fe_03_00982-B-0023)
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER I MEAN WE HAVE AGENCIES C._I._A. EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU KNOW ALL THESE SECRET SERVICE AGENCIES  (fe_03_00982-B-0024)
AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS AND WHY SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WAS EVEN POSSIBLE WAS THAT THEY DON'T COMMUNICATE  (fe_03_00982-B-0025)
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND RATHER THAN HAVE OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORTING EACH OTHER THEY'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO YOU KNOW TO GET PROMOTIONS AND WHATEVER IT IS  (fe_03_00982-B-0026)
ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_00982-B-0027)
WELL I THINK NOW THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE BIT THEY'RE A LOT ACTUALLY THEY'RE PROBABLY A LOT MORE AWARE OF THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT THEY'RE INTERCEPTING  (fe_03_00982-B-0028)
AND I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOU KNOW HOW THE ALERT WENT UP RECENTLY TO AN ORANGE  (fe_03_00982-B-0029)
UM AND I THINK THAT HAD TO DO WITH THEM OVERHEARING SOME OF THE SECRET SERVICE AGENCIES OVERHEARING CONVERSATIONS  (fe_03_00982-B-0030)
I KNOW OH I KNOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0032)
NOBODY KNOWS WHY AND WHAT DO YOU DO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN HOME WHAT DO YOU DO  (fe_03_00982-B-0033)
MY CHILDREN ARE TOO OLD TO KEEP HOME MY YOUNGEST ONE HAS JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN AND SHE'S GETTING READY TO SHE'S BEEN LOOKING AT EAST COAST COLLEGES AND SHE'S GETTING READY TO ACTUALLY GO SPEND A WEEK AT N._Y._U.  (fe_03_00982-B-0034)
AND I'M IN A MAJOR PANIC OVER HERE  (fe_03_00982-B-0035)
YEAH I DON'T WANT TO LET HER GO AND THEN MY OLDER DAUGHTER  (fe_03_00982-B-0036)
SHE GOES TO SCHOOL LOCALLY COLLEGE LOCALLY SHE JUST TURNED TWENTY  (fe_03_00982-B-0037)
BUT SHE LIKES TO PRETTY MUCH STAY CLOSE TO HOME WHEN SHE'S FINISHED SHE'S HEADING DOWN TO SAN DIEGO STATE SO SHE WANTS TO STICK CLOSE TO HOME THE OTHER ONE WANTS TO TRAVEL THE WORLD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00982-B-0038)
AND I WANT HER TO BUT IT'S JUST EVERYTHING IS SO UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0039)
WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO  (fe_03_00982-B-0040)
BESIDES TIGHTENING THE BORDERS HAVING THE AGENCIES WORK YOU KNOW MORE INTERACTIVELY TOGETHER DO  (fe_03_00982-B-0041)
YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAN BE DONE  (fe_03_00982-B-0042)
I KNOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0043)
I KNOW IT'S CALLED POLITICS  (fe_03_00982-B-0044)
YEAH WELL NOW YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED PER CENT SUPPORT THANKS TO FRANCE  (fe_03_00982-B-0045)
THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN OUR CORNER SO  (fe_03_00982-B-0046)
YEAH I DON'T KNOW I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN GO IN THERE AND DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH IRAQ AND THAT WILL PUT THIS ALL TO REST BUT  (fe_03_00982-B-0047)
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER THAN THAT  (fe_03_00982-B-0048)
THE U._N. SECURITY YEAH RIGHT  (fe_03_00982-B-0049)
OF COURSE THEY'RE ONLY SEEING WHAT  (fe_03_00982-B-0050)
SADDAM HUSSEIN WANTS THEM TO SEE YEAH  (fe_03_00982-B-0051)
I KNOW  (fe_03_00982-B-0052)

BUT AS FAR AS BIOTERRORISM I MEAN  (fe_03_00982-B-0054)
GOSH I JUST I MEAN LOOK AT ALL THE  (fe_03_00982-B-0055)
I KNOW AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINK OF ALL THE TANKERS THAT COME IN AND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOREIGN LANDS YOU KNOW WITH ALL OF OUR THE IMPORTS THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT COMES INTO OUR PORTS  (fe_03_00982-B-0056)
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY TOO I MEAN SOMETHING COULD COME OFF OF A PORT AND HAVE A BOMB ON IT  (fe_03_00982-B-0057)
SO I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST UGH  (fe_03_00982-B-0058)
REALLY AND I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT WE'VE NEVER REALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS BEFORE  (fe_03_00982-B-0059)
WE'VE HAD THE LUXURY OF LIVING IN THE U._S._A. AND THE U._S._A. NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MEAN WE USED TO LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES  (fe_03_00982-B-0060)
WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS BUSES THAT WERE YOU KNOW BOMBED AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND GO OH MY GOSH THEY ARE UNCIVIL  (fe_03_00982-B-0061)
AND HERE WE ARE RIGHT  (fe_03_00982-B-0063)
OH ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_00982-B-0064)
ABSOLUTELY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY SCARY IS YOU KNOW LIKE NERVE GAS AND SOME OF THAT STUFF THAT THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  (fe_03_00982-B-0065)
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO IF THEY GO TO A CODE RED YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT DO YOU DO SIT IN FRONT OF YOUR TELEVISION  (fe_03_00982-B-0066)

MAYBE UNITED YOU KNOW NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND ARE WE MOVING TOWARDS WAR OR AWAY FROM IT  (fe_03_00982-B-0073)
KNOW I THINK PART OF IT IS YOU FEEL SOMEWHAT HELPLESS  (fe_03_00982-B-0075)
YOU REALLY DO BECAUSE YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR FUTURE IS IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS  (fe_03_00982-B-0076)
SO [SIGH]  (fe_03_00982-B-0077)
YEAH I REALLY DO THINK THOUGH THAT TIGHTENING THE BORDERS IS ONE THING AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE I MEAN WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY  (fe_03_00982-B-0078)

AND WE HAVE BORDER PATROLS THROUGHOUT THIS THAT AREA COMING THROUGH AND EVEN AS FAR AS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE FORTY MILES INLAND BUT A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL COME BACK THROUGH AND THEY'LL BE CLOSED  (fe_03_00982-B-0087)
AND I KNOW THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER BORDER YOU KNOW THE OTHER BORDER PATROL CHECKS SO SOME ARE OPEN AND SOME ARE CLOSED BUT NONETHELESS I DON'T KNOW I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT  (fe_03_00982-B-0088)
YOU KNOW THE ONLY WAY THOSE TERRORISTS GOT IN OUR GOT IN AN AEROPLANE WAS BECAUSE WE LET THEM IN OUR COUNTRY  (fe_03_00982-B-0089)

YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE HOMELAND SECURITY THING WAS SUPPOSED TO FREE UP ONE GOVERNMENT AGENCY SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE DECISIONS YOU KNOW VERY QUICKLY  (fe_03_00982-B-0098)
SO  (fe_03_00982-B-0099)
I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN TIGHTENING UP THE BORDERS AND REALLY PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHO'S ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY  (fe_03_00982-B-0100)
I MEAN IT'S LIKE MAYBE THEY NEED TO DO SOME SORT OF SPONTANEOUS  (fe_03_00982-B-0101)
