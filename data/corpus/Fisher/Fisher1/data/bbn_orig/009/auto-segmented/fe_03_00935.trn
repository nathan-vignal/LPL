WELL I I DON'T KNOW LIKE DO YOU THINK THAT  (fe_03_00935-A-0036)

AND THEN HE'S TAKING EVEN MORE MONEY AWAY AND PUTTING IT TOWARDS FIGHTING INSTEAD OF FINDING MORE MONEY FROM THE MILITARY AND PUTTING IT TOWARDS SCHOOLS AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE I LOVE THAT BUMPER STICKER THAT IT'LL BE LIKE IT'LL BE A FINE DAY WHEN  (fe_03_00935-A-0038)
THE U._S. MILITARY HAS TO HAVE A BACK SALE TO PAY FOR THE WEAPONS THEY USE [LAUGHTER] AND SCHOOLS HAVE ALL THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE CLASS  (fe_03_00935-A-0039)
