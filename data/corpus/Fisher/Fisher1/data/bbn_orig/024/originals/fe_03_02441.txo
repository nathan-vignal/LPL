R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Alicia Warden.
L:  Ah, this is a really strange topic for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, I don't personally smoke or drink very often, um, I guess --
R:  Oh, I -- I have a totally different topic.
L:  Oh, you do?  [MN] 
R:  I have reality TV shows.
L:  Oh, weird.  I'd rather talk about that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know what we're supposed to ta- talk about.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, they asked me about which do you think is worst, gossiping, smoking, drinking excessively or drinking too much caffeine.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um.
L:  I don't know if we should hang up and call again or something.  I'd rather talk about rea- reality TV shows.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, well, we'll talk about my topic first.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  They asked why do you think they're so popular.  [MN] 
L:  Hm.  In a way, I think they're kind of, like, less reality than, like --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- sitcoms or drama shows.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  They're like more of a --
R:  --  it's really stupid how America, like, some of 'em are interesting, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but some are really outrageous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They are.  Like, um, what was that one?  Like, the Bachelor -- like the marrying shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you marry people you don't base your decision --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- on, like, a TV show and --
L:  I know.  I find myself, like, watching them every now and then.  I'm just, like, this is such a strange phenomenon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, like, Survivor was okay.  You know, that was the beginning and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, now, it's just a little out of hand.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think, like, good drama shows or something that are fictitious are supposed to be more, like, in tune with real life scenarios or they're supposed to mirror something about us but this is more like a distraction or an escapist thing.  
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I don't know.  I think maybe America, like, lives out their, I don't know, lives out their fantasies or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they want to do by watching [NOISE] nothing!  [LAUGH]  Sorry.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um.  I don't know, but, um, what was the other question?
L:  Oh.
R:  Do you watch any of them?  Like, which ones have you watched?  
L:  Um, I've just watched, like, an episode of this or that, you know.  I haven't kept up with anything.  I don't watch a whole lot of TV or [inaudible] or anything.  [MN] 
R:  I don't know if this is a reality show but there's a show called Hot or Not and it --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Have you -- okay, you've seen it on --
L:  I watched that the first time. 
R:  Oh.
L:  I didn't know if it was still on or not because I never see it or hear anything about it.
R:  Oh, yeah, it was, like, it's kinda degrading. [MN] 
L:  It's horrible.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's degrading, eh, but people actually go on it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they -- they put themselves in that place.
L:  I can't imagine wanting to do that one. 
R:  I know.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  I know, but, I mean, if you're hot [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, and I guess you have to be a little cocky.
L:  I just don't understand, like, who's qualified to judge that, you know, like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, the people --
L:  -- one of the judges was, like, so perverted and weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, the -- the -- the blond guy?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I was watching 'cause it was on after Friends and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I was, like, [MN] it was kind of interesting.  It kind of held my attention 'cause, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, to see, like, who actually makes it.  I think -- I think the big thing is, like, who's gonna win, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  I just think that's such a subjective thing.  I just don't understand how there's, like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- they're promoting this whole, like, this is the standard of beauty.  I'm, like, oh, come on, do we really need that.
R:  I know.  One of 'em there, like, yeah --
L:  Do we really need like --
R:  -- you're good except for your knees.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's like --
L:  Like, everyone needs to be more self conscious about their body, have, like, more body issues.
R:  Yeah, I know [MN].
L:  God.
R:  But other ones like, um, what's the other one?  The Bachelor I've seen.  That was -- oh, no, no, Joe Millionaire, you know the one --
L:  Yeah, I watched that a couple of times.
R:  Yeah, I watched that a couple of times but, um, it was pretty funny how you could obviously tell the people who actually wanted to marry him for the money. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like that one blonde chick that was such a bitch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I thought he was going for her for a while.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I think he was just trying to make the show interesting in -- instead of, like, I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- being married for, like, his temper.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, you feel like he was doing it for a joke and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- didn't he, like, end up, um, didn't he end up divorcing or something. 
L:  I don't[?] think so.  I don't -- I didn't, like, keep up with it after that.  I remember it was, like, in all these magazines and stuff.  I'm like, argh!  [LAUGH]  I'm embarrassed for these people but ...
R:  Yeah, I'm sure it didn't work out.  And then there's that new one.  You know the one with the masks?
L:  The masks?  
R:  Oh, you haven- --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  I haven't watched that yet.
R:  I haven't -- I don't think it came out.  I don't know if it came out yet.
L:  That looks really weird.
R:  Yeah, that one's a little too much.  They do -- they look like -- have you ever seen a movie with Leonardo di Caprio in it?  Um --
R:  Oh!
L:  The Man in the Iron Mask?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's --.
R:  That's what they remind me of.
L:  -- kinda creepy.
R:  I know.  It's a bit, ah, like sitting there talking to --
L:  It's an interesting concept but I'm not sure, like, I mean, you could obviously tell if there was, like, some big overweight person that they would still be judging on their appearance or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I mean ...
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it is a good concept actually because most people are, like, you know, base what they like on looks.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it seems like it's going for something that's kind of --
R:  But it's just scary.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  To, like, sit there and have a conversation --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- with someone in this weird colored mask and ...
L:  I can't imagine being that girl that has, like, thirty guys trying to --
R:  Yeah, that'd be fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- win her over in, like, this really short amount of time, like --
R:  [LAUGH] That'd be fun.
L:  -- oh, I can just pick and choose, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, see, then, the -- the base[?] thing is when, like, she picks somebody and then they take their mask off and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, like, I don't know if, um, like the TV show for NBC or whoever has it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gonna make like everybody like really, really ugly --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or just really, like -- that would be, I don't know, like, what -- what do you think the person would do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I'm sorry, I don't wanna do this any more.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  They'd probably be, like, you know, they're in front of a camera.  They probably have to go along with it just for their own, like [MN] image or something [LAUGH] to not look like they're a bitch and, like, [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, oh, you're ugly, forget it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, what if somebody had, like, I don't know, like, like, hideous, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- some people, I'm not trying --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to be mean or anything --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but some people are really just, um -- are kinda hard to look at, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Wait, so, um, what are the other ones?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I watched, like, Survivor the first couple of seasons or something.  I watched, like, a lot of it.
R:  Yeah, they had a lotta hype.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They had this other show that was like Teen Survivor.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They had all these, like, pre teens, like --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- thirteen year olds and stuff and they were all, like, crying, like, you know how --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I know what a reality TV show is.  Um, Road Rules and Real R- --World.
L:  That's right.  Those were like the --
R:  Yeah, the --
L:  -- original ones.
R:  Actually, yeah, I think they are the actual original ones before it got all big. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've been on for, like, ten seasons probably.
L:  I thought that when they first came out with that whole idea the Real World was pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah, th -- -- yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I watched the Real World.
L:  I mean, it kind of got, like, old after a couple of seasons, but --
R:  Yeah, I watched the last, um, the first one was, like -- where was the first one?  Seattle maybe?
L:  Um, I don't know, I think it was on the west coast or something.
R:  Well, like, I -- I never got into it.  Like, some people watch it every week.  Okay, this time, gotta turn on the TV --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the past season was Las Vegas and my roommate, she was into it, so I watched it and I kind of enjoyed it a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to find out, like, what they were doing, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And seeing it like -- the commercials actually is what gets you into it 'cause they're like, oh, no what's going to happen and you see these other t- -- random two people making out or, like, [MN] somebody hitting somebody --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- and you're like, oh, know, who did what.
L:  I sometimes wonder how much of it is just, like, editing.  I mean, they make it so dramatic and everything but I wonder, like, there's so many hours that they don't show on there --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that it's just more like normal life when they're not showing.
R:  Yeah, they show all the, like --
L:  And they pick these, like --
R:  -- worst of everything.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  The worst, absolutely worst of everything probably, 'cause that's what keeps America interested.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Seriously, they wouldn't make that much money if it was just people living their lives.
L:  Yep.
R:  But that's why they have, like, those people 'cause they screen them.  [MN]  I wonder what the criteria is to be on one of those.
L:  [MN]  Everybody, like, wants to be on that.  I c- -- I would never wanna be, like, in front of the camera.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know, yeah, I don't know if I'd want, like, a camera --
L:  Oh, I -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't think I could get used to it.  Like, they just seem like they don't notice it any more but I think I would always be self conscious about them.
R:  Yeah, and always fixing, like, how I look.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [several inaudible words]  Like, I'd always be, like, have a mirror and be, like, oh, okay, I don't have anything --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- hanging on my nose or anything.
L:  I know.  They're always following you around to the bathroom, like, when you first get up, you're like, "Argh, leave me alone".
R:  Yeah, I saw the, like, the follow up on the Las Vegas one and they were talking about how, like, there was rooms for the people, the, like, the video camera people to sleep in.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, in that -- in -- in their big, like, hotel --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- suite they had.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But I think, um, I -- and then, now I'm watching the Real World versus Road Rules, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- the Battle of the Sexes they have on MTV.
L:  Oh, wow, I -- I've never seen that.
R:  And, um, it's interesting, I guess.  [LAUGH]  It's not much of a reality show.  It's more of a competition.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's, mm, battle of the sexes and everything, but --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- um, let me think, is there any other subject of reality TV?
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
R:  Um.
L:  Well, there's always, like, the dating things.  
R:  Oh, yeah, the dating ones.
L:  That's just like sort of an extension of old dating games [inaudible] to this whole reality thing.
R:  Oh, yeah, like all those -- do you -- oh, like the Fifth Wheel --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  The Fifth Wheel and the one where they have, like, somebody has an earpiece and two of their friends, like, tell them what to do, argh!
L:  Oh, God, I've never seen that one.
R:  There's too many.  There's too many.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They keep coming up with all these weird ideas.  You know, [MN] like the basics are okay, you know, like Blind Date is okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, like, the Fifth Wheel where they take, like, three --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of one sex and two of another --
L:  Yeah, it's so absurd.
R:  -- and then they, like, mix them all together and introduce -- they have like four in the beginning and then they introduce the other guy or the other girl --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [MN] I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's kind of like the s- --
