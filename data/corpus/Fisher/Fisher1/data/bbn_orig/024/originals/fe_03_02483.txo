R:  W- what was the name of one of the characters, 'cause I used to watch Survivor, but I don't remember which episode it was.
L:  I think it was a guy, uh, that won it, he was a gay guy, I think his name was Richard or something like that.
R:  Oh, [MN] did he win?
L:  It probably was the f- -- the first one, when it -- when it first came on, it -- that's when I watched it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, he won.
R:  See, I watched the second -- I watched the second season of it --

L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, um, [SIGH] who else?  Um, that's all I can remember.  I remember that old guy, [LIPSMACK] and, um, that's about it.  I know a lot of characters from, um, Survivor, like they have different shows now.

L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you gotta watch that. [LIPSMACK]
L:  But he didn't win though, did he?
R:  Yeah, he's still in, um, he's still in the running.  They put him in the top, in -- in, uh, in the lower three now, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- he might -- he might not make it, but I think everybody in America rooting for Ruben [LAUGH] to win.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I watched it when he -- before he was on it, I watched when there was, uh, that other girl was on there, what's her name, Kelly?  And then they got a movie or something?
R:  Oh yeah, I watched that one too, yeah.
L:  And I was just, like, uh, it was all right, you know?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I- --
L:  They can do it, they all right, but they not like my man.

R:  I'd be on, like, uh, I would be on the Real World on MTV.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  I would -- I would go on that show.
L:  So you could cuss people out?
R:  [LAUGH] I'd be the angry black woman on there.

L:  His name was Dave.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, the, um, little black guy?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.

L:  He was on there and they -- they kicked him off, I guess, uh, you know --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- he was messing with some chick or something.
R:  Yeah, he pulled the, um, covers off that girl.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, while she was in the bath. [LAUGH]
L:  And she --
R:  I seen that episode.
L:  [LAUGH] And she got mad.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They kicked him off the new one too.  They had, like, a -- a Real World Road Rules challenge and, um, [LIPSMACK] there's this guy, Puck, spit in his face --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and he left the show.  Yeah.
L:  Man.
R:  You ain't -- you haven't been watching it?  It's on MTV.
L:  Nah.
R:  They probably show it again.  Yep, he was on the first -- they -- they, um, called him back to be -- it's like a challenge show, where they challenge each other, the Real World challenged the Road Rules or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Um, and, um, this guy, Puck, spit in his face.
L:  Maybe that's why he went on there, just to, you know [LAUGH] maybe he was just --
R:  Man.  You seen him lately?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  I haven't seen him for a couple of years, for real.
R:  [MN] Man, well, if you see that show. [LAUGH] I can hear it echo.  So, t- this is, um, how long is this supposed to last?
L:  Think, like, ten or fifteen minutes or something.
R:  Oh.  How do you get paid? [LAUGH] I didn't --
L:  They didn't ex- explain all that?
R:  M- -- well, I've --
L:  So, you --
R:  -- never called, I just actually did it, like, a couple of days ago.
L:  Oh yeah, they, uh, I think they send you a check.  They get your information, they got my information and all --
R:  Oh, okay, and they --
L:  -- and then they -- I guess they send it to you in the mail.
R:  So, how do they know -- like, how do you know when to end the call?  You have to be, like, a certain amount?
L:  Yeah, I think they're gonna come back and say, "Ten minutes is up" or something.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  So, what, we're going to keep talking about reality shows? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we can talk about whatever, you know? [LAUGH] I guess we supposed to talk about that, but we can talk about anything.
R:  Well, I -- hey, I know what we can talk about.
L:  What's that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] See, but you don't watch the show, so ...
L:  What show?
R:  Um, [MN] Real World.  They were just in Las Vegas.
L:  Nah, I haven't watched that one.
R:  Oh, what do you wa- -- do you watch TV? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you watch The Bachelor?
L:  Which one?
R:  The Bachelor.
L:  Oh, yeah, I watched that, I watched that.
R:  Oh yeah, now, that was good.
L:  I [MN] yeah, it was all right.
R:  That was a good one.
L:  Yeah.  That's the one where, uh, all the girls are trying to get with that guy, right?
R:  Uh, d- -- right, right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They about to do another one, I think, with, uh, guys trying to find some girl, Bachelorette or something.
R:  Yeah, they already did that show, The Bachelorette.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  See, I think some of these shows, it's like a set up though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Because I really can't see myself trying to marry a man that I just met, like six weeks on a television show.  I -- [LAUGH] and how can you actually get really -- be real if you have cameras and stuff like that all around you?  You know, you got -- you --
L:  Yeah, you gotta -- I -- I guess when the cameras roll off, that's when they get real.
R:  E- exactly.  'Cause you can't be but so rude if you got a audience, you know, looking at you the whole time.  You know, you really can't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really express yourself or be your true self if you know that millions of people are watching you, or are gonna see you on TV, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You only --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- you're gonna limit yourself to a certain extent, because you know millions of people will see it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So there's nothing real about it. [LAUGH]
L:  It's not -- it's -- I mean, it's like fake reality.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  And now, see, when it first came out, that's as real as it's going to get. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  Because t- that's when it's raw, it's original, it's fresh, you don't -- you don't have any kind of standard, you know, you just follow your own lead, but --
L:  But they got, uh, they got Surv- -- uh, Survivor was the first show, right?
R:  Right.
L:  That ever came out.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, Real World was the first show that ever came out.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
R:  Yeah.  But, like, far as competition and things like that, I think it was Survivor was the first --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- reality show.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, Survivor is good.
L:  They just made a movie about that, uh, Cancun.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] the Real Cancun, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] They just took it to the movies. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They didn't put no black people -- they have to put some more black people on these reality shows.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh right, no.
L:  The Real Hood.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Bring it -- bring it -- that's what -- I'm -- show I'm gonna create.
R:  [LAUGH] The Real Hood.
L:  The R- -- the Real Hood.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He rolling down, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  I know that's right. [LAUGH] They would have to show that on Showtime or something. [LAUGH]  
L:  They then put that on at two o'clock in the morning.  
R:  [LAUGH] That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right after Showtime at the Apollo.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  That's when we'll come on.
R:  They don't wanna see the Real Hood. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be too much. [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Mm mm. [SIGH] Yeah.  They -- we are not represented -- not really on the shows.  We might get a couple or one or two on them, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  M- -- well, you get one, you don't get two.  You mightn't get --
L:  But they not gonna put it down like they supposed to put it down.
R:  Uh-uh, uh-uh.
L:  No.
R:  I don't know where they find a -- the ones they find, but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know, I guess, see, somebody like me, I -- I -- I couldn't do it, you know?  I just couldn't do it.
L:  I'm saying, you're in Philly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to come up to Philly all the time.  I'm from DC.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what you doing in, uh, on the west side?
L:  I don't know if -- w- -- I -- you know, we should talk differently, like, on, uh, you know, when this thing not recording and all that, then we could get into all that.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I don't want, you know, I don't want business to be all out there like that.
R:  Oh, right.  I know, look --
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  -- you know, they said you had to get too -- too -- too deep. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't want a- anybody to be, like, "Oh, okay".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What's this guy talking about? [LAUGH]
