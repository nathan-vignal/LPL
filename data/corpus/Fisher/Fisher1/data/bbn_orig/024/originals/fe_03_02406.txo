R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Heather --
R:  Hi, I'm Michelle --
L:  Michelle.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, Heather, nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you in Los Angeles?
R:  No, no, I'm in Indiana -- 
L:  Oh -- 
R:  Indianapolis.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Have you -- is this the first time you've ever -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is the second time I've done it.
L:  Okay, so, ah, did you get the list of stuff we're supposed to --
R:  Yeah, I can't remember -- 
L:  -- be discussing.
R:  -- everything but I got -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the list -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, basically, [inaudible] smoking, drinking -- 
L:  Over eating.
R:  -- alcohol -- 
L:  Over eating and not exercising.
R:  Yes.
L:  And drinking caffeine.  Okay -- 
R:  Yes, that's it -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- so, what do you think is worse?
L:  Um, [MN] it's a tie, I think.  Smoking is definitely probably the worst for the person doing it and for the country as a whole.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because it creates huge health costs for, ah, for everybody involved and the people don't have money to pay and they get sick and then the county ends up paying which is basically the tax payer, so it's pretty bad.  And it also, ah, has some unintended consequences, like, people like driving, smoking -- 
R:  Oh, I hate that.
L:  -- not paying attention.
R:  That drives me crazy.
L:  And causing accidents.  So, I'd have to say smoking is [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would say smoking is probably, yeah, the worst thing for your health and the health -- not -- 
L:  And others.
R:  -- just of you, I mean, it's like if you [SIGH] -- I mean, it's like it's probably the only thing that you can damage the people that live in your house also -- 
L:  That's why [several inaudible words] anyone who's [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- I mean, like if you drink it probably physically and emotionally scares people.  But, the -- if you -- especially if you have children.
L:  Right.
R:  Smoking in the house, I mean, it's just -- it's a really bad thing.
L:  That's why anyone who's around that after growing up in that for sixteen, seventeen years inhaling that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It cannot be good.  And everyone who walks in -- so, yeah, you've got a- additional health costs and health risks associated for everybody else.  Of course alcohol, you could say that as well because if you're getting in a car with somebody who's been drinking and, ah, on the road --  
R:  Yes.
L:  But [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but, you can drink in moderation where you can't smoke and have it ever be, like, a good thing for you.
R:  No.  And almost never does your smoking not affect the other people around you.
L:  Right.
R:  Where, if you have a couple of drinks, that normally doesn't affect the other people that are sitting there with you -- 
L:  And you can't -- and people don't smoke one cigarette a day or something.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  [LAUGH] Even if they did, why would they smoke at all?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] Apparently it's highly addictive.  So, I don't do any of these things, so [LAUGH] -- 
R:  No, yeah, I don't anymore.  I smoked in college.
L:  Oh, is that right?  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I drink every once and awhile.  Not a whole lot, just because -- I don't know, [several inaudible words] --  
L:  Yeah, I don't really.  I'm actually an avid runner so, ah -- 
R:  Oh, did ya?  I run too -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's one of the reasons I stopped smoking -- 
L:  Yeah it -- 
R:  -- because it's like -- 
L:  -- interferes -- 
R:  -- I smoked in college and then, like, on New Year's Eve when we h- like, all my friends graduated we all made a pact to quit smoking.
L:  Oh, that worked.  Okay -- 
R:  And I think all of us but one did, like, hasn't -- hasn't smoked since then.  And one -- one of my friends still smokes.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, it's, ah, especially looked down upon in California because very few people smoke.
R:  Yes, I know.  I used to date a guy out there.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And I was in college when I was dating him.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, so, yeah.
R:  So, it was like, I'd like fly out over the summer sometimes and, yeah -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I smoked then so I was just like -- 
L:  It's a non starter.  A lot of people would never date anybody who smoked.
R:  I know.  He said the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I hadn't -- I hadn't smoked in front of him.  I -- I don't know --  
L:  It's an immediate -- 
R:  -- I just never told him and I was like, "Oh, really".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, different parts of the country it's not like that but here it's an immediate disqualifier so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause nobody wants to be around that.  And you can't smoke anywhere now here.
R:  No, and it's really a good thing.  I mean, I w- I kind of wish that the atmosphere, like here, was a lot like that because I really didn't start smoking until I was in college. 
L:  When everyone else was doing it -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- probably 
R:  -- and I'd lived with the -- I'd lived with these girls for probably six months before I ever -- 
L:  Oh, you picked it up.
R:  -- smoked.
L:  Were they smoking as well?
R:  Oh, yeah.  They smoked all the time.
L:  Oh, there you go.
R:  That's why it was like -- yeah, and then I did.  I did all through college and then -- it really makes a huge difference, because I run all the time too -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like, when I stopped -- 
L:  I can't even imagine trying to run.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's really -- I didn't -- I think it didn't affect me that much because I was young.
L:  Right, then as you get older.
R:  But, it's like when I stopped and I -- I noticed a huge difference in my performance when I stopped smoking, when I started running.  And it's funny because about two or three weeks after I stopped smoking I really started coughing stuff up out of my lungs.  It was really gross -- 
L:  Ooh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And I didn't expect -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that at all.
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and it wasn't, like, right away.  It's like not -- it was like two -- 
L:  It takes a long while -- 
R:  -- or three weeks later.
L:  -- right, for your lungs to actually start healing.
R:  Yeah, 'cause, like, I'd be heavy on the treadmill and I'd get off and I'd just -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- cough.
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know and that -- that was just the short period of time.  Well, I mean, relatively.  I mean -- 
L:  Right, it wasn't a lifetime.
R:  -- I only smoked for, like, three and a half years.
L:  Oh, my God -- 
R:  So, and I didn't even smoke all the time.  It was mostly just when I drank, like, you know -- 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] so silly. 
R:  So, I mean, I can't even imagine people -- people who do -- and I think -- another thing is, it's like my grandpa -- or my grandmother died.  She had smoked all of her life.  She had -- 
L:  Did she died of lung cancer, or emphysema or -- 
R:  No, emphysema.
L:  Mm.
R:  She had emphysema and congestive heart failure.  And like, I was in the room.  Like, I actually saw -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- her die.  And it was -- she couldn't breath.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  She was on oxygen, like, the last three years of her life and it's like, I had already stopped smoking then, but I was just like, "Oh, my gosh".  That would be now like -- 
L:  That's not a nice way to go.
R:  No, uh-huh -- 
L:  That was definitely -- 
R:  -- it was horrible.
L:  -- argh.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would have to say smoking.
L:  Although I, yeah, [inaudible] like drinking and [several inaudible words] 'cause it does ruin your life and, ah, of other people around you and you can't hold a job necessarily and it really -- 
R:  No, I would think --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- I haven't really known anybody who has a serious alcohol problem but -- 
L:  Yeah, but when they do it's -- 
R:  -- yeah, people who do -- I mean it can -- 
L:  It ruins your life.
R:  -- wreck the hav- wreck havoc on your body, so --
L:  Yeah, and you -- that's all you think about is when your next drink is -- kind of ruining your whole life and getting DUIs and you lose your licence and it's pretty bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm not fond of, ah, over eating [LAUGH] but, I don't think they're actually -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- hurting anybody but themselves.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I know.  But -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Not being overweight it's hard for me to envision.  [LAUGH] What -- 
R:  See, I'm not either but I -- I think it's just because I'm lucky.  I -- I have a high metabolism and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I work out all the time.  So, it's like, but I love food.  I mean, it's like I can't imagine, like -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I diet in the sense that I eat healthy, like I pay attention to what I eat.  But, I can't -- like, all these diets that people do -- 
L:  Oh, forget it.
R:  -- I can't -- no I couldn't do it.
L:  Yeah, I don't do any of that stuff either.  I just eat what I want.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I think I can because I work out but, if I didn't, oh, that would be so -- well, that'd be hard.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yeah, just as soon as you take in more calories than you're working off that's it.  I know -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- so, the other -- the only other thing that wasn't physical was gossip.  That was on our list.  Look gossip can be bad but it can't -- 
R:  That I know.
L:  -- kill anyone I don't think.
R:  That really bothers me too, but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But yeah.  And that is -- that's probably -- I don't know that -- I think that hurts the person who's gossiping as much -- I mean -- 
L:  As much as -- a- can as much as the person they're talking about.
R:  Or, at least it reveals more about that person -- 
L:  Their character.
R:  -- because I -- actually I had a room mate a couple of years' ago who's really negative and really talked bad about people all the time and I never realised that until she moved out, like, what an impact she had in the house.  Like -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- her -- just her being negative all the time.  Like, who it changed everybody in the house.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then once she moved out it was just -- there was just a huge difference.  And I think that that is so much more subtle.  You don't realise that.  Like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when somebody's negative and talks bad about people all the time what an impact it has on relationships.
L:  And if the word gets back to that person whom they're talking about -- what it does.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Which it usually does get back to them.  I had somebody do something crazy, like, a year ago.  Um, I met a guy and we exchanged numbers and got on and whatever and, ah, she called him, like, the next day and said, "Don't go out with her".
R:  [MN] 
L:  "You don't know about her".
R:  Was it your friend?
L:  It was somebody I knew but -- and she was not a friend -- 
R:  Ah, clearly.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- she's just somebody sort of in my cir- yeah, clearly not.  [LAUGH] Somebody in my circle.  And she really went out of her way to just -- to try and, like, basically, ah, ruin a possible relationship.  And I couldn't figure out why, what she had against me.  And, ah, it didn't stop at that one phone call.  She made a couple of calls and every time she ran into him she said, "You're not going out with Heather, are you?"
R:  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Did he ever?
L:  -- and he sort of -- yeah, we did go out.  He sort of threatened her -- she threatened him, like, "If you do you're not going to be able to do x, y and z with us" like -- 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- you're not going to be able to be a part of our tennis group or something.  And -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm like -- [several inaudible words] whatever.  But, I finally, like, six to eight months later I got her alone and said, "What the heck.  What were you doing?  I don't even know you.  What on earth -- so, why would you do such a thing?"  It's like, "Well, I thought you'd been flirting when I was engaged, ah, with my fiance and -- 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- it really hurt me so I just did this out of hurt".  It's like, "Yeah, thanks".
R:  So, instead of, like, coming to you and talking -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to you about it and clearing -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- everything up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Never -- right, never said a word to me.  I was just supposed to know this or something.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Right.  'Cause she was, like, holding in all this negative feeling for years and then [LAUGH] got her chance.
R:  See 'cause gossiping is so -- and it's always like.  It's always sneaky and behind the back.
L:  Oh, well, she ended up being furious that the guy had told me she said the stuff.  She wasn't, like, embarrassed for herself as much as that she was angry -- 
R:  She was -- 
L:  -- with the person who told me -- 
R:  Argh.
L:  -- with the guy.  So, instead of saying, "Okay, [LAUGH] I shouldn't have done this and I won't do it again" and learning a lesson and apologizing to me, she immediately called him and said, "I can't believe you told her".  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, you know, that's funny because that's how the -- like, this girl was, like, she'd do it.  Like, there were four of us that lived here.  And she would do that.  She'd go from one person to the other and tell things -- 
L:  About each other in the house? 
R:  Yeah.  And then when we got -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- together about it she -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- got really mad at us.
L:  What a surprise.
R:  Yeah.  Got mad at us.
L:  [inaudible] --
