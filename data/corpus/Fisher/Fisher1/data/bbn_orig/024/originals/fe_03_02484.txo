R:  Hello?
L:  H- hi.  H- --
R:  Hi, I'm Lucia, how are you?
L:  Oh, I'm fine.  My name is Kiki[?].  How are you?
R:  I'm good, thank you.
L:  That's good.
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think when -- do you watch any of those shows?
L:  Uh, you know, I watch a few of them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, well, I -- I've basically, like, watched an episode here, an episode there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But never really, you know, like, i- -- I don't watch, like, one from start to finish as far as, like, the whole season is concerned.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like to keep up with the people on Survivor or whatever.  I think, like, the closest one I've ever kept up with is, like, American Idol.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, because everybody talks about that one.
R:  Oh, of course. [LAUGH] It's everywhere. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I mean, it's on the -- I mean, I'm reading the newspaper, trying to get real news -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's, like, "Guess who got kicked off of American Idol" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  So, I mean, it's just, like, "Oh, this is so ridiculous".
R:  It is.
L:  But I hope that the whole genre -- I hope it, at some point, just collapses. [LAUGH]
R:  You know what?  I don't think it will. [LAUGH] Everybody --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, everybody's just so sucked in and, you know, as I badmouth it all the time, but I'm sitting there watching 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Isn't it terrible?
R:  You know?  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm always talking about, "Oh, they're so stupid, I can't believe they do that" and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I sit there and watch 'em just the same, you know?  So [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and I think -- I think just because it's so unpredictable, there's no script, [NOISE] like you don't know what's going to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It draws more people into it.  That's why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why they keep coming up with, you know, more stuff and new things, new shows.  That's why it's so popular.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know, it starts off i- -- li- -- as like every man's experience or whatever, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like -- like, "I can do that".
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  It's, "I'm doing that" you know? 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But I think reality TV is starting to go into the realm of unreality.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I mean, it's just, like, "Okay, can you really see yourself over in the far regions of Africa --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, running, jumping, you know, surviving, going through all these tribal --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is not rea- --  okay, yeah, it's reality for the bushmen --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's not a reality for most people who watch that show -- sh- show.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true, that's true.
L:  So, I'm just, like, you're going to an extreme, and these -- these Millionaire --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and these Bachelor shows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, can you -- can you really see yourself asking someone to marry you --
R:  No, that's crazy.
L:  -- that you've only known for six weeks and you pick 'em out of a lineup --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you date 'em all?
R:  Yeah, that's sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- well, I think that's -- that's again, you know, what draws more people to watch it, because it's, like, that's something you would never do, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, watching this idiot do it, and, "Oh my gosh, how's it going to end up?" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.  I think instead of, uh, reality TV they just need to call it fantasy TV.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Or it's --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- basically, like, y- you know, whatever you -- whatever you can come up with in your imagination, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then -- then that's what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that's what the [several inaudible words] day is.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, what do you think is, like, the worst one?
R:  Uh, I think the -- all those -- Married by America and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Bachelor and Bachelorette and now the, um, [LIPSMACK] what is that one where the guys are covered?
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  What is th- -- 
L:  Oh --
R:  Mr. Personality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think that, where you have to choose your life long partner fr- -- [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- from, you know, a few weeks.  N- nah. [LAUGH]
L:  And they're masked?  No way.
R:  Those -- oh, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  'Cause the first thing you look at is a person's, you know, physical attractiveness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if -- I'd hate to say it, but --
L:  I mean, regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, I mean --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's still true.  I mean, you gotta wake up with that person for fifty years, you know?
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  They gotta be able to do something.
R:  Y- you gotta like what you see. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you would hope.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Although --
R:  That's -- that's why I hooked up with my man, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I saw him and said, "Hey, come talk to me". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Lord knows I wouldn't have talked to him if he was ugly. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- I know.  I wonder why -- how do they do this?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, the worst one for me would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- probably be -- the worst one for me would probably be the, um, it's between the one where they've got the makeover show where they get the plastic surgery and create a whole new face.
R:  Oh God, yeah.
L:  That's, like, a new one, and Fear Factor.
R:  I love Fear Factor.  I'm obsessed. [LAUGH]
L:  But the thing about Fear Factor is who in the world --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is putting -- I mean, who's going to eat that stuff, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Who wants to eat, you know, an animal's parts that you don't even wanna see?
R:  Ew, oh, it's so gross.
L:  You know?  That's so gross.
R:  That's what makes me wanna watch it, because I wanna --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- see who really wants to eat that. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, 'cause, I mean, it's, like, it made me sick to my stomach to watch it the times I did watch it.
R:  I know.
L:  I said, "Oh no --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and only for fifty thousand?"
R:  I know.
L:  [MN]
R:  They should up the [LAUGH] the prize.
L:  They should, and yeah, because that one had, like, centipedes all in their hair --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I mean, they -- they were, like, pouring 'em, pouring 'em all over and different stuff --
R:  Oh, it's so gross.
L:  -- and I was just, like, "Okay, and all this is fifty and you might not even win?"
R:  Oh, my God.  I know.
L:  So, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] I feel so sorry for the ones that don't win.
L:  I know.
R:  Because you did all that stupid, you know, those stupid stunts and you ate all that crap and nothing. [LAUGH] You got nothing. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  I think they get, like, consolation prizes.  They should get, like, you know, maybe a couple of thousand.
L:  Something.  Yeah, just for showing up.
R:  Something. [LAUGH]
L:  They ought to get, like, two thousand bucks for showing -- or at least airfare.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?  To make it worth their while.
R:  For having the nerve. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  For having the nerve to stand and eat, you know, larvae [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- for national television.
L:  I just think that is the worst.
R:  Oh, that's gross.
L:  But, you know, these reality shows -- do you think that they're, um, I think they may be rigged.  I think some of them may be rigged, really.
R:  You think so?
L:  I do.  I think they may be rigged, because, I mean, that whole Bachelor show, it seemed like -- and see, I didn't get this from secondhand opinion, I'm reading the news and, you know, I mean, watching the news and reading, you know, going on the -- you know, watching those shows and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I think that, you know, they may be -- don't they tell them, "Nah, don't -- don't pick him".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] "No, don't pick her".
R:  They give 'em hints? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think that, like, "America really wants to see, you know, something else than, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- than what you're picking".
R:  That's --
L:  But --
R:  I think they're doing that with American Idol right now, 'cause there's no way Ruben could have been in their line up.
L:  No way.
R:  There's just no way.
L:  They said the bottom ten --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, the bottom two.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I could not believe that.
R:  No.  Mm mm.
L:  Well, I mean everybody's loving Ruben.
R:  Of course.
L:  [MN]
R:  Of course.  I think he's going to be in the top -- I think they're just trying to make it juicy so they put him on the line up, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to make people go, "What?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but then Josh, Josh should have been off.
R:  Oh --
L:  Josh knows he should have been off.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  But some of those other ones should have -- should have been off a long time ago too and they stuck it out, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  But I couldn't -- I was so surprised that they, um, chose Carmen over, um, that other ... [LIPSMACK] oh gosh --
L:  Kim?  Was it Kim?  I don't remember her name.
R:  Yeah, Kim.  The blonde.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Yeah, I mean, she was so charismatic, she was so, like, into the crowd and everything and I could not believe they left Carmen over her.
L:  Well, yeah, I've never, like, watched the show --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've never watched it, you know, I never watched the elimination portion of the show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've only watched, like, the other episodes where they just perform and, you know, Simon cuts them up and --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- Paula hates Simon and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and Randy's just there or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I don't watch the one where they actually, like, eliminate somebody.  I'm just, like, "Wow".
R:  Those are the ones that I watch.  I don't watch them singing, I just watch the eliminations. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just to see who's left. [LAUGH]
L:  That is too funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is too funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's gotta be the most exciting part of the whole show.
R:  It is, it is.
L:  And everybody's talking about it, a- all the radio stations.
R:  Right.
L:  And it seems like it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kinda brought America together. [LAUGH]
R:  I know it.  I know.
L:  I mean, everybody, black, white, rich, whatever, is talking about the Idol. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  No, but my favorite was the -- the first three days of the Idol --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- American Idol, when they're, um, choosing the ones who get to stay.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And they're -- and they show, like, all the ones that sucked really bad, that they swear they can sing.
L:  Yes.  Oh, like, didn't they know?
R:  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
L:  Haven't, like, people got mothers, they've got fathers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, significant others --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't any of those people tell them they couldn't sing?
R:  [LAUGH] I guess not.
L:  Oh [MN] --
R:  They got no friends. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean i- -- they sh- -- and if they do, they're liars.
R:  [LAUGH] I know. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, a few of them, didn't they just sound like wounded animals?
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I think they just want their, [MN] you know, five seconds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of -- of fame.
R:  Of fame, yeah.
L:  You know?  Positive or negative.
R:  Yeah, well, they got that, didn't they? [LAUGH] That's sad.
L:  Gosh.  So, who do you think's gonna win it all?  On Idol?
R:  I think Ruben's gonna take it.
L:  Yeah, they say it's between Ruben and Clay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Clay is really good, but he's sounding the same to me in every song.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and that's what Simon said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, but, um, I'm from -- I'm from that area where Clay's from.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, the actual city where Clay's from.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, you know, we're, like, "Clay, we love Clay".  You know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you hear people on the radio stations, "I knew Clay's mother --"
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- and, uh, [LAUGH] um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and I just think they're the sweetest people you ever did meet".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- you're just, like, "Oh, God" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I just -- like, you make it sound like this area's just a r- -- Hickville -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, it's, like, "I was on the PTA with Clay's momma and --"
R:  Oh, God.
L:  "-- and we really, you know, we're just rooting for --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I -- I'm just, like, "Oh, Lord".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  D- do -- it's so funny he comes from there.  But, you know, to me his voice sounds like he should -- he should be on one of those Disney movies, you know, like, Broadway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just, you know, real, just a -- showtime.
R:  He just -- right, right.  He does sound like that, like he should be a character in the Disney --
L:  Yeah, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I don't see him doing, like, you know, hit albums --
R:  No.
L:  -- on the radio station.  I see him, like, on the --
