R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello. [LAUGH] I'm Ellie.
R:  Uh, Richard.  I'm in, uh, Seattle, Washington.
L:  Okay, I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  This is interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, you don't have an accent, though.
L:  No, no accent. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, um, well, I personally have watched reality shows, and I've watched Joe Millionaire, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? and I've watched Survivor and, um, [COUGH] I don't think they are -- call me a prude, but I don't think they're very healthy. [LAUGH]
L:  No, definitely not healthy, I agree with that.
R:  For a variety of reasons, I mean, you know, to [SIGH] to set up somebody and -- and lie to them and, um, [SIGH] make somebody look like a fool in front of -- I mean, I know it's everybody's choice.
L:  Right.
R:  I just -- it just bothers me that, um, they are so popular, 'cause I think it says something about our society.
L:  I -- I -- I completely agree.  Um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I think the new crop of shows is even worse. [LAUGH]
R:  And they're getting worse, yes.
L:  They -- they're just terrible, um, [LIPSMACK] I mean, ah, it -- it's funny too, because a lot of the people on the shows are, you know, very attractive people --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, seem upbeat and friendly and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, you know, they're -- they have good jobs and they're young and they're educated and I'm just not sure why they're willing to risk their, you know, their integrity and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and their, you know, their whole -- the risk of embarrassment on these television shows and -- it's -- it's pretty crazy.
R:  I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, because one of my goals is to become a psychologist and it's, like, it says something about human behaviour, I think --
L:  I agree. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  To, um, and it tickles me, you know, because [MN] if this g- -- if the truth were known about that guy, you know, and you know, what, two thousand a month and a construction worker, no matter --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- how good looking he -- he may or may not be, none of them would have given him the time of day.
L:  It's true.  It's true.
R:  Ah, but -- you know?  None of them, a- and we're being -- so i- it had nothing to do with -- with the fact that he might be a decent person --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and might -- that he might be a wonderful human being, but that he had m- money, they thought, and they were being deliberately made fools of.
L:  It's true.   I -- I think the good thing about -- well, that -- I -- I actually got -- kinda got into that show.  I was rooting for Zora, I think probably with the rest of America --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I -- I -- I -- I thought she was a genuine person, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's the other girls that were just, ah, [MN] just completely -- you could see their hearts on their sleeves w- with, you know, big dollars signs written all over it.
R:  I kn- -- yes.
L:  Um, and that -- that guy too, I don't -- I guess he saw it as an opportunity for exposure, perhaps to become an actor or other type --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of media person, but, oh yeah, [MN] I mean, but the funny thing is, I -- not -- everybody that I talked to has seen one or more of them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they have, you know, becomes involved with them too, you know, watching them every week and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and really getting involved.  I don't know.  It's -- it's kind of a phenomenon, but hopefully it'll die out soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I hope you're right, but I don't think so, because, um, [NOISE] I mean, I know people who I swear that's their whole topic of conversation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you're with them.  I'm sure they know the people's middle names --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, the -- the -- the names of their family, their cousins and I think it -- that -- um, the people whom I know and my friends that watch it religiously, they don't have lives.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They really don't.
L:  It can become that kind of a situation, where you're so involved.  But I know people who watch soap operas who are like that too. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, y- y- yeah, 'cause I have friends who've w- watched Days of Lives, and for thirty years --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- or something and, uh, those don't bother me as much, because if you -- like, I think I have a pretty interesting life for me.
L:  Right.
R:  Somebody else might find it boring, but I don't h- -- need to vicariously live my life through some v- -- uh, TV personality.
L:  Like these poor people who are [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And, um, [SIGH] like, American Idol, that's kind of fun or, you know, to see a bunch of little kids who are talented --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's kind of fun.  Um, [SIGH] but I think it says something about our -- and this other one where everybody has --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- has a mask, and --
L:  Oh, that one.  I saw that one a little bit and I -- oh, sheesh, just -- just -- it's horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and like, I'm not quite as bad looking as that ugly guy they show --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, but I'm a very average person --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  And it's, like, it says something, 'cause they're all young and beautiful, and it's, like, why do you need to come on this show in front of eighty million people --
L:  Uh, silly.
R:  -- and sh- -- yes, if I were that guy, yes, I'd think, "Hm.  I'll probably have an acting career, I'll probably be in commercials" like he is, so, yeah, human nature would kick in with me too.
L:  Right.
R:  If I looked like him, if I looked -- yeah.  Right, yes, yes, I'm the first --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to admit it.  Human nature is powerful.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I will have acting career and, you know, i- -- we all are in charge of our own lives, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And if I want someone -- if I want eighty million people to know that I can be as shallow and superficial and greedy and materialistic as everybody else, that's my choice.
L:  Oh, have you heard of the new one called Extreme Makeover?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, it's on, I think, Channel seven, I think it's ABC.
R:  Okay.
L:  The -- the people actually are selected, um, to u- undergo an extreme makeover, and by extreme they mean getting plastic surgery, getting --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- perhaps breast implants or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, getting a haircut, getting make up, getting new clothes, but really, uh, you know, and then going to a gym and then working out, but -- but really getting plastic surgery.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, getting their teeth whitened a- and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watched that with my fiancee for maybe ten minutes or so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we were just [MN] shocked that these people would do this.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN] Getting -- a- and both of them were married, they had families and I'm thinking, "W- why on earth would you want to go on TV and do this?"
R:  You know, and --
L:  I guess because it's free?
R:  And we [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we do have an cul- -- a culture that says, "If you're not young, if you don't have perfect teeth, perfect hair, no wrinkles" that you're not a valuable human being.
L:  Right.
R:  I think.
L:  I think that's -- that's really despicable, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that people should have to feel like that.
R:  But the only reason it's on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is 'cause all of us watch it.
L:  Isn't that sad? [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH]
R:  And that is sad, 'cause that does say --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something about who we are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And people, you know, a hundred or five hundred years, uh, from now, looking back on us, w- we're going to look mighty pathetic, I think.  Unless we're even worse, you know, and I think every culture has exploited people, you know, and -- but we allow -- we allow it.  And we have ourselves to blame.
L:  I just wanna know what happened to, you know, societies where people discussed things and thought about, you know, intelligent -- I mean, I couldn't even think of a topic to think of, I mean, really, at this point --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- because of all these crazy media things that I'm watching, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, people back in Greece and -- and Rome, when they would think about these things and discuss them and -- and you know, when kids used to -- I was, um, reading an article a- about Manhattan, um, and things that are disappearing, for example, kids playing stickball in the streets --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because all kids now play video games.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, these things where people would get together and -- and -- and socialize are even gone, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for little kids, they're sitting home with joysticks, playing games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's like, part of the reality TV generation, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  And I think we -- we're -- we're so used to instant answers and instant gratification, and you know, I have a friend -- I go to [NOISE] -- I go to their house and if the [NOISE] computer is -- like, it takes fifteen seconds, they're going , "Oh, this is so slow" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's, like, "For God's sake, we're talking fifteen seconds --"
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] we're --
R:  "-- and you're calling it slow?"
L:  What would they have done before the wheel was invented and they had to, you know, pull a sled behind them or something?  [LAUGH] I- it would have been terrible.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, and it's like, [SIGH] and I'll go the library and it's like, "Oh, these --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- machines are so slow".  For God's sake, you can send an email to Antarctica, u- um, sooner that you can blink your eyes. 
L:  It's true. [NOISE]
R:  You know, and [SIGH] I just [NOISE] -- I know we got off topic a bit, but I just think it says something about our culture, that -- I mean, I have people -- I -- in my life who are very important friends who are average, maybe below average --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe aren't perfect, but they're incredible human beings.
L:  Right, sure.
R:  I value them, I like them, uh, but they're not perfect, they, you know, maybe are overweight or, uh, maybe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little on the ugly side.
L:  Oh, that doesn't -- that's not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it d- -- i- -- outside --
R:  It shouldn't --
L:  -- appearances really shouldn't matter as much as inside appearances.
R:  You're right, but that's totally -- yeah, outside.  And I didn't mean it to be m- -- bad at all, just we -- we're running out of time.
L:  I'm going to tell your friends you said that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And, yeah, don't my friends I said that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you know how society would judge them as homely or ugly --
L:  That's just --
R:  -- but they're incredible people.
L:  Yeah, well, see, you didn't though, you gave them a chance, and that's why they're your friends.
R:  Yes, and --
L:  So, why [NOISE] -- so maybe that -- that means that reality TV hasn't sunk in so deep --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that it's over, [LAUGH] you know?  People still have hope.
R:  Well, and again, if eighty million people didn't watch them, they wouldn't be on the air.
L:  That's true.
R:  And I do think it's sad for the people whom I know that do not have lives and are bored, maybe it's good that they have this outlet, because it -- they -- they have to have something to talk about, to think about, you know, and they do have, you know, uh, social intercourse with each other, because they talk about American Idol, they talk about Joe Millionaire and it's like, "But you talk about these TV personalities and you don't talk about your own life.  What are you doing?  You know, what books have you read? --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- what thoughts do you have?"
L:  Right.
R:  And it's these -- the --
L:  Well, we can start the movement now.  Tell all your friends --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Don't watch these shows and read books --"
R:  Well --
L:  "-- and discuss them, and ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, to make a very, very long story short, 'cause I k now we're running out of time, you know, I go -- I go to the local Starbucks where there are university students, there are people who want to be lawyers and there are people who are studying and thinking and talking when Joe Millionaire is on and they -- they -- they're in front of their laptops writing their dissertations and their, you know, thesis --
L:  Good.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in- instead of glued to the -- to not watching The Simpsons and not watching Joe -- so I think there are a lotta people like you and I that -- that know there are -- there's more to life.
L:  Well, hopefully, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If pe- people just look at it for a little bit of entertainment and -- and -- and don't get so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- involved into it, that's okay, but when it becomes s- such a phenomenon that it just takes over, that's when it -- it's really just out of control and some -- something needs to be done. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I have friends, you know, you're talking on the phone, much as we are, and it's like, "Oh no, um, American Idol's on.  I gotta go.  Bye, see ya".
L:  And then it's -- y- y- your friends are actually important, who are people --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- are -- are being taken over for, you know, some television show which -- isn't that a sad state of affairs? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, and again, you know, like, [SIGH] I don't know if you saw the last time, of course I could tell you that the -- the f- -- the fat guy was going to get booted out and the -- the good looking cowboy singer was gonna -- is gonna stay in.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, this is just [MN] the facts of life --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  I -- I -- I read a book a long time ago, The Power of Beauty --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- yeah.
R:  And beauty is very i- -- very powerful and [SIGH] but I -- I
