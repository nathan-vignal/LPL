L:  Hi, this is Kat[?].
R:  Hi, my name's Joanne.
L:  Hi, Joanne.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thanks.  Um, so do you watch reality TV shows?
L:  Uh, every so o- -- uh, i- -- not much, actually.  Um, the only one I actually -- my sister is addicted to Survivor and I don't get it.
R:  So am I. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Hotdog.  Well, I think --
R:  [SIGH] I've b- --
L:  -- it's more of a social thing with my sister, um, she gets together with her friends to watch it and it's kind of a social moment for all of them.  How about you?
R:  Um, actually, I just watch it at home, and I'm the only one that watches it and everybody else goes and leaves the room --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they don't understand why I like it [LAUGH] but it's just I've watched it since the first season, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the sec- -- the second season, I wasn't too into it, um, and I didn't watch it as much, but -- oh, wait a minute, there was of them, a Africa one, I didn't watch that one that much, it was kind of boring, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know.  I'm just a -- I'm -- I'm a junkie on it.  And I [MN] I don't know about, like, Big Brother I kind of got into --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the last of it [LIPSMACK] but, um, and I watch American Idol.  I don't know if they consider that reality TV.
L:  Yeah, I do, pretty much.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, well, then, I'm a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm a reality TV junkie. [LAUGH]
L:  You are a junkie.  What's the deal?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know what my problem is, I just -- I guess, you know, I figure I can watch their problems for a while and just --
L:  Totally.
R:  -- forget about my own. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, absolutely.  You know which one I have gotten into, though?
R:  What's that?
L:  I was really intr -- I was really interested in this, Mr. Personality.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  That's the only one I've caught and gone, "Hey, that's actually kind of a wicked idea". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that one I have -- I haven't done it, but, um, I haven't watched it, because we watched that, uh, Married by America, and it was such a joke that [MN] well [MN] --
L:  Oh, was it awful?
R:  It was pretty awful.  I mean, nobody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ended up getting married --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it was -- it was --
L:  Oh, seriously?
R:  Yeah, no one got married.
L:  I thought they had to.
R:  No, they could back out.   They actually -- two couples went to the altar and, um, at the -- both at the altar, the one girl that was supposed to get married to the guy, she was totally, like, "Yeah, let's do it" and he told her no, he -- he was who her family paired her up with and he -- he -- he told her no, he was, like, "I wanna --
L:  Yow.
R:  "-- know you better first" and then the other girl told the guy no, because she didn't feel like her family cared about her.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or his family --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- cared about her, so they -- no one got married.  It was a big waste of money for Fox, I think.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's awful. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, I was, like, "Well, I don't wanna watch this Mr. Personality and get disappointed at the end again".
L:  Right.
R:  At least Survivor --
L:  Well, no, it's a -- it was -- it's a whole different, uh, i- i- it's a different thing, but then -- then that's not -- it's -- it's all coming down to who she picks to -- to keep dating. [MN] Um, and -- and it has nothing to do wi- with what he looks like.
R:  Yeah, I know, but then what happens when he pulls off the mask and then that's another, like, the -- The Bachelor thing where, you know, or what was that, um, Joe Millionaire.  I mean, they were so great together, like, on the show, and everyone thought they were gonna -- 'cause I watched that, and then you thought Zora and the guy were --
L:  I watched the -- the last couple of -- yeah.
R:  Well, you really thought they were going to be together and then they kept them separated for a whole month.  Well, I think within that whole month [inaudible] -- 
L:  No, he was a little too interested in himself.  There was -- th- that was his main point of interest was him, himself and him.
R:  Yeah, but if you think about -- think about it, I mean, maybe the girl one with this Mr. Personality will -- will work, but if you notice that most of the ones that, like, have to do with a guy being the main star of it, he starts --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- enjoying the limelight and he --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- gets all these other women throwing themselves at him and I don't think that --
L:  Well, no, what -- what guy wouldn't like that?
R:  Yeah.  So, I think it's hard because Joe Millionaire did -- he did that and then, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, the guy from the first Bachelor, he did that, and that girl, p- poor thing, loved him to death and then --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, that's hard.
R:  She did and now she's all dumped and everything and then I think the second -- I don't know, it just seems like the guys who get all that limelight and they don't like it, but it looks like Krista from The Bachelorette, which I didn't watch --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it looks like she's going to stay with her man, who knows? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, we'll see.
R:  The, um --
L:  N- no, it just seemed -- it just seemed a lot more interesting, sociologically speaking, because who do we really fall in love with, you know, and -- and what happens when, you know --
R:  When the masks come off?
L:  When the mask comes off, yeah.
R:  Well, you know, usually the masks come off in regular dating about three months after you're dating, so [LAUGH] --
L:  I know. [LAUGH] Exactly so.
R:  And then you -- because you see that real person and then, y- you know, [LAUGH] you'll know if you like them.  I don't know, I guess I just -- th- that's my main thing for not watching that, is I just don't want to be disappointed.  I don't wanna be, like --
L:  Are you in a relationship right now?
R:  I'm married, yeah.
L:  Oh, are you?  Fabulous.
R:  Yeah, I'm married and I have a -- a -- one child, so, and she's eight months old, but I don't know, I'm -- I'm just -- my husband doesn't like the reality shows, my mom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she can't believe I watch 'em --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she's, like, "I can't believe -- you don't like people like that".  Especially on Survivor, because they're real sneaky people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's, like, "You don't like people like that".  I'm, like, "I know, but I like watching how they work, man".  I'm, like, "Look at them, they're just totally twisting the minds of these people".  And it --
L:  But, no, that's the -- that's the way the world works.  I mean --
R:  It is.
L:  -- I hate to be -- I hate to be ugly, but it totally is.
R:  I know, it's coming on tonight, and I can't wait to see what happens with poor Rob, because he has totally manipulated this game, and he has got --
L:  Real.
R:  I mean, it's going to be interesting, because now he's -- he turned on some people that thought -- they thought he had -- that they thought have strong alliances with and it's going to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- interesting to see what happens now, and I'm, like, 'cause he, y- you know, I kept saying, "Rob, watch what you're doing, man.  You're ge- -- you're getting into hot water here" and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it came to it last week and so I'm excited to see now what's gonna happen, because he really -- he threw a big monkey wrench into some plans there. So [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  It's going to be -- that's why I guess I watch it.  I like to see what happens next because the control that people think they have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then who actually holds the control.  It's funny in the end, when people are all cocky, going, "Oh, I've got this in the bag" and then it's, like, they're gone.
L:  Well, that's kind of always an illusion, 'cause the, uh, control is always an illusion in your life and -- and, I mean, you really don't have any control of anything, and once you accept that, I mean, it's kind of, like, [inaudible] y- -- uh, [inaudible] saying, you know, once, "Life is misery.  Once you accept that, everything becomes easier".
R:  Right.
L:  Once you -- once you accept the fact that you don't have control, it -- everything becomes easier.  You -- you -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- begin to see things for what they are.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, and -- and I think that's what -- I don't know, I guess just seeing other people think they have control and realizing, "No, hey, you have don't have control".
L:  Totally.
R:  And then [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it's, like, "See?  That's what you had to go there to realize, you know?" [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But it's -- I don't -- I just enjoy watching this stuff and sometimes their drama is much better than mine, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't how, quite.
L:  Well, no, it's the whole soap opera moment about it, I'm sure.
R:  E- exactly.  Yeah, it is.  'Cause it -- yeah, I'm -- I'm new at staying at home and, um, I'm used to being in the workforce and I got to see my drama there, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and now, being at home, I pretty much work on my computer and [MN] --
L:  How old is your baby?
R:  Eight months.
L:  Oh, wow, so you really are stuck at home?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Right on.
R:  So, you know, I work from home and, um, watch reality [LAUGH] reality day shows.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And hope I don't get sucked back into the soap opera world like I was when I was a teenager.
L:  Go on, girl.
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, I've got --
L:  Well, no, I mean, we all need -- we all need stories to take our minds off of -- off of things.
R:  Yeah, and to give us something to talk about, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause my -- my sister in law will probably call me and say, "Did you see that?", you know, and just like when American Idol last night, you know, that was the topic of conversation with my girlfriends on the phone today.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  "Could you believe so and so got vo- -- you know, got in the bottom this and that" so that was kind of neat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's just something to talk about, some kind of drama, [SIGH] but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I mean, pity -- you don't like -- you -- you're watching the Mr. Personality now?
L:  Um, I saw the first one.  I -- I was working the other night, so I missed, uh, the -- the second installment, but, uh, I was very interested in the first one, because a- actually there was one guy that got completely irate that he got booted off.  He was kinda weird, he was kinda -- he was a little bit out there.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  He was a m- -- yeah, he was a mascot, actually, an NFL mascot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he, like, flipped out at this girl.  He's, like, "And let me tell you something.  You missed the best chance here" and I -- and we're all going, "Oh my God --
R:  Oh, y- --
L:  "-- send in the cops.  What the hell is wrong with this guy?"
R:  Like, um, "Hello, you're a mascot" you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He was, like, "And this is lame and da da da da da and if you're going to let some fortune t- --", they -- they had, for fun, like, a fortune teller come and -- and, uh, talk about all the guys, um, [MN] right there, to their faces and stuff.  But, like, it was -- it was kind of a party game.  It was -- and he took it very, very seriously.  He -- he was, like, you know, "If you're going to let some -- some [MN] dime store fortune teller decide who you [MN] -- who you go with and who you don't, then you're dumber than you look".
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Something like that.  I was, like -- I was, like, "Wow, you're really endearing yourself to people right now, buddy".
R:  Yeah.  Somebody --
L:  Wait a --
R:  -- took something a little personal.  Something must have hit -- struck a nerve there. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] Well, no, he was just -- he was kind of -- I don't mean to be rude, but he was kind of weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- and I was just [MN] you know, everybody was -- was kind of, uh, I -- I watched it with a couple of girlfriends of mine and we all sat around, we're, like, "Wow, he's a little needy, isn't he?  Yeah, he is". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, you have to wonder about people that for a job they hide behind a costume and you don't really get to see who they are all the time, you know?
L:  Well, no, that's -- I mean, a job is a job, I mean, I'm -- I'm in --
R:  It is, but --
L:  -- I'm in a strange job as well.  I'm -- well, for a woman, I guess, but --
R:  What --
L:  -- [MN] that -- and that doesn't really matter, because actors do that all the time.  But --
R:  They do, but you sometimes get this -- I don't know.  I guess, I mean, something struck a nerve.
L:  This guy was just weird.  This guy -- this -- this guy was not grounded in reality.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was, like, d- -- this man needs to get a grip bigger than you have ever seen.
R:  Maybe he should be on Big Brother, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] that would be --
R:  That would have been a --
L:  -- scary, that would be fabulous.
R:  Yeah, put him on -- I don't know if you've ever watched that, but that show gets pretty funny.
