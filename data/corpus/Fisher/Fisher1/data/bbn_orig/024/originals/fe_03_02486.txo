R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Boulla[?].
R:  I- -- uh, my name is Jill.
L:  Hi.  How you doing?
R:  I'm doing fine.
L:  Good.
R:  Um, so, which, uh, reality shows do you watch?
L:  I watch Survivor, I watch, um, um, How to Become a Millionaire, you know, most of the, um, regular, um, reality shows on TV I do watch.  I like American Idol too.
R:  Okay.  I actually watched Survivor a couple of times.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] How did you like it?
R:  Um, I actually like the Survivor stuff.  I mean, it's -- it's kind of, like, to see people do whatever they -- how much they'll do for money.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I thought.  But I really, really am, you know, I'm proud that -- that people like that are willing to do that.  I don't think I'd be able to do it, though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  I think I could do some of the things, but I don't think I'd eat any worms or maggots.
L:  [NOISE] No, no way.  No way.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, some of the, um, heights some of them jump, I can't -- I don't think I can do it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, so I'm really impressed.
R:  Ok- --
L:  Did you watch, um, [LIPSMACK], uh, +Big -- Big Brother last year?
R:  What is it called?
L:  Big Brother.
R:  No, no, no.
L:  Oh, I liked that too.  It's very funny, not very, very, you know, um, intelligent, but, you know, very funny, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  Not as intelligent as Survivor and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah, this is actually the first year that I've -- I don't normally watch, uh, what is it?  Public TV or, excuse me, regular TV, so this is actually the first year that I actually sort of began watching, uh, the shows.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.  So, um, do you watch American Idol?
R:  No, w- -- Am- American Idol?  No, I've watched -- I watched a little bit of the Millionaire thing --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like, the end.  The end of it.
L:  Yeah, I watched that at the end too.
R:  'Cause it didn't really interest me.  I mean, I was, like ... and, you know, what's the purpose of this?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People embarrass somebody they don't know?
L:  That's stupid. [LAUGH] I think it's stupid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  I watch it towards the end when, you know, they brought back, um, the guy and the, um, lady to show -- to let us see if they had any real relationship that had formed, you know, [NOISE] during the taping of the show.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I watched it when, um, he knew, um, he was waiting for her to come to s- -- to come to -- in, to see if he's going to, like, she's going to at least, you know, stay with him after she found out that he was not really a millionaire.
R:  Uh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I saw that episode and, um, I saw the, um, aftermath of it too. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, which was quite interesting, but I didn't see the whole thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, but I like, um, American Idol too.
R:  What is that about?
L:  American Idol, it's like, um, they search for musicians and they do -- I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] the USA.
R:  Oh, they're singing, right?
L:  A lot of people apply, you know, to -- just -- it's like a con- -- it's a, um, star search.
R:  I have seen that, where people are, like, singing, right?
L:  Yeah, they're singing, yeah.
R:  Okay, I've seen --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- like, maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ten minutes of it and then I tur- -- and people are, like, r- -- are r- rating them?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, it's that, [NOISE] ah, this is the second show [NOISE] they'll be having now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They had one, I think, um, was it last year, I think?  Um, a girl called Kelly Clarkson won that.
R:  Right.
L:  And this is the second time around.  They, um, they are, like, almost to the end of it now.
R:  Okay.
L:  They have about, I think, four or five participants left.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, to -- so that they kinda know who is gonna be w- -- the winner also, stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  I like watching reality TV.  It's -- it's funny to me, you know?  You know, after I go out to work, you know, a long day and all that and I put the kids to bed, I just want to sit down and see --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what crazy stuff they have on TV now.
R:  Fa- fantasy.
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some makes sense and some doesn't make sense --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  And some of it's just, like, plain funny.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  So, [LIPSMACK] it's one of those things.
R:  Yeah, it's the same.  I kind of, like, watch it just to sort of see something crazy.
L:  Oh, oh, yeah, lots of crazy stuff.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  There is one I -- I've been trying to, you know, remember since we started this conversation, but, um, it's about this funny Hollywood family.  I've forgo- -- Osbournes, the Osbournes, it --
R:  I've only seen it, like, once.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I was, like, "Nah, I'm into it". [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  No.
L:  It's just so stupid to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  I'm not interested.
L:  Exactly.
R:  At all.
L:  Exactly.  I wasn't interested at all in that too.
R:  How -- how come, though?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How come you weren't interested? [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  How come you weren't interested?
L:  Ah, I -- I -- I just thought it was silly, the whole family, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  When they first started, I watched it, I think, once, you know, just to check it out.
R:  Right.
L:  And when I did, I -- I was not impressed at all.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, they say different, you know, folks for -- different stuff for different folks.  Maybe some people like it, some people might like it and some people might not.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, except the people [NOISE] that do not like it at all.
R:  Yeah, I was gonna say, it's not my reality. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly. [NOISE] Yeah.  And, um, did you watch The Bachelors?  Now they have The Bachelorette or something. [NOISE]
R:  No, no, no.  I mean --
L:  Oh, I didn't [NOISE] w- -- 
R:  -- I hardly ever watch -- like I said, I hardly ever watch any of this stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I do, once in a while.  Like, I don't know, when my kids get to sleep at night, I'm not -- [NOISE] and I don't feel sleepy, I might just, you know, [NOISE] [several inaudible words] again this night. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  To see what is going on, so [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know -- I like American Idol a lot, but it comes on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I think Survivor is Thursday night.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I might just watch that.
R:  Yes.
L:  That is [MN] a very high, intelligent program.  The best, in fact.
R:  Right.  I think that's the one I like the best. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's the one I like the best too.  After that, American Idol, because I saw American Idol trying to help people out there.  Then I like the Star [NOISE] Search on CBS too.
R:  I used to watch Star Search.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  'Cause i- -- the -- the l- last one they had was, um, very interesting.  In that, um, there was this kid, this black kid [NOISE] that came on there that won the hundred thousand prize.  [NOISE] I felt really, you know, happy for her, because she and her family were living in all the streets, [NOISE] they were homeless.  And, you know, and she won, and I know she's -- now they living in a nice townhouse.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she's having man- -- you know, many, um, opportunities for record, to act. [NOISE] She was on Jay Leno the other day and, um, I'm really happy for her, you know, so I love stuff like that, you know, that helps people, you know, [NOISE] that bring people that, you know, will otherwise be unknown, bring them to, you know, uh, bring them into light.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I like those, um, kind of reality shows.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know?  But a lot of them are junk. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L: [MN] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But ... I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what -- what else did they say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're supposed to be, uh, [LIPSMACK] uh, reviewing or something?
L:  Huh?
R:  [LIPSMACK] What else did they say that we're supposed to be talking about for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's it, and I think after the ten minutes they tell us to stop, then, um, [NOISE] they now ask for comments and stuff like that. [NOISE] This is my first time of doing it, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know much about it.  Have you done it before?  This is your first time too?
R:  It's my first time.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] So how did you, um, come to know about it, the program? [NOISE]
R:  Uh, a friend sent me an email.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh, so I just, you know, s- signed up.  Do you live in the Philly area?
L:  [NOISE] Uh?
R:  Do you live in Philadelphia?
L:  No, I live in DC.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you live in DC?  Oh, 'cause they got people -- can hook up people all across the country, okay.
L:  Yeah, I live in DC, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  And how did you hear about it?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I was online one day, because, um, I -- I'm part of this, um, online which, um, which, [NOISE] uh, Weight Watch program, E. diet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And w- when we're in the community talking about, uh, the food we had that morning and somebody was talking about small businesses and, um, they raised the issue of, um, um, stuff like this.  And I said, "Okay, maybe I'll go check the website out" and I did, and I'm just trying it out, because a lot of, you know, scams out there and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lot of people, you know, that are frauds. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So ... and, um, I wish everything turns out okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, [MN] [LIPSMACK] what else are we going to talk about the reality shows?
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  I think we've exhausted ourselves. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  Well, h- how many kids do you have?  I hear 'em in the background. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, three, two girls and a boy.
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] We just got back in, like, ten minutes ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, they're getting ready to take a shower, then they eat dinner, then they go sleep.
R:  Okay.
L:  After homework and -- a- also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Then after they go to bed, I'll be able to sit in front of my TV and watch Survivor.
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I can't watch it when they're making noise, because I need all my attention on it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  My daughter told me once, "Mommy, you're an addict.  You're addicted to Survivor". I said, "Yes, I have to see who wins" and especially the one they have on now about, you know, the battle be- between the men and women.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm really, really praying [NOISE] that the women come out on top, but who knows how it's gonna come out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I need to check it out.  I haven't watched it in a while.
L:  Oh, you should, you should, you should.  Many backstabbing going on and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] I hope we -- I hope we women will win.  It's not as if I like, um, any of the women there particularly, but, um, since are we women, I have to, like, vote for the women, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, no, no.  Not necessarily.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but I -- I -- we have to show solidarity and support for our women. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  To show the man that they cannot always win. [LAUGH] And they should not always win. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  There is two women have won the Survivor, you know, challenge and stuff like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, the black lady last, yeah, and I think one, um, older woman, white woman.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, yeah, a black -- I think the black woman the last time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And the white woman, um, won before her.  And, um, a guy too, yeah.  I've really been keeping, you know, following all the Survivor programs. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Well, hey, you know?  It gives something -- something for folk to focus in on.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Just gotta [several inaudible words]
