R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Elise.
L:  Hi, Elise.  I'm Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.  [MN] I guess we're gonna talk about reality shows for a while.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you watch them?
L:  Um, y- -- I flip through 'em, but, ah, yeah, kind of.
R:  Yeah, I kind of, I've -- I've watched a couple of them but I -- I really thought that they were so cruel that I never watched any more.  I watched the one -- did you see it, where, um, the young girls were -- were trying to get married to this young guy?  I forget what it was called, probably the Bachelor, I'm not sure.
L:  Well, yeah.  You got the Bachelor, you got Joe Millionaire, you got, um [LAUGH]...
R:  Okay, it wasn't the Millionaire one, I heard about that one, but [MN] by then I had already watched that Bachelor one and I watched a couple of them [MN] --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and when -- as he, you know, rejected them, um, they were real brave in front of him and very gracious and all that sort of thing and then they interviewed them again when they got in the limousine and left and they were just crying so hard and I just -- it just really broke my heart to see them do that so I didn't watch 'em any more. [MN] 
L:  Ah, yeah, well, I mean, you know, those particular reality TV shows it's like I almost want to gag.
R:  Why?
L:  Just because anyone who goes, you know, who, at this point, you know the first one, you know, yeah, people might not really have known what was going on but at this point everybody knows what's going on.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, it's like, ah, yeah, okay, I [MN] -- what we really want is an acting job, I think.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I bet you're right.  I wonder if the girls knew on that, um, on that Millionaire thing.  I wonder if they -- if they ever got a hint that this -- this poor kid was really a nineteen -- wasn't he -- didn't he make nineteen thousand dollars a year or something as a construction worker?
L:  Which, by the way, just, you know, I used to do construction, so, yeah, no, you don't make nineteen thousand year as a construction -- you make a hell of a lot more than that.
R:  I thought so 'cause I used to work at the unemployment office here in Ohio --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, I took a lot of unemployment claims and they made a ton of money.  [LAUGH]  So, I thought that was a little bit fishy to begin with but --
L:  Right.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, just, you know, and I actually talked to so- somebody who was a contestant on that particular one --
R:  Did you really?
L:  You know, she -- yes, she was one of the first ones to go off.
R:  Okay.
L:  And she said, you know, she knew something was up because just the way he was talking it just didn't click, it didn't make sense and so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- she knew something was going on but --
R:  She just had a gut feeling about it, huh?
L:  Right.
R:  Mm.
L:  They, you know, but she didn't care, she was o- -- you know, off the first thing and she got to hang around France for a whole month.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow.  Is that where they -- that's where they did all this, I guess, in France, huh?
L:  That particular one.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  No, I mean, I -- I don't know, like, some of these things I -- I don't even know if you can really call them reality 'cause it's not really real.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know, but, I don't know, like, things like Survivor, I watched the first one.
R:  Did you?  How was that?  I never even -- I didn't even get involved in [MN] reality shows.  I didn't -- I wasn't quite sure what they were at that point.  I mean, beyond the, you know, the obvious, they must be something to do with reality and I know there was -- I don't kn- -- were they on an island?  Was that the deal or ...?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  The -- the first one was on an island and, you know, basically, you know, they -- the -- the characters interested me.
R:  [MN] Why?
L:  Um, [MN] well the morn- -- they did a good job of PR on the morning radio shows which was how I basically, you know, I got hooked -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- into loo- -- into watching it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I just watched, like, towards the tail end and, um, you know, the characters that were left were very interesting characters --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and it was kind of -- yeah -- it was kind of cool to see how they were relating on this -- this island.
R:  Well, what was the -- what was the concept behind?  I mean, did they eliminate each other as -- as this went along?  Is that how it [MN] -- was there --
L:  Right.  They had, ah -- they had competitions --
R:  -- something about getting together and voting who would go?
L:  Yeah, they would have competitions and through the competitions would kind of, um, ah, you know, get, like, personality traits come out --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and then at the end of the episode they would have a little meeting where everyone would vote off one person off the island.
R:  [MN]  Oh.  Well, that wouldn't leave that one person with a very good feeling would it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Wow.  So, did you watch the entire thing then?  Or just part of it?
L:  Just towards the end of the first one.
R:  Oh, that's right.  You mentioned that earlier and I forgot.  So, then, that -- that's the only one you ever really got hooked into watching then?
L:  Well, then I watched -- from there I watched the -- the whole series of the second Survivor, ah --
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah.  Two reasons.  One was because two of the guys were people that were from, you know, from Detroit, which is where I'm from.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, ah, you know, and one which I knew, [MN], so I wanted to see how he was --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and they both -- ah, one was the guy who got hi- -- um, his face burned in the fire.
R:  [MN]  No, what happened?
L:  Oh, he just leaned too close or -- to the fire and kind of, you know, inhaled too much smoke and passed out.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And so he was, you know, basically burnt his hands and -- I -- I think, w- was it his hands and face or just hands?  I don't know but --
R:  I didn't hear anything about it.  Wow.
L:  -- either way, um, you know he was projected to go all the way and then the other person was a -- a chef from Michigan who I actually knew.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, and, um, and, like, okay, this guy is completely arrogant and he, w- -- he still stayed arrogant on the show which was kind of funny.
R:  [MN]  He was what he was.
L:  So, I don't know, you know, I watched for those reasons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then I didn't really watch from that -- from that series on.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, but then there's just that curiosity, like, ah, who, wait, what was the one, um, Married By America?
R:  No, I never heard of that one.
L:  I'm like, oh, this one's just a couple months ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, oh, my God, it's like [LAUGH] I just had, I mean, i- it's, like, gotten to the point with that one and the one -- new one with Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Personality --
R:  Oh, I heard that that was coming up.  I haven't seen it though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It just started, that one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just like, okay, now we're -- it's at the point where I'm like, okay, I think we've had enough and I hope -- I hope for America's sake that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we've had enough.
R:  Mhm.  I hope so.
L:  Oh, the only one I really like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which I thought was kind of fun and really didn't take itself too seriously was, ah, the Amazing Race.
R:  No, I didn't hear of that one either.  I guess I live in a vacuum.
L:  That one always got a -- I don't know why, it -- it got, like, a bad night or bad time slot 'cause I know I couldn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- even watch it.  Um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But the -- the few times I saw it, it -- it was kind of funny.
R:  Really?
L:  I mean, yeah, it -- it just, I don't know.  I- it didn't take itself as seriously as some of these other ones did.
R:  Oh, that's good anyway.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess we're supposed to talk about why these thing- things are so popular but you know what, Mike?  I don't know why they're popular.  Why do you think they are?  Do you have an opinion on that?
L:  Um.  [LAUGH]  Why are circuses popular?  You know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's a freak show, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  A freak show!  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's true.  
L:  People -- ah, people -- I think people like watching train wrecks.  In fact, I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's the real reality TV.  That was the one that started it all was Cops.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  
L:  You know.
R:  That's reality, yeah.
L:  In fact, that's more reality based than any of the other things and it's just like, you know, [MN] sometimes things that aren't scripted are just, you know, just, you -- [MN] more amusing.
R:  I guess there's -- yeah --
L:  It's like people want to watch the train wreck.
R:  There's probably a lot more room for really wild things to happen than there is on something that's -- that's already scripted and written.  Hm.
L:  Right, 'cause you got that predictability factor in --
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  -- when you've got scripted things.  But you just don't know what's going to happen on these reality things.
R:  That's true.
L:  Although now it's to the point where you've seen so much that it's, like, okay [LAUGH] ...
R:  Hm.  I wonder if it's getting kind of hokey now for most people.
L:  Well, do you remember that movie, Ed?
R:  No.
L:  Um, it was about somebody who agreed to sign hi -- or, Ed TV, I'm sorry, it was called Ed TV. 
R:  Mm.
L:  And the premise behind it was this guy signs away his rights and they follow him around twenty four hours a day with the TV camera.
R:  Oh, wait, I think I did hear something about that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That was a movie that was done, well, about five years ago, six years ago, something like that.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Well, now, I guess it's to the point now where they're actually gonna try to do that.
R:  Are they really?
L:  Yeah, I read somewhere that they're actually doing testing for that show.
R:  Oh, I wonder if the shows are still more popular than -- than you and I seem to both hope.  I wish they'd just do away with them really but [MN] I can't figure out why they're so popular at all.
L:  Right, they're -- I think that's what it's gonna come down to is I think everything now is going to have that reality slant until --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- until people stop watching it.
R:  Mhm.  Until the newness wears off or the novelty of the whole thing.  Maybe that's why they're popular 'cause it's novel.
L:  Hopefully, I'm hoping that's the case but --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because I k- -- I kind of like the sitcom and the drama and now you can't watch as many of them because it's all reality TV.
R:  Yeah, I just, like I said, once I watched a couple of those episodes of that one with the -- the Bachelor and that was -- that was not the construction fella but the other one [MN] and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was just -- it was too cruel and I can't figure out why people like to watch 'em.  I jut think they're a real drag.
L:  Why di- -- why did you like to watch it?
R:  [MN] Um, actually I -- I watched it twice.  I got kind of curious to see which girl was gonna get this guy. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] It was down to like, I -- it was down to about three or maybe four by the time I started watching it but I watched it twice and -- and the one girl and I can't even remember what she looked like now but she sat in the back of that limousine [MN] and she was really heartbroken.  She was really in love with this guy, you know, and, um, or at least she seemed to be, you know, and she was, she just sobbed her little heart out and I felt so sorry for her.  She'd been so brave in front of him and she was real gracious about, you know, the rejection and everything [MN] and then she got in the car and cried like a baby, you know, [MN] so I was curious to see which one of these girls --
