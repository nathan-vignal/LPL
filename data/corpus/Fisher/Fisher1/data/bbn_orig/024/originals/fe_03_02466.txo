L:  Hi, this is Sherry.
R:  Hi, this is Jackie.  How are you today?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Fine, thank you.
L:  I guess the question is about reality TV.
R:  Reality TV?  Do you watch it?
L:  Um, [MN] sometimes.  Like, I watched, ah, Joe Millionaire [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a lot of it.  [LAUGH] Um, but -- um, a little bit of Survivor but that's about it.  I don't, like, get totally into it.
R:  No.  I don't -- can't get into it at all.
L:  Really? [MN]
R:  Mm, mm.  I have -- but I'm funny about my TV.  It either has to be something I'm interested in, like some kind of a movie show or something like that or, ah, educational.  I gotta get something out of it and [MN] I can't watch people put their lives out, exploiting +themselves, I guess you would call it.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] And I watched -- I also watched a little bit of, ah, They're Getting Married, let me think, Married by America.  Did you see the advertisements and stuff?  [MN] They, like, they let Amer- America pick their partners.  Ah, that was kind of scary.  I'm, like, wow, I would never do that.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Ah, no, sure wouldn't do that.  That's ridiculous.  [MN] Yeah, my husband watches Fear Factor sometimes and --
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- it's intense. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's pretty weird.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Those people get on TV and do all kinds of weird things for money. 
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] I think --
L:  Why do --
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Oh, oh, why do you think that the people watch it?  Like, so many people watch it?
R:  I, you know, I've often wondered that myself.  That was -- I was -- when they asked that question I was, "Hm, why do people?"  [MN] I think there's a lot of people that are into voyeurism and so that they like watching that and, um [MN] -- 
L:  What's voyeurism?
R:  Ah, ah, where pe- people who like to watch other people doing stuff --
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  -- like peeping toms and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There's -- there's both ends of it.  You either like -- you either like to expose yourself so people see you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] or you're on the other spectrum where you're the one who likes to watch people and you usually do it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the sly type thing.  [MN] Um, I think there are a lot of people that must be into that and then too, um, I don't know, people just [MN] -- I guess they think it'll make -- I don't know why people watch it.  [NOISE] I can't understand it.
L:  [MN] Oh, do you know what that beep ...?
R:  That was my answering machine that I had to -- I c- -- unfortunately with the cordless phone it won't cut it off so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'll have to delete it in a minute.
L:  Oh. [MN]
R:  That's what it is.  It's cutting itself off.  I had to turn the volume down. [MN]
L:  Ah, I see.
R:  Um, but, no, I guess that the voyeurism is the -- th- that and, I don't know, my -- my one friend, I have a -- one friend, she call- -- she's like, she thinks it's like the dumbing down of people because it doesn't challenge you to think of anything. [MN]
L:  Huh.
R:  When you're watching TV, you know, you don't have to think about, it doesn't challenge you in -- in any way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's just pure entertainment.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I know when -- when I -- I started watching Joe Millionaire it was because I liked the idea that, "Well, let's see if they choose him for love".  I kind of got into that idea 'cause normally I don't watch, like, just to watch the Bachelor or something  [MN]
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  That's kind of why I started watching it and I thought he was kind of cute and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he is real cute.  I didn't ever watch it.  Um, I saw him on some talk shows and stuff and they always, of course, it -- it -- it got real interesting.  Of course, th- they peak it up really good with their commercials, you know.  I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] like, I never really watched Survivor but then there was that time where they showed that alligator and the guy actually got burnt but they made it look like in the commercial he was going to get attacked by an alligator.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, and, of course, it's the last thing they show and I watched that episode because the hype from the -- from the commercial, I was like, whoa, you know.  I think other people get hyped up from the commercials too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But then every talk show, of course, you know, talks to every- -- talks about it and --
L:  Oh, I know, and they were on Oprah, like, the -- the lady that got dumped was on Oprah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, was she? [LAUGH]
L:  She lost her job over it or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  That's sad.  [LAUGH]
R:  I always wondered with these people, like, don't they work? 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, you know ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not too many jobs let you off for long periods of time.  If you don't win that million dollars I don't know what you'd do.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I guess I could see with Survivor because it seems like they get to, you know, sponsor television, you know, commercials.  That's the people who do it but the people who watch it, I don't know what they get out of it.
L:  Yeah.  And then --
R:  I have a friend who really gets into it though, boy, after she'll watch 'em she'll call me and tell me all about 'em and [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she gets all into 'em.  I'm like, "Mm, whatever". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, you're just a good friend.  You just listen. [MN]
R:  Mhm, hm, hm.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] I'm like, ah, she knows I'm not into 'em [MN] 'cause she's all the time saying, "You need to watch", and I'm like, "Argh".
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I say, "Yes, I'm sorry". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, [LAUGH]
R:  I can't do it.  [MN] They just don't interest me. [MN]  And, like, Fear Factor's her favorite and I -- I can't even watch that.  People eat worms and all kinds of gooky stuff and --
L:  I think people put them in the -- the people's place, like, "Ooh, could I do that, am I that brave?", you know. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  I think a lot of it is a challenge to people, [LIPSMACK] you know, they're not challenged somewhere else, so they --
L:  I don't think I could --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- eat those things or whatever.
R:  Uh-uh.  I would just -- I would be, like, "Oh, forget it, I don't need that money". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  One thing [several inaudible words]
L:  I mean, if -- if you were guaranteed the money I would probably do it but when you have to compete --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- ah, forget about it. [MN]
R:  Forget about it.  Ah, I watched, one time my husband was watching it and they put this dude in this box and it was full of sn- -- they -- they just poured snakes on these people.
L:  Ooh.
R:  First they put 'em in the box and then they just poured snakes on 'em and I'm, like, "No, I don't think so" and I'm not really afraid of snakes too -- who- whole heck of a lot but you're not going to pour snakes on me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I can't even see what people get out of watching that because I've -- I never forgot watching it.  It was, like, sometimes I have nightmares about them damn snakes. [MN]
L:  That is freaky.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, no, so, it doesn't h- -- ah, I don't get into 'em.  [MN] Um, I'm real disappointed actually in them and I don't understand why people watch 'em because they're getting so popular that they're taking over, um, the -- the shows and if you have regular programming I don't know what people watch.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, because --
L:  You have to have cable, huh?
R:  Yeah, if you don't have cable you're stuck with reality TV or paid programming and that's another thing I can't get over, people watching these commercials.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] gosh, I can't -- you don't get enough commercials in between your shows?  You gotta sit there and watch a whole thirty minute spiel. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, well, th- they have, like, three hours one after another sometimes.
R:  Yeah, on regular TV.  I was looking, and I was thinking, golly, 'cause [MN] what do the kids watch when they get home from school?  Judge Joe Brown or paid programming? [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there's a generation of, ah, credit cards.  Let's spend all your money.  I guess that's why you gotta get into reality pr- -- TV.  You're thinking, "Hm, can I do that?" [LAUGH]
L:  So, the -- the -- the court shows are -- they're reality TV too, are they?
R:  Yeah, I guess they are [MN] and --
L:  Oh, I get i- -- I get into those.
R:  Now, some of them aren't too bad because, of course, you know, it's case law, so [MN] law is law, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with the law so it is interesting because -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you learn, you know, [MN] where the law stands on things.
L:  Right.
R:  You learn about contract law and stuff like that.  I don't want to see people's divorces aired on TV.
L:  Ah. [MN]
R:  I like the civil ones [LIPSMACK] if it's a good civil suit.
L:  Right.
R:  I always like to see it contractual.  I like to see it if they're contractual, then I'll -- I'll watch them 'cause I always like to see how they're gonna, you know, go on that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um [MN] --
L:  Ah --
R:  Yeah, that's about all I do.  I'm -- I think reality TV -- would you consider, ah, Changing Rooms reality TV?  'Cause I watch that all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  What's it called?  Ch- --
R:  Changing Rooms, Trading Spaces, where they, um, decorate each other's homes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- that's kind of a reality TV too.  But that's a nice -- that's not -- that's more nice.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  I love those shows 'cause they -- they give you so many decorating ideas on how to do things inexpensively and they make so much and you [MN] I -- I like that.
L:  What I really don't like is Jerry Springer. [LAUGH]
R:  Nah.  That does- --
L:  'Cause I think that's sensationalized a lot.
R:  Exploitation, sensationalization, all of that, yeah.  Oh, it's good.
L:  The thing is, some people really act like this, you know, if you see your neighbors get in a fight, they really act crazy like this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] But, I mean, I don't need to see it on TV 'cause it's all around the world anyway. [MN]
R:  Exactly, some- -- do- don't you wonder though that these people get, ah, they get, like, desensitized to it because they see it on TV all the time, they, then they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't think it's -- there's anything different about it when they go out and do it in real life.
L:  Oh, that's not a good idea.
R:  You know, that's what I think.  I think when children are watching, like, really bad shows and stuff, after a while all the blood and the guts and the sex on TV [MN] well, after -- by the time they're teenagers, well, heck, that ain't nothing new to them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're so used to it.
L:  That's sad.
R:  Isn't it?  It's real sad.  [MN] It's just TV.  It's corruption.  Of course, you know, not all the reality TV shows are, they're not really into corruption.  I thought where they married that woman off was ridiculous and I don't know why anybody would watch that.
L:  Which one was that?
R:  The -- I think it might have been the first one where that woman married some guy, the --
L:  The Bachelor?
R:  The, ah, n- --
