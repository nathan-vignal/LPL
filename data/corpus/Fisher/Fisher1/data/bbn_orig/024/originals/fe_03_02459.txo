L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Heather.
R:  Hi, my name is Sharl.
L:  Okay.  I guess reality TV, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you watch?
R:  Um, some of it I do, yes.  We got completely hooked on Survivor the first few times.
L:  Okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I watch bits and pieces of it.  I'm not really into that too much.  Ah, I don't know, it seems to get trashier the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the more shows that come out and all that, so, um ...
R:  I agree with that.
L:  I'm thinking.
R:  They -- I- I'm not as obsessed with Survivor this time as the first few times.
L:  Right.
R:  The first time was just -- I could not miss an episode.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  But it's kind of gotten less with each passing one.
L:  Right, I think the first one, ah, you know, it's a -- it was a new show, it was, well, probably the first real reality show, so, ah --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  --everyone wanted to see it but then, I don't know, for me, it got kind of boring and ...
R:  Well, it -- there is a sa- -- certain sameness and just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the same people get dirty and raggedy and -- and, ah, the girls, it's pretty evident, I think, at this point, that they're hiring them for how they look and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not how th- -- how good they look in the least clothes they can find. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  Well, I don't watch it any more [LAUGH], so ... 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Any other -- any other shows that you watch or --
R:  Ah, we've kinda gotten into American Idol which I guess --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- is sort of a reality show too.
L:  Right, that's true, yes.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  So, um, we've been k- -- we didn't really watch the first one and then my husband really got interested in it and, um, [MN] this time we've watched every one of those.
L:  Is that right?
R:  We have our favorites and, you know.
L:  Well, I guess, my husband isn't really into them so that's part of the reason I don't watch them --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but, ah, he was actually interested in Joe Millionaire for some reason --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but, um, you know, I think --
R:  I know.  Some of those just kind of take you by surprise --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- once you get interested in them.
L:  And how can people actually do that, you know.
R:  I know.  I've never understood that.  It's -- it's, um, sometimes I compare it to, you know, when you pass an accident and you just can't look away.  
L:  Right.
R:  It's just like a morbid curiosity or something.
L:  Right, sure. [LAUGH] 
R:  And the -- the -- the ads, this new one, ah, what is it?  Mr. Personality, where they all have the masks on and --
L:  Okay, I hav- -- I've heard of it but I haven't really ...
R:  No.
L:  Noticed the ads but --
R:  I haven't watched it but I've just seen the ads --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for it and it's just, oh, [MN] they're getting worse and worse. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I think there's gonna be a point where they just, I don't know, they lose popularity or something and there'll be -- there'll be something trashier out probably.
R:  I think they're self destructing, you know --
L:  I know.  So do I.
R:  -- sort of like, that, ah, Who Wants to be a Millionaire phenomenon a couple of years ago. 
L:  That's right, yeah, so ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Once it got to be on five days a week then people sort of lost interest. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And have you -- did you see Married By America by any chance?
R:  No --
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I, ah, again saw the -- the, ah, previews on TV of that and um--
L:  Right.
R:  -- just think, "How can people possibly do that?"
L:  I know.  I saw one show and you could just feel how nervous they were and ...
R:  Oh, yes.  Oh, we --
L:  And I don't think any of them turned up. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't, yeah, I don't know how it finally ended up if any of them actually got married.  Ah ...
L:  I don't think -- I -- what I do is I check the website just to see who's made --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the next round and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I think they -- they all called it off. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think that's probably smart.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] We did watch, um -- my husband is -- is an inveterate flipper as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I think most men are and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he ran across that, ah, what was it?  Meet my Parents.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, so, we did watch that a couple of times and that was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very interesting.
L:  Is that right?  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, they, ah -- did you ever see that one?
L:  Um, no, I just read about it and it sounded like it was a bomb so --
R:  Oh, it was --
L:  -- I didn't -- didn't even bother.
R:  It was so weird, I mean --
L:  Really?
R:  It -- especially when it was the guys that were going to the girl's house and you think the parents are, I don't know, I got the feeling they're almost pimping their daughter, you know, to go for a weekend in Las Vegas or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Hawaii or somewhere --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- with some guy and --
L:  Boy.
R:  I just thought, uh!  I don't know.  But i- it's again just fascinating and [MN] it was one of those things I think that just lasted like an hour and it was over with.  That was it.  It wasn't a, you know, a week to week --
L:  Right, sure.
R:  -- kind of thing, so, you kind of got the decision that nigh, so it was easier to watch it, I think.
L:  Right.  I g- -- I guess why they're so popular, people just relate to them or -- I don't know, 'cause it's --
R:  I guess.
L:  -- it's real people and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing real things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though the cameras are in their face, I'm sure --
R:  Oh, I can't imagine.
L:  -- a lot of it is ad lib and --
R:  Well and that -- that could be, I guess, you or me up there.  I guess that's the --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, sort of the pull is that --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- anybody can get into these things.
L:  That's right.  Not me. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no.  I wouldn't --
L:  But, you know, it's possible.
R:  Well, did you ever watch Big Brother?
L:  Um, [MN] I watched a bit of the first season but it -- I found it kind of boring.  
R:  Again, yeah, yeah.  That --
L:  Not --
R:  I didn't really care what they were doing twenty four seven and --
L:  That's right, so ...
R:  I -- they -- that's one thing I like about Survivor, they seem to edit it very well --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you don't have long periods of just nothingness, you know.
L:  That's right and the -- the scenery is nice and --
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't know, they -- they have a lot of different conflicting personalities.
R:  Yeah, always. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When I saw the guy on, ah, Letterman the other day he, you know, he still has the latest Survivor that's kicked off and --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and he said, "What was the most outstanding thing?", or something, and he said the boredom.  He said it's just horrible.  There's nothing to do.  You can --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, you just, you can only stare at the fire for so many hours a day and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we don't see that --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- because they're following everybody and interviewing them individually so they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they do a good j- -- editing job of that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anyway.
L:  And people say h- how they made them look like a nasty person --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and they're really a nice person.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It's funny.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You've gotta wonder. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  But I guess the money is the incentive for them.
R:  I guess and in this day you'd think a million dollars isn't that much --
L:  No.
R:  -- truthfully to put yourself through all that in --
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  -- front of America.
L:  But then you get the endorsements after.
R:  Oh, yeah, a lot of them do and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and, ah ...
L:  So, [COUGH] but, I don't know why they're popular now. 
R:  I --
L:  I'm just waiting for them to fade. 
R:  I guess, yeah --
L:  So ...
R:  Who knows what'll be the next big thing? 
L:  Right.
R:  I'm almost afraid to find out. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] So ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  But, could you see yourself ever being on one of them?
L:  Mm, I don't think so. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I do- -- I don't think I could either.
L:  What's -- what's the one, the Fear Factor?  Ugh
R:  Oh, oh, I can't even watch that.
L:  Disgusting. [MN]
R:  That, to me, is just disgusting --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  I mean, to do that to a human being. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I -- ugh!  Just to find out what y- -- I guess -- what is the premise?  Just to find our what your worst fear is and make you --
L:  Right, yeah, see what you're -- you're -- what you- you'll do for money too.
R:  Oh, well, yeah, ugh.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, then, I guess it's given a lot of second rate celebrities another job.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  You know, that -- that guy on -- on Fear Factor, the one from -- what was he on?  News Radio or something.
L:  Okay.
R:  And Mon- Monica Lewinsky, of course.  That's that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- new Mr. Personality. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what I was going to say, she has a new show.  That's where -- that's where I heard of the show.
R:  Yeah, yes.  She's the host of that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH] I don't think I'll watch that now.
R:  No, no, somehow I think I can miss that.
L:  I wonder if Bill Clinton will. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Mm, yes, that's a whole 'nother reality. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh!
L:  So, well, do we keep talking or what?
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- it seems like it's been a long time. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Boy, let's talk about other stuff now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't know if we're --
L:  -- supposed to, but ...
R:  Well, it said something, like, for eight minutes they want you to talk about the topic --
L:  Right, sure.
R:  I guess you can only talk about reality TV so long.
L:  That's right.  I mean, there's no other reasons why I can think of the popularity of it, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  No, it -- it's just -- i- it's just shock and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, ah, you know, just morbid --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- curiosity mostly.
R:  That's right.
L:  Well, there's that other one where they, like, oh, help -- help me, I'm a celebrity [LAUGH] or whatever and they --
R:  Get Me Outta Here I'm a Celebrity or whatever it was.
L:  That's right, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I never saw any of them.
L:  Neither.  Those ones, they -- they can get stupid or they --
R:  Well, and then there was the ones, what was it -- The Mole?  I never saw that either.  I just saw --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- ads for that and -- and, um, the one -- now, the ones, like, my daughter kind of got to watching the one where they were, um, traveling, the pairs, you know, trying to get home or --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  I can't remember what the name of that one was even.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, ah, the Race across America or so- -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  No, no.  Something Around the W- -- I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, something, but, yeah.
L:  They had to go around the world and all that.
R:  Yeah, and they had to go -- there'd be like the next city and then -- and then find your --
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  -- and my daughter got kind of interested in that be- -- just because they were going to the different cities and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that was kind of interesting but, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you'd feel sorry for the people that'd get lost --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the people that would just fight and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- scream at each other. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well it just -- it shows, and I mean, you know, like we said, it's real people and that's what real relationships are like.
R:  Get your warts and all on there, I guess.
L:  Well, I get along with my husband, thank you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  No long trips like that though.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm not sure if we were racing against someone else and every mistake we made was going to be amplified that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we'd get along that well. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes reality's a little more than I want. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  Yeah.  We have enough problems. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, [MN] I don't know.
R:  Oh, no, I don't either, um ...
L:  [MN] But, ah ...
R:  But it's -- it's an interesting phenomenon and there's just --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- too much of it now.  Almost everything is.
L:  I know, I mean, they -- one -- one, well Survivor capitalized on it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and everyone else got on the bandwagon then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Well, and now they have that new one on PBS, I guess, that's just started. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, it's sort of like an upstairs downstairs kind of thing.
L:  Okay.  [MN] Haven't heard of that either.
R:  It just started.
L:  You're more clued in than I am.
R:  [LAUGH] I read the TV guide. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  Um, it's -- it's, ah, it said it's like Gosford Park meets Upstairs Downstairs or something.
L:  Okay, all right, yeah, I remember now. 
R:  Yeah, and, and so --
L:  [LAUGH] Just tell me a little bit more about it and I remember.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was just reading the blurb 'cause I was reading to see, you know, what was on TV last night and--
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- one of 'em said, um, "The servants revolt" so I guess whoever decided, you know, they -- they decided somehow somebody --
