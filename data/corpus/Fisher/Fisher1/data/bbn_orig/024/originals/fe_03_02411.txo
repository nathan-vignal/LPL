R:  Hello -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, my name's Art.
L:  My name is Drew.
R:  Drew, okay.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Ah, I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Fair enough.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess we've got to talk about personal habits relating to which one do we feel is worse -- 
R:  I think smoking --
L:  -- over eating, drinking, etc, etc.
R:  Yeah, we've got quite a few topics.
L:  Yeah.  You got any, ah, any thoughts off the top of the head?
R:  Ah, well, I think -- I think smoking actually, and actually lack of exercise was part of the top two.
L:  Yeah.  I actually agree with you there.  Um, I don't smoke cigarettes myself and, ah, I don't ever plan on doing it and I think it's pretty bad.  Bottom line.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I've always been an athlete so it's like, um, smoking would just [several inaudible words] my aerobics, um, and actually my workouts.  And I wear contacts also so it also bothers my eye- eye as a manner of speaking.
L:  Ah, okay.  Yeah, I'm -- I -- I'm a former athlete.  I'm a college student now.  I don't play sports any more but, I was pretty active all through junior high school and high school and, um, yeah, I don't like to smoke.  I still like to stay in shape.  And I don't think anything's wrong with over eating a- ah, like, I was thinking -- I was having a hard time choosing between over eating and lack of exercise -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, I would, you know -- you can -- you can over eat and still exercise and stay in shape.  But, you can't really, if you don't exercise, you can't over eat.
R:  Yeah, I agree there.  It's sort of like a -- actually, you know, if you exercise -- the more you exercise the more you can eat though -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- that's the way I always look at it and then, um, you know, everybody should need to know -- know their own body in a manner of speaking.  But, I know this -- this -- um, I'm -- I'm forty nine but I've -- I'm pretty lucky I've always been an athlete and, ah, I've always been able to manage my weight pretty much.  But -- but, most people can't.  It's amazing they don't really understand food as a manner of speaking.  I always thought that, you know, your body's like a car, you've got to throw in, you know -- put in your car -- you throw in your gas, oils [inaudible] you're going to have problems.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, ah, strange.  I -- when I was a -- when I used to compete a lot I used to eat actually about eight thousand calories per day and now that I'm older I don't train as much I'm down to about half of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  Ah, so, do you have a hard time adjusting your diet as you get older, like, does your metabolism actually slow down noticeably?
R:  [NOISE] Not mine because I've a -- I've always did aerobics when I did train.  I was -- I was a body builder and a power lifter on the national level that's why I came out -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that's why I came out in Los Angeles.  So, um, and now that I'm forty nine years old actually I don't -- actually well I don't eat when I was [several inaudible words] I just don't eat as much b- m- and, ah, a lot of people actually when they're -- when they're training either -- either eating more and then if they don't train they're still eating more.  But, for me -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just the opposite.  It's like, if I don't -- I don't train I don't have to eat as much.  Then my -- and my weight comes down a little bit but not by much.
L:  So, your metabol- I find metabolism slow down naturally so, it sounds like the more -- if you -- if you stay active then your metabolism stays -- 
R:  Yeah, you keep -- 
L:  -- as -- 
R:  -- you -- I think, better.  I think it keeps you running better, you know?  That's -- that's the way I look at it.  I mean, I -- ah, the more -- ah, to me a calorie's a calorie.  So, it's like, um, it doesn't matter what you eat it's just total calories.  That's the way I always look at it, even though some people say, "You -- you got to eat so much protein or carbohydrates" or that or whatever.  I don't know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I've always, um, yeah.  I've been lucky in a manner of speaking but I -- my whole family is heavy -- ah, has to lose weight and I'm just the opposite. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I'm pretty -- I'm still pretty big for my size and -- but -- but, because of my -- my good muscles, it's just old muscle I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  Now I no- 
L:  [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- I notice she said [inaudible] -- they mentioned drinking though.  I -- I don't have a drinking problem anymore because after -- after a certain age I sort of got -- had the dry heaves for two or three days so I -- that eliminated my, ah, drinking problem really quick.
L:  You dry heaved for two or three days?
R:  Oh, yeah, where -- right when I got about twenty nine years old I -- I just couldn't handle drinking as much as I could.  I mean, in college I used to drink all the time, you know a case of beer, or a bottle of whisky or vodka or whatever.  But, then right about twenty nine I -- I used to -- it just used to wipe me out for two or three days and, um, I'd lose about eight or nine pounds.
L:  Wow.  I guess your body just couldn't handle it anymore.
R:  No, exactly.  I could have a couple of drinks now but now I sort of nurse them, you know, in a manner of speaking.  But -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I, ah, yeah, for me I -- I know drinking's a big problem in this country but, um, ah, that -- that's not, you know, and, um, they do consider drinking -- and drinking is a drug in a manner of speaking but it's more acceptable.  But, a lot of people get hurt with drinking.  So -- 
L:  Especially -- I mean, I think drinking is pretty dangerous because people -- so many people do it and it's so widely accepted.
R:  Oh, yes -- 
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- I -- 
L:  -- so, you do.
R:  -- I agree there.
L:  So -- so, [several inaudible words] to fall into the trap of alcoholism and the funny thing is, I drink a lot too.  I'm in college.
R:  Mm, yeah.  I'd -- it was every day in college.  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't drink every day.  But, I'd drink I'd say, like, this is my senior year of college so I have less responsibilities now than I did in the past -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I drink a bottle maybe four times a week.  And it's about [several inaudible words] and I can see it getting [inaudible] about every day -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- for -- for weeks.
R:  What -- what school do you go to there?
L:  Ah, University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I went to Indiana University. 
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  That was a pretty -- pretty -- like -- 
L:  Isn't Indiana like a big party school?
R:  Actually it -- it is.  I still sort of rate it, like, number one at a [inaudible] top ten when I was -- I was there and, well, the year that I graduated was seventy six so that was the year number one -- we were number one in the country at basketball -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- back then.  So, we were in -- actually we [several inaudible words] [NOISE] last time they played a college team with my, ah -- 
L:  Well, our social there're, like, parties every night.
R:  Yeah, it was -- it was, ah -- I did party a lot, quite -- quite a bit.  But, I -- I did exercise there too.  I might -- might -- even though I have a BS degree I spent another thirty hours in, um, in [several inaudible words] you know, thirty credits, basically PE then I went back for my masters in athletic training.
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I've always -- I've always wondered what it's like to go to a school like that because my school is considered the -- the [inaudible] call it the Ivy -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that our friends who go to bigger schools [several inaudible words] that our party life is -- is nothing compared to what they do over there.
R:  Yeah.  You know, at that age you just learn to -- well, you're away from home and, I guess, everybody goes sort of wild.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, [several inaudible words].  But, you know, [several inaudible words] actually in this country I -- one of -- since I was a training out here, you know, a lot of -- and I'm surprised they say California a lot of people are a lot fit compared to other parts of the country.  But, I still -- I think there's a lot of people over here that need to lose weight.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah, including the kids.  Kids nowadays, because they don't exercise sixty -- there are sixty, seventy percent are actually out of shape.  They can't even do, like, a mile on a -- just even these little things that are con- considered simple thirty years ago.
L:  Wow.
R:  I actually think it's just a lack of nutrition or, you know, there's a -- well, there's a lot of different things.  But, people really need [inaudible] -- especially the kids.  They, ah, they need better eating habits.
L:  Yeah.  That's one thing that I've been thinking about is the way the f- like, the f- the food quality is really, really on the -- really on the down slide in this country.  If you look at, like, things like, ah, restaurants like McDonalds that are spreading like wildfire and the food they serve isn't even food.  It's -- it's pure garbage.
R:  I -- we are so used to fast food nowadays, especially in California, that, ah, oh, it's hard to get aw- get away from fast food.
L:  Yeah.  And as much as I don't like it I find myself being drawn to it because it's just everywhere and it's so convenient.
R:  Yeah.  Well, actually in college that's when I started gaining weight but I needed to gain weight because of the -- but, I lived in the dorms the first couple of years -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you get to eat as much as you want.  But, yeah, [several inaudible words] in this country [several inaudible words] coming third.  Recent tests have showed that kids nowadays are getting kind of very depressed at being overweight even to the point where it's like, um, it's almost like they're taking depression on to have cancer.  That was just recently -- recently stated.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [several inaudible words] I just saw it a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Wait, so what -- so, what are they saying?  That the depression was a result of the over eating?
R:  Ah, yes, yeah.  And bad self-esteem, self-respect.  You know, a lot of the -- a lot of kids nowadays are, you know, sometimes they put them on ritalin or other different drugs or, um, sometimes -- sometimes even antidepressants, you know?
L:  Yeah, they over medicate them.
R:  Over medicate and that's -- they're starting at an earlier age nowadays.
L:  That's kind of scary because, I don't know, I don't -- I don't really trust the medical establishment insofar as their mass production of -- of pills and -- and -- and -- and, ah, antibiotics.
R:  Yeah, well, actually in -- when I was training, actually, the more that I trained the more I learned about medicine, tell you the truth.  And, ah, all my -- all my [inaudible] doctors, I would tell them -- tell them what -- what I needed, um, and actually I came out pretty good compared to most of my friends.  Some of them are already -- some of them are even dead or, you know -- [inaudible] have, ah, kidney problems or heart problems or --  
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I took steroids at -- about ten years when I was a competitor.  But, I didn't take -- I took the least ones that are least an- anabol- or ana- anogen- anogenic[?].  Anabolic affects your [inaudible] which is good for the protein part.  But, the -- the side effects I took -- I always took the least amount and, tell you the truth, I -- I -- it must have worked because I still have all my hair.  I have clean skin.  I have, ah, no kidney problems.  I have no heart problems.
L:  You said some of your friends are dead.  But -- so, they probably -- 
R:  Yeah, actually, they are.
L:  What ages did they die?
R:  Yeah, surprisingly some of them are dead at m- at my age of forty -- well, they --
