L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Alison.
R:  And I'm Wanda.
L:  Hi, how old are you?
R:  Oh, I'm thirty nine.
L:  Oh, I'm only nineteen. [MN]
R:  Ooh, I gotta kid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I go to Penn State, so ...
R:  You g- -- you go to Penn State?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that is too cool.  I graduated from there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Cool.  What did you major in?
R:  Agricultural science and extension education.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Many, many years ago.
L:  [LAUGH] I can tell. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  And, ah, [LIPSMACK] what do you think about reality shows?
L:  Um, when I used to, like, be at home, my mom and I really got into them [MN] and I, like, we w- -- we really loved Survivor.  Like, you just kind of got hooked on it, like, not just because of, ah, the competitions and stuff but we also really liked, um, like little dramas that would go along but Survivor was definitely my favorite and even here I watch some of it.
R:  I -- I don't care for reality shows.  I [LAUGH] --
L:  Not at all?
R:  No.  I watch, once in a while I get a glimpse of it but, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a nerd s- ... [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you know if, um, like, the Real World and Road Rules, those are also considered reality, right?
R:  Ah, they're ones from MTV?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I used to like those.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I watch those too, so I guess I ...
R:  Yeah, they are because it's got four or five people living together --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they don't know each other and they get into each other's nerves.  [MN]  When I was younger I used to love to watch that.
L:  Yeah, I'm still into it.  Like, the weird thing now is because they're actually my age.  Like, before, you almost, like, idolized them because they were being followed around and you get to see, like, their whole life when they're in the house or whatever it is [MN] but now it's -- it's different, like, 'cause you try to put yourself in their situation 'cause it's more, like, your age and, I don't know, it's different.
R:  Yeah, yeah, you c- -- yeah, yeah.  You wanna be like them.  You --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- wanna have that fun.  [MN]  No, I'm -- I'm into more, more into documentaries.  That's what I really like to watch.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  History a- and that type of show, so I rarely watch TV myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have four children and they're all little.
L:  Oh.
R:  I worked, after I graduated college I worked and [MN] now I got my reality at home.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's true.
R:  Four children, eleven and under so I have to [MN] stay busy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And what other, and, ah, Wants to be a Million- -- oh, not wh- -- I'm trying to think of the one of the guy that all the girls thought he was really cute.
L:  Oh, um ...
R:  The guy with curly hair.
L:  Not the Bachelor, um, was it -- no it wasn't --
R:  Joe Millionaire.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  All my girlfriends loved that show --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because they're forty and older and they thought he was it.
L:  He -- he was good looking and I only saw a couple of those shows.
R:  Yeah.  I only saw the last one because my husband wanted to see it, to see who ended up.  I said, "He's going to ended up with the teacher.  She's smart, she's intelligent --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- and she wants the money".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And they're not going to stay together.
L:  What was that one, um, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?
R:  Oh, the girl that got second and then she had her show?
L:  Yeah, it was just --
R:  Oh, no, that's the one that they did get married.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  And then got a divorce right away or something like that.
L:  Yeah, like, who in their right mind would go on a show like that and marry some person who they just met?  You know.
R:  Money and glory.
L:  Yeah, I guess that's true.
R:  They want to -- they want those fifteen minutes of fame on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They wanna be seen.  They wanna be recognized.
L:  Someone was calling it prostitution because, you know, like honeymoons and stuff, they say that they would be having sex on the honeymoon and that [MN] because of the marriage they'd be getting money from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess they thought of her as that.
R:  Oh that's -- that's a very good point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is a very good point.  I can't -- I just don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't see myself doing that.
L:  I know.  And now they have the one where people vote on the Internet to decide who gets married.  I think it's, like, all Fox.  Fox does all those things.
R:  Yeah.  And Murdoch.  [inaudible] That's why he's a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- multi mill- -- actually he's a billionaire.
L:  I know.
R:  He knows what to do.  People like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because, get them away from the- -- from their reality. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  They get involved into those people's lives.
L:  Yeah, even though it may not be ethical it [MN] brings in people's viewing.
R:  And what are you studying at Penn State?  I'm just curious.
L:  I'm in, ah, sports medicine.
R:  Oh, cool.  That was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to live in Simmons Hall. I don't know if that exists still.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm right across from that now.  I'm in Mifflin in Pollock.
R:  Oh, go- -- wow.  Memories!  Ah!
L:  Yeah.  I -- I started out in, ah, East --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I didn't get along with my roommate at all, so I moved in with my friend down here.  It's nicer.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  It takes a lot of pressure off.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Do you get to watch TV downstairs or do they have TV in their rooms now?
L:  Um, my roommate has a big TV.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But they still have a TV in, like, on the main floor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we have a bigger one in our room.
R:  We weren't allowed to have TVs or anything like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that.
L:  Yeah, and they give you, like, a cable hook up --
R:  Oh!  Argh!
L:  [LAUGH] -- and Penn State has, um, a couple of its own, like, channels, like, movie channels and we get all the main ones but then there are some, like, from home, like, I don't get the food channel and stuff like that.
R:  But that is wonderful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you -- you can actually sit down and watch those reality shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you just don't wanna --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you just wanna relax and [MN] -- and watch them.  I really don't.  My husband once in a while turns it on but [MN] I don't care for them.
L:  [MN]
R:  But my children do like Star Search.  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah, that just came back on.
R:  Yeah, they really, really like Star Search.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  Do they vote on the -- on the Internet for 'em? 
R:  Oh, they do.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they get in and they vote and they like that.
L:  We did that the one day.
R:  Ah, I think that's considered reality since people are singing there and the people make the decision.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I'm trying to think of what other show but I just can't ...
L:  Well, there was that Big Brother.
R:  [MN] Oh, okay, yes, I remember that one.
L:  With all the cameras.
R:  Yeah, the -- the boy without the leg, he won one of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  There- there's a big thing on campus now with, ah, putting cameras downtown and they're all saying, "Oh, what's it going to turn into now?  Big Brother on campus?"  That they're gonna -- people are going to sit back and just watch us all walk around downtown, get in fights and all stuff like that.  [MN]
R:  They're gonna do that?
L:  Yeah, it's supposed to be for security but --
R:  Oh, my golly, no, no.
L:  Yeah, but -- but, I don't know if they're gonna have people watching 'em all the time or if somebody, um, has, like, gets beat up or something, they could watch the tapes then but they're saying, "Oh, now, Penn State's turning into a big reality show".
R:  Mhm, because they can see everything that's going on.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And when I was there it was fantastic.  I -- I mean, it was great.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- it was wonderful.  I haven't been there since nineteen eighty seven that I stopped over to see a friend but I keep in touch with a lot of professors --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- from there.  Some of them are still teaching.  Some of them are retired.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they wanted me to finish my masters but I never did.
L:  [MN]
R:  Bad person.
L:  [MN]
R:  Two classes left.
L:  [MN]
R:  I will some day when I'm old.
L:  Where -- where do you live now?
R:  I live in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, I was gonna say, you should come back.
R:  You live in State College and [MN] do they still have the, oh, the place they made the cinnamon rolls or whatever it's called that, that was really good, it was downtown.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I haven't been there yet.
R:  You ha- -- oh, it's good.  It's very, very good.  Yeah, but, and -- and the football games.  I miss that.  I lived at the dairy farm for -- for a while.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  My last two years, [MN] so I got to go the football games and -- for free, so that was very nice.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because we watched, we had to take care of the helicopters when they came with the cameras and everything and they gave us passes.
L:  Oh.  That's neat.
R:  But it was very nice.  [MN]  I don't know what else we can talk about reality shows.
L:  I know.
R:  I really don't care about them.
L:  [LAUGH]  Sometimes --
R:  These people making fool out of themselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- being on TV.
L:  I -- I -- another thing I just thought of.  I would be so embarrassed if I went on one, like, if my mom would find out, like, some of the things that I would do on the show.  You know?
R:  Oh, yes, that's [MN] --
L:  I mean, wh- -- did -- like, I'm sure, like, the -- the teens, like, that go on these shows, have families, like, on the Real World, like, they're just making out with everyone and hooking up with everyone, like.  I wouldn't want my parents to see that.
R:  Moms, moms, they really don't want to know who you're making out with.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's a wake up call in a lot of that they do not, they act differently --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they completely -- I was always the same so I was always obnoxious and loud so it wasn't a surprise for my parents when they went to my room.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And so the disaster because I always was like that and I -- most of my friends were males --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, my brother, that was a reality check --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when he went to college but, ah, I went and I don't regret what I did.  It was fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Almost failed that first year because I partied myself --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- too much.  But then after that --
