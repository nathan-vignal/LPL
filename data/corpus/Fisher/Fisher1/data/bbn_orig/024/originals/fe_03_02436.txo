R:  Hello? [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Oh, I'm doing just fine.  This is Steve.
R:  Hi, Steve.  Wow, that was a long list of things.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I wrote down three, cussing, alcohol and smoking.
R:  Oh, okay, you heard the cussing.  I didn't.  I did hear overeating, not exercising --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [MN] and drinking alcohol, smoking and I think [MN] gossiping, okay.
L:  Gossiping.
R:  I think ou- out of, ah, all of them, what did you say, cuss- cussing was the first one?  I don't know, I think the worst one is probably alcohol.
L:  Well, [MN] yeah, as far as social, ah, costs.  Yeah, alcohol is just amazing and then the smoking, um.  [MN]  We spend so much time and money and resources on those two that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, you know, if you think globally, yeah, that -- that would be it.  Personally --
R:  But, like, smoking -- smoking hurts your body.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like, drinking hurts your body and your soul.  Because, you know, you mess up your family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean, because a lot of people abuse it -- m- -- most people I know abuse alcohol.  They can't handle it.  They can't go out and have one drink.  They have to go out and have twenty.
L:  Why do you think's that?
R:  Huh?
L:  Why do you think they're doing that?
R:  Well, I think a lot of people have, um, I think a lot of people have issues and so they tend to bury 'em with alcohol.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they have issues from childhood or whatever [MN] and, um, it really makes me upset because more people die from DUIs than they do from lung cancer and [MN] [LAUGH], you know, [MN] and -- and innocent people die, you know from -- from -- from DUIs, children that I don- -- you know, and [MN] alcohol is a really sad thing to me.  [MN]  And they abu- -- a lot of people, when they drink they abuse their children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they abuse their wives or their husbands or whatever, you know, [MN] their entire family.
L:  [MN]  Do you think there should be prohibition again?
R:  [MN]  Um, n- -- I don't know, I mean, I know they would never be able to get away with it.  But in my personal opinion [MN] I think that, [MN] um, there should be done something done 'cause I could certainly live without alcohol.  [MN]  You know.
L:  Yeah, I -- I grew up w- [MN] i- -- in Iowa and when I turned eighteen eight- -- Iowa was an eighteen state so kids drank a lot in college [MN] and then now, of course, most states --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's twenty one and -- and, um, I just -- it -- it must make a world of difference because of, ah, all the, ah -- I know how we behaved at eighteen.  We weren't mature enough to handle it responsibly and we over- -- we always over drank.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was like the -- the object of, ah, of all the parties, you know, that was -- that was the reason to party.  [MN] 
R:  Of course.  Yeah, and smoking was never based around partying or anything.  It was just, like, a cool thing to do.  [MN] 
L:  Right.
R:  It is addictive and, yeah, it is bad for the people around you [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's more like a slow process [MN] than alcohol where it's, like, an immediate thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean to health it's not immediate but, um, if you're drunk and you're being a jerk [MN] then, you know, [MN] then it's pretty immediate.  [MN]  Then you immediately affect everyone around you.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  I -- I grew up with a lot of drunks [MN] and, um, my best friend just, ah, quit alcohol [MN] and, um, he did say that quitting smoking is harder than quitting drinking but, um, the drinking affected his life in a whole [MN] different -- it's a whole different ball game.  [COUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Do you think it's -- it's -- it's, ah different here than it is in other countries?
R:  You mean alcohol?  [MN] 
L:  Mm, abuse.
R:  Um, [MN] I don't know, I'm not really sure, but I know, like, um, [LIPSMACK] like, countries like Britain and stuff that are real close to us anyway, you know, it's pretty -- just as bad there that it is here.  Um, but, of course, places that, um, aren't quite like us [MN], um, I think that it's not so bad there, you know.  [MN]  I think it just all depends on what country you're referring to [MN] but, like, countries like, um, Australia and [MN], you know, and Britain and places like that, of course, you know, they're all just as bad.  [LAUGH]  In my opinion.  You know, I don't know, I've never lived there so I've never really seen it.
L:  Yeah, I've always had the sense that we all share pretty much the same problems there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as far as alcohol abuse and -- and perhaps it's not as bad in [MN] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- northern European countries like Finland and Sweden and [MN] -- of course, they say that alcohol is in -- worse in -- in Russia than anywhere.
R:  I can't imagine why with all that vodka.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I don't know what it's like in Greece and Italy and Spain, the s- -- the southern European countries, but, um --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [MN] we just, you know, it's -- it's -- it's s- -- so prevalent in -- in -- of course, now they don't have the TV ads like they used to [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, it's still, ah, the influence both from smoking and alcohol and even guns, [MN] all the stuff that we see in print ads and in advertisements it just makes it acceptable.
R:  Yeah, oh, definitely.  [MN]  But I think there's other things that are wrong.  But I mean, like, overeating and not exercising, [MN] yeah, it's bad for the long term, but, I mean, I guess if you really overeat and you were like five hundred pounds and couldn't get out your door, [MN] I guess that would affect, you know, your family life but for the normal American overeating is like going to McDonald's twice a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's not like where they're five hundred pounds and can't move.  [MN]  It's just that they're, [MN] you know, thirty or forty pounds overweight and, in my opinion, that's not really -- I think we [MN] -- we expect too much out of ourselves sometimes and I think we put, um, labels on people and, [MN] you know, not everybody's meant to be Barbie dolls and Kens, you know.  If we were we -- it would be a very boring world.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  If everyone walked around and everyone was skinny and fit [MN] it would just be a very boring place.  So, the overeating and not exercising, I think, you know, 'cause I actually hate to exercise, like on purpose.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd rather go out and go hiking or go swimming just for -- just for fun, you know, and that is technically exercise because I'm doing something but [MN] I'm not going to just go out and exercise on purpose.  Like, I can't go into a gym.  I get bored really fast.  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  Well, I -- I go to the gym a couple of times a week and I'd rather not.  I mean, I went to Tomasco[?] Canyon for a hike last weekend and I'd prefer to do that.  That's -- that's a lot more fun and it's just as good a workout, um, but [MN] I guess to -- to best organize my time or manage my time I've -- I've fallen into that -- that rut of, ah, going to the gym but [MN] you gotta be active in other ways too, I think, so ...
R:  Right, well, I ride my bike, um, but I normally ride it to places around town ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just for exercise.  And, um, but I don't mind riding my bike around town because I'm actually accomplishing something.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, I'm going to the post office, I'm going to the grocery store.  I'm not just going on my bike just to ride for exercise.  Like, that would be very boring.  [MN]  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so [MN] I don't know, for the most part as far as exercise and stuff goes it's, like, you know, if, like, if you can fit it in now in the -- in the winter [MN], you know, I -- it's like the most exercise I get I guess is shoveling snow [MN] so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Maryland.  [MN]  I just feel like this winter I did nothing but shovel snow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's always heavy wet snow in Maryland.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I -- I live in Los Angeles, so, ah, and I grew up in Iowa, so I -- I -- I -- I -- certainly did shovel a lot of snow and, ah, I don't miss it at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I certain-  -- I certainly didn't mind it at all actually [MN] but it was a lot, so, um, [LIPSMACK], um, you know, for the most part [MN] -- and what else did they say?  Gossip?
L:  Gossiping and cussing.
R:  Well, I don't really see how cussing could be -- I mean, it's just a word.  [LAUGH]  You know, and I don't really see it as a bad thing.  It's like, okay, whatever.  [MN] 
L:  Do you think it's a reflection on someone's education?
R:  I don't think so.  I know really smart people, really intelligent people that have been through all kinds of education that cuss.
L:  And wha- what makes 'em cuss?  Are they frustrated or are they [MN] -- I know that when I've cussed it's when I'm angry and I just can't think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- logically and calmly and put my thoughts down concisely and I --
R:  Um.
L:  -- just choose the easiest thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I think sometimes, [MN] um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's partly frustration and sometimes they're just using it as an expression, you know.  [MN]  Um, it's like, [COUGH] like, have you ever heard someone, like, talking about a bad situation [MN] and, um, you know, they're talking about a bad situation and they'll be, like, "I can't believe that, that's an arsehole", you know, or something like that and it's just their way of -- of telling you how bad this person was to them.  [MN]  It's sort of like an expression sometimes. [MN]  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, I guess they could use deeper words but at that point they were just trying to express themselves, [MN] you know, so, I think -- I think when I -- when I, you know, listen that when people cuss I don't really -- I don't really think twice about it.  Now, if I hear some kid walking around just saying a cuss every three seconds I start thinking.  I'm, like, "What?"  [LAUGH]  You know, but if he -- if he falls off his bike and says, "Shit", I'm not going to, um --
