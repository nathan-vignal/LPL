R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [MN] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN] Go ahead.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm -- I'm Michelle.
R:  Ah, I'm Tammy.
L:  Hi, Tammy.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Um, Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, I'm in Virginia. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, this is a tricky thing, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  So, w- -- [MN]
R:  I don't watch reality TV shows.
L:  You know what, um, I watch 'em occasionally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but recently I've gotten really put off by them.  Like, I think when they first came out I was kind of intrigued, like, wait, w- what kind of people would want to eat bugs and stuff and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how much money are they giving them to do this?  You know, it's like curiosity.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And then I kind of realized, I watched it, and it was just disgusting and I thought, "You couldn't get me to do that" you know, I would never do that for fifty thousand dollars or whatever it was.  It was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sickening. [LAUGH] 
R:  I think they just took that people will do anything for money --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- to the extreme.
L:  Yeah, and kind of ran with it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda, [MN] I don't know, I guess it -- you know, it definitely p- preys on -- on people's, like, you know, like, financial insecurities or something.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I -- I think it's, um, a pretty sad commentary on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on our country. [LAUGH] 
L:  I do too, actually, although I -- I -- I do have to say that, like, some of the other, like, um, the Osbournes --
R:  Ahah.
L:  That one I really enjoy.
R:  Yeah, I -- I gotta say I'm a closet Osbourne watcher.
L:  Because it's just, you know, it's -- it's just funny.  It's like, um, [MN] I guess it's kind of relieving just to see, you know, people just living --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just being people and, you know, that everybody's pets shit on the floor and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, all that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And those ones I enjoy.
R:  And -- and even though you have money you still have your problems.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, and I -- I -- I don't know, I think TV just kind of glamorizes everything but, you know, it's like when he's walking behind the dog cussing because he has to +pick -- pick up the poop or --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- the dog throws up on the floor or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's kinda ... [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Ah, have you ever seen that Anna Nicole one?
R:  Oh, I watched that once and I just thought, "How pathetic".
L:  I felt so -- I mean, I really felt, like, sad for her.
R:  Ahah.  I did too.  
L:  I really felt like, okay, they're really exploiting someone who is, like, you know, obviously in a very not good place in her life --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and obviously needs help.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's on drugs or something.  I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to me, it was, she was --
R:  And she's got all that money and look what she does with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] lost her mind.
L:  Very lonely, very sad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- woman.  [MN]  But I also -- I mean, I thought -- I really thought she was on drugs or something, it --
R:  Something.
L:  -- was like she was either drunk or --
R:  She always looks like she's half stoned.
L:  Yeah, she does.
R:  And she talks all, "argh, argh".
L:  Yeah, like, slurring and --
R:  Yeah, like, she's all high.
L:  -- I mean, I've seen ones where she's, like, [MN] even just her, you know, ah, her physical, you know the way she moves, she --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plops down or [MN], you know, just -- or does, like, real inappropriate kinda things.  It's like, "Oh, my God, why would anyone do that?"
R:  On TV even.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, if they weren't like, really drunk or [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  [MN]
L:  -- something.  And then to know you're being filmed.
R:  Well, she's doing it for the money, you know, she's doing it for money too.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  'Cause she can't be doing too much modeling looking like she's looking lately.
L:  Yeah, she's -- she's gotten pretty large.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I --
R:  Kinda blown up a little bit there.
L:  Yeah, [MN] which, you know, I don't think is a terrible thing.  I actually saw -- last night I saw something on television which I thought was pretty cool and it was, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know what show it was. I think it was one of those, like, forty eight minutes or  --
R:  Forty eight hours --
L:  Twenty minutes.
R:  -- or something like that.
L:  One of those, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sixty Minutes, Twenty Minutes, whatever they are.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, and it had Jamie Lee Curtis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And she had gone to More Magazine which is like a major fashion type magazine [MN] and gone to the editors and said that she would like -- she approached them, it was her idea, and she would -- wanted them to kind of smash the illusion [MN] and she -- they photographed her in her underwear with no makeup and absolutely no touch ups to the photos.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I hadn't -- I'd never seen the photos before last night and they were on TV and it was, like, [MN] I mean, I just really thought, I felt like a whole new level of respect for her because she really had guts.  I mean, [MN] you know, and she talked about, you know, that she -- what she went through for a few years when her body changed and [MN] not having that perfect twenty four year old body any more [MN] and just -- but accepting and being happy with her body as she was.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and it's like when you look at the picture i- it was just, it was real but she was so happy.  She was, like, grinning ear to ear --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's chubby and [MN], you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and everything's fallen and she's just -- no make up, wrinkled, just blazing, everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right there [MN] and, um, you know, but she really wanted to, like, pro- -- make a point, you know --
R:  That there's nothing wrong with it because that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's what happens to you as you get older.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Right, and, you know, they even, all these reality TV shows, [MN] I mean, they pick these people that are, like, I don't know, they must be on some kind of anorexic eating program --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or working out obsessively or [MN] -- or they're just at that age where they're at their peak.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're a- -- they're looking the best they're ever gonna look in their lives, [MN] you know, and it gives the impression that most people look like that.
R:  Right.
L:  It's such bullshit.
R:  And it's not really true.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  'Cause I know I don't.
L:  Yeah, neither do --
R:  Even at my marvellousest I didn't, you know, when I was -- I used to be, when I was in the army --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was always -- they were always telling me I was overweight and my body fat was just like nothing [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I'm just big, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm six feet tall and [MN] there's no way I was gonna weigh a hundred and fifty pounds.  It just wasn't going to happen.
L:  Right.
R:  And be healthy.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I'm not -- I'm not diet girl.  I'm not run and exercise girl.  That is not me.
L:  Yeah, me either.
R:  But, ah, you know, I do a little, you know, a little bit here and there and I watch what I eat but I -- I'm -- as long as I'm healthy [MN] and -- I'm not going to diet.  I'm just not going to do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm gonna eat ice cream.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm gonna eat pasta.  I'm gonna eat potatoes.  I'm --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- gonna eat it 'cause that's what I like.  And if I ha- --
L:  I'm the same way.
R:  Yeah, if I have a healthy balance and I eat, you know, a proper nutritious diet, I'm not going through all that.  Either take me like I am or [MN] see ya.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's probably why I'm by myself now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't kn- kn- -- I -- I think that if, like, these reality shows, if they would really make them reality --
R:  Yeah, if it was everybody's reality.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, show -- yeah, the r- real reality 'cause they say it's reality but it's not.
R:  It's not.  It's faked.
L:  They're still showing, you know, these twenty two year old perfect California girls, you know.
R:  But you gotta figure they're probably the only ones, those young ones are the only ones they're gonna find that are gonna eat bugs and all that stuff 'cause [MN] I know I couldn't do it. 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I don't care how much money they're giving away. 
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  I -- I don't think I could do that.
L:  I know it.
R:  And it's just like, um, I think, they kinda just cross the line and you kinda lose your dignity and, [MN] I mean, who -- I -- I don't like watching other people's misfortune.  It just doesn't do anything for me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, it just doesn't do anything for me.
L:  [MN] Oh, and then all those -- all those, like, court shows.  Oh, God, those irritate me --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so badly.
R:  Yeah.  There's -- there's -- there's so many things I don't watch.  I've gotten into, um, [MN] reruns of Charmed [LAUGH].
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, um, like, there's just, I have all these channels and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's only about ten of them that I actually look at with any kind of frequency.  I don't even look at regular TV any more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because --
L:  Yeah, we hardly do.
R:  -- it's just ludicrous.  I don't -- I don't --
L:  It's horrible.
R:  --watch the local news.  I don't even watch the news any more.  I just -- I might watch CNN w- -- I watch it in the -- at night before I go to sleep.
L:  That's what we watch.  Yeah, we'll --
R:  And --
L:  -- we'll watch CNN or the Fox news.  When the war was going on we watched the Fox news.
R:  [MN] Well, they just got on my nerves.
L:  Yeah, after a while it got pretty --
R:  Yeah, it was like, give me a break.
L:  -- they were just really stretching for a [MN] story.
R:  Yeah, they were really stretching for something to say and they were just getting and ragging on people -- anybody who didn't have the same opinion as they would have.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Just, like, "Oh, you're just foul.  You- you're just un American.  It's like, "No, I'm not un American, I just don't agree with you".  
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  They -- they were just kinda getting ludicrous, so [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I knew, when this started happening, I didn't have the Fox news channel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- program, I didn't watch it so, but when the war started I said, "Well let me watch Fox news" [LIPSMACK] and then as I was watching them I kinda went back to watchin-
