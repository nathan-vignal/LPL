R:  Hi, my name is Anita Lamber.
L:  Hi, my name is Bergita Rascala
R:  And I did not hear too well what she said about the topic. --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I thought I heard two different topics.
L:  Yeah, she went kind of fast.  I heard, um, the first time the topic was personal habits.
R:  Right.
L:  And then she gave a list of choices of people's personal habits and asked which one we felt was the worst, I believe.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they were um, smoking, um, drinking alcohol, drinking caffeine excess- excessively, um, over eating and not exercising, I think.
R:  I think that's -- yeah, your right.  She did go very fast. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.  There were a lot of them.  It would have been nice to have two or three maybe of those choices.
R:  I think so.  I think you're right, also, because you need more than ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, did you want to go first?
L:  Um, sure, um, well, I guess um, out of the habits listed, I would say that um, smoking would be my ah, least favorite habit of people.  But um, it's kind of ironic because I used to smoke --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and so [LAUGH] I think um, I'm a little, ah, even more biased towards that as -- as a horrible habit.  Do you smoke?
R:  No, I don't, so, but ah, you spoke exactly as if it were I speaking [LAUGH] because I did at one time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But that would be my number one, really, um, bad habit I would say.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I um, it just bothers me when I see people smoking, especially in front of kids.
R:  Yes, you're right.
L:  Ah, holding babies, things like that and it's kind of annoying to have people smoking by you when you're at a restaurant or, you know, trying to sit down somewhere.  But, you know, I used to be one of those people that did that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I was that way too at one time, but thank god we're not any more, right?
L:  Right.  How long have you been a non smoker?
R:  Twelve years.
L:  Twelve years, that's great.  I've been about four years.
R:  Well, you wouldn't want to any more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you ever get the urge, do something.  Take a piece of gum --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or a piece of candy or whatever, because every now and then I'll dream that I'm smoking --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I've done that too.
R:  -- and I wake up shaking. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've -- I've dreamt that I've smoked and then I wake up and I have to really think about it sometimes.  Did I -- did I smoke or -- [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  You wonder if you did do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm really, so, ah, set against it because my step father died from cancer --
L:  -- from cancer.
R:  -- the throat and -- and the lungs and all kinds of stuff like that, you know, it was just horrible.  It just went all through him.  And to see such a good looking, tall, handsome man, go down to a waste of -- I don't even think he was eighty five pounds.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yes, it was a horror.
L:  And he was a smoker?
R:  Yes, he was a smoker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, a couple of packs a day, but the worst part of it is, is that the truth of the matter is, it is addicting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people don't realize that and the companies did it on purpose.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  And that's why I don't understand why the United States is still allowing these companies to be in business today.
L:  Mhm.  I know.  And ah --
R:  They have proof --
L:  Right.
R:  They made a movie of it, too.
L:  Right, um, yeah that one um, I saw it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the guy who um, who worked for the company and then he um, went to the public and told them about it and then they were -- 
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- he was in danger himself.
R:  That's right.  I forget the name or the man who even played it.
L:  I know.  Ah, Russell Crowe, I think it was.
R:  Oh, it was?
L:  I think it was Russell Crowe.
R:  Oh wow, way back in the days when I didn't know who he was. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Before Gladiator. [LAUGH] But --
L:  I think -- yeah, I think, um, I'm a teacher too, I teach sixth grade.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, we do the -- I teach the respiratory system and so we do the whole -- I get this kit from the American Cancer Society and it gives all this information about how harmful smoking is and --
R:  It really is.
L:  -- you know, all the chemicals that are in cigarettes and it talks about -- so I -- I talk to the kids about how these companies, you know, all they want is your money and how they try to target young kids too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to get them addicted, and you know, at this age they all agree with you and they all, yeah, smoking's horrible, it's bad and -- and I'm never going to become a smoker, but then, I think I used to say that too when I was a little kid. [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- you know, I don't know if I ever did, because my mother and father both smoked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it was like, a natural thing to do, and in those days, you just didn't hear about it being cancerous --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you didn't hear about it being harmful.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I believe I'm much older than you are, ah, I'm in my sixties --
L:  Okay, yeah.  I'm only twenty eight.
R:  Oh, yeah, there you go.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so when, you know, you heard about it.
L:  Right, yeah.  I remember -- my dad's a smoker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he smokes a pipe, and I remember, you know, I knew that it was bad, what he was doing because I learned it in school.  And you know, I used to give him a hard time and my sister and I once found all his pipes and threw them away and, you know, [LAUGH] we used to always rag on him for smoking and say that we would never smoke, but she's four years younger than me and she -- she started smoking too. [LAUGH] She's -- she's still a smoker.
R:  Oh, I know.  Oh, she still is?
L:  She still is.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right now she's still smoking.  She's um, -- she's sort of um, you know it's hard to quit, because you start doing these things and they're, like, she just moved this year to Boston from Chicago --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- she started law school at Harvard, and so she's in this period of her life where she's under a lot of stress and you know, that wouldn't have been a good time for her to quit because you can't quit when you're under a lot of stress.
R:  No.  It is difficult.
L:  Yeah.  So there's all these things going on in her life that keep preventing her from really being ready to quit.
R:  But she can.
L:  Yeah, she can.
R:  It's really -- it's really an excuse that we use with ourselves.  When my stepfather wa- had his surgery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I had been off cigarettes about a year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and while he was in surgery I was in the waiting room smoking --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I went back to smoking, after he's having cancer surgery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Isn't that awful?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Worst part --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he came out of the surgery and got home, he smoked again.
L:  He wanted a cigarette, yeah.
R:  He did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He went right back to smoking.
L:  I know.
R:  He knew he was going to die and so at that point, you know, he just didn't care, but he lived --
L:  He just --
R:  -- through three years.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  With that horrible.  But I'm just, um, I think the American people, in some ways, are very stupid. [LAUGH] Sorry to say that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we'll gang up together and -- and get to the President, or whoever it is we have to get to, about these companies being allowed to produce cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they say that they don't um, spike the cigarettes, but they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if they do any more, but they did.
L:  Mhm.  Well, nicotine is an addictive drug.
R:  Yes, but they were also putting something else in it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you remember from the movie.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were putting addictive substances in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which was so bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that to me seems worse.  I think my second next thing would probably be alcohol.
L:  Really.
R:  Mm, being a bad habit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause that a- affects a lot of other lives too.
L:  Mhm.  I think, yeah, excessive drinking and -- and driving --
R:  Mhm.  Excessive, right.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Especially driving.
R:  So where are you calling -- where are you located?
L:  I'm in Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Are you -- are you on the East Coast?
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  You're in Florida.
R:  Fort Lauderdale.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yes.
L:  For some reason you sounded East Coast.
R:  Well, I originally was from New Jersey.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, twenty five years ago I moved to Florida, but I still can't get rid of the accent.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Those East Coast accents, they never go away.
R:  That East Coast accent [LAUGH] is so strong.
L:  Yeah, I have an aunt that lives in ah, New York City --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, yeah, she's got a pretty Manhattany accent.
R:  Then you can tell, and I was right across the river from Manhattan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we have that um, accent.  It carries right over. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  So, do I have the mid Western accent?
R:  No.  You sound to me like, just like everybody else does down here.
L:  Really?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  And there are a lot of people from Michigan in Florida.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's a lot of snowbirds that come back and forth --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a lot of people migrated.
L:  Yeah.  It's get-
R:  Mhm.  Like now, we have a terrible, terrible day.
L:  Why's that?
R:  It's raining something terrible.
L:  Yeah.  It's been pretty dreary here too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's the temperature?
R:  I would say right now, it might be around seventy --
