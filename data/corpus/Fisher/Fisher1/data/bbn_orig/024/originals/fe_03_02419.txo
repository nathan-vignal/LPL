R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I am Brian.
L:  I am Eli.
R:  Eli.
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow -- 
L:  He's in the Bible, Eli is.
R:  Oh, Eli.  I see.
L:  E.L.I.  Where are you?
R:  I am in Los Angeles.
L:  My goodness.  I'm in Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Outstanding.
L:  Boy.  Of -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- course, I'm originally from Montreal -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- so, ah, I w- I came down here about fifty years ago.  Y'all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They think I'm from New Jersey.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I've been to every state in the union.
R:  Very good.  Very good.  I've been in, ah, almost all of them myself.
L:  Yes.  So, what are we supposed to be talking about?
R:  Well, we're supposed to be talking about personal habits.  Which is worse, ah, ex- excessive drinking, smoking, overeating or a lack of exercise?
L:  Well, they're all bad actually.
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  What is the worse?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I suppose drinking because not only does it hurt you but you can kill other people, you know, if you drive and drink.
R:  That is true.  That is true.  Ah, that would be a sh- a -- a -- a kind of a habit that could give you a short term injury -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- very quickly.
L:  You know, and then it could affect your family, you know, if you become alcoholic.  Of course -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that depends a lot on your genes, I suppose, from what I've read.  But, overeating is bad and, ah, all these other -- smoking will kill you -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and if you smoke in the house it will, ah, hurt people around you.
R:  Hurt other people around you and even -- even hurt your own furniture.
L:  Oh, yeah, it hurts everything.  I mean, I tell you it's, ah, I've seen -- years' ago I used to sing professionally and I worked nightclubs and the lights were on me.  You know, when -- when you're on -- on the stage.  And you couldn't see out there because it was just like a bad cloud and it was just unbelievable.  Of course, on this days, they didn't know that it was gonna kill you.
R:  Yeah, and everybody was doing it.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, I mean, it was the normal thing.  And, ah, a Mickey Mantle was in a ads for Camels and doctors were in ads for cigarettes -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it peps you up, you know, of course.  The, ah, tobacco companies kept the information away from people.  They didn't say anything, you know, and then they started putting more nicotine in so it'll become habit forming.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, it -- it -- it -- it's amazing, of course.  Ah, what did you do in business or whatever your career?
R:  Um, actually I am an inventory.
L:  Oh, that's great.  So, have you done much with it?
R:  Well, I'm trying to organize a company right now for something that's supposed to -- supposed to come out and change the world.  But, you know, who -- who's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- invention doesn't change the world.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Of course, you've got to patent it and, you know, protect yourself on your invention.
R:  Exactly.  There's -- there's, ah, a lot of hoops to jump through.  But, you know, it's, ah, a one day at a time really.
L:  Do they have many or any patent attorneys over there?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, this is Los Angeles.  You've got -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, the -- the worst thing you can do is just reach out and grab one.
L:  Oh, yeah, because in New York I know that, ah, they have quite a few --  
R:  Yeah --  
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- yeah.
L:  And then -- 
R:  So, you have to be careful who you're going to trust.
L:  Oh, yeah, but you -- the best thing to do when you go, of course, ah, to do something like that -- they tell -- tell me that you can take your invention and put it on paper and everything and then mail it yourself and don't -- don't open the envelope, that's the first thing -- 
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- is that 
R:  -- say that.  But, actually, ah, that's not -- that's not accurate.
L:  It's not per- a- full proof.  But, you have to get an attorney that you trust to work with you with the patent attorneys.
R:  Yes, exactly -- 
L:  Be- because the --
R:  -- exactly.
L:  -- heaven knows what they'll do --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know?
R:  Well, ah, to go back to our topic for a second here.  I think that -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ah, personally excessive eating is a problem that is not advertised very much.
L:  No, but it's, ah, when I read the papers it shows that most, ah, we've got more obesity in this country than nearly anywhere.
R:  That is -- that's exactly right.  Yes.  And -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that's bad because we're a very, very hard working nation but, at the same time, ah, I think there's a lot of lazy people out there.
L:  Also, the doctors a- I mean, there's so much out there.  Like, my doctor says, "You should cut down on red meat" and, ah, w- I eat a lot of, ah, fresh fruits and vegetables and salads -- 
R:  Very good.
L:  -- and I eat a lot of, ah, fresh salmon and, ah, sardines and tuna fish.  In the morning I have oatmeal -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and skim milk and, ah, you know, so I eat very little meat and a -- and a -- on occasion I eat, ah, some chicken -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, and, ah, not much in sugar.  But, Atkins diet is opposite of what -- you know he says you can eat as much meat as you want.  You can eat bacon and everything and you loose weight and it won't give you cholesterol.
R:  In exchange for what?  Exercising every day?
L:  Well, you've got to exercise too.  Some.  Like, I walk about two miles a day.
R:  Wow.
L:  A indoor track.  They have a Jewish community centre right near here where, ah, you can walk indoors because outdoors in stupid.  I s- see some of these people walking down -- running down the street and the exhaust from, ah, cars, you know, as you run or walk fast -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you're breathing deeply.  And -- 
R:  And that gets you -- right into your system that much better.
L:  That's right and they're -- they're, ah -- it's a most amazing.  And then they're inhaling all this gas exhaust -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, people do that, you know?  People don't, ah -- and like I say, doctors -- the Atkins[?] diet is opposite what my doctor tells me to do and I've got a cholesterol problem so I take two -- I take Wellcoll[?] and, ah, Lipid[?].  I took, ah, like Allipidtar[?] or -- or Zohar[?] Staten[?].  But, ah, one of the side effects for that is that you can -- it hurts your muscles, especially in your legs.  And I started getting pain.  He said, "Off of that".  So, I can't take Astatine[?].  It's called Astatine or Staten.  And, ah, so, I'm taking Wellcoll which doesn't even go through the liver.  It doesn't -- you know, it's -- it's a little safer.  Of course none -- none of these medicines are real safe, you know, but they all -- all have some side effects.  So -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I get my cholesterol checked twice a year and see what's happening -- 
R:  Well, are you -- 
L:  But, like you -- 
R:  -- ah -- do you -- do you consider yourself to be in shape?
L:  Well, I am -- ah, I'm seventy two, and --
R:  Well, you sound pretty active.
L:  -- and I walk two miles a day.  I eat properly.  I don't smoke.  I don't drink.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm fairly good shape, you know, for my age.  I'm -- I'm really in good shape, I think.
R:  And what do you do with your time?
L:  Well, I retired from, ah, I was a -- a retail promotional consultant for about twelve years and I travelled, ah -- every state in the union.  I've been up to, ah -- well, the last time I was in California I was in Leesburg[?].  Ever hear of that?
R: Mm, no.  Is it a large place?
L:  No.  It's a little town and it's about sixty miles from the, ah, ah, San Fernando Valley, I suppose.  On this side of LA.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  [MN] Sherman[?] Oaks[?]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, ah -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  And I used to, ah -- when I went out of town I carried a little, ah, ah, coolerator[?] it's called, where you can put -- to keep the food cool for quite a few days.  It's not a refrigerator -- a coolerator.  And then I would, ah, eat mostly in the room.  You know, I'd buy soya milk or skim milk which I use if -- I -- I use skim milk.  I eat yogurt.  So, I do the best I can.  I take multi vitamins, you know, all the vitamins -- multi vitamin, vitamin E and, ah, a CQ-Ten and various ones.  Ah, years ago when I sang professionally I had a Italian kid in my group and he was a health nut.  This is -- we're talking about forty, fifty years ago. 
R:  Right.
L:  And at that time Gaylord[?] Houser[?] was the big macher[?], like, you know, in health foods and stuff.  But, this guy -- our band was the cleanest band anywhere.  We didn't smoke.  We didn't drink.  Ah, we ate yogurt before it was sold in the stores.  He -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he had a farmer who had Bulgarian culture and they made yogurt out of it.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, ah, he would supply us with yogurt and a few people -- whoever he sold it to.  But, ah, you know, and, ah, I -- a- a- I, ah, learned from him about dental floss and, you know, and he was a weight lifter which I didn't do.  But, ah, all around us we had musicians in the big band, ah, in the club band that were shooting up heroin -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, ah, they were rarely taking, ah -- cocaine wasn't big.  But, heroin was big and, ah, marijuana which was.  And I saw them over the years.  They just lost everything, you know?  They -- 
R:  Really?
L:  -- lost their work and they -- you know and, ah, and they -- th- but, their weight wasn't high.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, weight is a dangerous, ah -- this country, I mean, you see it in the paper all the time about how obese people are.  And, ah, it's -- in fact I was watching The View.  You ever watch The View?
R:  I think I've seen it before --
