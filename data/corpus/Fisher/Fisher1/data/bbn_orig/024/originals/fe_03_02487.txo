L:  My name's Julie.
R:  Hi, Julie, my name is Bill.  How are you today?
L:  I'm doing good.  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Good.  So -- so what's your take on the reality programs?
L:  Um, for the most part, I pretty much enjoy 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yeah, well, most of 'em.  There's some that are pretty bad, but I'm pretty, uh, addicted to, like, American Idol and Big Brother and, uh, shows like that.  I don't watch 'em all, just a few of 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  I can't handle it.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, I think they all have gotten a little bit out of hand, with too many of 'em, but the ones that first started it, you know, within the, l- like, they've gone on four or five years, are the ones I pretty much stick to. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  Yeah, I -- I tried to watch the Survivor and it looks pretty okay, and it seems that could be exciting, but it seems so -- so strange to me, I mean, to be -- to be taken out to an island or somewhere and having to do some of the stuff that they have to do.
L:  Yeah.  Survivor's one of the ones I don't watch.  I don't like that one, I could never get into that one, uh, I always thought it was kind of ridiculous and stupid.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, but I do -- for some reason I did like Big Brother, I don't know if you know which one that one is, where they stick 'em in the house. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's even weirder.  Road Rules was the one I sorta used to watch a little bit of before, that was pretty cool.
L:  Yeah, I've watched that one.
R:  Where they had those challenges to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, the -- the -- I don't know if it's a reality show, but the one, I think it's on NBC, the one where they -- they have to do -- perform these acts, like ride a bicycle across a -- a -- a be- -- a beam between two buildings --
L:  Fear Factor?
R:  -- and -- yeah, Fear Factor, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, that --
L:  Yeah, I watch that one too. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that one I sort of slip in and out of, uh, I can't handle the bug eating thing.  But, I don't know, I mean, if I had to eat bugs, I think I could eat bugs, but watching somebody sit there and put their head in a -- in a vat of bugs seems very peculiar to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, usually whenever they gotta eat something, that's when I kinda turn my head.  I usually don't like that part. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, ho- --
L:  I can handle the extreme stunts, but [LAUGH] --
R:  What -- what about the one where you put the head -- your head in with the worms or something that they have?  I don't know if you've ever seen --
L:  I don't think I could do that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's so- --
L:  When it comes to the bug part, nah. [LAUGH]
R:  The Survivor, I sort of admire those people.  I kinda like those d- -- [MN] I -- I -- it's not really a reality show, um, but it's the one where they do that two hundred mile challenge, where they have teams of people that, like, go down to Chile or South America or something and they --
L:  Oh, the Eco Challenge?
R:  Eco Challenge, yeah.
L:  Yeah, they got the new one getting ready to come on for Fiji. [LAUGH]
R:  Fiji?  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, Fiji.  That's supposed to be starting, like, next week or something.
R:  Oh really?
L:  A- --
R:  So -- so you really watch a lot of these shows then, huh?
L:  Well, I don't watch that one.  I just watch a lot of TV and see the commercials. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  Uh, I like to veg out in front of the TV when I get off a work. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, Am- American Idol looks pretty good.  I've only seen clips of it, 'cause I -- I'm, uh, hooked on a couple of other shows when those are on.  But that -- they're -- they're -- I -- I saw this kid that did, um, Elvis the other night.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Did you see him?
L:  Nah, I don't think I saw the Elvis one.
R:  He's a kid about --
L:  Was that one on --
R:  -- eight or nine years old and he w- -- he -- he was dressed up like Elvis, not in a shiny suit, but I think he had a leather jacket on with the collar --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- turned up, and he was singing a couple of Elvi- -- he sang a Elvis song.
L:  That one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that one's, uh, the American kid one.
R:  Is that Am- --
L:  'Cause they have two, they have one that's, like, America's most talented kid and then they have American Idol, which is the adults --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- like the teenagers and adults and then the other one is kids.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that one sounds like that was the kid one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, the--
R:  Yeah, I've only -- go ahead.
L:  I was going to say the one, ah, show that I am not interested in at all is the one that's hosted by Monica Lewinsky, the Mr. Personality, that one looks really stupid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, hey, yeah, that's really strange, where they have the mask, oh, serious, man.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Did --
L:  It looks like some sort of demented wrestling thing going on. [LAUGH]
R:  What kind of woman would want to, you know, act that way?
L:  No, I -- I couldn't do that.  I'd need to see 'em.  I mean, looks don't -- aren't everything, but I gotta see the person so, you know, I couldn't just go through three months, you know, trying to date somebody without even seeing 'em.
R:  Is that how long it is, three months?
L:  I think so, I think they last twelve weeks is what they do.  It's either --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- six or twelve weeks, I'm not sure exactly.  But it's such a short period of time, and they're trying to say you're going learn their personality that quickly, I -- I just can't see that happening, how people can get married off a these shows. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hey, yeah.  That -- did that woman get married, the one that was on Channel -- on Fox?  That -- that --  
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- uh, Ma- Married in America or something?
L:  I -- I don't know, I didn't keep up with that one.
R:  Yeah.  I saw th- --
L:  So, I don't know -- I don't know what happened with that one.
R:  I saw the headline for that and I couldn't believe it.  I go, "God, wouldn't -- i- -- would [MN] wouldn't it be more fun to choose and make your own mistakes?"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And --
R:  I don't know, you know, Married by America, let somebody else choose your -- the person that's there for you, huh?  Hm.
L:  That just doesn't --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I d- -- I'm not much of a reality program show -- I tho- -- I think I'll get into it, but right now, not really.
L:  I -- I think one of the biggest reasons why I watch 'em is because it's all that's on.  There's so many of them they -- that they monopolize the -- the time, and that you can't get any more regular sitcoms going.  'Cause I really would rather prefer watching sitcoms like Friends.  I'm really into watching Friends, but they just don't bring any new ones out any more, they just keep bringing more reality, and you -- that's why I get so into 'em, because that's all that's on. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's what -- that's what they say, they interviewed a fellow yesterday and -- and he -- he was a contestant on one of the shows, one of the reality shows, and he said that's the whole new market.  But I got this cable package and I get a whole bunch of other channels, like I get, um, um, I -- I get -- I get these movies, I get about five or six, it's called Stars.  I get these --
L:  Yeah, that's what I get, I have that here.  What state are you in?
R:  California.
L:  Oh, you're in California and you get that?  I didn't know that.
R:  You're d- --
L:  I'm in Louisiana. [LAUGH]
R:  Louisiana?  Oh, down south --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I figured.
L:  Yeah, we get -- I have the Stars package too, but, uh, most of the good movies, they come on, I've seen 'em a hundred times. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I like -- the one I've been hooked on lately is the one with, uh, Robert Redford in Spy.  It's --
L:  What --
R:  -- it [MN] the spy program where he -- he, uh, he and somebody else are, uh, he -- he's the, um, sort of, the, uh, man that manipulates this, uh, spy and he has him doing all kind of different things.  It's a real --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't think I've seen that one.
R:  Yeah, it's really good.  It's -- it's one of his -- Red- -- Redford's latest ones.  And -- and it's done -- he's sort of in -- in -- in his last days a- at the CIA or the D- DOD, Department of Defense or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and this -- this guy he used to work with a few years back, um, w- -- or tried to, uh, rescue his -- this woman he fell in love with and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's in prison.  So --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- it -- I -- I get that and then I get these other channels, like, um, I get Bob Newhart and I got, um, the, um, those -- these other channels where you get some ESPN Two --
L:  Yeah, we have that.
R:  -- and -- and -- and you get some of these history channels and couple of other channels.  There's a really great science channel, just a really great -- so when some of this other stuff is on, I just peruse through those or cruise those channels.
L:  Yeah.  I- -- um, usually, when football season comes around, I'm usually watching football, so then, uh, all the reality kind of goes out the door. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what -- what do you think of this Arena football. [LAUGH] That's not our topic. [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's kind of a reality show, isn't it?
L:  I guess so.
R:  It's an old real- -- that's an old reality show.  But now I --
L:  I -- I've never -- I've never watched the Arena football, but, uh, except a few times, so I -- I don't have a real big take on it yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  I know we're supposed to be getting an Arena team down here in New Orleans, uh, within the next year, so maybe I'll get a little more into it once we get a team. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's a much smaller field and it's played inside the stadium.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I do like i- -- I liked that, um, Survivor program for the different places where they've been at, the -- the different --
L:  Yeah, that would be interesting to do. [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and -- and --
L:  If you could go someplace.
R:  And it seems so strange, it's, like, there's these people out there that hold back reality and then they feed these people who win and there's this whole shaping of -- I used to -- I studied some psychology and they -- they try and shape people's behaviour and -- and stuff, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's -- it's, um, [LIPSMACK] it's kind of cool, the settings and stuff, but some of the -- the backstabbing and all that other stuff that goes on, it's a little bizarre for me.
L:  Yeah, all just for money and they tell you -- do all these things, and the worst part is they're doing it in front of millions of people, they're showing them their bad side and then that's what people remember 'em for, is the backstabbing, you know, person that screwed some other person just so they could get money.  And I wouldn't want to be known to be that person for the rest of my life, walking down the street, say, "Hey
