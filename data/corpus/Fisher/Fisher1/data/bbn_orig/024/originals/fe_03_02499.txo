R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Pauline.
R:  Hi, my name is Leva.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, I'm Pauline.
R:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You too, Leva.
R:  So, do you wanna start?
L:  Okay.  This is reality TV.  Boy.  I don't watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reality TV.  [LAUGH]  I don't think I've watched reality TV in a long time.
R:  Oh.  That's probably the smart way to do things.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My -- my husband watches the history channel most of the time and I just sit there and watch that with him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do -- do you watch re- reality TV at all?
R:  I can't say I watch it.  I can say that when there's nothing on -- else on I have it on.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I'm ve- -- I'm trying to remember the name of the show.  The, uh, Bachelor.  The Bachelor, I've had on.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Um.  It's ridiculous.  It sounds like a ridiculous idea to me though.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I never watched that.  Um, I'm trying to think if there's ever been a time when I've watched re- reality TV.  Um.  [LIPSMACK].  You know, I've watched the, um, American Idol for the last, probably, eight weeks.  I'm not sure if that's reality TV or not.
R:  I guess it is.  'Cause it's like the --
L:  Well, I'm sure -- [MN]
R:  -- the making of people.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It was -- it was really the [MN] -- the people that have been on that show [MN] the singers, have been ab- absolutely fabulous for -- over the last eight weeks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's something that I enjoy doing.  Watching, uh, young people perform and seeing how things turn out and watching them, uh, uh, get better and better every week.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  It's cool to see that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although that's, uh -- I haven't watched it very much, but that Simon guy is just too nasty.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, you mean, Simon?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, Simon can sometimes be a little rough on them but, uh, he was -- he's been pretty good lately because the ki- -- all the pe- -- young people that are singing right now are all good.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So, he's, um, he's been a lot nicer to them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's cool.
L:  They only have, I think, uh, four -- four -- three or four left that are singing.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  After -- is that [MN] -- the -- because the last time I saw it there was a marine was the one who was on.
L:  Yeah, he's still on.
R:  He's still on?
L:  Yeah, and Reuben.
R:  Reuben, right.  Reuben's the heavy guy, right?
L:  Reuben's on.  Uh.  Uh, yeah, he's the really heavy guy with a wonderful voice and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Clay is still on.  
R:  I don't know who Clay is.
L:  And, uh -- oh, I can't remember the other -- one other girl that had a fabulous voice is on.  And those -- those four will be performing next week.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, cool.
L:  But that's -- I think that's the only really reality show that I watch.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  In the mornings I watch Little House on the Prairie!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's not -- that's not much of reality TV.
R:  No.  [SIGH]
L:  I'm trying to think in the past --
R:  I -- I wonder if things like Trauma, um, Life in the OR, Maternity Ward, those things. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they could -- 
R:  I wonder if those count?
L:  Yeah those could, uh, probably be considered and even, um [LIPSMACK] um, the X. Files.  I don't know if there's -- that's reality but Cops --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, Trauma and ER, those are all probably reality TV too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I have occasion -- I have occasionally watched them.
R:  Yeah.  The --
L:  And ...
R:  I watched some of them.  I -- I spent some time in New Orleans in the hospitals there, so I -- I love watching the, like, the Charity Trauma or the -- or the, uh, Maternity Ward over at University Hospital.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It's like, "Hey, I know where they are now".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  And --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- those shows -- actually those shows are really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  I -- I like those shows.  I think that they, uh, offer a lot to the public.  Uh, they're not crazy shows.  Some of the reality--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- shows, I understand, are pretty crazy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I'm --
R:  I think --
L:  -- just not into that.
R:  Yeah.  I think most of the new ones, like -- like the Survivor -- Survivor.  I've only seen part of, like, the first one when they --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- sat down and ate rats.  I mean, I don't know what the sense in that is.  [SIGH]
L:  I think that I watched [MN] one time and I thought, "This is ridiculous".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  These people are putting their lives in danger just to -- to be on this show.  I -- I don't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't like it at all.
R:  And then -- and the one, like I said, The -- The Bachelor.  I've seen a bit of -- that -- that's the one that comes on when there's nothing else on that I like.  And it's consistently been that way.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  -- it's usually playing in the background while I do something else.  But ...
L:  Well, we ha- -- we have, um, uh, a dish, so we have satellite.  So, we have so many channels to choose from that I don't normally go to any of those reality channels, there so much.
R:  [LAUGH].  That's true.
L:  There's so much good stuff on.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I have -- uh, I just have cable so I have some more, but I like comedy and stuff that I don't have to pay too much attention to.
L:  Right.
R:  But that sit- -- that -- that one sits well in the background, but it's really heartbreaking to see, you know, these are really people who really think they're gonna find love.  And a lot of that, I think, you know, I don't know, there are too many broken hearts there.
L:  I would imagine there would be.  I've never seen that show.
R:  Yeah. Oh, what happens is that they all come in and they all -- there are twenty five girls who come in and, like, I think eleven are kicked off on the first show.  And then after that they're, um, [LIPSMACK] slowly but surely weeded out, and as you're getting to the lower numbers they're all completely falling in love with the guy.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or vice versa, when they had The Bachelorette, the last two and -- were like falling -- both in love with the girl.  And --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- you know, you put yourself out that far because it might be marriage, but on the other hand, you know ...
L:  It might be heartbreak.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  But that one still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- makes more sense to me than this one, um, [LIPSMACK] Married by America?
L:  I -- I've never seen that either.
R:  I've seen just a bit of that one, once.  And what it is, is they have just -- I think it starts off with a bunch of people, and friends and family say which of those people they think would be good for the -- their friend or family member.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the three last people get up and -- America votes basically.  Which is [MN] ludicrous.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like without -- without knowing anyone or anything.  They hear what --
L:  America doesn't -- America doesn't always vote right.  Let me know -- let me tell ya.  [LAUGH]
R:  A- absolutely.  
L:  They make some pretty bad --
R:  You know.
L:  -- mistakes.
R:  And it's one thing to make a mistake like on, um, um, [LIPSMACK] on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, what's it called?  What were you saying you watch?
L:  Um.
R:  Over the last eight weeks.
L:  Oh.  Oh, the American Idol.
R:  Oh, American Idol.  It's one thing to make a mistake like that and then, you know, [LIPSMACK] worse comes to worse, they -- the kids are going to have to find another producer or something. 
L:  Yes, and almost every one of those [MN] young people that are left on that show right now will all probably become stars.
R:  Right.
L:  Because somebody's gonna want them.
R:  Exactly.  And it's another thing when you get Married by America and, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're -- they're -- [MN] this is marriage, you know.  We're not talking about buying a, uh, [MN] not even buying a million dollar house.  We're talking about, like, a sacred matrimony.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know. 
R:  [COUGH]
L:   And I would not want somebody in Ame- -- you know, people in America to match me with my husband.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I would -- I would much rather, uh, do that matching myself.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  It's very [inaudible].
L:  But, you know, as far as reality [SIGH] TV I just -- I'm just not into it.  So I guess I'm not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a very good candidate for this call tonight, since I don't ever watch it.
R:  That's -- same here.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we're making pretty good time so far, I think.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How many minutes have we been talking?  [LAUGH]
R:  Hold on one second, I'll look at my phone.  Nine minutes and fifty three seconds.  Oh, no, since I called.
L:  Oh, we've only got --  [MN]
R:  So, it's, uh, about two minutes less than that.
L:  Yeah, about a couple of minutes, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.
L:  Um. [MN]
R:  But there was just -- I don't if it was an ad or I just -- my TV is on silent right now, but there's something about The Bachelor just showed up on it.
L:  The what?
R:  Um, not The Bachelor -- yes, The Bachelor.  I thought -- it -- it almost seemed --
L:  Oh, The Bachelor.
R:  -- like they're playing it.
L:  Yeah, I've never see -- I've never even heard of that program.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  See I'm out of TV except for -- because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we have satellite, I get so many channels, that --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Why bother watching the plain things?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What other -- oh, the other one, Fear Factor.  Have you ever seen or heard of?
L:  What is it?
R:  Fear Factor.
L:  Fear Fact- -- oh, yeah, I think that is ridiculous.  I watched it one night with my [MN] one daughter who really likes it and I went, "You are kidding.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  You like this?"  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean some of the stunts are pretty cool.  But then, like --
L:  I only --
R:  -- eating this lousy stuff.  
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's just like -- because they -- they make sure they're safe.  That's why I don't mind the stunts.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have all these safeties in place.
L:  That's good.  That's good.
R:  But, like, you know, eating -- what was it?  The -- the ones I watched they had to ox text- -- testicles.  
L:  Oh, yuk.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like -- exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I heard from someone that they claim that these are delicacies -- everything that they make them eat is a delicacy somewhere.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, there probably is somewhere, a delicacy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But not in this country.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  For a good -- v- very good reason.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that, at least -- at least that one's safe.  Like [LIPSMACK] of all of them, that one's the safest one.
L:  Yeah, because Survivor --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't think was real safe.  I think that the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  People could've gotten hurt --
R:  They --
L:  -- very easily on that program.
R:  They had someone get hurt.
L:  Did they?
R:  They -- I think they had someone get hurt.  I don't remember what happened.  But I think it had to do with water.  I think he was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- either -- either he -- something happened in the water or right outside of the water.  And they had to fly it -- it was made -- did they have one in Australia?  
L:  I think -- I think I remember watching the one with the water, and he almost drowned.
R:  Maybe that -- and then they had to fly him to mainland or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was in real trouble.
R:  Yeah.  So that's like --
L:  He was in real trouble.
R:  I think -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  I think most of these shows are unsafe on one level or another.
L:  Yeah, and I don't --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I -- I am not into, um, radio, I mean, television shows that put people's lives in jeopardy.
R:  Exact
