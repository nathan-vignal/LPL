R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  I --
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, well, my name is Max and I'm from Los Angeles, California.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Ah, my name is Max.  I'm from Los Angeles, California.
L:  Okay.  My name is Maria, um, I live in Texas.
R:  Oh, okay, great.
L:  In San Bernardino.
R:  Um, so, I guess, what -- what would you say would be the worst out of all the -- the things you just heard?  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  Well, I only heard, like, the first three.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Okay.  Um, I can --
L:  Wh- --
R:  I can name them all if you like.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I think she said, um, gossip, smoking, drinking, exercise, um, ah, I forgot actually.  There's a few other ones.
L:  The worst of all habits?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, I would -- I would have to say drinking.
R:  Why is that?
L:  [MN] Well, ah, I guess, if -- if you -- if it's a habit, you know, you -- if you're gonna be drinking all the time then it -- that's bad for you.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.  I -- to me, though, I'm a -- I would say gossip, mainly because, um, all the other ones are bad but gossip is really, like, the worst one 'cause you can't really defend it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, if a person's negative and they start a gossip and it spreads, like, it -- sometimes it's really hard to find out the truth and, I don't know, it just destroys other people's lives which isn't too cool.  [MN] 
L:  Well, yeah, that is true.  That is true, but it depends, you know, sometimes gossip also helps.  I -- I don't know, you know, I think that way.
R:  Um, how would gossip help?
L:  Well, you know, um, sometimes you say not a bad thing about one person but, I mean, people think usually gossip is saying something wrong but sometimes you can say something positive about a person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if they hear it, you know [MN] I --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  It could, like, brighten their mood or something.
L:  Yeah, ahah.
R:  But, they're -- they're asking you in, like, a negative way, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  That would be my top one just because, like, I'm in school right now and there's a lot of gossip and, like, I don't know, it -- it just -- gossip leads to more trouble.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, yeah, like, second would be, like, smoking or drinking 'cause they're just bad for your body and your mind.
L:  Well, how -- how old are you?
R:  I am twenty.
L:  Okay, see, I guess it's depending on the age.  I'm thirty two and I have a lot of friends who have [MN] husbands who drink a lot, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that -- that seems to be the problem nowadays.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I don't know.  I have a lot of friends who drink a lot but they just do it for fun though 'cause I guess we're still --
L:  Yeah, no, these one's are a regular basis type of thing, you know.  They have to have some -- a drink --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- every night after work.
R:  Like an addiction kind of?
L:  Yes.  You know.
R:  Oh.
L:  As soon as they get off work they have to go to the refrigerator, open the refrigerator and get a beer.
R:  Mhm.  And does that change, like, how they act?
L:  Yeah, I think so, 'cause I have a very good friend, her husband is like that and, you know, he comes in from work and he gets his drink and then he sits at the couch and two -- maybe two hours later, you know, he already drunk four or five beers and, you know, he's already kind of isolated from his family, his children, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  To me that -- that looks kind of bad.
R:  Yeah, that is bad.  It's good if -- I mean, it's okay if you do it once in a while --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but I could see how if you do it daily it could become a problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  What would be, I guess, some of the others that you might say are bad, I guess?
L:  Okay, well, wh- when she meant exercising does she mean not exercising or ...?
R:  I don't know.  I think she meant, like, if you don't exercise.
L:  Yeah, that's not, well, um, okay, drinking was one.  The other one was --
R:  Smoking.
L:  Gossiping.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those are the bad ones.
R:  Ye- --
L:  And smoking, well, you know, smoking is also a bad habit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Definitely not a good one.
L:  -- [MN] you know, people, ah, you have, I guess, an option of smoking or not smoking, so ...
R:  Mhm.  But it's sort of like alcohol, I guess, because, I mean, people do get a- -- can get addicted to it.  It could [MN] become a daily thing which --
L:  And not only that, I mean, not only are you killing yourself, you are actually killing other people too from --
R:  Yeah, 'cause secondhand smoke kills just as well.
L:  Yeah, smoking.
R:  Um.
L:  What was the other one?
R:  Um, there was one, ah, also drinking caffeine.
L:  Uh?
R:  There was another one, like, I believe, drinking caffeine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, but I don't know.  I guess that's not really -- well, I- -- it could be bad but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH]  Which one would you say you used the most?  I mean, which habit?
R:  The -- the habit that I -- I probably have, would probably be, um, [MN] I guess smoking probably or drinking 'cause I don't really do any of the other ones and I try to exercise once a week or so.
L:  Yeah, well, I think mine is the exercise because [MN] I don't drink that much.  I only drink maybe every other Friday when I'm with my friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I smoke maybe once -- once every three days, so [MN] ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's not so bad.
R:  Yeah, that's not too bad.
L:  But I don't exercise at all.  I try but I can't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I'm far too busy.  I have too many jobs.
R:  Yeah, and I don't know, there's just too many other things to do when it comes to exercise.  Plus you need, like, a gym and stuff, I don't know.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but for me I also, like, I smoke maybe a couple of times a week but, like, I don't know, I guess that will probably the worst one for me 'cause I do it.
L:  The -- which one?  And on the gossip, oh, well that -- that I guess I defend it because I guess I do it all the time, you know.
R:  Oh, hm.
L:  I work at the [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, one, you know, something happens and everybody calls everybody else because they wanna know who -- who has the info on it, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That goss- -- gossiping can be okay but I -- I'm just saying, like, like, there's a lot of gossip, for example, like, celebrities, like, they can't really defend themselves from something, like, gossip, something negative about -- it would be, like, on the front page of the -- the newspaper and then they can't really do anything 'cause, I mean, they have no say in it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Someone else's words.  So, yeah, but ... I definitely can gossip in -- in a good way, like friends gossip [several inaudible words] that's all cool but, I don't know, I just seen a lot of bad gossip.  So, I don't know, I'd probably say to me that's the worst [inaudible].
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Um, is this your first ti- -- is this your first, um, phone thing?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Ah, it's mine too.  [MN] 
L:  Have you done it for a long time?
R:  No, this is my first one actually.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I started the -- well, I signed up yesterday but then they called me today but I was kinda busy so I didn't take the first call and I said well, let me try and see if I [MN] -- if I can do a call out which I did, so ...
R:  Um, yeah, that's what I did.  I entered a number and then they just connected me, I guess.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I guess and they have certain topics that people have to talk about.
R:  Yeah.  I guess everyone gets, like, a different topic or something.
L:  Yeah.  That's cool.  You know the -- the way people -- the -- they come up with things now.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's really cool.
L:  Mm.
R:  Mhm.  What time is it in Texas right now?
L:  It's twelve thirty three.
R:  Wow.  Twelve thirty three.
L:  Yeah.  Over there it's eight thirty -- I mean ten thirty three, right?
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  Yeah, I used to live in Fremont.
R:  Oh, in Fremont?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's not too far away.
L:  No.  I was there for about three years, [MN] nineteen ninety nine I think was my last year.
R:  Why did you decide to move to Texas?
L:  Ah, well, actually, I am from, ah, I lived in Texas before --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, but, and I was only there for three years.  I didn't like it because it was too crowded, too fast.
R:  Oh, and --
L:  Over here it's a small town, we, you know, we pace ourselves.  There's no traffic on the freeways.
R:  Mhm, yeah, there's a lot of traffic.
L:  Nothing like that, so ...
R:  Ah, I guess, yeah, it's pretty cool and I'm sure it has, like, a better environment 'cause, I don't know, LA is really dirty and stuff.
L:  Ahah.  Plus I live right next to -- across from Mexico so I go to Mexico a lot.
R:  Oh.  I was just at Rosario, like, two weeks ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Pretty cool,
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Is it, um, but, is it -- is it, like, the temperatures -- is it much hotter in Texas than LA?
L:  Oh, yeah, it's very, very hot.  Right now it must be in the eighties.  Right now.
R:  In the evening?
L:  Yeah, we had some drizzle.  It was gonna rain.  We had some thunderstorms last night but, ah, seventy five percent of the time it's in the eighties.  Seventies, eighties.
R:  Yeah, LA's pretty hot except at night.  At night it gets pretty chilly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Finally [inaudible]
