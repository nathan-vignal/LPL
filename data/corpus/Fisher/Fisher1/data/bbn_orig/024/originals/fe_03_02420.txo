R:  Well, ah, if [several inaudible words] for me, ah, to go to the lake.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Hi, I'm not -- not too bad.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] So, er, [LAUGH] this is the bad habits we are going over whatever.  [LAUGH] My name is Manuela by -- by the way.
L:  I'm Tiffany.
R:  Okay.  So, what do you think is your -- the bad habits or -- 
L:  Personally, I think smoking is the worst of those.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Well, [LAUGH] it -- to me it's, ah, it -- it's also about, er, er, eating, er, food which is completely processed and devitalized because it's -- it's an addiction.  It's a bad habit and it makes people sick and it creates all sorts -- kinds of addiction like alcohol and smoking and, ah, drugs and all of that.  So, ah, the way we eat is really, ah, important it -- and can be a very bad habit when -- when we drink and -- like the sodas and, ah, it's a lot of, ah, food with pesticides and all of this will create lot of addictions.
L:  That's -- that's a very interesting point.  I hadn't thought of it that way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, unfortunately --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- we're so [several inaudible words] we don't know about that.  The food which is not, ah, the way, ah, [several inaudible words] spirit created it, ah, like the -- the animals in the wild they don't -- they never get sick and truly, um, when we see the -- the increase of this is now appearing, it's really because of what is, like in, ah, what it means and, ah, it -- it -- it goes from one addiction to another.
L:  That's a very true point.  I guess I don't think a whole lot about what I eat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I notice, ah, in this study they are going to -- to consider.  But, it's [several inaudible words] really.  [LAUGH] It's a [inaudible] for -- for example, er, sugar goes with salt, ah, and then it creates a different problems to eats a lot of sugar we create +diabetes and if we increase the amount of salt and, ah, it can create a hydric[?] pressure and then it's more --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- processed food and [LAUGH] insulin and [LAUGH] all of that stuff.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that d- that doesn't sound good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  All right.  All right.  Right.
L:  It makes one think about what they're eating, I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I think the problem with smoking that I see is the -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- fact that you're not only harming yourself, you're harming everyone around you.
R:  I agree with you.
L:  You know, you're -- if you're smoking a cigarette, you know, they've got the commercials out and studies show that -- that the people around you get more of the nicotine and more of the bad -- 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- bad things than you -- are -- more of the bad things than you do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, right.  It's [several inaudible words] agree with you.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, I'm, like, just, you know, eating and putting all the chemicals into your own body or drinking and putting all the chemicals in your own body -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're putting them in everybody elses -- 
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- whether they chose to or not -- 
R:  Right.  Even though it's sad to smoke [several inaudible words] oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Li- like I, ah, I think I was in the park and, ah, well for example when I go to green market [several inaudible words] there's beautiful benches and, ah, sometimes I will like to sit to snack something, on something, and, um, I have to look who is smoking there because when people smoke I don't want to be seated next --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to that person.  And even with [several inaudible words] they don't realise how the -- the smoke is annoying.
L:  Yes.  That -- I mean, if people need to smoke they could at least make sure that they're not around anyone else which is really tough.  [LAUGH] I mean --  
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I guess, you -- they would maybe think that they're outside.  But -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- if the wind is blowing right and it goes in your face -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or whatever and a lot of people have allergies to smoke [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Right, it's true.  It's true.  I agree with you.  [inaudible] that, ah, funny -- and what -- what, er, is funny for me is I see this addiction.  In winter time, for example, people work in office -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they go outside to -- to freeze outside just to smoke.  It's unbelievable.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they probably wouldn't stand outside for that long waiting for a cab or something like that.  But -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they're smoking, that's [LAUGH] -- 
R:  R- right.  Ah, it's always, ah, it's -- it's -- it's am -- it's amazing to see that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The thing which, um, really I don't like to see is, ah, when the, um, people are in the car with children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they smoke in the car.  I don't understand why they can do that to their children.
L:  I agree totally.  Or a pregnant woman.
R:  Yes, they -- 
L:  You know, all those studies that show what it does to the child and -- and they -- I don't -- I have never heard of any studies about addiction with children.  But, I mean, you see studies with addiction with alcoholism.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, maybe that's why there's an increase in -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- there was an increase in teenage smoking is because the parents all smoked when they were pregnant and didn't think anything of it.
R:  W- well.  I guess it's a combination of things because the commercials -- it's interesting on TV, er, [several inaudible words] why I don't have it, they -- they have higher now childrens +psychological, ah, [inaudible] to make a balance, er, buy things for the kids and are so that they know that the kids are going to ask for it.  And it was same for teenagers, I believe they see the smoking, ah, at the advertising they think is great, ah, it's so exciting.  It's empowering --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and all that stuff.  And, um, it's, ah, the way they -- they are able to manipulate the teenager as well to have them addicted.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- then, what is interesting too, in -- in, ah, every commercial it's one thing after another.  It's one addiction with another one.  It's the -- it's the  way it is, ah, made.
L:  Mhm.  Most of the time when you see someone smoking, they're drinking or vice versa, if somebody is drinking.  You know, I have a friend who smokes who says that whenever he drinks a beer he needs to have a cigarette [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- it's kind of to balance it out.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Right.  And, ah, even, ah, when, ah, y- you go outside on the billboards you see these pictures of people, er, together on the beach having fun with a drink.  It's always, ah, showing people -- it's very powering, you're so beautiful, and you can be friends, or you can make a lot of friends when you, ah, drink and when you smoke.  It's -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- i- it's interesting.  And then we have this [several inaudible words] it's not good for your health, blah, blah, blah, and at the meantime they push really people.  But, they [several inaudible words] if you don't do that you're not going to look good, you're not going to look great and be wonderful.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's funny how society looks down on people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that -- wh- who don't drink.  In a lot of cases, you know, if you go out with friends or whatever and you don't drink you're looked down on.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, well, you know, "Well, why not?  What's wrong with you that you don't drink alcohol?"  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  Right.  You know, it's amazing because I don't like alcohol and I don't drink it at all and people say, "How come you're French and you don't drink alcohol?"  I say, "I don't like it".  It's not because I'm French but I'm supposed to like it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's so interesting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it really doesn't taste that good.  [LAUGH] I mean -- 
R:  It -- it doesn't taste good.  I never -- I remember when I, ah, was a teenager, of course I tasted it and --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- at first I didn't really like it.  Um, I -- I did it when I was going to dance with friends and stuff like that.  But, it was not really something I -- I enjoyed anyway.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't know what people find in alcohol, er, when, ah, they drink it.  I r- really I don't know, even if they are not alcoholic and they drink it on occasion, I don't know what's -- what is nice.
L:  Yeah, I [LAUGH] -- I guess it's just the -- the fact of it and how society has glamorized it.  How it's been glamorized throughout -- throughout the ages -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and in America it's the fact that it's illegal for children or for, you know, anyone under twenty one.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And that's -- I think that's a big, big part of the desire to drink.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Right.  It's true that, ah, when, ah, you are a teenager you want to experiment because they see people doing it.  It's like a -- a child, ah, who is growing.  A child won't understand when we say, "It's not good for you" and he sees his parents or other people do it.  It's -- it's very confusing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and the teenagers -- okay, ah, ah, it's the time to experiment to discover who they are and they want to experiment everything.
L:  Mhm.  And because they can't do it they think it's better -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] because only adults can do it they think that they're adults --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- so, they can do it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is true.  It -- it's true.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's what leads to the alcoholism and the bad habits and the [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.  Because I'm amazed to see that with -- with thing about alcohol is [inaudible] for example, and also sodas are really addictive too.  It's like alcohol and it depletes the body of different things, ah, that people are not aware of.  It's a very dangerous to you and it's more than choice when there is aspartame in it, ah, because aspartame has, ah, side effects and bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- effects wh- which take a long time to show up. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- and, um, the -- the sodas are very addictive and they -- they do act -- l- like, they deplete the body out of it's -- it's k- --
