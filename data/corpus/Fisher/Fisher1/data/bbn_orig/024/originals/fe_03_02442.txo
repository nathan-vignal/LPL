L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My na- --
L:  How're you doing?
R:  All right.  My name is Don Clark and I live in Downey.
L:  [MN]  Where's that?
R:  LA, seventeen miles south.
L:  Okay, what's that city called?  Downey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Okay.  Ah, my name is Mike and I'm from, ah, I'm calling from New York City.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Pretty far, huh?
R:  Pretty far, man.  So, do you watch reality TV?
L:  Ah, I do, actually.  Not all of them but th- -- 'cause there's so many but, ah, [LIPSMACK] I -- I do.  I never -- I j- I -- someone told me that the first real -- real reality TV was MTV's Real World which --
R:  Yeah.  My wife used to wa- -- make me watch that all the time.
L:  -- which I -- but I never -- I never watched it.  I never go- -- I -- I don't know, I didn't like it.  It just didn't -- didn't appeal to me, you know.  I don't watch MTV much myself anyway so I -- that's probably why I never watched it [MN] but [LIPSMACK] I really got into reality TV during the first Survivor which was a few years ago [LIPSMACK].  Ah, do you remember, ah, when Rich won?
R:  I didn't watch any of the first Survivor.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  Ah, I watched it like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a couple of years later.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 'Cau- -- now -- now they're just -- there's so many Survivors and all this -- all this stuff but [MN] -- so that's -- but I never watched another Survivor after that 'cause I -- yeah, whatever -- it just -- I lost interest but, ah, [LIPSMACK] you know, um ... Let's see, ah, the last -- last reality show I watched was Married By America.
R:  Yeah, I watched part of that.  I watched part of the Bachelor guy too.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, like, most of that stuff you -- my wife decides what I'm watching.
L:  Your wife decides what you're watching?
R:  Pretty much.
L:  That doesn't sound good.
R:  Well, you know, ah --
L:  You know.
R:  [MN]  If I wanna watch -- either watch that or go away.  So, ah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  A...
L:  Do you watch -- what about -- do you get to watch sports at all?
R:  Oh, man, I don't let her have the TV when Penn State plays.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  Just football.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, ah ...
L:  Well, at least you get to watch that though.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, yeah, well, everybody got two TVs, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, and, ah...  You watch -- on them Survivor shows, don't you think it's kinda like, ah, maybe they should just throw them in and see who eats each other or something?  I think that'd be better.
L:  See who eats each other?
R:  Yeah.  See who really survives.
L:  Well, yeah, I guess, I guess, yeah.  It's gonna -- it's gonna come down to -- it's, you know, it's gonna get, you know, more violent as the years go by 'cause people are gonna demand more.  It's gonna probably get sicker and sicker.
R:  Is -- is Fear Factor a reality show?
L:  Ah, n- [MN], g- -- that's a good question.  Not really.  Ah, but it's a good show.  Um --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it's an i- -- it's a very interesting show.
R:  I don't know, man.  I -- my wife watches that all the time.  I think it's kinda disgusting, a lot of it.  [NOISE]  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  It is but [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's funny though.  It's funny to -- to watch people, you know, eat bugs or whatever, have to eat bugs for whatever, what is it, fifty thousand dollars, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, but that's not even that much money.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean.
L:  No, it's not.
R:  I mean.
L:  It's not.  I mean, some of the stuff they do I don't, you know, I -- you know what?  I'm -- I'm eating -- eating that kinda stuff maybe but I don't know, like, I -- I don't like heights myself so some of the stuff they have to do is, um, they have to, like, [LIPSMACK] you know, climb a, like, a, you know, be o- on a high ledge or something or do something in -- in a high -- I don't know if I'd be able to do that [MN] but --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- fifty thousand dollars is -- is not -- is not a hell of a lot, you know.
R:  Not for what they're doing.
L:  Yeah, I would agree with that though.  I would agree.
R:  [MN] Heights don't bother me at all, except for the first fifteen or twenty five feet.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause if you fall from there you get gimped out for life.
L:  You -- you what for life?
R:  Gimped out, man.  You're gonna break something.  You're not ever gonna be the same.
L:  What do you mean?  What?  If you fall from fifteen, twenty feet?
R:  Yeah.  Above twenty feet it doesn't bother me any more.
L:  Because, basically, you think [MN] if you fall does- -- you know, that's it?
R:  That's it.  You're through.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Although I have seen -- seen people fall a lot further and get up.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Once, maybe twenty years ago, I seen a guy fall from thirty feet, at least thirty feet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get up and run probably another twelve feet and he had two broken legs and a busted pelvis.
L:  How -- where did he fall from?
R:  He fell off a tank.  I work in an oil refinery.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They were cleaning the top of a tank --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and I -- you know they'll bring people in as laborers that aren't really too swift --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they were up there hosing the top of it and they hit an explosion light bulb or one of those light bulbs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it -- when it hit, it exploded 'cau- -- from the heat of the glass.
L:  Right.
R:  And he didn't know what it was and he turned and ran and ran right off the tank.  But he had an air hose on that halfway down caught him, flipped him around and then snapped, so, you know, he did kind of a flip in the air and then when he fell and he hit and got up and run, when he fell I thought he was dead and then I thought, "Wow".  He got up and ran.
L:  Oh, but he was running with broken legs?
R:  With broken legs.
L:  Oh, shit.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [COUGH] 
L:  And how [LAUGH] -- and how many feet -- how many feet h- high was that?
R:  The tank was at least thirty five feet.
L:  Okay.  So, basically, what -- what you're saying is -- is the, ah, the hose kind of broke his fall a little bit?
R:  It didn't really break his fall.  It only flipped him around so he didn't land on his head.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  'Cause the first, I don't know, the first thing he did, it wasn't -- the explosion didn't rock him off the tank.
L:  Ahah.
R:  He panicked and ran off the tank.
L:  Wow.
R:  So he got like -- like three feet off the tank and then, shh, started straight down but when he got almost down there the- they had a breathing air because, ah, the gas up there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- caught him, flipped him and then it -- it didn't hold him.  It just snapped.  
L:  Okay.  I gotcha.  And how's he doing now?
R:  Ah, he lived.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I never seen him again.  You know, he was a contractor who came in to clean the tank.
L:  Okay.
R:  But --
L:  Sounds like a dangerous job.
R:  Well, it doesn't happen often and now they a- -- whenever they go up there they all have to have a -- OSHA has given 'em [LIPSMACK] the thing that makes like a bungee jumper, like the rock climbers have.
L:  Yeah, of course.
R:  Yeah.  So, now they have that on everything, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  So, it's a little bit safer.  
R:  Quite a bit.  But, that was my first -- I wish they should have had that on TV.  Or those other ones like them, ah, America's Stupid Videos.  Are they reality based TV?
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] American's Stup- -- American Funniest Home Videos.  Which i- --
R:  No, no, the one where they do the crime.
L:  Where they're doing what?
R:  You never seen th- the Stu- -- America's Stupidest Criminals?
L:  Oh, oh, ah, yeah, [MN] right.  It's called, like, a Cops.
R:  Yeah, kind a like a Cops but --
L:  Ah, but it's just like v- videos of dumb criminals.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've seen that before.  Um, [MN] I don't know if that's real- -- really reality.  Ah, it -- it's -- yeah, I guess it is because it's showing real stuff.  I like that kinda stuff, um, you know.  I don't -- did you watch the Bachelorette?
R:  Yeah, part of that, but not much.
L:  Which one?  The one with Trista?
R:  I -- I think I watched the one where she, like, lost.  One of the girls got kicked off and was highly upset.
L:  Okay.  Oh, oh, you mean, a- -- okay, and she was crying?  One girl was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that was funny.
R:  Yeah, those aren't like my favorite.  The other one, America's Home Videos, man, I can't believe some of the people that win on that.
L:  I know.
R:  Like, that's kind of like a fixed thing or something.
L:  You think?
R:  I don't know, man, but when I watched the guy watched for making strange noises under the table or something but there was couple of them that were a lot more --
L:  Do -- do you watch that show a lot?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I [MN] -- all them shows, I kinda work rotating shifts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I've never been able to watch 'em every week.
L:  Well, one show a couple of weeks ago on America's Funniest Home Video, ah, which won, which was, I think, extremely, extremely funny, right, and I'll describe it to you [MN] and I don't know if you saw it.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, basically and this -- and this is the one that won for the day, you know, that won the ten thousand dollars for that -- that day.  Ah, ah, ok- --kids, small kids, I don't know, five years old or something, you know, cute kids are in a show [MN] and they were singing and there was, ah -- they were in a line just singing something in a -- in a -- in, you know, in a school play or something [MN] and the mother was filming it, ah, and there was a -- and there was a -- a little boy on the end and then a little girl next to him and then other people next to them.  But it focuses on the little boy and the little girl, and what happens is, the little boy sneezed.  And, ah, he had, you know, he sneezed, he -- he didn't cover his nose, so, ah, he just like, you know, just sneezed and -- and he didn't realize it but, I -- I guess, he had, ah -- he had, you know, snot coming out -- he had snot coming out -- came out of his nose and was just on his face, just, you know, just there, kinda just, like, hanging down.  And the gir- -- little girl next to him -- the little girl next to him looked at him [MN] --
