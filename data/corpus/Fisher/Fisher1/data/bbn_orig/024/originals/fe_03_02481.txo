L:  Hi, my name is Anne[?].
R:  Hi, my name is Mary Jane.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you, Mary Jane.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm all right.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.  Um, we're supposed to talk about reality TV.
L:  Yeah, Who Wants to be a Millionaire --
R:  Mm, I --
L:  -- and Survivor.
R:  Survivor, Fear Factor.
L:  Yeah.  Um [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  Do you watch any of those?
L:  Every now and then.  I really don't care for them so much, especially Fear Factor, 'cause one -- one night I watching it [COUGH] and they had this couple eat, um --
R:  Bugs?
L:  -- like, moldy cheese with maggots --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and it was so gross, they were throwing up, they were -- stuff was coming out of their nose and it was just so awful, so [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I think --
R:  I like that show. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know. [COUGH] My husband says it's trash TV, but --
L:  It is, it's --
R:  -- I like it.
L:  -- gross, ick.
R:  I kinda like to see who's gonna win.
L:  Every now and then I'd -- I will, if it's not something like that, but, you know, if it's more s- -- you know, like, sporty, like, stuff that they're doing, competing in, but stuff like that, that is just gross.  They could get sick or anything and --
R:  Yeah, I heard, you know, s- some guys have sued them over some of those --
L:  I'm sure.
R:  -- ones they've had.
L:  Yeah, but they didn't --
R:  It was kinda --
L:  -- put a gun to their head and make them do it.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, so we all have a choice, and the things people will do for that almighty dollar bill, you know, it amazes me.
R:  Mhm.  I know they had a -- [NOISE] a semi finals, [LAUGH] I watched it Monday night [COUGH] --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- it wasn't too bad.  They had to milk a goat with their mouth --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, at -- at least they didn't --
L:  They've had worse, so, I guess, mm.
R:  They didn't have to eat any roaches or any --
L:  No.
R:  -- gross stuff like that.
L:  I know.
R:  But some of those people were lactose intolerant.
L:  Re- -- and they did it anyways?
R:  They had to do it anyway.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  You know, I thought [COUGH] -- that would make 'em sick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Probably will.  They'll -- they'll, um, [LIPSMACK] have some effects from it, I'm sure.
R:  Mhm.  You watch Survivor?
L:  Um, I haven't in a while.
R:  Oh, I saw that.  I don't know, I see bits and pieces of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really can't get into it like --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- Fear Factor, I guess.
L:  Mm mm, no, and let's see, um, what was another one?  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, I d- --
L:  -- was it Bachelor or something?  'Cause I haven't watched it.  Um, wh- --
R:  What's the name of it?  I --
L:  Um, The -- The Most Eligible Bachelor or something like that.
R:  Oh, that, oh yeah, I saw that once or twice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think that's too good.
L:  Me either, uh-uh.  I think people like that are desperate.  I think you should wait.  A woman should wait until a man finds her for marriage.  She shouldn't be out trying to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  And shouldn't have it broadcast on TV --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- and for all the --
L:  No.
R:  -- whole world to see.
L:  I know.
R:  [COUGH] What was that other question she said in the beginning?  I couldn't remember.  She said to talk about the programs and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then there was something else.
L:  I can't remember either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She -- I mean, she goes so fast and sometimes her voice is low, so, you know, if you don't catch it all --
R:  I know.  I was --
L:  -- at first, you just cannot, like --
R:  I had a pen with me and I for- -- didn't write it down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  So, what other shows are there?
L:  Um --
R:  I don't even -- I can't even think of any right off the bat.
L:  I can't either.
R:  I was thinking of that American Idol, the --
L:  Oh, yeah, American Idol, yeah. [MN] Um --
R:  But is that a reality show?  I don't know.
L:  Well, I think they -- they compete against each other to see who -- who's gonna be the winner of whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I've watched it a few times and, you know, they sing really good, the ones that I've s- -- you know, um, watched.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the one guy who's the judge, the last judge, he usually judges people pretty harshly, but the other night, he was pretty nice.  [COUGH] He gave everybody a pretty good rating and everything, so I was surprised.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah.  I don't know how long they have to compete for, but I think it's very expensive for them to, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do that every week and everything and then, um, when they think that they're about to get ahead, then that they get kicked off or whatever, so I really don't know the -- [LIPSMACK] if I had a -- a child, I don't know if I would really want them to invest that much into that.
R:  Mhm.  I don't think I've ever watched American Idol.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah --
R:  I watched that -- something about child stars.
L:  Okay, yeah.  I watched that once, too.
R:  But is that a reality TV [LAUGH] show?
L:  I think it is, but, um --
R:  Or they had those -- they had some real, you know, like, eight, nine, ten --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- year old girl singing and --
L:  Yeah, they were really good.  W- -- that girl -- this one girl, think she was ten, I knew she played the piano, I mean, it was, like, wonderful, I mean -- and she said she practised, like, three hours a day, and you can tell --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because she was really, really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she won that night.
R:  Really?
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wonder if they'll have finals on that? [COUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  But I've only seen that once or twice.
L:  Me too.  I don't really --
R:  When I did see it, I thought, "Oh", I couldn't believe the girl that won.  She -- I don't think her voice was that good, but --
L:  [LAUGH] It -- it amazes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- me sometimes the people that do win. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and then she was dressed, like, her mom had sewed this dress and it was just absolutely ugly. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  You would think she would want her to really look nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sometimes they make 'em look too grown up too.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, like, a lot of make up and stuff on 'em.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  And those outfits aren't even, you know, for kids their age, sometimes.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Trying to think --
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, I don't know if it's good for the kids, because I think that it's probably more pressure for them when they, you know, want them to do stuff like that.  But, yeah --
R:  Yeah, I bet the younger they are, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think probably the worst it is.
L:  Probably.
R:  But I still like Fear Factor.
L:  But some of them seem to really enjoy it, you know, performing and everything, so -- but some kids are just really gifted and it doesn't bother -- bother them, so I guess if, you know, if they're okay with it, then it's all right.
R:  Mhm.  I don't know.  I still like Fear Factor, that's about the only one I -- I watch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just kinda interesting to see what people do for all that money, you know?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's interesting.
R:  Kinda -- I don't know.  I guess I'm kinda getting tired of it, I guess.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I did --
R:  But, you know --
L:  -- when I saw that that night, I -- I -- my husband was kinda, like, getting into watching it, but since that, I haven't really, you know?  Think maybe I watched it once or twice after that, but I don't get into it like I used to, because I would just rather watch a movie, a pretty good movie on Lifetime or something, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When they started it, it was a lot ... I --  I  don't know, probably a lot worse, I think, than it was now.
L:  Probably.
R:  'Cause they had to do, you know, stuff with snakes and --
L:  Mm.  Gross.
R:  Really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- heavy duty gross stuff.
L:  Mhm. [COUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, then one night they -- they had to get, like, all these fish eggs.  Did you see that one?
R:  Fish eggs?
L:  They had to --
R:  Oh, I can't remember that one.
L:  -- eat them.  Uh, th- they had to go and find them, then they had to put 'em -- get so many and then they were, like, counting and then they had to eat them.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  Mhm.  That was gross.  And it was -- th- the water was really murky and -- and dirty, they could barely see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they did it.  And it was smelly, and this one guy, he -- he wouldn't do it though.  He says, "No, I'm not doing it" and he walked off.  I don't blame him.
R:  Oh.  Did you see that one where they had, uh, those dead rats and they had to take 'em --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- by their mouth and throw 'em in a bucket?
L:  Oh.
R:  I think -- I guess they were rat -- dead -- dead mice or dead rats or something.
L:  Oh, that is making me sick to my stomach just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thinking about it.
R:  And then they were -- that one time they were buried, like buried in cockroaches and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- inside a casket or a -- oh, God.
L:  Mm.
R:  That --
L:  I wonder who comes up with that stuff?
R:  And I won- -- the --
L:  They must be -- they must really have a sick mind.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  One time they were in, uh, what, Las Vegas, and they had to go slide down the side of that building.  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah, I think I saw that.  Mhm.
R:  When they were in Las Vegas?
L:  Mhm.  Was it, um, the -- was it men and women that did it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I saw that one, yeah, mhm.
R:  But some of those -- some of those guys, I don't know, the girls usually seem like they win more than the guys do.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause they put their all into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they made up their mind to really do it, they just, you know, go all the way, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, sometimes they're better than the guys, too.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know?
R:  So, I don't know.  You think reality TV's going to last?
L:  Um, hm, no, not really, I don't.  They gotta come up with something else, you know, to get the interest back, I guess, for it, but I think it's, like, fading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They just come and they go, you know?
R:  It's like that, uh, show Who Wants to be a Millionaire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that used to be the big rage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now it's kind of --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's filtering down.
R:  Kind of going away.
L:  Yeah, and I don't think they pay enough anyway.  I think the last two people that are on should get something, you know?  I- -- just -- not just one person, you know, just take it all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's really a cheap show, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For all that they have to go through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I kinda wonder how long those -- some of those have been on already --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- those reality shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- only -- it's a year or two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  Oh, I live in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in Iowa.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  North east Iowa.
L:  Yeah, I had a girlfriend who was Des Moines, Iowa.
R:  Oh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's right in the middle of the state.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, how's the weather there?  Is it, uh, hot today?
R:  Oh, no.  It's been kinda cold and rainy.
L:  Oh --
R:  We got so much rain.
L:  -- it's been beautiful here.  Really hot, you know, we -- we have our air conditioner on --
