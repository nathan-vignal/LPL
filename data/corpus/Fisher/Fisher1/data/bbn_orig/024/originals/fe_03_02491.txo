L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [MN]
R:  Who -- Is this who I think it is?
L:  Is this who you think it is?
R:  Yeah, did I talk to you yesterday?
L:  No. No.
R:  Oh.  My god your voice sounds the same
L:  Oh, how funny, no you're completely different from the guy I spoke to yesterday.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  I [LAUGH] -- what's your name?
R:  My name's John.
L:  John, I'm Deena[?].
R:  Hi, Deena.
L:  Good to meet you.
R:  Yeah, where are you from?
L:  Well, I'm down in Tampa.  What about yourself?
R:  Oh, I'm on the other side.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, really?  Where in California?
R:  Uh, Huntington Beach.
L:  Oh, yeah, I spent many years there.  I worked at an agency called Shyett Day[?] for about eight years there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What --
L:  There's a lot of reps in Huntington Beach.
R:  Mhm.
L:  M- --
R:  What are you doing in Florida?
L:  Well, uh, my husband's Canadian and this is the land of [inaudible] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- here we are.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Here we are, yeah.  I stayed in advertising for a while but now I'm mostly doing the, uh, the homestead thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  So, yeah.  So, I got a chuckle out of our topic today.
R:  I know, reality shows.  Do you even watch 'em?
L:  I know.  Uh, well, you know what?  I had resisted them for the longest time, and then I caught a couple of episodes of one of the, uh, the relationship ones, not the Survivor type things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then I found myself, um, catching another episode of one of the more recent ones.  Again, was, I guess, The Bachelor.  The -- the guy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from California --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the Firestone?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. What about you?
R:  Uh, not really.  Um --
L:  Not any of it at all, huh?
R:  No, uh, you know, I did when I was in Texas, I was -- I just moved back here in the beginning of the year and I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- spent six years in Texas, but, uh, it -- it -- it was funny, 'cause I did, at one point, uh, I started watching, um, the show with the room mates and each week they would cut a room mate out and finally it -- you know, and it was just out of boredom, really, but, um -- I don't know why they're so popular, to be honest with you.
L:  I -- well, you know what?  I guess it's like a train wreck --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's awful, but you just can't tear your eyes from it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sometimes, when you start watching.  Um, uh, but I think, uh, one of them though is so bad that I just -- I couldn't even watch.   It's, like, I turned it on and I couldn't hang with it, which is, uh, [SIGH] yeah, unusual sometimes, I mean, I'm not saying I'm not a discriminate viewer, but [LIPSMACK] um, you know, I -- and I'm not a snob either [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll be the first one to say, "I love to watch TV.  I love to veg out in front of TV", I just don't have that much time to do it these years. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, you know, to me it's like mind candy, in a way. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I -- I guess -- I -- I'm not sure, I -- I -- I just -- I know I don't like them, and I -- I don't understand why they're so popular.  For me, it's -- it -- it -- coming -- I'm an -- also a musician and -- and so I look at the arts and I think, "Has it gotten that bad that nobody can think of anything creative?"
L:  Yeah.  Well -- and also I think they've also created the audience for it out there too.  You know, it's, like, I think any other kind of a -- a habit or -- you know, a -- a mainstream, per se?
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And then it just gets more popular and more popular and more popular until you're finally eating all of that kind of a menu and you've forgotten what, you know, m- more basic or home cooking or more wholesome foods are, so --
R:  That's what I was just thinking when you were saying that was -- yeah, it's like junk food of TV.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And that it's so easy for people to just, like you say, it's -- it's mind candy and that they can turn it on, not really get involved, and it doesn't matter where it goes.
L:  And unfortunately it's gotten to that point though, because it's a ha- -- you know, you're hard pressed to come up with an alternative, even if you have cable solutions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, even the premium channels, because a lot of the, uh, the movies and such really are an art form.  I've noticed the -- a decline even in Bravo.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, you know, where it used to be a lot more in terms of, you know, a lot more art type films and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and foreign films and all, and they're not doing that too much.  I'm surprised, you know, that [SIGH] I've seen a shift in their whole zone or -- so [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Huh, that's -- that's a shame.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I didn't know that.  Uh, I -- I don't follow Bravo anymore.  I used to when Twin Peaks was on [LAUGH] but, uh --
L:  Oh, was it on Bravo, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That might have been the turn then. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  Oh, really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There -- there was the demise --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- David Lynch.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Once again. [LAUGH]
L:  That there was the infection right, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That was a bug descended on Bravo. [MN]
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  What a -- what a funny, uh, topic.  When they -- when they said, "Reality shows", I'm, like, "Uh-oh".
L:  [LAUGH] What was your topic yesterday?
R:  Oh, gosh, what was it?  Um, you know, to be honest with you, I can't even think of it.  I was --
L:  Um, I remember the to- -- 'cause I just signed up for this the night before last --
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  -- and I was so surprised that yesterday, right away, a call.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And right now, right away, a call, and, you know, and I wonder if I've missed any, but, um, I -- I guess I wasn't anticipating being called this frequently or this soon, you know, two and two.
R:  Yeah, I just got back and there was a message that they had called and s- -- and I had the number, so I called in, and it's, like, "Okay, you wanna talk?  We'll hook you up".
L:  Oh, so it does leave a message, then?
R:  Yeah, yeah, they do.  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was funny, too, 'cause they go, "Yeah, today's topic is --" and it was something else, you know, and I'm, like --
L:  Oh, so I guess it's part of that whole random rotation?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Yesterday's topic for us was, um, as best I could hear it, it was, like, what do you consider the w-  -- the worst evil and, um, and I guess the general topic was personal habits.
R:  That's -- yeah, you're right.  And I -- yeah, gossiping was my, uh, I -- I thought that was the worst because --
L:  You thought that was the worst?  More so than alcohol?
R:  Well, yeah, because alcohol is self, uh, inflicted.  Gossiping is something that usually hurts somebody else, and I thought, "Well, you know, that's -- that's not a very positive --", uh, you know?  And I -- it's just not a good thing to do.  Now, I may -- may have misunderstood the topic, but, uh, [MN] you know, I -- I -- I drink a little alcohol.  I'm not, uh, abusive, by no means.
L:  A teetotaler, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- you know, I have a glass of wine or a beer occasionally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I'm at the age now where all that other stuff, you know, I just -- I got away from it, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, smoking, same thing.  If you smoke, you know, you're -- you're hurting yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Secondhand smoke will kill us all, but, uh --
L:  Right, but when you said that's self inflicted with the alcoholism, I thought of secondhand drinking, you know, sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the people -- I -- I mean, fortunately, we've been blessed that I don't have that in my family in terms of any, um, alcoholism, but [LIPSMACK] I've certainly see it affect other families, and interestingly enough, it wasn't one that popped to mind, but I became more conscious of it, because the gentleman that I was speaking with yesterday told me he had seventeen years of sobriety under his belt, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, um --
R:  So, it hit home, uh?
L:  So, for him it really did, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was still kind of e- eliminating, I was in the eliminating phase and then he just piped right up and said no, that it was alcohol.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, that kind of, uh, you know, just kind of zeroed in for both of us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when we started talking.  So, what do you --
R:  So, anyway, you -- you're -- you're into TV?  What do you watch?
L:  Yeah, well, I wish I could be.  You know, I mean, I'm at a point in my life where I'm consist- -- uh, constantly going.  I don't have a moment to take a breather.  I've got two young sons, you know, and, uh, I've got a -- quite a bit of a commute between home and where they go to school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  My mom lives with us, she's eighty and she has Parkinson's, so that's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one of the reasons that I've decided to step away from corporate America and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] freelance from home and just focus on the kids and -- and the mother for now.
R:  Well, that's -- that's -- that's very, very nice of you, I mean --
L:  So, it --
R:  -- that -- it -- it -- it's a -- quite a --
L:  It's my calling for now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and it's quite a -- quite a load that you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you've taken on.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, you know, because of that, I find myself just ... constantly on the go, you know, I'm sure some women and some people in general, 'cause I've known men this way, that are just, you know, awesome housekeepers and it's just systematic for them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's not me, so it takes [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it takes up -- and I -- I wasn't born with that, you know, domesticity dream or whatever that comes with these people, but [MN] [LIPSMACK] so it's a little bit more challenging for me, and there's nothing I like better than just, you know, dropping down with a book when I can, or you know, just phasing out for a little bit before I go to sleep.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it took me for years to, uh, to catch up on all the old reruns of -- of Frasier.  That was my first --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- that was my comeback into the world, was watching late night Frasier, all the years that I'd missed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Yeah, but -- go ahead.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  No, I was just going to say -- but, you know, now that I'm -- now that the boys are a little older and I can kind of cruise a little bit on the TV and surf round and see what's happening, I -- again, I find myself hard pressed, I just go channel after channel after channel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I didn't find that I was even making time for TV except, unfortunately, you know, for the last war coverage and all, then I realized that, "Oh yeah, if there's something I really want to watch, then I will make time for it".  Um --
R:  And that's -- that's your m- -- your masculine side coming out.
L:  What's that?
R:  Channel surfing.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's -- you know, I mean, there -- there's a bunch of -- i- it all seems segmented, you know?  You can either watch, uh, like, the WB classification, where it's all that -- that e type stuff out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, where you find all those home type shows in the upper c- cable channels, or [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know, but, uh, even network, those used to be the -- the king and, uh, you can't even really distinguish them when you're clicking through.
R:  Right, yeah.  It's -- it's, uh, the whole -- the whole thing, even the -- the movies and the theatres have gotten so, uh, [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nobody -- nobody writes anything creative anymore.
L:  No, no.  I remember they had, uh, I would say the equivalent of those was made for television movies back in the seventies, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where [SIGH] where you would have something of epic proportions and they'd bring in an artist from -- from yesteryear or something, you know, or -- and -- and make it a real feature [LIPSMACK] and then have, uh, whatever night at the movies, and that was a big deal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be able to tune into something like that.  I'm sure I'm --
R:  Yeah, I'm a -- I'm a sixties child, so I -- I grew up with kind of, you know, the old Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse show and --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  God, those -- those were just gold.  But, I mean they're --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- absolute classics, you know, and --
L:  We still play -- I mean, my kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We, y- you know, you -- you -- just the other day, you know, 'cause we had moved last summer and I had, uh, that's one of the things that hadn't gotten unpacked, is still stored up somewhere, and I told them, "We need to break those videos out", you know?  It -- it's been a while, you know, and I start naming off titles, and they were getting excited too, you know, like, "Yeah, we need to find --
