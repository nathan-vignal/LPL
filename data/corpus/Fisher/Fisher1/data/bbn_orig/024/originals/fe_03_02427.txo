R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.  I've never done this before.  My name is Margerie.  We should stick to the topic.
R:  Yes. Ah, okay, wonderful.  My name is Pascal.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah, so we have a choice of personal -- from what I guess they're, ah, they're considering bad habits.
R:  Yes.
L:  That seems to be the implication.
R:  Yes.
L:  I have several of them.  Do you?
R:  Oh.  Well, ah, I don't, ah -- I mean, I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol -- 
L:  I do both of those things.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but, I don't stick to a perfect diet [inaudible] [LAUGH] and I don't exercise enough.
L:  Ah, I exercise a lot [several inaudible words] --
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, [LAUGH] where shall -- so, we're, ah, coming from two different, um, points of view a- or two different life experiences -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- regarding our personal habits.
R:  Yes.
L:  Are we in different locations?  I'm in New York city.
R:  I'm in, ah, California.
L:  And, ah, I've been to California where people do have different personal habits in California -- 
R:  Yeah, I think it's -- yeah, actually I'm originally from Switzerland.  And, ah -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah, over there everybody smokes and that's -- that was one of my incentive to move to this -- to the States, to California because here is the no smoking environment, and I really enjoy it.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  From the point of view of a smoking New Yorker, ah, one thinks more and more of moving to Europe.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I've been to -- I've been to New York a couple of times and now they have also passed the law that, ah, that you cannot smoke, um, in -- in like in bars or -- or in restaurant or something -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause I see a lot of, ah -- ah, New Yorkers smoking outside of buildings.
L:  Yes, that's the -- [inaudible] personal habits.  A question of personal habit -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ah, becomes, ah -- ah, kind of social habits because [MN] that, you know, it -- it blocks the streets or actually, you know, like pedestrians -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are -- have become more involved in the life of smokers than they were when smokers could smoke indoors.
R:  Yes, that's true.  That's true.  But, um, one -- you know, the -- the thing that I -- I had experienced before is that I always had, ah, guests over for dinner and things like this at my home and, ah, and first I was tolerating, ah, smoke -- smoking and, um, and it was like -- I think that whenever you have, like, ten smokers together they tend to smoke more.  And I was really like, you know, I couldn't breath it anymore.  So, after a while I said, "Well, you know, could you just smoke outside" and in -- I think that in, you know, in my country it's like, ah, well, you know, then you're not social if you don't al- allow the, you know, smokers to smoke in an evening or if you have guests.  And here I -- I realise that I have, ah, friends who smoke also in California.  You know, French friends or things like this.  But, they do, ah, they usually go outside on the patio to smoke and we have a great weather here so it's easier for -- for smokers -- 
L:  In California, yes.
R:  -- yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Usually you do, yes.
R:  Yeah, and do you exercise too?  Do you exercise a lot because -- do you have, like, a -- a gym pass or -- 
L:  Well, I [MN] -- well, I'm actually a dancer.  So, exercising -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is -- is -- is, another -- the personal habit is, um, is sort of a by-product of -- of, um -- you know, I don't really exercise to exercise, but exercise with the aim that it's -- it's, ah, you know, it's going to result and [LAUGH] work a lot, but it is.  So, I guess you could make some r- relationship between habits and, ah, and -- and art which is a way of trying to, ah -- ah -- ah, break habits -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And yet, what has happened -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I do, um, I do swim as an exercise and I do walk, ah, but, ah, I just cannot force myself go for [several inaudible words] --
L:  Do you walk in California?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Do you walk in California?
R:  I do.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That's [LAUGH] -- that's how people know you're a European.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I've [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] -- I know.  In New York it's like, "Come in things to walk" and, um, no.  I have to say that I walk more when I'm in New York than here.  But, I usually go for walks here, you know, I just, ah -- I live, ah, in New Port Beach.  It's south of, ah, Los Angeles.  And, um, I'm by the -- by the ocean.  And -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- ah, we -- and we have a [several inaudible words].  So, I usually go for, like, you know, an hour walk or I go to the -- to the swimming pool of the complex I live in and I usually swim an hour.  And I do this like five times a week.  But -- like, a- usually from March to November, you know.  But, in December, January, February, March I have a -- I have a hard time [several inaudible words] doing exercise and, ah, so, you know.  I mean, it's great.  I mean, I -- I did some dance before, um, you know, when I was younger, ah, but, um, I just, ah -- that's wonderful that you're dancing.  It's, ah -- so, are you a -- a -- a classical ballet dancer or jazz or -- 
L:  Ah, well, ah -- ah -- ah, those are [several inaudible words] what shall I call it, I -- I wouldn't exactly call it bad habits.  But, um [LAUGH], but, I -- you know, I've -- I've had some training in all those things.  But, I -- you know, I've -- I've had some training in all those things.  But, I -- I guess the kind of dancing I do -- but, let's not get off on that.  And, um, like, I think we're supposed to, um, try to stay on [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'd love to talk about my dancing and I guess I could relate it to a habit.  But, it's also, ah, in fact -- well, actually -- actually the nature of practising -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, which is, you know, a form of habit.  There's, um -- um, there is, ah, you know, you -- you kind of practise 'til it becomes a habit, when you become aware that you're doing habitual things, you're practising -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to break habits and yet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're practising to develop habits.  I was interested in what you said about -- 'cause I think that's true about, ah, smokers smoke more when they're together.  Ah, do you think that's also true with these other possibilities they threw at us like overeaters and -- and --  
R:  Ah, yeah.  Um, well -- 
L:  -- alcoholics -- do you -- you -- alcoholics do drink more if they get together, right?
R:  Yeah, that's right.  Ah, that's right.  I -- I, ah, I see when -- when I go to parties and people -- ah -- ah, I mean, I had experience in the past with, ah, with people that, ah -- with like boyfriends that, ah, would drink more if, you know, we go to a party and there's, like, a lot of alcohol in there, you know?  I- if the -- if there is an occasion people are going to drink or they're going to smoke, you know, ah, I would not say the same thing for eating because, I mean, usually I would say that I eat more.  Ah, I have the bad habit to eat more when I'm alone than when I'm with -- around people.
L:  So, [several inaudible words] and so we can't really generalize about habits in general.  Each one th- that, you know, 'cause I -- I think you're -- I think right.  I think I eat more when I'm alone myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um -- 
R:  I think -- I think it's the -- I mean, there's some people that have -- that would eat more if they go to a restaurant with friends.  You know, that's where they tend to overeat.  But, um, for my personal experience it's I would eat more when I'm alone because I think that, ah, I -- I, um, I tend to compensate more, ah, food, you know like, ah -- ah, loneliness or +boredom or whatever with food.  So, I would do this when I'm alone.  And, ah, you know, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's another topic.  Loneliness and habits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And with restaurants that -- well, [inaudible] I -- I -- I -- there's also the question of economics isn't there.  And I know that, ah, you know, there's a certain feeling when you're -- you're paying for this food and, you know, it's sort of embarrassing to take home a doggie bag.  So, I'm tempted to, you know, it's my -- you know, finish it.  Like, that's -- that's another kind of habit training.  Like you're, you know, you're parental training to, you know, eat what's on your plate.  Whereas at home, if you cook for yourself, you know, you could put it away and, you know, you can -- you know, nobody sees if you throw it out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, but I mean a- th- com- compared to, um, the habit we have, ah, in Europe, ah, we don't have the habit to take a doggie bag.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  That's wonderful here because you don't have to finish your -- your plate, you know?  You could just -- okay, you know, I'm -- I'm not going to finish that, I'm going to just going take it home and, ah, you know.  But, um, yeah, I would say that, ah, that's the -- the huge difference.
L:  Oh, that's right.  And Europeans -- um -- um -- I think that the last time I was in Europe was in ninety eight actually.  And, ah, um, their habit does seem to be to always kind of leave something on the plate.  That may -- may -- may be the illusion of -- of plentitude which wasn't always the case.  I mean, ah, well, it's never the case for everybody but even, ah, you know, middle class Europeans certainly suffered during the war -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, and I'm thrilled to think that, you know, we're free of that.  I -- I -- it's something I noticed with people, you know, leaving things behind on their plate almost, um, self-consciously.
R:  Yeah, and -- and, ah, and, ah, i- if you take Europe and not come here and, ah, and -- I mean, the first time I came here and I ate and then the -- you know, I didn't finish because I was -- the portions here are huge compared to what we have -- 
L:  There's that too.  [LAUGH] Yes -- 
R:  -- we have over there.  And then the -- the -- the -- the -- the waiter said, "Do you want a d- do you want a, you know, do you want to take this home?"  And I was, like, "Excuse me?"  [LAUGH] That's -- that's really a -- a different -- you now, a huge difference of, ah, behaviour.  But, ah, you know, just, ah -- 
L:  Well, back to smoking [MN] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I -- I recall the same trip that I took in -- in ninety eight which was actually the last time I was in Europe and, um, and already the anti-smoking, um, mania had a- forgive me, 'cause you don't like smoke, but, um, had taken over in this country.  So, I was very discreet and said, "Would you mind if I smoke?"  It's just that well, you know, that sort of was just so comical that I would ask the question.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think that the -- yeah, I think it's, ah -- but, I mean, I'm sure if you go, like, to, ah, um, like the mid west or -- or -- or, you know, like, ah, Texas or things like this.  I mean, everybody smokes, you know, I mean, the -- the ratio -- I think the ratio's like, ah, maybe in California eighty percent of people do not smoke and, um, twenty percent do smoke.  And if you go, like, in another -- even if you go to Nevada, to Los Vegas, you know, the ratio is reverse.  I mean, there's a lot of people that are smoking there.
L:  Oh, well that -- d- do -- can they smoke in gambling casinos do you suppose?  I've never been there.
R:  Oh, yes.  You -- you -- you can -- you can smoke, oh, everywhere, yeah.  When you go to casinos you have -- you have that, oh, huge smoke, you know?  I mean, yeah, yeah, of course.  I mean, they would never -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] it must be very stressful, um, you now, winning and losing.  [LAUGH] Anoth- another habit which isn't -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- on our list of habits to talk about.
R:  Do you smoke, ah -- do you smoke at work or do you smoke, like, ah -- 
L:  I'm not allowed to smoke at -- well -- well, I mean, I can smoke when I work in my, um, in my apartment.  But, um, but even, you know, even, you now, dance studios where you --
