L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Carla.
R:  Hi, this is Bonnie.
L:  [MN]
R:  This is only my second time doing this, so --
L:  Me too, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I was trying to -- i- initially I thought she said, "Audi TV" and then I realised she was saying, "No, reality TV".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, talk about a language study.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  So, do you watch reality TV?
R:  You know, the only ones -- I -- I started watching Survivor when it first came, because it was new, when it first came out, and then there was another one and another one and another one --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and another one --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I didn't.  The only one I've really watched was Joe Millionaire.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just because I wanted to see the end, how mad the women were going to get to find out that he really wasn't a millionaire.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, uh, I'm a Star, Get Me Out of Here.
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.
R:  Um, it -- it's already over.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  They put -- they put about a dozen -- a dozen, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Hollywood stars in the Amazon for --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- I don't know how many weeks and they had --
L:  And they were all screaming, "Get me out of here" --
R:  Oh, yeah, they had to --
L:  -- the first show, right?
R:  -- they had to rough it.  No, actually, nobody left.
L:  Oh.
R:  They got voted off the last week of the show through viewers, but nobody -- nobody left, I was surprised.  Well, you know, they had to --
L:  Well, hey, I'd be surprised at that too.
R:  They had to make -- each of -- each of 'em had to make themselves seem better than the next, you know?
L:  Mm.  Hm, well, I don't really watch a whole lot of television, but my kids from time to time have it on some of these shows.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I did watch -- I have to admit, I did watch Joe Millionaire, because I wanted to see the ending too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's nothing that ticked me off more than when they prolonged it past the episode it looked like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they were going to give the ending to.  Oh, what a waste.
R:  A- and you to wait another week for two hours of -- of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, fluff in the front and then -- and then he finally, I guess, told her at the end.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Yeah, that's the only one I watched.
L:  Well, the backlash for me is I'm not going to bother watching the [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- the next one like that.  Oh, you know what?  There is one that I saw, just a- an episode or two of that I thought was really funny, and that's the one, uh, mm [LIPSMACK] it's the dating one, where, like, three -- for your -- for your kids or something, and, um, like, your daughter or your son and the parents choose.
R:  Oh, Meet the Parents.
L:  Meet the Parents.
R:  Yeah, oh, you know what?  Now that you say that, I've watched that too, just off and on.
L:  I thought that w- -- I watched it -- I think I've watched it, like, three times, and I just thought that was funnier than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all get out, and a part of me felt sorry for them, the other part of me felt like, "Well, you know --"
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  "-- you're learning that it doesn't pay to lie". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I liked --
L:  Because those lie detectors would kill --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'em in the end. [LAUGH]
R:  I liked that, but I -- I -- after I saw a couple of shows, it was, like, after the lie detector tests and this and that, you know, as far as --
L:  Then it lost its uniqueness.
R:  Yeah, as far as some of the stuff that the couples had done, that the parents were watching on video and stuff like that, like out at the jacuzzi or in the pool --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it takes two to tango --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, and you're putting some woman or a man on a lie detector test, everybody's got a past.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, no one's perfect, we've all done things we're not proud of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And these -- th- they're making their decisions on these women based on, you know, how many people they've slept with, how many drinks they have when they go out and, you know, stuff --
L:  I think, you know, the biggest --
R:  -- I'm sure the son doesn't really care. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think the biggest eye opener to the parents was that their kids are -- are real adults.
R:  Yeah, they are the way they are.
L:  That was a -- that wa- -- yeah.  And it, you know, it -- you -- you're surprised that your kids would fall into that class and do some of that stuff --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- but they're -- they're just human beings like everybody else.
R:  I have a nineteen year old daughter and I always -- I'd had said to her, "Look, when you start having sex with your boyfriend, please come to me first.  Don't do it first, come to me first so we can discuss it, do the Planned Parenthood thing, or you know, do what we have to do" and she actually did, and it was, like, "Oh my God, I can't believe she's doing this". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, oh, jeez.
L:  Well, you know, it's not a bad thing.  I have a twenty one year old daughter, and when I dropped her off at college, 'cause she kept saying, "No, no, no.  I don't wanna to talk to you about it" and I've always been pretty open about -- about, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sex in general --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we talk about it in our house, actually, and it embarrasses the kids to no end.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  But I feel like unless you normalize it, they won't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, wh- when I dropped my daughter off at college, the number one on my checklist was figuring out where Planned Parenthood was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and showing it to her, so that if she doesn't feel comfortable coming to me, at least she knew there was someplace else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go.
R:  Well, we did the same thing.  We started going to Planned Parenthood, but then it got into the where I didn't even have to go with her anymore, she was sixteen, and it was -- I would call to make her appointments, and they're, "If -- if you're not Shannon, we can't talk to you", "What do you mean?  This is my daughter --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I'm being a responsible parent, making an appointment for her so she has no babies, and you're telling me I can't?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Well, she doesn't really even have to tell you", I'm like, "What?" [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, wow.  Well, they did the same, I mean, once my -- I sent my daughter off to college, because she went young, so she was still not eighteen, it didn't matter, they won't share anything with you, they --
R:  No, I was so surprised at that.  You would figure, because you're trying to be a good parent and, you know, they didn't like me a little bit, but [LIPSMACK] they're s- --
L:  No, they're afraid you're actually a really bad parent checking up on them --
R:  [MN] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you're can be sweet as all get out and it won't -- they won't buy it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I was, like, uh, "Who do you think brings her to these appointments, you know?  I sit in that waiting room and wait for her".
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  And now that she's nineteen I have, you know, I have nothing to do with it.
L:  But, you know, the reverse of that -- that Meet the Parents thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- w- was Meet the Kids.  Did you see that one?
R:  No.
L:  I think there was only one episode.
R:  I never even heard of that.
L:  Yeah, it was Meet the Kids, and it was this, uh, uh, single mom with three grown adult boys.
R:  Oh, jeez.
L:  Yeah, and then they brought in these three men, which apparently they must have prescreened as matching in some way, because they -- it was real clear from the early introduction that they'd already met --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- previously, and, um, so I figure they must have done some prescreening to come up with these three jokers, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, those boys were just ruthless.
R:  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, I bet.
L:  Oh, they were just ruthless.  And what was really sad at the end is a mo- -- the mother was trying to use reverse psychology, 'cause they were going to pick somebody who they didn't want their mom to get 'cause she -- she w- -- they were tired of seeing her date losers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, on one of the elimination -- the very first elimination rounds, the guy she felt most, uh, attached to, she tried to do some reverse, um, psychology, ah, saying, you know, she didn't have a lot of interest in him, thinking that, "Well, that's not someone Mom would normally date, so we should keep him".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And instead, the opposite happened --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- they let him go first! [LAUGH]
R:  No way!
L:  And then it was just two losers, in my view --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that were left. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I never heard that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I never heard of that at all.
L:  So, it was -- it was -- it wasn't so much as a funny show as it was, um, and it -- it's all very, very humorous, there's definitely something humorous about putting a man on a hot seat, and about --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- l- lying and --
R:  Watch him squirm. [LAUGH]
L:  -- finding some of those -- yeah, because they brought in past girlfriends that were -- you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- these men, and they did show videos and they, you know, they told things that these guys had done.  Like, I guess one guy was an artist and apparently someone had told, uh, some of, you know, and his friends, someone had told that what he had done in a restaurant previously was, um, um, picked up change from another table, the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- waitress' tip, to pay his own bill.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  It's, like, ew. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, but --
L:  But --
R:  -- something like that, I mean, you know --
L:  Those nasty little traits you really don't want anybody to know about. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But it's not something that -- that -- it's, you know, it's not gonna affect you for the rest of your life if your daughter --
L:  No, but --
R: -- dates this man.
L:  -- you know, they -- they came up with the weirdest little things like that, and it was just sort of an -- this just weird sinking feeling.  It's, like, you know, I really don't want to know this stuff about these guys. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- yeah, yeah.
L: [LAUGH] But, you know what?  The only show I've really -- I watch, you know, one here and one there, and it's, like, beyond that, they just don't capture my --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- imagination much.
R:  Well, I'm sitting here, the -- the other one I did watch -- me, I -- "Oh, I don't watch any", and now they're coming up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Big Brother, the very first Big Brother, did you see that one, when they put those, like, ten people in the house and --
L:  No, I only saw n- -- I only saw, like, news reports and clippings on it.
R:  Okay, that was --
L:  But I never actually watched any of it.
R:  -- that was really good, because it was the second one after the Survivor --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so it was the next one, but a different one, other -- you know, unlike Survivor and that -- that was really good.  I liked that.
L:  Oh, interesting.  There's just no way I'd be chained in a house with a bunch of strangers like that.
R:  Ah, i- -- I don't know.  You know, what I li- -- I like the Extreme Makeover show.  I went online last night and tried to get an application.  It's twelve pages long --
L:  Oh, you're kidding me.
R:  -- the application, it's so much writing and videos and pictures you have to send, but I guess if you really wanna do it, you're gonna do it.  But --
L:  Oh, isn't that -- isn't that truly an extreme show, I mean --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- don't they do, like, liposuction and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- facelifts and all kind of stuff?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  All kinds of dental work, and, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I saw the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- commercials and I just kinda went, "OOh".
R:  Can you imagine the money you're saving though?  I mean, if you -- if you really wanted to do all those things?
L:  For going on the show, they pay for everything?
R:  I believe so.  I don't think you pay a dime.
L:  I think what I'd really hate is if they s- suggested that you -- they pick something [LAUGH] you don't want fixed.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "Oh, wait a minute, I thought that was one of my good features".
R:  [LAUGH] We all have, probably as far women, we all have the same couple of things we want to fix.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I watch that too, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was flipping channels last night and I -- all I saw was a face -- a nose -- something different about some girl's nose.
R:  Oh yeah, this lady had the worst nose.  Oh, my God.
L:  Did she have a really bad nose?
R:  Yes, it --
L:  'Cause I flipped -- continued flipping channels when I saw that she was just going to cry.
R:  It looked like she kept walking -- it -- she would walk into walls.  It was -- it was big --
L:  It was really bad?
R:  -- and crooked, and -- she looked -- it was manly.  She looked like a football player or a boxer or somebody that got hit in the nose too often.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she was -- she was -- she was very pretty, by the end of it, by the time they did her hair and her make up and she had liposuction and breast implants and teeth done and it's, like, "Wow".
L:  Oh, my word.
