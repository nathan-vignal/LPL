R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Melissa.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm fabulous.
L:  Do you watch --
R:  What shows do you watch?
L:  I watch Survivor, um, Big Brother and, although I'm embarrassed to admit it, I watch The Bachelor. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] So do I. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I must admit my favorite one was Joe Millionaire.  I was addicted.
L:  Oh, see, I watched -- I watched that one and I was just disgusted --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- by it.  I don't know why I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but it was like this horrific addiction that I couldn't stop watching it.
R:  I know.  I agree.  I got married during -- while it was, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- going through the time when it was playing and, like, on my honeymoon I was, like, "Stop --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- gotta catch it".
L:  Oh, my husband would have killed me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, he wasn't very happy.
L:  Yeah, my husband --
R:  But, yeah.
L:  -- last night, I -- I was watching The Bachelor and he saw me and he was, like, "Oh, my, not again". [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know.  
L:  Okay, so why do you like reality shows so much?
R:  I -- I don't know.  I think it, like, gives me a glimpse into somebody else's life to live vicariously through it.
L:  Yo, isn't that sad though?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, that's why I do it too, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, I don't know, I'm, like, you know, wife, couple of kids.  It gives me my escape.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  Is that why you watch it too?
L:  Yeah, probably, and, well, do you watch Survivor?
R:  A little bit.  Not very much.
L:  Okay, 'cause that one -- that's the first one I watched and I liked it because I liked seeing how other people interacted and how they, you know, what went through their minds and why they made the choices they did and ...
R:  Right.
L:  It's just interesting to see how other people think and why they make their decisions.  [MN] That's probably why I watch it too, to see how other people live, you know.
R:  Right.  I agree.  I mean, I watched the first season of Survivor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that kind of gave me a bad taste because so many people seemed conniving.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It -- I mean -- I would hope that in real life people didn't deal with me that way on a daily basis even though I'm sure they do.
L:  Right.
R:  And that bothered me a little bit.  
L:  Yeah, I could see that but it's also, at least, like, Survivor is a game.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  I mean, the whole point of the game, I mean, they say it is to outlive, outlast and outwit or something like that, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- can't remember [MN] so in shows like that I'm, like, "Okay, they're supposed to do whatever they can to win this money but then, like, you know, Joe Millionaire --"
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  They [LAUGH] -- that was just weird.
R:  I hate to admit I was so addicted to that show though.
L:  I know.
R:  It was something that I couldn't contain.
L:  I know.  So was I.
R:  You know, and then I have, like, this huge fantasy in my head of what these people are really like and now that it's over and you're seeing them in the media it's totally different.
L:  Oh, see, I don't -- I haven't seen them in the media, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  [MN]
R:  I mean --
L:  So, what are they like?
R:  Just totally different.  Like, that Ted Evan Marriott --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- completely, seems like such a different individual.  It seemed like he had, you know, some of the solid foundations in life that we desire in an individual.
L:  Right.
R:  And now he seems so different.  He seems so fake.
L:  Hm.
R:  And that bothers me, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it almost seemed like during the show though he was, like, "Oh, I'm doing this so I can get TV time and" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  "-- so people can get to know me and ..."
R:  Exactly.
L:  Oh.
R:  I agree.  What do you think about the new bachelor?
L:  [MN] Um, well, I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that he's gonna pick Kristin.
R:  Do you?
L:  But I wish he'd -- I wish he'd pick Jen.
R:  Me too.
L:  I like Jen.  She's my favorite.
R:  I agree.  [MN]
L:  I mean, he says things, like -- and she complements him so well.
R:  I know, and that's what I'm looking for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it seems to me such a carnal thing with him and that --
L:  You think?
R:  I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, I guess, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I -- he's not my favorite one they've had yet.
L:  [MN]  Now, see, I've only watched this one and the one before, the one with --
R:  Really?
L:  -- Trista, the Bachelorette.
R:  Right.  What did you think of that one?
L:  I totally wanted her to pick Ryan and didn't think she would and so I was so excited when she did.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I agree.  And I think that she caught so much bad publicity for it due to the fact that she was a female.
L:  Really?
R:  And that really bothered me.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, about how she kissed too many men and she did this, she did that.  And I -- that kind of irritated me a little bit.
L:  Oh, you see --
R:  Because --
L:  -- I didn't hear that but no -- I d- -- no one's saying that about this new guy, it doesn't seem like.
R:  Exactly.  And he's kissing every one of them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Every day.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And he gets upset when he gets a cheek.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  [LAUGH]  So true.
L:  Like, good for you, girls.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I just think that, I mean, seriously, I think the whole reason why I watch it is just to simply live vicariously through others.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and to see maybe how the other side of the world thinks, because a lot of my single girlfriends are, like, "Oh, we do th- -- we do exactly that".
L:  Hm.
R:  And it's no different.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I would never -- I don't think I could ever sell my soul and do that.  [MN]
L:  No, I don't think I could either.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean.  Oh, have you watched that one, Extreme Makeovers?
L:  Huh-uh.  I haven't seen that one.
R:  Oh, it's on after The Bachelor.  [MN] These people have, like, thousands of dollars of cosmetic surgery.
L:  [MN] Hm.
R:  And then, like, reappear to their family and, like, these women leave their husband and kids for, like, six weeks.
L:  [MN] And do they know what they're going to do?
R:  Yeah, they're having, like, face lifts and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Lasix and tummy tucks and breast augmentation and -- it's a very interesting show.
L:  Oh, here's another reality TV show I watch although I don't know if you'd call it reality, um, oh, I used to watch it when I had cable, what's the name of it?  Trading Spaces.
R:  Oh, I love that show.
L:  [LAUGH]  Isn't that one good?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Now, see, that one I like because I'm, like, "Oh, I could do that in my house" or it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  --  gives me ideas to be daring with colors --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I would paint my walls or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that.  [MN]
R:  Nah, I really liked that show too.  [MN]  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Do you ever watch --
R:  Trying to think of --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you ever --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you ever watch the one, um, like the ones about, I don't know, police shows and [MN] all those kind of reality shows?
R:  Not really.  They kind of leave a bad taste in my mouth.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  So ...
L:  But it seems like, okay, that's private, you know, I don't really want to know all this.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  This is kind of weird.
R:  I kind of tr- -- tend to gravitate towards the ones that have less scandal in them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm looking for adventure but not that much adventure.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um, have you ever -- oh, another one that I watched -- I used to watch a lot was, um, the show on MTV called The Real World.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I watched --
R:  -- and then the Osbournes.
L:  -- that a long time ago.  Oh, see I've never watched the Osbournes 'cause I really, I don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  I was really young when Ozzy Osbourne was really popular and he just really grossed me out.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Eating grass and stuff.  I'm like, "I don't want to have anything to do with that show".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I think that my -- my whole problem with it is, is, um, my kids are twelve and thirteen and if my children acted like that I would beat them.  I would be forced to.  I mean, the kids --
L:  So why did you like it?
R:  [MN]  How can people in that much dysfunction actually function?  I was always waiting to see the moment where they actually function.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And it never happened.  And part of it is is that my husband is a big fan of Ozzy Osbourne.
L:  Ah.
R:  He was real into Black Sabbath so he more got me into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's very different though.  I mean I couldn't imagine my girls actually even approaching me in that manner.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  But, [MN] yeah, I don't know, but I watched the first season and then when I found out they were coming out with the second season I just couldn't bring myself to, oh, no.
L: Yeah. 
R:  Did you ever watch the Anna Nicole Show?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  Oh!
L:  I've never even heard of that one.
R:  Ah, y- you know who Anna Nicole Smith is, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, she had her own, it was similar to the Osbournes.
L:  Hm.
R:  And she just -- I watched it once and that was all it took.
L:  Yeah, see, ones like that, like, well, I haven't seen that one but -- well, I haven't heard of that one but the Ozzy Osbourne one, I just think that's just almost well, like you said, it's so dysfunctional.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't know.  Maybe it makes people feel better.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, maybe things are messed up but at least it's not that bad.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH]  Never thought of it like that.  [MN]  But, I don't know, I enjoy reality shows and my girls and I watch them a lot together which is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  So, do you let your twelve and thirteen year olds watch, like, The Bachelor, with you?
R:  [MN]  No.
L:  [LAUGH]  So what do they watch with you?
R:  Well, they've watched Joe Millionaire with me quite a bit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we were really intrigued by that and then, um, they're into Survivor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They'll watch it every once in a while because they swear that that's exactly how middle school is for them.  All about --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- who can survive.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's a very good analogy.
R:  So, you know, they're like, "Oh, I would do that to my friend" or "I would do that", you know.  So, I mean, I think that they -- it gives them, like, a different perspective on how others act and it more gives --
L:  Right.
R:  -- me time to sit down with them and ask them, you know, would you do that or could you see yourself or --
L:  Or how would you feel if someone did that to you?
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's probably a good --
