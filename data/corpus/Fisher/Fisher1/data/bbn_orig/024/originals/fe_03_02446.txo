R:  Hey, what's up?
L:  Hi there.  How are you?
R:  How's it going?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  How's it going?
L:  Oh, not bad.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is my first time doing this.
R:  I -- it's only my second time.  It's still a little weird getting used to it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  They totally picked the right topic for me though 'cause I watch way too much reality TV.
L:  Ah, you know, I've been wat- -- I've been watching like, um, pretty often in the past month --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I -- I don't know if it's just like a large flux of it.  I've never watched this much reality [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- television in my life because I used to see, like, whatever on MTV and what not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, it's just, like, I skip all the sitcoms and go --
R:  I know.
L:  -- straight to the reality.
R:  Me too.  It's ridiculous.  Which ones have you been watching?
L:  I -- I've been, lately I've been hooked on, um, ah, Mr. Personality.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That was crazy, right, the first episode where that guy flipped out on her?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I s- -- I didn't see the first episode.  What happened?
R:  Oh, it was nuts.  It was, like, he took the mask off and he's like, "And I just wanna tell you something, you're --" 'cause they had a psychic come in and give, like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- their astrological profiles --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and he flipped out.  He's like, "How are you gonna let a psychic, you know, dictate who's the right man for you".  He just looked stark raving mad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was he even, like, good looking and what not?
R:  No, that's the thing and he's only, like, your average looking guy.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But then they profiled him the next day on, like, one of those TV shows like Excess Hollywood and they were, like, yeah, he's -- he, you know, says that he's a mascot for a football team or something but he's actually unemployed.  It's like [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, I think she made the right choice.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's good.  Did you see the, um, the last episode?  Um, I think Pete got kicked off?  
R:  He --
L:  Was that the last one?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I taped it this week.  I haven't even gotten a chance to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- sit down and watch it.
L:  Oh, I don't wanna -- I don't wanna spoil it for you then.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's --
L:  But, ah, she kicked off the guy that I thought was, like, the cutest one --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of the bunch.  [MN]  And --
R:  Was he the Asian guy?
L:  Oh, no, he was cute too but, you know, when -- okay, yeah, he did get kicked off.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when he, um, when he took off the m- -- ah, mask, she said that she was not attracted to him at all.
R:  Really?
L:  So, maybe it could have been because he was Asian or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what not but I thought he was, like, really tall, like, like, really, I thought he was a really good looking guy too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  So, I was really surprised when she said that.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But another good looking guy got kicked off and he was, like, my personal favorite.  I'm, like, oh, she's gonna regret it and once he took off the mask she said she was so surprised, she's like, oh, my God, he's such a cutie pie.
R:  Ah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I was, like, he was, I think he was, probably, like, him and Peter were probably, like, the best looking of the bunch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now they're gone.
L:  Oh, man, now she's stuck with all these [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, Pete seemed like a normal guy too.  That's what I liked about him.  Like, he seemed really straightforward.  He's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I'm not really quite sure what I'm doing right now and it's so, like they said in the prompter, like why do people like reality shows.  I think that's why because [MN] you're watching real people that have, like, the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- same issues as you do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's kinda refreshing.  It's not like Friends --
L:  Like closer to home, yeah.
R:  Yeah, with this, like, amazing apartment and they're all supposedly struggling this and that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's like, oh, you can totally --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- identify with just being at that point in your life.  You're like, I don't know what I'm doing but [LAUGH] ...
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  What do you think of --
R:  Do you watch Survivor at all?
L:  You know, I did.  You know, I watched the first time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it came out, but I haven't been, like, following it at all.  I was hooked on, like, Temptation Island.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I was really upset when, like, they're not -- I don't think they're playing it any more, or wasn't it ...
R:  I know, it was so much fun.
L:  It's the trashier it is, the more I love it, you know.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm a sucker for trash and, like [LAUGH] ...
R:  Did you see Love Cruise?  A lot of people missed that one --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but it was so trashy and fun.
L:  No, no.  What -- what was that about?
R:  It was evil.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was done by the same people who do the Real World, so you know they know how to, like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- manipulate situations and get mad drama.
L:  Right.
R:  It was, like, they chose, like, I -- I think it was, like, eight women, eight men, and the way -- they set it up for humiliation right from the get go 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they put 'em on, like, separate sides of the boat [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and they're, like, "Run to the person you're attracted to and you wanna hang out with".
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, like, some women got, like, three guys with them.  Some women got nobody.
L:  [MN] Oh, that's humiliating.
R:  Isn't it? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and the one woman cried, like, in the first episode.  She's, like, "I don't understand, nobody likes me".  It was just, oh, my God, it was awful --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but it was so entertaining.  [LAUGH] 
L:  W- was there people being like voted off or something, like ...
R:  I'm trying to remember how they voted people off.  I think they had a series -- it was a vote.  That's right.  It was just like Survivor where they would actually vote --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it was, like, whatever couple remained got, like, some amazing vacation.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But it was cool the way they set it up because they picked attractive people but not models, so you could see where they'd have typical insecurities when, you know --
L:  I see, I see.  Wow.
R:  Yeah, oh, those Real World people are evil.  They just know how to get -- they just know how to pick people at this point.
L:  Right.
R:  They --
L:  Oh, my God, that's hilarious.
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm so mad so many people missed that one 'cause when I talk about they're like, "No, when was it on?"
L:  Yeah, I -- I've never even hear- -- I don't remember hearing about this.
R:  I don't think they hyped it that much and I don't think the ratings were that great.  I remember it was, like, October of two thousand two because I remember, like, what job I had at the time and I was --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, telling people at work, like, "You have to watch this show".
L:  You -- oh, was it on ca- -- was it on cable?  Is it not --
R:  It was on regular TV actually.
L:  Really?  I don't why --
R:  I don't remember which channel.
L:  -- I don't even -- why I don't even remember this.
R:  Probably because you had, like, a life at the time, like.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because that's the problem with these shows, I got way too caught up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- in college it was, like, a lot worse.
R:  Exactly.
L:  If -- actually if I was in college now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right?  And all -- and all these real- -- it'd be ten times worse --
R:  Totally.
L:  -- like than, um, Real World and whatever I was watching back then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  My friend's little sister who's in college right now, she said all of them, like, it's ridiculous.  They go from Eliminate to Shipmates to Blind Date --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's, like, just constantly, it's all they watch.
L:  You know, I love Eliminate.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That is an evil show, right?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I watched it last night and what's so bad about it, it comes on at, like, two in the morning --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I wanna see who gets chosen.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I stay up so late and I know I get, like, you know, late to work, you know, just because I was watching Eliminate.
R:  I'm so glad I'm not the only person who does that the same way.  I'm, like, "Go to bed, go to bed".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then I'm, like, [MN] "Oh, but I wanna see if he cuts that snotty redhead", you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, these girls, sometimes they piss me off.
R:  I know.  
L:  They're like so, well, I mean, not like every sorority girls, like, but they -- some of them fit like that, the whatchamacallit, stereotypical --
R:  Totally.
L:  -- sorority type and I'm like, "Oh, I just want to smack these girls", you know.
R:  I just, can you imagine acting that trashy on TV with, like, a total stranger?  [MN] 
L:  And I'm like, "This is stupid".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now you're never gonna get a date.
R:  They always vote, like, the smartest girl off first 'cause she's not, like, f- -- like, she hasn't flashed 'em yet or she --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- hasn't, like, completely, like, made out with him yet and he's, like, yeah, you just seemed kind uptight --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, [LAUGH], you had dignity --
L:  I know.
R:  -- so I have to cut you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  That so kills me.
L:  Right.
R:  I actually saw a woman in the street who was on Shipmates and, like, we were standing in line for something and I --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- was like, "Oh, my God, were you on Shipmates?" 'cause she had acted like --
L:  You actually recognized her?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Totally, that's when you know you're watching too much reality TV.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You're, like, recognizing people in the street.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Did you -- what did she say?
R:  She was actually -- she was really crazy on the show so I was a little afraid to talk to her.  She was, like, this really high strung Russian woman and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I was like, "Oh", you know, "were you just acting, what were you doing?"  And she was, like, "No it was all real.  It was just the way they edited it made me look crazy" and I'm, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know, man.  You can't be --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH].
R:  -- edited to be that crazy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Guess I had to see it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To see how -- what she did.
R:  Oh, she was just nuts.  She was, like, crying within five minutes.  Like, he -- she said she was a dancer and he made some comment like, "Oh, a stripper.  Ha, ha, ha".  And she flipped out and she's like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  "Just because I'm Russian you think I'm a slut", like that's how it went, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's so hilarious.
R:  Yeah, but she was nuts.  She was, like, when I was talking to her she was like, "Yeah and I got an agent from it and now I'm getting into acting" and I'm like, "Oh, my God".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  She got spotted.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Well, some -- some good came out of it then.
R:  I guess, yeah.  So ...
L:  Di- did you ever watch this one episode, I think it was Blind Date, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this guy, well actually the guy and the girl were both really dopey.  They were blond --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the guy was [MN] really, really buff but he talked like Arnold Schwarzenegger --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you know who I'm talking about?
R:  I don't -- I might have.  I feel like I've seen so many of them I probably have seen it.
L:  Anyways, he was this gorgeous buff or whatever and his voice was like heavy accent just like Arnold Schwarzenegger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, I think I had the TV on and I was working on something and I heard the same voice again --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and he was on Fifth Wheel --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- and I'm, like, why is he skipping?  He's not even from here.  He's from, like, you know, some other co- -- wherever Arnold Schwarzenegger's from [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, it was just like, did he just come to America and he's decided to, like [MN]  --
R:  Do reality shows.
L:  -- you know, hop in on -- yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]  They probably, oh, 'cause there's so many of them in LA so they probably do go from one to the other.
L:  Yeah, probably.
R:  That's hilarious.
L:  And -- and he was really, really hot, so --
R:  Really?
L:  -- [MN] I'm sure that's why they chose him.  They're like, yeah, sure, you know.  You're a shoe in.
R:  Totally.  He's going to cause some drama.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  That's -- I actually saw somebody from Blind Date who was also on that Chains of Love.  Did you see that one?  That was another short lived one.
L:  No, no.
R:  Where they actually chained, like, one guy to four girls.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I actually did see a couple of episodes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They were on the bed and, like ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That was just so vile.  But I saw a guy doubling up on that one, 'cause I'm looking at him and first -- again you think he's an actor 'cause you're like, wait, I've seen this guy before and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- then I'm like, oh, my God, I saw him on Bli- -- that's when I knew, like, you're watching way too much reality TV.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are -- are you from California?  [inaudible]
R:  No, I'm from New York actually.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, same here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  I'm always wondering will I, like, run into Monica Lewinsky?  I know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- she's in the West Village, you know, I'm like --
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah, and, like, oh, I love your bags.  I don't know what I'd say to her.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I love your bags.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's when, yeah, I'm like, all of a sudden you're a TV host.  What happened to your big bad handbag Mo- -- you know, designing career?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think she still has it going on.  They -- they sell it at, like, Henri Bendel.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and, um, she has a website, like, the Real Monica dot com.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  And, like, I -- I've seen one or two that are, like, nice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, you know, never bought it but, um, once, um, I think once I was on [inaudible] and I saw it, like, on the handbags and it went up for, like, a lot.
R:  Really?
L:  And I was just like --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, like, almost retail, like a hundr- --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- over a hundred definitely, like -- [MN] 
R:  Oh, my G- -- doesn't it tick you off, you know, like, I hate when these people get famous for such sleazy reasons.
L:  Right, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, [LAUGH].
L:  Poor Monica.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they don't give her much to do on Mr. Personality though, do they, like ...
L:  I was actually really surprised, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought I would see -- you know, you just see her at the end.
R:  Totally.
L:  And, you know, every once in a while she brings her -- brings, what's her face, Hayley --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in to, like, to watch a video or something like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
