L:  [MN] Hi --
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  My name's Carol.
R:  Hi, Carol.  I'm Peggy.
L:  Oh, I'm in St Louis.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] I'm in, ah, Hollywood, California.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.  [MN] Do you watch reality TV?
L:  Usually I don't.  I have occasionally watched, um, [MN] I think I watched some millionaire show once about --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- this guy who had to pick from three women.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But usually I don't watch it.  Do you?
R:  Ah, I stop on it because, ah, quite a bit because first of all I have a son and he's so involved with it.  It's so engrossing for them.  I'm not sure why.
L:  How old is your son?
R:  He's nine.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, he'll stop on it but, um, I find myself because, ah, it's sort of peer pressure almost, that every body talks about these shows so much [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I -- I f- -- I kind of want to tune in to see what the heck all the action and talk a- -- is about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] So, if I do tune in I like to tune in late in the show --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so I don't have to [MN] actually go through the elimination process, the questioning process, like, on -- on Millionaire or these Bachelor shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or Survivor.  I like sort of, um, i- -- I -- I find it overly dramatic. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  I don't find it real at all [LAUGH] actually. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, I don't think it's real either.
R:  I -- I -- I sort of, you know, what I -- what I think of in reality for reality shows is something like the old fashioned Candid Camera. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  To me, that is more reality than what they're depicting, these people who know they're being filmed so they're going to dramatize every single time they pick up their fork, to me.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right, and then after they --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- do those shows then they end up on Oprah talking all about it.  Have you ever seen that happen?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh!  It's so ridiculous, and so, then they get more publicity [MN] for, um --
R:  More money.
L:  Yeah -- going through it.  But actually the more I think about it I probably have watched -- I think I checked out Survivor because my d- --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- my daughter is thirty five and she has an eleven year old son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she watches Survivor.  She -- she --
R:  She wouldn't miss it?
L:  -- loves it.
R:  Ah.  Ahah.
L:  And, so, I checked it out because I thought, well, my daughter and I are quite a bit alike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I thought well, maybe I'll love it too.  Well, forget it.  I didn't love it at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just didn't want to -- you know, I just thought it was stupid.
R:  [MN] Well, it -- it seems a little stupid and it -- and, to me, it's very unrealistic.  [MN] You never see -- you rarely see anybody kicking back enjoying life.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] So, it becomes to me, um, about, all about the money.
L:  Exactly, because --
R:  All about the end and I don't really love that in our society.
L:  Right.
R:  Or -- or to -- to -- or to advocate it for -- for the next generation.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yes, we're capitalists, we're all capitalists but [MN], I mean, to not see these people, like, in the Survivor case, where it's so beautiful, there's such a gorgeous setting, they may never be there again in their lives --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're battling and dueling and -- and being nasty to each other for the end of, of course, winning which is a -- I mean, they -- I think they choose these contestants because they're fiercely competitive --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and in tiptop shape, I appreciate all that, [MN] but to not enjoy it and to not [LIPSMACK] have the audience see us enjoy -- see them enjoy it somewhat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think takes away from the reality -- ah, to me, it's not real.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Because of that.
L:  Right.
R:  I- if I were there I'd say, "Well, go ahead, go ahead.  You go down the path and I'll ...", [MN] but, you know, but they may be fired for that, I don't know, but to see, ah, more enjoyment, I think, would be more real.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] One time when I watched, I think it was the Millionaire show, and a couple of those girls --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who went on it, you know, they always have beautiful clothes, the families are always perfect and rich --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, and they live in a perfect place, of course, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you kind of wonder, do they really live there or are they just, you know, making this like a set for them to see?
R:  Or they -- or they cast those perfect people --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which is not real either, to me.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, they could be casting, they could be looking for that sort of, um, [LIPSMACK] perfect person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because it is TV but [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's -- I think it's wrong to call all of that stuff reality TV.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  [NOISE]  Because it's based in reality, it's based on a lot of fantasy.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, you know, there's supposed to be a new channel.  They've been advertising out here, there's a new channel coming that's just gonna be reality.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's coming from the makers, I think, of E channel.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which is a hot -- a h- hot channel if you want to catch up on, you know, trivia news.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I guess they're gonna do a -- a one entire channel [LIPSMACK] maybe this, ah, [MN] conversation has something to do with it, that they're doing surveys or something, yeah, one channel that you can just watch [MN] reality TV twenty four seven.
L:  Oh.
R:  How exciting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really.  I thought this conversation was just for language, to study language patterns.
R:  Oh.
L:  And what kinds of, um, expressions we use.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because I saw it in ESL magazine, which is English as a second language magazine.
R:  Oh, how interesting.
L:  I teach English as a second language.
R:  Oh, how interest- -- as a second language?
L:  Yeah, like, to foreigners.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I thought it was to determine --
R:  You could be right.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, but, who knows?
R:  You could be right.  [MN]
L:  What do you do?
R:  I am a, um, film maker.  I just finished my [MN] last film, the -- it's called An Existential Affair.  I produced, wrote and directed it, shot on thirty five millimeter and I'm in the post.
L:  Oh.
R:  Post production for it right now.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  And in it I used three languages.  I used German, I used [MN] Armenian --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and French.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Because it's such an international world, ah, for film.  You know, we get sold all over the world, so I brought it in.  I think I got a little excitement about it all.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah, and I used -- in the movie, I use a lot of TV references so that [MN] you're watching TV in my movie.  [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I do have a little, ah, because [MN] reality is -- reality TV is -- is so popular, it really sets the time.
L:  Ahah.
R:  My -- my television, what it does is set the time period which is throughout the nineties, the Clinton administration [COUGH] and Bush's -- Bush senior's administration, so we always know where we are in time by referencing the television and I did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- put a little spot of in the late nineties when this all started happening, the [MN] -- the Survivor, so I had to license some footage like that.
L:  Oh.  That's interesting.  
R:  Yeah, but I'm based -- I'm from New York.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, um --
R:  So, I'm stuck out here in LA.  
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Boy.  Sounds like you have a great --
R:  Do I sound like I'm from New York?
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]  Just curious.
L:  -- not that much.
R:  No, good.
L:  Just a little, but not much.
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, you know, there's gonna be a new show with Monica Lewinsky?
R:  I heard that.  Did you know anything m- --?  Is it -- is it a reality show?
L:  I think so.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's like a millionaires.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  It's gonna be millionaire men who are blindfolded --
R:  No way!
L:  -- and then the women have to pick them based on their inner beauty, because she can't see their faces.  So, sh- --
R:  What does this have to do with Monica?
L:  She's the hostess.
R:  Oh, my God!  
L:  So, all she does is, um, I guess, be alongside the woman who is selecting and tell her what to do and --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- maybe, maybe give her like questions to ask or something, I don't know.
R:  Maybe she's hoping Hilary's gonna divorce Bill and he'll come on the show --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and have the highest ratings ever.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I know.
R:  That is too funny.
L:  Pretty weird.
R:  Well, she has to be doing something.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, I know.  I guess she at least got this job.  She probably ended up getting a lot of money after all her publicity.  
R:  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if she's gonna be smoking cigars and wearing the blue dress.
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, who kn- -- I don't think she'll wear the blue dress probably --
R:  Oh, I hope not.
L:  -- probably never again in her life.
R:  Oh, gosh.  
L:  Oh.
R:  That was her demise.
L:  Yeah, really.  [MN]  So ...
R:  But I do have -- I do have the Bill Clinton clip in my movie, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky".  I mean, isn't that -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  [LAUGH]  I got to exploit that.
L:  Right, why not?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN] Well, I've never been to New York.  I really wish I could go there but my husband doesn't like New York.  I guess it's too --
R:  I wonder why.  It's a very intense place.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You step out and -- from anywhere and you're just engulfed in energy.  You're just sort of pushed along.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  To walk to the next place you're going to.  It's -- it's -- I -- I long to be there every day.  My parents are there.  I have six sisters, two brothers there.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  So, as soon as I wrap this film up I'm gonna go back there and write a little bit.  [COUGH] 
L:  Oh, great.
R:  But my mother is hooked on this reality stuff.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  She sets her clock by it.  How to Marry a Millionaire, oh yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's an hour long show, do you realize that?
L:  No.
R:  I believe it's an hour long --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and she will sit there and watch it for one hour from beginning, you know, no talking, right to the end of, ah, [MN] you know, because everybody loves Regis --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, she fell in love with Regis and a lot of America did before that silly show but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's a big draw on that show but I --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I think that was the forefront in -- in reality shows, wasn't it?
L:  [MN]
