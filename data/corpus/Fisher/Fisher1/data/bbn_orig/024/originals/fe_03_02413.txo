L:  Hi, my name's Candy.
R:  Hi Candy.  My name is Cindy.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  Um, this is my second time.
L:  This is my first.
R:  Okay.  Um, I'm from Min[?] Missouri.
L:  I'm from Kentucky.
R:  Kentucky, huh, okay.  Um, do we just start talking about the subject, and I've already forgotten what it was.  Ah, bad habits, I think.
L:  Yeah, um, smoking, alcohol, gossip, caffeine and something else.
R:  Not exercising.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, not exercising.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I am the worst ex-smoker non-smoker you'll ever want to meet.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I can't -- I can't think of a good thing about smoking.  And having -- I was just telling my husband tonight, it'll be nine years May ninth that I've quit smoking and I -- I can't stand to be around it.  I can't stand the smell.  I just -- oh, it's just -- 
L:  I'd say that's where it comes -- a smoker currently wanting to quit.  So -- 
R:  Oh, well, if you -- that's the --
L:  [inaudible]  
R:  -- first thing, the first step is the want.  You've got to have the desire.
L:  Yeah, I know.  You've got to have will power.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I, um, I did it the hard way.  Um, I did it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cold turkey.  I, um -- 
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah, I did.  I -- well, my daughter was pregnant.  She was eight -- eight months pregnant and she had told me that she wasn't going to bring her grand baby over to our house 'cause my husband and I both smoke like chimneys.
L:  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  And, um, I quit.  My husband kept smoking.  But, um, I quit.  And, ah, it was hard.  Oh, my God, I was an evil person.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now my husband -- 
L:  I [several inaudible words] want to have and then you can quit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] My husband quit about four years later when my mom -- um, I came home, um, my mom had just went to the hospital.  She was real sick and she was diagnosed with lung cancer.
L:  Oh, my God --
R:  So, I -- I came home and I said, "I don't care where you smoke but, you're not smoking in my car, you're not smoking in the house.  I don't want to see you ever smoking those cigarettes".
L:  Yeah, I would say smoking's probably the far worst thing out of all those -- 
R:  Yeah.
L: -- 'cause it causes so many different mistakes on your body.
R:  Yeah.  If -- 
L:  Emphysema -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it's a -- 
R:  Yeah, COPD[?] and it's just really bad for you.  So's not exercising.  I have to say, um, my husband's listening to my conversation [LAUGH].  You see -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he thought I should start off with, ah, like, we- we're both, um, over weight and we're told we should go exercise -- you know, walk.  And -- and we did a few times and we went -- first we started out in the winter time, walking around the mall.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, ah, that just got to be expensive 'cause I'd always carry my wallet with me and I'd have to stop on my second or third round.
L:  And get something to drink or something to eat -- 
R:  And get -- no get -- go shopping.
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's worse.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, now we're walking -- I'd say more than we were.  I -- I tell him ev- every time we go it's better than not going at g- at all.
L:  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't exercise like I should but I do exercise [several inaudible words] I have two kids.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And now they're even saying that -- 
L:  So, that keeps me exercising -- 
R:  Now they're even saying that the forty five minutes of house work you do is -- is better, you know, can be considered exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  See, what else? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- else?  I'm trying to think.
R:  Well, drinking of course.  That's got a lot of ill effects on your body, especially your liver.
L:  It has a bunch of ill effects on family period.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  I dated an ex-drinker.  Well, a drinker at the time.  He's an ex now, and it got pretty bad.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  He was into drinking and drugs so -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it did not mix.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he got very physical one night and knocked all my front teeth out and, well, there was that relationship.
R:  Oh, my.  Well, at least you got -- you were smart enough to get out of it.
L:  Yeah.  It cost me all my teeth.  But, it didn't cost me my life.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Now I'm with a guy now who used to be a real bad alcoholic but is not now.  So -- 
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- he hasn't drunk for five years.
R:  Oh, that's good, that's good.
L:  Still drink occasionally but I don't let him drink more than one beer -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  One beer's as far as I'll let him go.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] --
L:  Too many risk involved.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, my husband hasn't had a drink in [MN] twenty -- it'll be twenty three years in July.  It was pretty bad the first few years that we were together.  But, he fully quit.  [NOISE] --
L:  Well, you made it through.
R:  Huh?
L:  I said you made it through.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we made it through it and the, um, last twenty three were a lot better than the first five.  [LAUGH]
L:  I believe so.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so -- 
L:  If you can make it through a hurdle you can make it for good.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, but he's a keeper.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  And me and [several inaudible words] to argue constantly but, we're still together.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  We can argue and make up, we're fine.  If we can't make up we've got troubles.
R:  Oh.
L:  Arguments only last about half an hour anyhow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Unless they're --
R:  If -- 
L:  -- real heated, then they last -- last a couple of days.  [MN]  
R:  He wh- I'm sorry?
L:  I said unless they're a real heated argument and then they last a couple of days.
R:  Mm.  Let's see.  Smoking, alcohol, exercise -- 
L:  Gossiping, that was another one.
R:  Oh, gossiping.  Well, that can really hurt.  And you know -- 
L:  Yeah, that hurts feelings.
R:  -- if you -- if you -- I work with people from -- I'd say from the age of twenty one to sixty five and the fifty year olds are as bad, if not worse, than the twenty year olds --
L:  They're worse than the younger ones.
R:  Yeah, the young ones and the older ones.  You know, it's the -- people in their forties sort of -- just sort of sit back and lis- ah, you know, 'cause they've been there and they know what can, you know, the results of gossiping and [several inaudible words] I don't know, it just -- 
L:  And they still don't work.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and then they -- it's like they relapse when they're in their fifties I guess.  [LAUGH] I don't know.  But, [inaudible] -- 
L:  I believe it's not[?] coworkers.  That's all they do is gossip all -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- day long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, look, you don't realise it but if you think you're talking about somebody behind their back but they're sitting there listening to it, or they hear it. 
R:  Or they -- someone that they're -- [NOISE] that's in their little group goes and tells everybody [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and that's where the hurting comes from.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And then they say it just to spite people and -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  And gossip's no good.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  What else was [several inaudible words].  Gossip, exercise, smoking, alcohol.  There's another one. 
R:  Eating too much?
L:  No.  Caffeine.
R:  Oh, caffeine [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  And I've got to admit that is bad because I'm a caffeine ad- addict.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I was, um -- 
L:  If I don't have my pot[?] when I wake up I'm the crankiest person in the world and I can't quit because I get caffeine headaches.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  I did -- 
R:  Well, now they're saying -- 
L:  -- cut down at one time, like, one pot a day -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I lost a lot of weight.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it does add weight to you.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I'm drinking, um, diet and caffeine free soda now, and they say, "Why bother" and I'm like, "Well, it still has the taste but" -- 
L:  It kind of weans you off of it.
R:  Yeah.  Um -- 
L:  See, I can't drink diet.  I just don't have a taste for it.
R:  Mm, you get used to it -- 
L:  Just like the weight loss drinks.  I can't drink them either.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] Which I'm not really -- real bad over weight.  But -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm over weight enough.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I was told to cut back on my caffeine.  Um, I have fibroid cysts in my breasts and, oh, sometimes I can't even hardly put a bra on if they hurt so bad.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  He said, "Cut -- cut back on the coff- the caffeine".  So, I did and that -- that definitely helped.
L:  Well -- 
R:  I still have to have -- I have to have at least one.  You know, when you're used to two pots of coffee a day -- 
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- you know, you go back to -- 
L:  That would kill me.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- two cups of coffee, yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] coffee -- 
R:  Well I -- yeah.  I -- I do -- I used to do soda and coffee but now --  
L:  Now mocha's I can do, but plain coffee, no.  [LAUGH] And mocha's, I think, are worse for you.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to treat myself to a cappuccino when I got gas once a week and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't even miss that anymore because they're -- 
L:  They get expensive.
R:  Yes.  That, or -- 
L:  It's hard on -- it's hard on your wallet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's full of calories and stuff.
L:  I think caffeine period is -- well, I don't know.  Alcohol is probably the worst thing on your wallet.
R:  And your body.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was there -- 
R:  Um.
L:  -- another one?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, no.  I think we've talked about all of them.  Um, we have to talk about, um, suppose -- we're supposed to talk about it for at least eight minutes and I didn't look at the clock when we were starting.
L:  I didn't either.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  But -- we're -- we're close to eight minutes.  Last night was my first time and, ah -- 
L:  Oh, see, they called last night and my phone has a to- a tone and a pulse --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I couldn't get it to go through so it finally hung up on me.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I lost the topic last night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And tonight I was starting to wonder and then I pushed the tone button and then it took it to answer.  I'm like, "Well, [LAUGH] --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- that's what was wrong last night".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  How did you find out about this?
L:  A friend of mine told me about it.
R:  Yeah.  My daughter told me about it.
L:  'Cause I do a bunch of paid stuff on the internet anyhow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [several inaudible words] and that kind of good garbage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And record points and get gift certificates and stuff like that.  And she told me about this.  She said, "You're a talker.  So, that would actually work for you".
R:  Yeah.  I'm not a talker -- 
L:  I mean, I never -- 
R:  -- but, I told my daughter I'd try it.
L:  -- he said I never shut up.  So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, maybe I should try it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it's a little bit different though when you're talking to strangers you don't know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's kind of harder -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to figure out something to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they put me on a heated discussion then I probably wouldn't shut up but -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- something that simple, or -- I don't know, I got all them bad habits.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh -- 
L:  Hard to focus in on one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could have sworn there was another one though.
R:  Well, are -- are you sure it's not over eating?
L:  It might be.
R:  I think it was.  They said -- 
L:  I think it -- 
R:  -- it so quick I didn't really catch all of them.
L:  Yeah.  Um, of course that's -- that's bad for you but --
