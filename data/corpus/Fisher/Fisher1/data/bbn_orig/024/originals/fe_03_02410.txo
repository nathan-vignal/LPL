L:  [inaudible] this is Hertz[?] speaking.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, what are we supposed to do?
R:  Um, [SIGH] we're supposed to say what's -- what's worse in how we introduce ourselves -- 
L:  Ah, I believe gossip is worse.
R:  Gossip.  I was going to say the exact same thing.  Gossip.
L:  We can, because peoples speaking behind other peoples backs, that's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- disrespectful.
R:  It hurts everyone.  Who cares if you don't exercise, that's your business.
L:  But sloth is a sin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] I'm torn by [several inaudible words] gossip.
L:  Yeah, gossip.  Yeah, okay.  Um, wh- what about sloth though?  Don't you believe a sin is worse than just, ah, disrespect --  
R:  Hm.
L:  -- as some would look at it?
R:  Hm.  You know what?  It's like I -- I feel like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gossiping is more -- because of the judging and not just sin as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  I really don't.  I guess -- 
L:  See if they're all -- 
R:  -- gossiping just --
L:  -- sins then how -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can they be put a- ahead of one another?
R:  Right.  Right.  Sin is sin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And sin -- sin wasn't the category but maybe the other one is -- is as close to sin as you can get.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Um, this is an odd study.  I've never done this before.
R:  Me neither --
L:  [several inaudible words] that -- [inaudible] to do with -- I hope it works --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- and I get paid [several inaudible words] --  
R:  You hope what?
L:  I -- I hope that I get paid, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH] --
L:  They had some pretty good concrete details and stuff -- 
R:  Yeah, 'cause that would be a sin.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, anyway, um -- 
R:  It's tough these days.
L:  Yeah, so, just gossip, that's it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's it -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  It's the one I'll stay with.
L:  How long does this take?
R:  It said, um, ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes [inaudible].
R:  And I -- I'm watching, um, the best ball game right now.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I just spoken to UCLA admissions [inaudible].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm going to be working at the UCLA camp this summer doing massage therapy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's a great, great school.
L:  [several inaudible words] just gone in as a freshman.
R:  Really?
L:  [inaudible] pre-med, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  It's ironic.
R:  Pre-med.  How did you get interested in pre-med?
L:  Um, I don't know, just like -- just the work of some doctors isn't as -- as I'd like it to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you couldn't just [inaudible] when they're good or not -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if -- and if further money or just the love of it.
R:  We had, um, a- a- after a recommendation, ah, wi- my dad had prostate cancer three years ago and he was recommended to go to UCLA with a great surgeon Dr Baltergrin[?] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, it was -- to me it's, like, he's an excellent surgeon.
L:  Yeah.  I just notice people are putting more money into plastic surgery rather than, like -- like specialties to help kids and other people, you know?
R:  Isn't it the truth?
L:  Yeah.  So, it's a -- 
R:  Well, ye- mm.
L:  Especially the eye is one of the most  complex organs and the way they treat people with eye problems it's, like, medieval, right?
R:  Really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  And it's -- that's scary because that's -- that's one of the things that I've -- I don't like to touches -- have my eyes touched at all.  It's such a delicate -- my grandmother just had cataract surgery.  She's eighty six and I question that.
L:  Yeah.  She kn- [inaudible] the got -- doctor was good she won't have to revisit.  But, my grandparents have had, like, several surgeries.  They -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- always have to go back after the first one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't trust them either.
R:  You know, it's like, you just don't -- as -- as nice as their bedside manner or their clinic or whatever -- my question was, like, "How much do you get paid?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, probably -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a good amount.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A good amount.  [inaudible], there's a lot of money in plastic surgery in LA.  But -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  A- all the pretty people -- are you f- originally from LA?
L:  Um, no.  I'm from USSR Armenia.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm from Ohio.
L:  Oh, ah, that's very -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- interesting.  That's pretty far from -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [inaudible].  Or the Great Lakes [inaudible]?
R:  Yeah.  So, how long have you been here in this country?
L:  Um, eleven years.
R:  Eleven years.
L:  Right.
R:  And wh- what are your thoughts of, um, what's going on right now in the middle east?
L:  Middle east?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nothing's going on.  I just think the United States' trying to globalize their dem- democratic economy.
R:  Really.
L:  That's what I think they're trying to do.  I don't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have -- have any -- I don't have anything against it.
R:  Sure.
L:  It'll be good for the other nations.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't want to -- 
R:  But, intellectually?
L:  -- pay two dollars for oil, I guess, I mean -- 
R:  Oh, man, yeah.  [MN] I mean, how's that make sense?
L:  It's just the truth -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think.
R:  Wh- why do you think Americans' swallow it so easily?
L:  Ah, I don't know.  It's -- Americans, ah, Americans.  I -- I'm -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- American.  I'd -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fight for this nation -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't condon any of their actions in the middle east.
R:  No.
L:  And I don't like some of their practices, so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I define my own values.  I agree with most of the values here.
R:  Yeah.  Overall -- all -- you know, I -- I agree.  To me it's like w- w- with America there's ev- every state it's different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that -- that people don't, un- understand -- 
L:  California's different.  You can tell the people.  In New York, like, it's heavy populated -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- metropolitan areas.  The people are somewhat more educated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's cool though.
R:  And so what's your -- your favorite place in the -- in the United States?
L:  In the United States?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I've -- I've been around actually -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've been to many of the states.  I liked northern New York -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Colorado was cool.
R:  Oh, man.  I've been to Colorado.  Never New York.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've always wanted to go to New York.
L:  New York is pretty cool.  It's very alive [inaudible] you can't go in on a weekday and there -- there'll be people watching a B movie in the middle of the night.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Like it never sleeps.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is so interesting -- 
L:  There's always something to do.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- it's -- I am so glad that I got you on the other end.  Someone interesting.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].
R:  'Cause the directions weren't very clear and so I thought, "Okay" I mean [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But, like, how can you discuss, like, a simple subject like that for ten minutes?  I don't -- 
R:  Gossip.
L:  -- I don't understand.
R:  Man.
L:  I think they just wanted to get people to talk and just analyze their voice -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  Y- you know what?  It's [SIGH] -- I think because, um, you're, you know, studying pre-med and I'm a massage therapist but I work with -- with victims of violence, those are the people I massage -- the state allots a certain amount of money -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  The gossip is like, I don't know, it hurts so many people in the workplace.  You see it go on --  
L:  Oh, it's everywhere -- 
R:  -- all day long.
L:  -- especially in [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- it's in schools -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's in families.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  Families it's like, I think we almost allow that 'cause it's family.  But, that is just as harmful.  
L:  [several inaudible words] I don't -- I never say -- if I was to say something to a person even though -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's bad, I'll tell them in their face.
R:  Right.
L:  It's better than telling somebody else -- 
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- or behind their back.
R:  Go to [several inaudible words].
L:  'Cause, I mean, people should be able to handle the criticism -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unless they're -- I don't know, unless they have problems, right? 
R:  Yeah.  What's your birth sign?
L:  Ah, scorpio.
R:  You're a scorpio?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ouch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Why?
R:  Noth- that's why you're so direct.
L:  There's not -- 
R:  Ye- yeah, there are some -- 
L:  -- there's nothing wrong with that -- 
R:  No, I don't think so either.
L:  [several inaudible words] it helps people not get hurt in the long run.
R:  You know what?  It's like, I think some people just, they hide out behind who they are so that they can say, "Well, that hurt my feelings" rather than, "It's constructive.  Why don't you" you know -- 
L:  Well, everybody has feelings, they're just not willing to accept I guess or -- I don't know -- 
R:  Right.  How old are you -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- if -- if you don't mind me asking?
L:  Eighteen.
R:  You're eighteen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You sound a lot -- oh, my son's eighteen.  You do not sound eighteen.
L:  Oh, I- I'm eighteen.  That's why I'm a freshman undergraduate -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- at UCLA.
R:  UCLA, and so, when you're a doctor, how many years from now?
L:  [SIGH] eight -- 
R:  Wh- what's going to be your title?
L:  Doctor Poshein[?]
R:  Yeah, okay -- 
L:  Probably eight years though.
R:  Ah, eight years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  And -- and what's your [inaudible] -- your speciality?
L:  Um, right now the ophthalmologist.
R:  Entomologist, okay.
L:  Right, a retina specialist probably.
R:  That's so -- that's so interesting.  You know, um, my son still has problems.  He has Rh negative and we had his lights on for, like, three days -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, it damaged his eyes pretty -- pretty bad.  But, um, it's funny.  The eye's an amazing, amazing organ.  It's resilient.
L:  It's the most complex organ in the body and -- look, my doctor -- I know this person.  He's figured out how to transplant, ah, human stem cells into the retina and regrow retina -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [inaudible].  But, like, it's -- it hasn't been done successfully as of yet -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I bel- I believe it might have been once.  But --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not sure yet.  But, it's a -- it's a new thing, a new cure.  It could be a cure to blindness -- 
R:  Oh, wouldn't that be -- 
L:  -- for cells.
R:  -- wonderful?
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, especially if there were countries where we've, you know, just forgot about those people.  That's the place the United States decides not to meddle.  [LAUGH] 
L:  W- well, yeah, 'cause they have to put -- 
R:  It's like, "Could you meddle here?"
L:  -- more money in there -- they just meddle in one -- they think, "Well, America's always been, like, think of what's best for now" you know, they never -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- think, "That's where they give here, like all those weapons in the eighties".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And came back, "Wow, Hussein's our enemy now".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ironic isn't it?
R:  [MN] yeah.
L:  And I wonder who gave him all the weapons.  And Russian helped too, though -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Russia sold him most of the nuclear arms they have -- 
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's basically they're causing their own problems.
R:  Well, yeah, it's -- you know, it -- it comes back around and that's the -- that's the universe, that's the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That-
