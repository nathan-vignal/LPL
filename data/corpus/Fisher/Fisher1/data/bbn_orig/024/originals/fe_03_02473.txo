L:  Hi, my name's Katherine.
R:  Hi, my name's Karen.  How are you?
L:  Hi.  Fine, thank you.  How are you, Karen?
R:  I'm doing good.
L:  Oh good.  Uh, Karen, I sure don't watch, uh, reality TV.  Do you?
R:  Well, the only thing that I watch, and it's always towards --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the end of the season is the, uh, [LIPSMACK] um, the Survivor show.
L:  Oh, you have to tell me then, w- what -- tell me what it's all about.  I've never seen one.
R:  You've never seen the Survivor show?
L:  No.
R:  Um, well, on the -- the Survivor shows they usually have, you know, x amount of participants that start at the beginning, and they usually go thirty to forty days, like, in the Amazon or whatever, and, um, they do contests and, um, for each contest, whoever wins it, they get, like, what's called an immunity necklace --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, 'cause after the -- every contest they go and they, uh, boot somebody off the island, they vote 'em off.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So, if you have the immunity necklace, then you can't get booted off, they can't vote you off.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I always like to watch towards, like, the last couple of three weeks, because they're down to, like, four or five people and then you kinda go, "Hm, who's gonna win?" [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God. [LAUGH] It sounds kind of cruel and humiliating.  Do you find that it has -- I mean, I -- I think the shows are so misnamed.  It's such a misnomer to say "reality".
R:  Yeah, it's not.
L:  Y- yeah, like, I always go into the Amazon or wherever, that's real. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, it -- I think all -- it's a -- a challenge of physical -- physical fitness, and basically who -- you know, m- -- they make alliances with each other, and then, like, two or three people will say, "Well, if you vote against this person, then I'll help you with this" or, "I'll make sure you don't ever get voted off", so, you know, they kind of do that kind of stuff too.
L:  Oh.  Is it majority rule, that, um, if -- how many people are there, total, in the beginning?
R:  [SIGH] I think there's usually, like, twenty.  There's, like, ten and ten --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and they -- they put 'em into two separate -- what's called tribes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then they -- they're supposed to work as a group.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and then it gets down to the point where there's only two people against each other, and then, um, i- it then -- once they get down to -- I think it's seven people, then the other people become part of -- of, um, [LIPSMACK] what is it?  Like a voting panel.  They get to vote people off, not the people that are actually still in the game --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they get to vote people off, so, see, then it's the -- the point of, "Well, that person voted me off, and I think they're a jerk" so they'll vote --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'em off, you know, and so it's that kind --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of part of it is kinda [LAUGH] --
L:  So, it's vindictive and evil at the end --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not totally merit -- it's not a merit based thing, it's not a democracy based thing?
R:  Basically, yeah.  I mean, a- and some of 'em are really good and some of 'em are really vindictive like that.  It's, like, you know, it's like, "Well, I'm going to vote you off because you were a jerk to me" and it's, like, "Well, that's not the way -- the way that it's supposed to be".  It's supposed to be --
L:  It's n- --
R:  -- who is the best at the physical, the challenge, the -- you know, the emotional, the mental.
L:  It -- it's --
R:  That's what I like to see.
L:  It sounds like it's a popularity contest as well as --
R:  Kinda.
L:  -- can you survive eating bugs?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But do they give the people water and stuff?
R:  They get -- uh, the, like, the first show, they didn't give 'em anything and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- um, they had to, like, earn, like, fishing hooks and those kind of things to catch -- and then, one of --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R: -- the shows that I watched, they actually gave them, like, rice, so much rice --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, so much fish and that kind of stuff, because the people in the one show, they -- they were pretty much starving to death, yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  So, they --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- decided, "Well, on the next show --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- we better start giving them at least a ration of rice".  So then they have to learn how to ration it out until it runs out.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my God. [LAUGH]
R:  And then -- so some of the challenges --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are, like, the -- when I watched the last Thursday, there's one on tonight, the last Thursday, they, um, they had x amount of dollars and they could, uh, bid on a food item, but they didn't get shown what the item of food was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- until they were done bidding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was, like, a steak and a potato, I mean, and it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just funny to watch these people, it's like, "Oh, my God.  It's a steak and potato".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and one guy --
L:  That's hilarious.
R:  -- got, like a -- yeah, one guy got, like, a piece of cheesecake, you know, and so they're bidding on this, you know, hoping they're going to get something really good to eat, so, I think it's funny.
L:  Did they give them anything really stinky, like, y- you know, "L- let's make a deal", you know, like, "Here's a piece of moldy cheese" or --
R:  That's what they do for some of the contests.  They'll have, like, um, each group, they c- -- say, "Okay, you have to come up.  You have to eat, like, this nasty bug or you have to swallow whole this raw fish or you have to eat this", you know?  Yeah, they do do that, to see if -- who's going to lose it, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, w- when they were purchasing the food items, did -- did --
R:  No, the food items, this time, everything was kosher, everything was, like, good food.
L:  Oh, okay, so nobody had to buy with their valuable dollars and ended up getting something really gross?
R:  No, no, they didn't do that.  No.
L:  Oh, that's good.  'Cause that would be awful.
R:  I think they would boycott if they did. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I have to sneeze.  Can you hold on a second?
R:  Sure.
L:  I -- oh, thank you. [NOISE] Sorry.  Allergy season. [LAUGH]
R:  The one thing -- I don't watch things like The Bachelor, I think that's dumb.  That's such a dumb show.
L:  Yeah, I haven't gone down that --
R:  And I don't watch -- what's the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other -- there's some other ones, like, when -- The Bachelorette.  I mean, I think that stuff's stupid too.  And The Millionaire --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  No, sorry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like, okay.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I haven't gone [several inaudible words]
R:  'Cause it never turns out the way they want it to.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Plus, I guess the point is, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with so many of those shows, and I think there was one recently on -- on Fox s- station, and I guess somebody -- the people were supposed to get -- couples were supposed to be married by America and I -- as I understand it, um, none of the couples accepted, um, being married to one another.  They were chosen by America and hooked up by America and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- never met each other before [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and within a matter of weeks, they were supposed to get married to one another and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that -- but that was a total, um, fiasco and -- and of course none of the people said, you know, "Oof, you know, I don't want to commit the rest of my life in [LAUGH] being married to you" [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's -- it's staggering, I can't believe the crap that, um, network e- executives think are are -- y- you know, is going to whet our appetite.  But what's even more amazing is that advertisers say, "Sure.  I'll spend millions of dollars paying to, uh, [LAUGH] put an advertisement in --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and pay for this program".  So -- oh well, and maybe we're all idiots for -- for watching it, but it sounds like you and are -- aren't at least watching it, so that's good.
R:  [LAUGH] See, that's why I -- the only one I like is Survivor, only because it's just, um, it's not like The Bachelor or The Bachelorette where it's -- they're sitting there choosing.  I mean, that's almost like, you know, like slavery.  It's, like, "Okay, I'm going to choose this guy".
L:  Oh, it's revolting.
R:  And -- well, and I don't like that.  I mean, at least with the, um, the Survivor show, you know, they're doing it for physical fitness and that kind of stuff.  Yeah, there's a little bit a, you know, stuff going on in the background, but, you know, I would be more out to let my kids watch that than I would if I was going have a m- -- do the Bachelorette or whatever.  It's, like, okay --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, here -- and I only get network TV.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't -- I don't pay for cable or any of that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.
R:  So, I don't watch a lot of TV, because of tho- those kind of shows.
L:  Right, right.  A wise choice, yeah.  I don't know why the current trend is for these reality based shows.  I guess that the audiences are watching them, which I find surprising, and I would assume it costs the networks very little to make them, to produce them, but I find it very surprising that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, they're saying that we want to see that stuff, 'cause I sure don't.  Um, I don't wanna watch that stuff, I find it pretty damn stupid, but --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, and then there's this other show, um, when I was in a hotel room, I was watching it on cable, and it's basically -- they put, like -- like, eight or ten college slash working people together in, like, a -- a great big huge studio apartment type thing, um, you know, one of those great big huge flats --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they make 'em all live together, and they have to get along, and they have to, like, you know, dress, they have, like, a communal dressing room, a communal bathroom.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  And then the -- you know, their bedrooms are all in separate areas but, you know, it -- it -- they sit there and they film, um, what's going on between the people, like, when a person pairs up, or if this person doesn't get along with that person or that person's talking about that person.  Yeah, it's like they threw all these people that don't know each other --
L:  That's ridiculous.
R:  -- um, college age, and they film this whole thing.  And I'm thinking --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- "Okay, what's the point of this whole thing?  Do they get money at the end of it, or what's the deal?"  I never did figure out what it was.
L:  Oh, my God.  Do you -- do they get filmed going to the bathroom?
R:  Um, they showed a couple of 'em in the bathroom.  They showed a couple of 'em doing the deed on TV too.  And it's, like --
L:  You are kidding!
R:  No --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- and it's just like, "Okay, like we need to see that". [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Unbelievable.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I'm just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm -- I'm completely flabbergasted, I can't even think of words to, uh, describe [LAUGH] -- oh, my God.
R:  Well, and the only reason I sat there and watched it is because I couldn't believe --
L:  Oh, sure, I would -- I would have watched it too. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that they would go in and -- and they would do that.  It's just, like, what is this?  And I never did, like I said, figure out -- you know, at least with Survivor, they get a million dollars at the end --
L:  Sure, right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  You know, that's --
R:  Where w- with this show, I have no idea what they do.
L:  I don't understand that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but I guess -- you know, in college, I'm late, mid forties, forty four, um, you know, we barely had a TV, it was black and white and, you know, cable didn't exist back then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't imagine this.  That's -- it's staggering.  But I guess, you know, things are so different, and that's reality TV, to watch a whole bunch of people just doing their daily business and then be -- it sounds like they'd be very gossipy and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and talking to- --
