R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello -- hi. 
R:  How are you? 
L:  Good I'm Dianne. 
R:  Dianne my name is Joe. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Quick way to make ten bucks, huh? 
L:  Yeah it's my first call.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mine too. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Are we really supposed to speak about reality shows? 
L:  Yes do you watch any? 
R:  Um, well you know I'm fifty three and the -- about the only thing that interests me anymore is the bachelor show that shows the pretty girls. 
L:  [LAUGH] Well I don't watch any reality shows, although I've seen a couple. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I just -- to me they're no -- they're almost no different than like, um, talk shows that you know you're just airing your personal business in front of everyone and -- 
R:  Yeah I guess its -- it's -- I can't imagine how they get these people to do things.  [LAUGH] I do have -- I have to admit I watch that fear factor show every once in a while because when I watch them eating the bugs and things it takes me back about --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- forty-five years ago when I was a little kid and we used to do that stuff for fun, nobody paid us to do that. 
L:  Well I just think that when I see people doing those things, I think that to do those things they must really want attention. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So you know that if you're going to go air your business on you know, national TV like that, you really want to be in the public eye. 
R:  Yep I -- I agree with you. 
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] but, um, --
R:  Where are you located? 
L:  I'm in, um, New [inaudible] New York.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, is that right? 
L:  And you?  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm in West [inaudible] Virginia. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  I've been here for [LAUGH] a number of years.  I used to work up in Buffalo for a while, and Virginia Beach, Virginia and [COUGH] I was in Toronto for a while, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- somehow we ended up here, this is where our kids wanted to stay and they got married and we've got grandchildren now. 
L:  Oh, okay.  But, uh, I guess we're supposed to talk for like the whole eight minutes about this reality show stuff -- like either one of us know much about, cause we don't watch it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah you're right. 
L:  But, um, you know what I mean?  I've seen it a couple of times -- I guess I can understand why some people -- like when people have fun watching it because it's -- you can relate to it cause it's real life. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um, --
R:  But -- but to -- to bare yourself -- you know besides -- you know some of these shows they bare almost everything on their body --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- but besides that you know to be kissing and hugging and you know passionate embraces and it just seems like. 
L:  Well I also think -- I just happened to watch part of a show on the other day, it was visiting someone in a hospital during a date and she happened to have on blind date --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I just -- I could not believe it because I mean, on the first date first of all they're talking about you know sex and, you know whether or not, you know how much they like sex or have sex [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then talking about you know, um, she starts talking about her breast size. 
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  And like all of this stuff on national TV you know on their first date --
R:  Oh, I'm gonna have to watch this show.  When is it on?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't even know, but I was thinking is if this girl's mother is watching this show, she's going to have a heart attack. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah. 
L:  Like I just find it so stupid that the people come across like such bimbos, like I mean -- and she actually said to the guy, he said something like, "Well you know I like a really classy woman", and she said, "Oh, well I have had a lot of people telling me I am the classiest, you will never find a classier woman than me".  [inaudible]
R:  Oh, yeah sounds like it. 
L:  [inaudible] Talking about her breast size [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe that's low class she's referring to. 
L:  Well exactly.  [LAUGH] So to me it's just more like, um, it is more entertainment to laugh at. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But I couldn't imagine really the people who really do it because they're getting laughed at.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well how would you like -- you mentioned -- how would you like it to be the parents seeing your daughter on there.  
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  How about these shows they make on spring break, with all of the --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- kids carrying on, you know the thing I regret is that I never had the money to go to one of those when I was nineteen years old. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah I never went to those either. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean I went to -- I went to uh, you know the Jersey Shore like after graduation kind of thing but --
R:  How is that?  Is it -- I --
L:  You wouldn't like it.
R:  -- I've been up and down the East Coast, but I haven't made it that far north is it pretty decent? 
L:  The Jersey Shore, well when I went and that was years ago and it was kind of I mean it was alright, but I mean I just remember everybody getting really drunk and trashing the hotel rooms. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And you know thinking like -- you know now when I look back on it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I -- I was wondering how the -- how the actual beach and the water if it's --. 
L:  You know I haven't been there in years, that was in eighty five. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  [inaudible] although I have friends who have houses in the Jersey Shore so they stay it's nice. 
R:  Well that's good, but, um, -- let's see what other reality shows are there? 
L:  Um, good question cause I don't watch a whole lot of them. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what else have I seen, um, I don't even think I've seen how to -- how to, um, how to marry a millionaire or whatever -- I mean I've never watched it once. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, but, um, the sad thing is shows like you know they need to be single to be married some without even having met them, you are just supposed to go marry the person. 
R:  Well but you know -- but -- but then again the way a lot of people are certainly not everybody there is a lot of people who don't think twice about, you know just moving on to someone else, just get a divorce and just keep on talking. 
L:  Well that's true. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, uh, I don't know -- I couldn't do it -- just like I can't really see these people who would do these things.  It's funny to watch them sometimes, but I just can't imagine doing what they're doing or getting on a show like that. 
R:  Yeah, well they have that -- the one out now where the young lady is trying to pick a husband from a group of twenty guys that are wearing masks. 
L:  Oh, right -- right -- right. 
R:  I just -- I can't imagine anything more demeaning than -- than trying to sell yourself like that and then hiding your face -- it just seems -- it seems so unnatural, I don't -- I don't think I would be a very good participant. 
L:  And -- but if you notice all of these shows, all of the people happen to be on tend to be pretty good looking people. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah that's true.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean to me I think they are the only -- 
R:  That guys like me on there. 
L:  [LAUGH] But you know I think there is like especially with women I don't think they'd have the confidence to go on TV like that if they didn't really think they were attractive enough to have people like them -- maybe to embarrassed to do it. 
R:  Well I think you are probably right. 
L:  Although you have to wonder if he winning or you know so attractive and all what's wrong with them --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because they are that desperate that they are going on TV to meet somebody or they need that much attention. 
R:  Well I think it's a -- money service is what it is, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To get a lot of cash and a lot of exposure and so on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But we -- what the heck -- oh, -- oh, so they have those entertainment shows, so what you know Star Search and things like that. 
L:  Yeah but I don't know -- I don't think those are considered reality shows are they? 
R:  You know I don't know. 
L:  I mean not they're -- not like living your life on TV so to speak. 
R:  Yeah that's true. 
L:  I mean those are fun -- I like those shows. 
R:  But I -- I guess to be an American Idol or to be a star you have to know how to sing and dance. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  To -- to play the piano or to play the violin or something like that --
L:  Yeah you definitely need to have a talent. 
R:  Yeah but -- but you never see any of those talents all you see is singing. 
L:  Well no American Idol is specifically for singing. 
R:  Oh.
L:  That is specifically to find a singer.  I mean they have singing all different musical categories though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Each week there is like a different category but -- see my husband he is in music management. 
R:  Oh, he is. 
L:  Yes, I actually wanted to go see [inaudible] on star search a couple of weeks ago. 
R:  Oh, cool. 
L:  So [inaudible]
R:  So you live -- do you live in [inaudible]? 
L:  No I don't.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] New [inaudible] New York. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about that? 
L:  Yep. 
R:  Well how -- is that anywhere near White Plains, New York? 
L:  Yes -- yes kind of. 
R:  Well my wife's, uh, family is from uh, -- well let's -- let's say her mother and -- and her parents were --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from White Plains, New York. 
L:  Oh, okay
R:  Before they moved [NOISE] to Virginia. 
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay but, uh, --
R:  [NOISE] You can [NOISE] probably hear my dogs in the [NOISE] background. 
L:  Yes I do. 
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I've got three.
L:  [inaudible] this should be a reality show, you know get on the phone and talk to strangers.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like a reality show or something. 
R:  Well Diana [NOISE] it's been very [NOISE] speaking talking to you [NOISE] I don't know how much time we have left but --
L:  I don't know I think they're going to warn us when our time is up. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  I have a feeling if we hang up before, we don't get our ten bucks. 
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly you know a dollar a minute can't beat that. 
R:  Well how did you get involved [NOISE] in this thing? 
L:  On line 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I signed up for I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I signed up for things on line. 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And then got an e-mail saying, you know do you want to participate in this. 
R:  Well I guess there are several to -- to make money.  I've happened to be -- I'm only like I said fifty three but uh, I was a manager for -- for thirty years [NOISE] and I had some serious [NOISE] heart problems so they put [NOISE] me off work [NOISE] so I'm trying to [NOISE] come up with ways to make [NOISE] some extra money and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] Good lord.  [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] My three dog saw another dog walk down the street, and that's forbidden around here. 
L:  Oh.
R:  This is -- this is their area.  So -- 
L:  Well, I don't know much more about reality shows. 
R:  Well actually I don't think I had anything to say about reality shows.  It would be interesting to see what other topics they might have. 
L:  Yeah.  Hold on let me look at my phone and see if it tells me how many minutes we have. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  No it doesn't tell me by looking at it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, some actually tell you as you know how many minutes on -- cause I'm on a cell phone. 
R:  How long do they actually listen to you?  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well I'm sure they record it. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I guess it would be kind -- 
L:  Well they must listen -- they must listen to at least a lot of them cause the whole point it's a -- it's a study on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people talking on the phone.  It'd be no point if they weren't going to listen. 
R:  Yeah maybe one of those -- those type surveys to see how many people actually do talk about it and how many people just set the phone down and [LAUGH] that's the end of it. 
L:  Yeah but I think that's why they said something like, um, you have to talk about for a certain amount of minutes and then, um, -- I mean think that's why they were
