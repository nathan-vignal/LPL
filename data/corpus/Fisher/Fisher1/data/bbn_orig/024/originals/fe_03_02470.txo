L:  Hello, my name is Stacey.
R:  Hi, I'm David.
L:  Hi.  I have a brother named David.
R:  Oh, great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, reality television.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm an -- I'm an addict, uh, sorry to say [LAUGH] of, A- American Idol this season.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I started watching it and I don't think it's the best -- it's not the best show on TV but I'm -- I'm definitely an addict. [LAUGH]
L:  I love Survivor.  I've been following Survivor since the first one.  I didn't watch it, but I sorta got into it.  [NOISE] I don't particularly watch American Idol.  I'm very busy.  I work -- I work nights sometimes, so --
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [COUGH] I'm a singer myself, ah, so I tend to be real critical [LAUGH] when I hear other singers and it's not like the best -- it's not the best --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- singing that I've heard, and I've heard a lot of people, uh, sing better than the people on the show [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's just, like, once -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I started to watch it, I didn't watch the one last season, I think I watched, like, one episode of it, and I think they kicked off someone that I really liked and it was like -- I was like, "Oh, this is dumb" so [LAUGH] uh, this season I started watching it.  I'm just -- I'm totally hooked. [LAUGH] Uh, and last night the -- the person I think everybody thought was going to get kicked off didn't get kicked off, so, uh, I -- I -- I even didn't -- I didn't watch most of the show last night, I -- we didn't have it on.  I turned on the TV and somebody else was singing, and when they are usually singing at the end, it usually means that they're going to kick --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- off one of those people, so they kind of give them, like, their last chance, and, uh, uh, that happened and, uh, when I saw the one guy singing, I said, "Oh, they didn't kick him off", and they ended up not kicking him off, but this other girl that also, oh, uh, I didn't think was going to get kicked off, so it's interesting.
L:  [MN] I don't, um, the only one I really like is Survivor, although that one -- that new one with Monica Lewinsky is really bad.
R:  Yeah, I [LAUGH] I saw one --
L:  Oh God.
R:  -- episode of that and I was just, like, "Okay, not again". [LAUGH]
L:  Sleazy.  Sleazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, what the hell are they doing?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, I -- first of all, it's bad because it has her on it [LAUGH] and second of all, it's bad 'cause i- i- it just is, it's a -- it's a very weird concept.
L:  It's a disgusting concept.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like, "Stop that", you know?  I mean --
R:  It's just really eerie to, you know, watch the people walk around with the masks on their faces.
L:  Weird.  I like -- I like the game shows more than I like the reality.  I liked Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
R:  Yeah, is that --
L:  That's fun.
R:  -- still on?
L:  I don't think so.  But it was fun.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  The game shows are fun.
R:  I haven't watched that in a long time.
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of the reality TV, the concepts just turn me off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That one with the kid, America's Most Talented Kid, I mean --
R:  I saw that.
L:  Ew.
R:  I seen that once, I think.  It was kind of weird.
L:  Child abuse --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know?  That's how you know you're a bad parent.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When your kid is s- -- is on TV dressed like Tiffany, you know, and -- and -- and shaking her hips, it's just [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ick, ew.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Don't like that.
R:  I watched The Real World.  One season I was hooked on that, on MTV.  Um, and, uh, I was living out of the country last year, so I didn't see the last season, but I -- I still really want to see it, because one of the people that was on, that was The Real World Chicago, um, one of the -- not that's it's quality television, but the one of the people that's on it was a graduate of my high school class, so [LAUGH] it's a big gossip thing amongst, uh, alumni of my high school, uh, that this one guy was on there, um, I -- and I still haven't seen it, so --
L:  I think if you can't get on television these days, you're not trying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was on TV when Donahue was on.  I got tickets to the -- see the show, that was fun.  At one point --
R:  Which -- which show was that?
L:  Uh, when Donahue was on.  It's a talk show in New York City.
R:  Okay.  Oh yeah, Donahue, yeah.
L:  That was fun, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, he had his arm around me at one point, I'm, like, "Okay".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It must have looked really weird, because he's, like, six feet three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm barely five feet, so it was pretty funny. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [COUGH] yeah, I'm -- I'm originally from Chicago and, uh, I've always to go see Oprah taped, 'cause that's where it's taped there, but those tickets are very difficult to get.  Um, but I really like her and I really like that show.
L:  I'm a native New Yorker.  I live in New Jersey now, but I'm a native New Yorker.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  New York's fun.  I haven't been to the city [NOISE] in a while though. [NOISE] I'm doing the suburban mommy thing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I live, uh, outside of New York now too, I live in Jersey city.
L:  Oh, I live in, uh, I live in one, uh, I live in a -- in Essex county --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, about ten minutes from the airport, just ten minutes outside of it. [NOISE] Jersey city is nice.  I think it's probably nicer than it is over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's the one drawback, [NOISE] the commute is a pain in the neck. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I do, I -- I like game shows as well.
L:  Game shows are fun.
R:  I have a, um, I'm a graduate student and one of my -- one of my classmates --
L:  Where?
R:  [COUGH] Um, at a s- -- a small school called, uh, Hebrew Union College in the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- NYU area.
L:  [Hebrew phrase]
R:  It's what?
L:  Do you speak any Hebrew?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, I had six years of Hebrew school.
R:  Oh, great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sure my Hebrew is atrocious, but I had six years of it.
R:  Oh, great.  [Hebrew word] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, so I'm a graduate student there, and w- -- one of my classmates was recently, uh, I mean, like, last September he was on The Wheel of Fortune --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- and won a whole chunk of money.  He won, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seventy five thousand dollars. [LAUGH]
L:  I want my husband to do that, 'cause he is really good with those game shows. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they're having trials for Jeopardy.  I think if you go online, seven online.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  And they do that.  I'd have to get someone to watch my baby though.
R:  Yeah, when I was younger, I -- I tried out for the team Jeopardy and it was -- it was very difficult, um, I was in the room for the audition there and they came back in and said, "No one in this whole room" and there must have been at least a hundred people in the room and they said, "No one in the room passed the test", um --
L:  Oh my, really?
R:  Yeah, and, uh, the -- someone asked, "Well, how many of the questions do you h- -- do you have get right to get -- get through to the next round?" and they were -- one of the women was very secretive, "Oh, we can't tell you that" and then one of the women said, no, we just had to get seventy or, like, seventy or seventy five percent.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh, which, i- -- I remember was the -- the way that you had to -- i- it was basically you had to watch, uh, kind of a -- a pseudo Jeopardy, uh, game where Alex Trebek's voice was going and there were about, like, fifty questions, all different topics and they were all -- they said that they were all basically final Jeopardy challenge kind of -- th- that level of challenge, or, like, the top of the double Jeopardy round and they would --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- just give you the answer, and you basically had -- you had under ten seconds to write down the answer.  Um, they just went on and on and on, and there -- there would be a lot of times they would ask a question, you'd be, like, "Oh, I know it", it's, like, on the tip of your tongue, but they -- i- -- I -- I mean, they would be on to the next question before you could even, uh -- 
L:  That sounds hard.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you couldn't really think.  Um, because I've always been good at that game when I've been watching it, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm sure it's a different --
R:  Harder.
L:  -- experience.  I ran -- I ran into someone actually, it was a friend of a friend who was, like, the all time Jeopardy champ --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or, like, had been, like, a five time Jeopardy champ.  I made the mistake of playing Trivial Pursuit with him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not a good idea.
R:  No.
L:  No. [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] Like, where did you get that information from?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, not good. [NOISE] Ay, nice day outside, is it?
R:  Yeah, it's beautiful.  I just took a walk.
L:  I have -- I'm watching my four month old daughter.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  She's learning to chew on things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She's figured if she could pull the pacifier out of her mouth, she can almost put it back in.  Hm.  Babies are cute.
R:  Great.
L:  When she's a little older I'm going back to work.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, this is not much of a topic, [LAUGH] is it, I mean --
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  -- I don't watch American Idol --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and I just -- I love Survivor, but that's about it.
R:  Yeah, I never really got into Survivor, um --
L:  I like the sociological aspects of Survivor, it's fun to see the sort of office politics, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in action.  I really like -- I like -- the problem is, like, that to win, you have to be really creepy, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, you have to betray everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, who wants to behave like that?  So, yeah, i- -- m- most of the time you wind ending thinking, "Ew" when you watch the person who wins.
R:  [MN]
L:  But it's still sort of fun to see people plotting --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause they're like that in real life, you know, when they talk about you behind your back and they break pacts and, you know, it's like -- it's sort of like real life office politics.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] You gotta wonder if all these shows are just a trend and they're gonna go away or if people will continue wanting to watch that stuff, 'cause just some of them are just so bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I think the American public's [NOISE] appetite for bad stuff is insatiable.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think so. [NOISE] Oh, somebody is crying because Mommy is not tending to her.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mommy i- is talking on the phone. [LAUGH] Oh.  Do you have any kids?
R:  No, I'm -- I'm only twenty three. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I can imagine, twenty three.
R:  I have -- I have two k- kittens.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they can be a handful, but they're not like a baby. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  At twenty three, forget it, I'm thirty two. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't want kids till I was thirty and even then I was, like, "Hm, maybe, maybe not".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's a good thing not to want kids a- at twenty three.
R:  Definitely.
L:  You have lots of time, you find out who you are. [NOISE]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Babies are a lot of responsibility, a lot of hard work.
R:  Yeah.  They're fun to play with when you're not taking care of them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and you don't have to be the one who gets up.
R:  I like playing with other people's babies. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's different.
R:  Yeah, I have two twin cousins, um, a boy and a girl that are -- they're going on three now.
L:  Oh, twins.
R:  They're really cute.
