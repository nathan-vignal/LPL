R:  Hi, I'm Sarah -- 
L:  Stephan- hi, I'm Stephanie.
R:  Um, okay, so I guess we start now, huh?  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  [LAUGH] Sorry about that. 
L:  Oh, okay -- 
R:  Um, can you hear me clearly?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Great, well hi, um, I'm Sarah.  I'm from Utah.  Where are you from?
L:  Oh, California.
R:  Great, well sounds good.  So, what do you think is worse?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, let's see, probably gossiping.
R:  Gossiping.  Mm.  Why do you think that?
L:  Ah, I know, 'cause it's, like, people just setting out, like, ah, um, things that aren't true and just carrying it on and, like, just basically letting people [inaudible] things that aren't true.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think it really hurts people when people gossip about them.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, just the gossip it just hurts people.  Mm.  Yeah.  I hadn't thought of that as being the worst.  I always kind of thought that it -- you heard that alcohol was the worst because it did so much damage and stuff.  What do you think? 
L:  Um, well, yeah.  Alcohol and, um, it's pretty -- [several inaudible words] I mean, not everyone does it in excess -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's a good thing.  It would be kind of hard if everyone did it in excess.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And also, like, um, gossip with, um, with alcohol -- you're kind of -- most of the time, unless you do it in excess, like if you're an alcoholic or whatever, you're only really hurting yourself.  With gossip -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're hurting, like, a lot of people.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah -- 
L:  I guess -- 
R:  -- it's true.
L:  -- someone could argue that, you know, alcohol hurts other people too but that's usually only when people do it in extreme excess.
R:  Yeah, or if they drive drunk or something.
L:  Yeah.  But, with gossip, you know, I kind of just --
R:  It poisons everyone's hands that it touches or yours I guess -- 
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  Yeah, that's so true.  Hm.  Yeah, I didn't think that they would give that topic like that.  Um, like, I thought they'd just say, "Here -- here's your topic.  Talk about".  Um, what do you think about, like, um, what were the other things I mentioned.  Um, over eating.
L:  Over eating?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah.  That's pretty harmful too.  I mean, you can either [several inaudible words] your food better, unhealthy for you and then, um, like, I guess, get a bunch[?] of weight and increase your cholesterol and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and be unhealthy [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah, it's kind of a problem in my family for a couple of people.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and -- but, they're working on getting over it so, that's a good thing. 
L:  Yeah, there's a lot and like -- like, I guess now that if you can get over that like [several inaudible words] [NOISE] you know, you can go to your doctor and they can set up, like, eating [several inaudible words] for you.  And there's all kinds of nutritionists out there and stuff like that. 
R:  Yeah, that's nice.  Um, all those nutrition shops and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think gossip is one of the worst.  Um -- 
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's nothing really out there that tries to stop gossip.  Like, you know, with alcohol and, like, smoking and over eating and stuff like that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, there's all these programs out there, like, you know, Alcoholics Anonymous or Overeaters Anonymous -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, or Narcotics Anonymous and so they can help stop that.  But, there's nothing really out there that tries to stop gossip.
R:  Yeah, that's true, except for, like -- like, you know, um, churches and stuff that teach against it and stuff.  There's nothing really nationally governmentally done or anything.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But, that's [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  That's for sure.
R:  -- I guess that it's kind of what they do in the government sometimes though is make up things about each other in politics.  I never liked that.  Like, if I ever hear a, um -- if I ever hear a politician during voting time dishing on another politician --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I generally won't vote for that person 'cause, you know, it -- that's just kind of low.  [MN] There's -- 
L:  It is, yeah.  It's kind of just like personal attacks, like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bring up all kinds of stuff.  They don't really have to do anything with how they would, like, serve their country or whatever.  You know, it doesn't really have any relevance, like, when they bring up personal attacks to how they would act as a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- politician.  So -- 
R:  It doesn't -- all it does is knock down the other person and trying to build that person up and [LAUGH] it doesn't build them up really, it just -- okay, you know, how are you going to treat anybody else that makes you mad, you know?
L:  Yeah, it makes them look like a jerk basically.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.  Um, but [MN] do you [MN] -- so, you don't know of any organizations that stop gossip?
L:  Um, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  [LAUGH] The church that I go -- 
L:  I don't know of any.
R:  The church I go to just teaches against it but -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- ah, it's the only thing I've ever really heard though, ah, except for, like, you know, people that know what's bad, you know, will talk about it.  But, you don't, like, hear about it on billboards or anything.
L:  [MN] What kind of stuff do they do, um, [several inaudible words] to teach you how to stop it?
R:  Well, there's a lot of lessons on it.  Um, just because -- just kind of 'cause -- like, they believe -- we believe in being honest, you know, and, I mean -- well, you know, it's kind of like if -- if somebody else does something good, you know, or if somebody else is -- I -- I guess that gossiping happens a lot 'cause of jealous and -- and we teach that, like, um, [SIGH] you know, if somebody else does something great, that's kind of a benefit to everyone, you know, I -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- mean, just because they're doing bad doesn't mean that that's an insult to you and also t- you know, we teach, like, to be honest and that sort of thing and, um, one of the ways that I -- I always just remember is that there's this poster.  It's called the Mormon ad that they put out and it's called, um -- and it has a picture of, like -- this is what I thought, like, earlier when you said that -- there's pic- a picture of people passing on this -- this black stuff hand to hand and it says something like, you know, don't pass it on, or something like that.  And it's just something -- something that is talked against because it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hurts people.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so, it's nice to have something out there like that.  Just that's the one thing I've seen though is that -- that poster.  It's like, I wish you could post that in high schools and stuff.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, it's usually because in high school they're so unsure.  Like, I guess, ah, I don't.  They're still going through the growing process and everything and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they don't realise how bad it hurts other people or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're kind of just trying to fit in so they'll do, you know, stupid things to try to fit in.
R:  Yeah, teach them -- it helps -- it's really cool when people are just nice to each other too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are the people I looked up to most in high school were the people who were nice to everyone and -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  The people that were there, like, they would move along from group to group.  Like, they would be friends with the nerds and they could be friends with, like, the popular people too and, like -- 
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  
L:  -- they would just make friends with people that were just good people, you know.  They didn't look at, like, how they dressed or who they were friends with or anything like that. 
R:  Yeah, it didn't matter if, like, they were gothic or they were, um, Presbyterian or if they were nerds or whatever.  They -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were just friends with them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it seemed like -- y- I know, you don't have to belong to a specific, you know, type of groups or [several inaudible words] that person [several inaudible words] people in, like, all types of groups.
R:  Yeah, that's really true.  Really true.  Mm.  Um.  Um.  Yeah, that was -- that was a problem mostly in my middle school and, like, um, I hear about it in high school but I didn't experience it in high school.  But, yeah, that'd be cool if they -- if they taught against it in high school and middle schools 'cause I think that kids, even though a lot of times, like, you know, it seemed like they didn't listen but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they hear it.  So -- 
L:  They do.  Kids are really influenced, like, 'cause when I, ah, like, as far as my graduating or anything like that I'm just thinking of going into education -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I want to be a teacher.  So, I'll totally teach that type of thing when I become a teacher [several inaudible words] like, and just how to teach people right or anything like that.
R:  Well, that's really cool.  [LAUGH] It helps break people's bad gossip habits.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's really cool, yeah.  People -- teaching people to respect one another that's, ah, that's really cool.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  They -- they don't even have courses along that.  Usually it's just like history or [several inaudible words], you know, the core classes like that, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they should have classes about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like social interaction classes or something like that.  Like, I'm in a sociology class --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, right, in my college and, like, a lot of it teaches about, like, socializing people and, like, how the people in the r- has influenced them so much, they think -- and like, teachers and [several inaudible words] anything, they're not supposed to influence the kids.  Like, they could totally turn them around and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- shape them into acting correctly if they put more effort into it.  [MN] 
R:  That's really cool.  Ah, that's cool you're in a sociology class.  I was going to take one, um, [MN] but I didn't get to -- not yet.  But some day maybe.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah, I thought about that when I was in high school.  I thought about that it would be really cool to have some kind of, um, class that taught you about social things 'cause, you know, to help those who kind of, um, don't know how to talk to people and to help people just respect each other, you know?
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  I mean, it -- if it was your assignment to talk to and get to know people, I mean, you'd do it a lot easier than if you -- you know, it's harder to do it just on your own 'cause it's kind of -- 'cause you're kind of shy.  But -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, that would -- that'd be really cool.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, there's lots of kids.  Like, you could be as book smart as you are [several inaudible words] --
