L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Catherine.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Desiree from New Jersey.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I live in New York in the city.  Um, um, oh God, of all the, um, well, I was gossiping, drinking, ah, smoking -- 
L:  [NOISE] And caffeine.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and caffeine.  Um, I'd have to say, ah, a- a- yeah, all of them taking into consideration in -- in excessive, I would have to say drinking.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I agree with the excessiveness it would be drinking as well.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Ah, and I -- I -- I only think -- I think all of them in -- in excess are horrible but, I think that -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- um, probably second would have been smoking -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- ah, I think that excessively drinking would probably be more detrimental to someone wh- you know, life in all aspects, um, you know, than like gossiping -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- or, you know, something like that.  I'd, um -- and I don't -- I don't think gossiping's going to kill someone but drinking a lot definitely could or you could kill someone else if you're driving or something like that.
L:  [NOISE] Right, exactly.  Alcohol and drinking is more, you know, causes more damage in the long run I believe, even over smoking.  So, that's why I pick that.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Um, yeah, I think, ah, if, um, um, a- yeah, it -- it, well, I wouldn't -- I don't have the medical background to -- to know what you were more likely to get first, emphysema or, like, ah, some sort of liver disease.  But, um, I just think that all the -- all the effects -- um, I mean, you know when someone's at a party -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they're drinking -- I mean, you can smoke too much and maybe it's annoying to someone else but, ye- you're not going to have an adverse effect on someone else whereas if you're drinking too much and you're one of, like, those rowdy drinkers, you could end up in a fight or if you even, in your driving, you could get in a car accident and you could kill someone.  Um, whereas with smoking it -- it's -- it's a more long term effect.  Like, if y- you know, you're -- if you're going to get emphysema it's going to be later on -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, whereas drinking I think you could -- you know, you could end it all in one night.
L:  Right, and I had that same type of idea in my mind as well.  I agree with you one hundred percent.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, do you have, um, like any personal experiences with it or ...?
L:  No, I don't do any of them [LAUGH] so, I really don't.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that's --
R:  I don't know -- 
L:  -- a good thing, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's a very good thing.  I -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't smoke.  Um, I think it's, ah, band in, ah, in -- in smoking in -- in New York.  It's the greatest thing that they could have ever done -- 
L:  [NOISE] I agree.
R:  Um, I actually think that people will actually go out more i- i- that now that there're -- I know would -- 
L:  I would too.
R:  Because I hate all this smell and everything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in my hair.  But, for alcoholism I know that my -- ah, my younger brother who's two years younger -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than I am has had an enormous problem.  And so, it affects our family directly because, you know, it's -- it's being pulled over for DUI.  And -- and thank God he's never ever been injured and he's been in so many car accidents and he's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never injured anyone else.
L:  Oh, good.  [NOISE]
R:  But, it -- it just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, it -- it's the fees and -- and legal fees and just all sorts of things my parents -- 
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- have paid is unreal.  Um, the amount of cars that he's totalled is [LAUGH] unreal.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, like it -- it's just -- it takes a horrible toll.  I mean, just this morning I was speaking to my mom -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, you know, sh- th- th- both my parents are in, like, a frenzy and I mean, right now is -- is he really d- is he fine.  He's fine right now but, that's the thing with alcoholism the -- the tr- the effects are -- are long term.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, I mean, you have one car accident and y- you know, court is, like, two months from now and it -- you know, things are pending and it -- it -- so, it's not something that you can just fix over night even if it was just a one night thing.  You know and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and i- in -- I -- I don't know.  Some people say it's a disease, some people say it's not.  Um, I think a lot of it is just, you know, your will power in getting things in order.  Um, so, we definitely had a first hand, ah, experience with it and, ah, much more detrimental than, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than -- if they would have had, I think, drug use as one of the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, examples -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- maybe I think I would have chosen that first.
L:  Me too, definitely.  Definitely I would as well.  Especially with it being illegal, you know?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] That would make sense.  [LAUGH]  But -- 
R:  That would absolutely make sense to, um -- because I think that, um, that with drug use then you -- it -- it enters your body even, ah, quicker than -- thank I think alcohol.  Um, I don't know.  Personally, I even -- I -- I socially drink and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- usually I drink wine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I can't -- I can't mix red and white because I automatically get a headache -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I can only have one to -- 
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- two glasses and then I'm a goner.  I'm a very bad drinker.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm a very, very bad drinker and, um -- and I've never ever tried drugs, ah, in my life.  I think, I just can't stand the smell.  I can't.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I never did either, only because I had -- I just don't want to.  I know it's wrong and bad and -- 
R:  It's wrong -- 
L:  -- [NOISE] I never did them.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- it's bad -- yeah, right, it's, um -- y- you don't know -- I -- I -- just to me it just sounds a little absurd.  Like, this is something that's about, you know, chemically altering my body.  Why, in God's name would I want to do this?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, I agree with you one hundred percent, I do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm the same way -- 
R:  How ah -- how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh, I'm twenty five.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Um, it's -- it's -- it's strange though, um, I think for people our age to -- to think the way we do.  I think most peop- I usually find that I'm in the minority of it.
L:  M- me too.
R:  Ah, I have had friends -- you know, one of my best friends, I think, has snorted everything up her nose that is, like, known to man, and -- and we're very good friends.  But, she knows to keep that away from me because I will always frown upon it and I'm like, "You know what?  It's your body, you do what you want to do.  But, don't do --"  
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- it around me".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  I can't stand that.  Luckily -- I'm lucky I have a boyfriend that doesn't do that or -- and most of my friends now -- I mean, when I was younger they did, but, the friends I'm with now, they don't.  So, I'm lucky.  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's, um -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  [several inaudible words] both agreeing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh?
R:  I guess we both agree on our, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, that would be [several inaudible words].  I heard you were watching -- 
R:  That we're -- 
L:  -- American Idol too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I heard it in your background.
R:  I, ah, I don't know.  I just -- I had the music on.  I -- I was watching it when I was eating, um -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm actually doing a final, ah, for a -- a class that I'm taking and so I, ah -- that's what I was doing.
L:  Oh.  Because we were watching it.  [LAUGH] Who's calling?  Well -- 
R:  It's -- it's -- 
L:  -- that's good. 
R:  -- good.  You seem well.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  But, that's good that, you know, we both have the same feelings about it and there's no big debate going on here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I -- 
R:  Well, it's interesting to know that other people think, ah, you know, think the same things.  Like I said, I would think that someone similar to my age group would probably think, ah, opposite.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I know i- in, um -- I work in the -- in the finance industry and it's very common for after work for people to go out for drinks.  Like, Thursday's a big thing to go out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, and it's not for me.  To me I can -- Thursdays -- I still have to go to work on Friday and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I have gone out on Thursdays and I have gone drinking out on Thursdays and I feel horrible the next day.  And I'm --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, "Why did I do that?  Why do other people do it?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I can't function properly at work the next day and I just don't unders- I -- I did it a couple of times and t- I said I wouldn't -- I'm not doing that to myself.  I j- I just -- I'm sick all day the next day.  Um, but it's very common and I think most of the time people -- their reaction to me is -- I don't know, like I'm always the oddball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like I'm always the third wheel because I don't want to go out drinking, ah, with people.  And -- and when I -- and when I say, "No" it's because I know that they're the type of people that are going to go and do it excessively.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, if I knew that they just meant they were going to go have a glass of wine, I -- I could join them.  But, I know that that's not what they're in for.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they're out for, um, you know, h- how many drinks can they have in -- in one night.  So, um, and another aspect is -- i- is financially.
L:  Yeah, that too.
R:  It -- it could absolutely ruin someone.
L:  That too, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  My roommate, um, is -- priorities are in absolutely disarray.  And, um, I'm actually supposed to be moving this coming weekend and that is one of the main, main reasons, because she never pays rent on time, and it's directly because of her social life and her drinking.
L:  Wow.
R:  If she's going to go out with her friends and I have n- she c- she can really drink someone under the table.  Um, she's going to go and she's -- like she's not here tonight.  She's going to go out whether rent gets paid or not. 
L:  Mhm.
