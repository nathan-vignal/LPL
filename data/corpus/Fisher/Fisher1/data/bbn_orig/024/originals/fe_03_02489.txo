L:  Vince Martin.
R:  Eva -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Eva Gonzales[?].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, and yourself?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess we're suppo- --
L:  Not too bad.
R:  Good.  I guess we're supposed to be talking about reality TV.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Okay.  How do you feel about it?
L:  Um, I'm not sure if -- how -- how I feel one way or the other.  I really haven't watched too much of it.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, the little bits that I have seen, I can understand how people get sucked into it.
R:  Yeah, but ha- -- have -- so you haven't really watched -- I ac- -- honestly haven't watched any of it.  But what I've heard is b- basically it's not good.  N- n- not to -- not -- it's very -- actually, it's not informative so, uh, what's to me -- my purpose is what's the use of watching it?
L:  [NOISE] Well, it's certainly not very indepth --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, and it's certainly not promoting humanity -- [LAUGH] humanity in any sense.  But I -- I think that there is something -- I -- I -- I've seen, like, an episode here, an episode there, um, mostly, uh, you know, with friends or whatnot and -- and there -- there is something very disturbingly entertaining.
R:  No, that -- that I believe -- just, what's that, um --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- ah, the one about the -- The Bachelorette, Bachelor?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I feel that y- -- just going on TV for that purpose is, I mean, honestly how -- h- -- [MN] I [MN] I don't even -- I don't remember what timeframe they give you to even know the person.  I mean, you could be with somebody in -- in real life a- -- a year or two years and still not know them.
L:  Right.
R:  What --
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's not a very good way to meet people, I -- I -- I don't think, at all.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  But --
R:  -- it's -- I definitely don't believe in them.  That Survivor, from what I hear, it's what?  In -- it's in its, uh, twelfth series, if I'm correct?  Something like that.
L:  It's been around a while, yeah.  I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah, 'cause -- well, and that information I got just from [MN] uh, actually reading a newspaper which stated that just a lot of the reality shows are getting -- getting sickening, but they seem to, uh, draw in a crowd, because obviously, it's like I said, Survivor's in its twelfth series, and then you have the -- I think they have, like, two new reality shows going on now, well, that are supposed to be actually coming up.
L:  Well, the one that -- that Mr. Personality --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- which is hosted by Monica Lewinsky, of all people.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  And what's that about?
L:  It -- it's a dating --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's a dating show, but I guess the catch is that all the -- it's one woman and I think it starts with twenty guys.  The catch is all the guys have to wear masks.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, she has to d- -- she has to decide -- pick her -- her love based totally on -- on personality.
R:  Okay, right.  Okay, that one I -- I -- that's the one I -- honestly, when I s- -- I think I read -- when I read that, no, actually, I saw a preview on TV --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I thought it was like a -- a j- -- one of those joke commercials.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, it kinda does.
R:  'Cause --
L:  It kinda does.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm, like, who -- who would -- on personality, okay --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then the guys wearing the mask is -- you know, it's -- I -- I watch the Nickelodeon channel and they have, like, junk cartoons about -- like the Screamer Box --
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, like, I'm thinking it's a commercial, but it's actually going to be a new series?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it's already --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's already started.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, probably they won't pick me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, the guy better have a nice personality.  But, let's see, okay, so we got Survivor series, Bachelor, Bachelorette.  I think only one of them actually so called made it. That was, um, [LIPSMACK] who was that guy?  God, I have their face in front of me, 'cause they've been all over the news, the only ones that actually made it.  God.
L:  I mean, in what sense?
R:  I'm sorry?  That -- that actually dated, they're married, they're supposed to -- I think they're supposed to get married.
L:  Oh yeah, right.  I don't know which one.
R:  Ryan, something Ryan.  I think it's Ryan and Fisher.
L:  Them -- I think that was The Bachelorette one, I think.
R:  No, no, no, no, no.  Actually, no.
L:  No?
R:  Isn't that the one where he was supposed to be a millionaire, but he's really not?  That one.
L:  Oh, Joe Millionaire?
R:  Joe Millionaire, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that -- that show.  I mean, that seems to be the only that actually had -- well, from what it seems, still a happy ending and it's --
L:  I -- I -- I didn't know that at all.  I know, like, he's been on, like, Oprah and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  That -- that --
R:  Yeah, no, because they seem that they're supposed to looking into a million dollar home somewhere, and they're talking about kids and they're still dating and they're -- it seems to still be -- [MN] that -- still be going on.  Then they had that other o- -- the new one, I think it is, on -- or semi new, that they meet the, um, [LIPSMACK] you have to meet the parents first.
L:  Yeah, that's, uh --
R:  That your parents pick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  And they have a lie detector and all that.  Yeah, that one's just mean. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Well, listen, it beats that, um, what is it?  Uh, the -- the -- the show with Simon.  And these are m- -- honestly --
L:  Ameri- --
R:  -- I -- I don't watch TV, but just from what I read.
L:  Right.
R:  And get on the internet, they seem to just ha- -- are finding just more waste of time on -- on the TV.
L:  Well, it's like a -- I think it's a vicarious thrill to see people get, you know, it's kind of fun to watch people get, you know, made fun of and yelled at and embarrassed and -- and I think the fact that it is, it's quote real makes it, um --
R:  Much more entertaining?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  I mean, I -- I -- you know, I -- I [MN] I don't know, because I -- I re- really haven't watched i- -- more than, like, one episode of a couple of the shows, but I can totally see how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people really g- get into it.
R:  Right.  No, that's what the -- like I said, I [MN] like, I think I quickly watched one Survivor series.  To me, it's -- just from the beginning it was just, like, a waste of time.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, uh, it's -- it's the talk of the town, obviously, 'cause everybody seems to be, uh, listening to it or, um, you're actually watching it.  A lot of people rush home just to watch it, so [COUGH] to me it's -- I personally feel it's a waste of time, but then I feel TV, television's a waste of time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's why we have computers now.
L:  Right.  Well, there's still some decent stuff on there, but I mean, I think that's the -- probably the problem with reality TV too, that it is so successful --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the networks just keep doing it, because it keeps working.  And eventually -- I mean, eventually people get sick and tired of it and it'll go back to --
R:  To radio? [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, no, it won't --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- go back to radio, but I think it'll go back to more, you know, the way it used to be, you know, like, sitcoms will always --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be around and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and things like that.  But --
R:  Right, but they have, um, okay, so we see -- they got Survivor.  From what I hear, like I said, there's Survivor, Joe Millionaire, Bachelorette, I think it was, or Bachelor guy, the one who w- -- I forgot the show where the guy picked the wrong girl.  They say he should have picked the other one, because he ended up breaking up with -- just basically like a real soap opera.
L:  Right.
R:  I forgot what the show was, but it was basically -- w- well, the same thing about, um, [LIPSMACK] it was the guy, and he -- he was supposed to pick the girl and everybody stated that he was supposed to p- -- I think the girl's name was Zena, he was supposed to pick her, because she really fell in love with him or something like that.  But again, this is all -- I think the new --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- the new show, I think I'm going to have to actually watch.
L:  Right.
R:  So that when I call up this topic line I'll actually --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- know what I'm talking about. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause obviously you've watched a little more TV than I have. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, I gotta see, um, c- -- [MN] okay, so what else would they have?  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Well, I think th- th- the thing that's kind of creepy now, is like -- like it's -- the -- the dating shows are so popular, and those are like -- things like Survivor --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, i- i- it's a little different because it's, you know, it's -- it's sort of like, you know, it's competitive but it's -- there's, like, some fairness to it and, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, they're not setting people -- like, Joe Millionaire, like they set those poor people up, like, girls, and, like, just lied to 'em for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and these people take, like, months out of their lives.  It's gotta take forever to film these things, you know?
R:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] definitely.  Definitely.  No, that I understand.  No.  But they have -- they have -- they have, um, [LIPSMACK] I forgot what it was, um, basically that's almost like Fear Factor.  It's almost like F- --
L:  Yeah, that.  Right.
R:  Like, it's -- it's like a topic stuff, it's like a topic, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ba- basically not like that so called reality show, but m- meeting for love and usually -- kind of reality show and, like, m- -- Joe Millionaire or Bachelorette, or you could have so called reality shows, like, um, Fear Factor and Survivor.
L:  Right.
R:  But they just throw a little extra in there to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I guess break up the monotony, I don't, h- honestly, like I said, to me, I -- I don't see a point in it.  But, I mean, if they're going on this survey for opinion, bet they've figured ours.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure they definitely got ours.  But, uh, no, so, let's see.
L:  Okay.
R:  Oh, my God.  How much can you talk about reality shows?
L:  Ah, I guess if you watch them a lot, I'm sure people talk forever, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm sure they have discussion boards and -- yeah.
R:  M- -- right.
L:  Fan clubs and all sorts of stuff.
R:  Yeah, well, it's like I said, they -- it's -- a -- a couple of people watch it, I'm that they'll -- it -- it becomes a phase, so then again eventually it's just like every other fad out there, it's obviously just going to die out.
L:  I -- I don't know about that.
R:  It -- well, th- --
L:  I mean, y- you know, you -- I mean, you have, like, game s-  -- you know --
R:  Mhm?
L:  You know -- and I said you had game shows was a big fad for a while and everyone had a game show on a few years ago, and now you have reality TV and --
R:  Right.  E- exactly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the game shows faded out.
L:  Right.
R:  How many game shows -- now you have reruns, Family Feud, ah, a couple of other ones, but not [MN] -- not anything that's, like, back in those days.  I -- no, reality show will be here for a while but, like I say, that eventually it will die out.
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah.  Well, if we're lucky, it will.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, but then, you know what?  They'll just come up with something new.  Well, yeah, they'll definitely come up with something new.  What was that?  But they have -- okay, they said ten minutes, and it's been more than ten minutes.  How much can you talk about reality shows?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My God.  Okay, let's see, um, well, come on buddy, you gotta help me out here.
L:  I'm thinking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You gonna be t- -- uh, thinking, "Let's see, what else in reality show" and can you think they actually ever listen to this?  Um --
L:  Just [MN] trying to rethink what questions they asked, if you watch
