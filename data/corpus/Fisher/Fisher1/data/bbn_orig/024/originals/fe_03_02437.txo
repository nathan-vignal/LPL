L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]  This is weird.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Who's this?
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- actually, I've had one call actually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it was a different topic.
R:  Yeah.  My name's Naomi.
L:  What -- what is it?
R:  Naomi.
L:  Naomi.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's a pretty name.  
R:  Thank you.
L:  I'm Ann.
R:  Okay.
L:  Wher- where are you from?
R:  I'm from, ah, Texas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, what do you think's the worst?  Gossiping, overeating, alcohol or caffeine, blah, blah, blah?
L:  [MN]  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  You know, that's the --
R:  They're all bad things.
L:  Yeah, well, [MN] I don't know.  I think as far as, you know, when I'm [MN] looking for a boyfriend, you know, [MN] I guess for me the worst thing is, you know, combine the overeating and not exercising --
R:  Yeah, that's horrible.
L:  -- because I can't -- I can't stand fat, so it's --
R:  [LAUGH]  Me and you both.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I guess --
R:  It's horrible when it's all pressing on you and stuff.
L:  Yeah, like, well, because my ex husband, you know, he -- he got really huge, so [MN] --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Started out at -- at, um, two hundred and twenty five pounds wh- when we were married which is fine --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when we first got married 'cause he was six four but -- but now he's about four hundred pounds.
R:  Oh, my God, how did that happen?
L:  He just kept eating more every year, you know, and -- and I kept making excuses for him but at some point I just got turned off.  I couldn't stand it any more.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah, I mean, there were other --
R:  You'd think he would have --
L:  Yeah, there were other things too.  Well, he -- y- -- you know, there were things we didn't know.  He has sleep apnea and [MN] -- and people that have that tend to be overweight 'cause they, you know, they can't sleep well at night so they sleep more during the day and they -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're just not active, so, you know, but he won't get it taken care of, so, you know [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's -- that's his fault [MN] but -- but so now you know, it's like, like, I just can't be with a guy [MN] that, you know, has too much fat.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  A little bit's okay.
R:  It's not attractive.  [MN] 
L:  No, no.  I j- -- I just think people should take care of themselves.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Not even through just you looking at it, just for their own health would be, you know ...
L:  Yeah, right, exactly.  Well, that's what I worry about with my ex husband too.  You know, is he going to be around [MN] to see all the kids grow up, so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.
L:  If, you know, he just -- he can't hardly move.  He -- he doesn't work much, [MN] you know, it's his silly fat, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow.
L:  Yeah, we -- we all know people that are overweight, you know, that, um, should -- should take better care of themselves.
R:  Yeah, everybody in my family is fat.  I'm like --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- the only one that's not a size, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sixteen and stuff.
L:  Yeah, I'm the only one that's not overweight in my family.  Well, I take that back.  My [MN] younger sister is -- has lost weight now.  She's on some kind of [MN] medication for her migraines and it's -- it's curbed her appetite and she lost a lot of weight and she's got down to being thin and it was some other headache medicine that made her gain weight so [LAUGH] ... 
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  You know, but my other sister [NOISE], the one in the middle, loves to cook and [MN], you know, she's overweight and my mom's overweight.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my dad isn't way overweight but he has, like, he has a beer belly but he doesn't even drink beer.  [MN]
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, but he snacks, you know.  He drinks a lot of cola and, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he li- -- well, my parents are s- -- just now are starting to get worried about their health a little bit and they're starting to go for walks every evening, so [MN] that --
R:  Yeah, which is always a good thing.
L:  -- that, yeah, that's encouraging but, [MN] I don't know, the smoking and drinking can be bad too [MN], you know.
R:  Oh, most definitely.  
L:  I mean, I had an --
R:  When you overdo it.
L:  Yeah, I had an ex boyfriend who -- who, um, [MN] who was a smoker and drinker, heavy, you know, he was alcoholic and [MN] heavy smoker and I don't know how I stayed with him for a year and a half because [MN] the smoke just made me ill all the time, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sinus infections [MN].
R:  That's like the worst thing you can do is smoke.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the drinking doesn't always hurt other people, it does sometimes but --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- depending what kinda alcoholic you are it can but [MN] but --
R:  Once you start driving and drinking but smoking --
L:  Yeah, well that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]  Smoking always hurts the people around you.
L:  Yeah, this -- this is true and [MN] -- and this guy, you know, like, begging, you know, I'd get a sinus headache and beg him to stop smoking and ten minutes later he got another cigarette, you know [MN].
R:  Oh, my God.  You should wear one of those surgical mask things, you know.
L:  [MN] Yeah, well I'm not with him any more.
R:  Don't stop talking -- just wear it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, you're not with him?
L:  No, no, he's an ex boyfriend.  No, the guy I'm with now doesn't smoke or drink and he --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's -- he's only a little bit overweight and, you know, just the love handles, and he's always trying to lose it, so [MN] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's always trying to work out and, you know, [MN] former boxer, so --
R:  Uh-oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, that's what he likes about me though is that I keep in shape and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- run marathons, so [MN] ...
R:  Oh, wow, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, but [MN] ...  Oh, of course, gossiping's, um --
R:  Well, I love to gossip though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I am a gossiping machine.
L:  It kind of depends, you know, on -- sometimes it's harmless.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if you're not --
R:  When it's true it's harmless.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But when it's just an out and out lie --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that's horrible.
L:  Yeah, you don't want to do that and [MN] sometimes, you know, there's just some great stories, [MN] you know.  [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  [MN] That you know about your friends.
R:  You have to say it.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  You get kind of excited about it and want to talk about it and, [MN] you know, if you're not vicious about it, if you're not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're not doing it to, like, put somebody down but just because it's, [MN] you know, a funny story ...
R:  I mean, anything could be considered gossip.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.  [MN] 
L:  That's true.
R:  All it is, is information.
L:  [COUGH]  This is true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Yeah, what was the other one?  Caffeine?
R:  Oh, yeah, caffeine and caffeine.
L:  I don't -- I don't really know too many -- I don't know too many people that are that addicted to caffeine, you know, though I'm making coffee right now but [MN] --
R:  Uh-oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have a headache and [MN] -- and that -- that's the only way I can get rid of it is with some caffeine and ibuprofen, so, [MN] but I --
R:  I wouldn't say that caffeine was a bad thing, you know.
L:  Yeah, well, I -- I guess there are people that drink coffee all day long.  The -- the worst thing about that would be their breath, you know, c- --
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's not like they're gonna kill you for a coffee.
L:  No, not -- not usually.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I mean, I guess if you're taking -- I guess, some college students have trouble with [inaudible] or something, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and get addicted to that but [MN] -- but, I don't know, one -- I guess there's people that drink cola all day long too.  That's not -- I -- I don't think it's the caffeine that's so bad in that though as the phosphorus --
R:  It's the --
L:  -- and the sugar.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and all the preservatives and crap in it.
L:  Yeah, they've actually found, you know, things that are good about coffee and tea too, the -- the antioxidants in them, so [MN]...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, the same with drinking, you know, wine --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's always good.
L:  -- actually good for you, so, [LIPSMACK] so, I guess those things -- so, I guess it's still kind of not exercising and overeating.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, that's -- there's never benefit from not exercising and overeating.
L:  Yeah, and I guess that you could see why some people overeat, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's comfort food and -- and I -- you know, I don't really understand it because I'm just blessed to have something in me that tells me when -- when to stop.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And if I don't stop I feel sick so [MN] it doesn't make --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it doesn't make me want to overeat.  The same with drinking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, after one glass of something that's enough.  [MN] 
R:  I know, I get drunk so easily.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  It's so crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have that one drink and you feel all good and you're like, oh, why -- why have five when the one can do you?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Why -- why have a couple more and throw up, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, or pass out and miss all the fun.  That's what I don't want to do.
L:  Right, right.  I'd like to remember what I was doing.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's always a good thing.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, all my friends can -- 
R:  So you don't get, like, killed.
L:  Yeah, all my friends can drink more but [MN] -- and I won't -- I won't drink and drive, that's -- that's for sure, you know, I know how that I feel really buzzed with one, you know.  I can't imagine trying to get in the car.  [MN] 
R:  I know.  That's crazy.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense, so, but, I don't know why people think they can drive.
R:  Oh, my God.  
L:  Although I --
R:  People think a lot of things they shouldn't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, although I have to say that -- that my ex boyfriend who was an alcoholic, he was so used to the alcohol that he could actually drive better than I could with my one drink but, [MN] you know ...
R:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So, either he was like -- like one of those very functional alcoholics that could, um, work and everything but he rode his bicycle to school 'cause he did have a DUI.  [MN] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think a lot of people have had DUIs, you know, but --
R:  Oh, yeah, it's so common, to drink and drive these days.
L:  Yeah, [MN] but -- but you know, you only have to just dr- -- just have one drink, eat food with it and wait and hour, you know, then you're okay but [MN] --
R:  Or just walk to the bar, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I don't -- I don't really understand why people keep drinking, you know, just to -- up the time -- to the time they're gonna leave and [MN] stuff but maybe 'cause it's a habit because they have more than one and they lose their judgment, I don't know. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't get it and I don't get the overeating 'cause, you know, like I said, I stop --
