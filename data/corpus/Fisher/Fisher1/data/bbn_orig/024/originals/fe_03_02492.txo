L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Nina.
L:  Hi.  Michelle.
R:  Hi, how's it going?
L:  Oh good, how about you?
R:  Oh, it's going pretty good.  So, our favorite subject to discuss here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- reality TV.
L:  Reality TV.
R:  [LAUGH] Have you had enough of it yet?
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH] So, did you have any favorites at all?
L:  Um, y- you know, when Survivor first started.
R:  Yeah, and you, you're about like me, I -- I've kinda given up on that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  About the only one I still do watch and it's only because, uh, my daughter likes it is Fear Factor.
L:  Oh, Fear -- and I can't -- I can't even watch that show.
R:  Oh, 'cause it grosses you out?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I just can't believe people are that --
R:  I can't either.  Desperate, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some of the stuff they do in there and it's -- it's gotten worse this season, I think.  'Cause last year, you know, like with the scorpions and stuff, that was about enough for me and this year they did -- they did some really gross stuff.  Really, really gross stuff.  So, yeah, i- it -- it's bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty bad.  And then you've got the, uh, you know, let -- let's get on TV and make a fool out of ourselves with the, uh, dating and marriage stuff.
L:  Oh [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't that -- now -- now that is the one that bothers me the most.
R:  Yeah.  It -- would -- would -- the one this year that I d- -- really did not care for was the one where they were having the people getting married.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty sick.  I mean, that's sick.
L:  That is -- that is, like, the stupidest thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
L:  You know?  Yeah, and then, now we have, what?  Mr. Personality, being hosted by Monica Lewin- --
R:  By Miss Personality?  Yeah, there you go. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God, when I saw -- the first time I saw the promo for that it was, like, "No.  This is a joke" you know?
R:  I haven't even seen anything about that one yet.  I'll probably turn it on just to see her and how she handles herself, you know?
L:  Yeah, I haven't watched it either.
R:  And -- and I -- and I've seen her lately and she -- she looks really good, so power to her, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the way I look at it.  I don't think her career and her life should be squashed because his wasn't, so --
L:  Right.
R:  You know -- you agree, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool, I'm glad to hear that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it -- it just -- it makes me ill, it's, like, wait a second.  Everyone's, like, pointing their finger at her and hello, you know, Mr. Man in Power, let's, you know --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- representing our country.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And he just walked away like he didn't, you know, have a care in the world.  So, uh, mm.  No comment.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, which other ones are out there?  You know which one I did like was, um, there is that, uh, The Bachelor one, the guy was from around, like, the mid West area and I watched that one.  'Cause I really did think them -- that h- he and that girl would end up together.  It was so stupid.
L:  Yeah, see, now I didn't, um, I don't know, the whole dating thing just ... I -- I --
R:  Would -- yeah.
L:  -- don't like -- yeah, I don't know, I --
R:  Well, right.  It's bad enough, like, people dating on their own, why, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- advertise and -- I don't know.  I --
L:  I -- yeah.
R:  I hear ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And especially once you get to be, like, in -- in your twenties and stuff, like, in your -- [MN] when they're rich like that, that's almost a mockery.
L:  Well, I think so too.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you can just walk into it.  Why would you wanna flaunt how much money you've got on TV and all that, if you, you know, if you're having problems meeting somebody and stuff, maybe you need to get your head out of your butt and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, drive, like, a cheap car and go out to real places and you'll meet plenty real --
L:  Well, that's what I -- yeah, and I always wondered, it's, like, okay, you have all this money.  Why is it so difficult to meet somebody?
R:  Right, right.  You would [MN] --
L:  You know, what is wrong with you?
R:  Because I don't know about you, but I have a ton of girlfriends, they're, like, looking for a guy that does have a lot of money and --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- it's, like, you know, that's not going to buy you all the answers to your dream, but I'm sure they can find somebody like that, because, y- you know, let's be real, a lot of these guys that do have a lot of money aren't anything to gawk at.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so --
L:  I -- yeah.
R:  And it -- it seems to me there should be [MN] anybody who wants to meet somebody should be able to meet 'em somewhere. [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, a -- wh- --
R:  Where -- where do you live?
L:  I -- I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay, so you're up east and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't know what the ratio is like there.  I mean, I'm in the mid West, as I had said earlier, and it's -- you know, there's more guys than there are girls.
L:  Oh, re- -- see, now, that's -- see, I'm just re- --
R:  Opposite up there, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I'm recently divorced and --
R:  Yeah.  Do you have kids?
L:  Um, a -- a tw- twenty year old daughter.
R:  Oh well, yeah, hey, you know, this reality stuff, you've lived it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Or you are living it, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah, the -- I guess you're kind of going through the thing of reality, life.  Yeah, the dating scene, it stinks, I mean, you know, people tell you where you're supposed to go and how you're supposed to meet people and it doesn't work like that.
L:  No, it doesn't.
R:  And then the ones that you meet at the place, y- -- between you and me, if -- if I were to go again, I probably would kind of use one of the dating services.  I don't -- you know, I -- I've never -- well, I guess I've known some people that do.  But why not?  You know the people are signed up for the thing for the same reason --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so at least you got a -- you know, you're starting out with one thing in common.
L:  Yeah, well, I have a friend that that's how, um, he met his wife.
R:  Yeah, and why -- you know, I -- I think it's a -- a great way to start.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if y- -- the matching up thing with, um, your friends and somebody knows somebody, yeah, that's fine and dandy, but d- -- I -- I wouldn't expect a love connection from it.
L:  No.
R:  No, just going out and getting out of the house and having fun, that's -- that's cool.
L:  N- no.  Uh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's -- I mean, you know, and that's what a lot of the reality based TV shows are.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Exactly.  And -- and if you look at it like entertainment, that's fine, but I -- I kinda get tired of it being all over now, when you turn on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, before it seemed like it was only on a couple of days of the week, which was cool.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you know which days not to turn on the TV.  Least they haven't convoluted our Thursday nights yet, have they? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think so.  I think Survivor is the only one that's on Thursday nights now.
R:  Right, right.  And I think people -- actually, that -- that was like the -- the fore founder, if you will, so I think people kinda, you know, the true fans will stay with that show on the Thursday night and then they've got the other stuff on TV, like the Friends and all those --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things that are real popular, so it's not bad.  Yeah.
L:  So why -- so why do you think this is so popular?  I mean, why -- why all of a sudden?
R:  I -- I think [SIGH] it's new, it's different and everybody can relate to it.  And e- -- misery loves company.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe that's what it is, misery loves company and -- and -- and -- and, like, the -- it's not phony or staged, I mean -- I mean, parts of it are, obviously.  But, I mean, it's just people can relate to different aspects of it, be it, you know, they like laughing at other people making idiots out of themselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they've done the same thing, I guess and --
L:  And I think we're all voyeurs deep down in our hearts.
R:  Yeah, I know, we are.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  We all wanna p- -- you know, have you ever driven past a house where the -- the lights are on, you know, and they have, like, sheer drapes or maybe the curtains are open?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, you -- you're still kind of, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't wanna look, but --
R:  Well, you do, though.  Especially --
L:  But you do, it's -- it's human nature.
R:  Yeah, especially if it's a house, like, a -- a new house or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you -- we're -- we're nosy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're nosy, and -- and it's just we like to see that other people a- are other similar to us with that, you know?  I -- I think we -- we become more comfortable as -- as, like, you know, people that are living in this day and age.  Maybe that's part of it too, with all the crap going on.  It's, like, you know, it's a diversion. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  You -- you know, the wars and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the unexpected this and that and tragedies, it's -- it's kind of lighthearted, and there's no [inaudible] to it, not really.
L:  No.
R:  You know, and it's -- it's much to do about nothing, you narrow down who you think -- you know, it's -- it's almost like voting, I guess.  People like to vote for their favorite, and then this kind of draws it out and, you know, in -- in the end some of us -- well, we'll pick the right one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Which some of us won't and, you know, it doesn't matter, 'cause we're gonna get another chance to do it again. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Yeah, y- yeah, I mean, you know, like, if you look at, um, like, American Idol --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- um, I know several people -- now, I w- -- I -- I don't usually watch the whole thing, I wait 'til, like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the end, um --
R:  I -- but you watch a little bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of it here and there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so you just kinda know the ones that you think are good, and then -- it was cool, the way you're saying, because then if you pick it up, like, in two or three weeks, if you're person's still there, you're, like, "Hey, I'm doing pretty good" and then you wanna watch more.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, people -- I mean, I -- the -- I, uh, uh, two people come to mind right away.  They are, like, obsessed with this show.
R:  Yeah --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and they have been since the la- -- since the last --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go round and all that?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm, like, you know, it's just a television program.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  When their favorite one gets voted off, "Oh n- -- oh, my God.  I don't wanna watch it", it's, like, "Well, come on.  It's just a TV show". 
R:  Yeah, but, you know, this -- that show, out of all of them, I really do kind of appreciate, um, purely because talent does get recognized --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and rewarded on there, and you don't have to be the one who wins in order to have your dream come true. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So that part of it I think is cool and I can -- I can see watching that, because there's so many talented people on there.  Then again, there were a lot that were talented that didn't make the cut.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that one's pretty cool.  I -- I kinda like watching that periodically.
L:  I like -- yeah.
R:  Th- the songs are great, they do, you know, r- remakes of, um, popular ones that we probably heard when we were growing up.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of 'em are -- are really good.  So, it'll be interesting to -- to see who does get -- I haven't even seen it to see who -- who's left on it.  Has Ruben left?
L:  No, he's still on.  He almo- --
R:  Okay.
L:  He was in the bottom two last night, and I was, like, um, "Oh my God, no". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm hoping he gets it, and if he doesn't, then there's, uh, you know, another person that would be all right to -- so, you know, whatever.  And making it this far, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Same thing we were just saying.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's, like, we pick one of the ones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that somebody that's one of your favorites?
L:  Him, and, um, that Clay Aitken.  I don't know how, but, um --
R:  I- is he the other guy?
L:  He's, yeah, very thin and --
R:  The blond haired guy, kinda?
L:  Kind of, yeah, with, like an elfish face.
R:  Yeah, I like him too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those are the two that I'm -- I'm with.  I'm, like, one's really diversified but the other one's just got a really good raspy voice and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and -- and if Ruben makes it, I think that's just great, you know?  'Cause it's gonna -- it's gonna prove old what's his face wrong about -- he's always nailing people about being overweight --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- screw it, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I ju- -- yeah, I mean, that's, like, you know, the one show that, you know, if I am home, I will --
R:  Right.
L:  -- make sure that I watch.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, like --
L:  But, oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, and then maybe they'll come up with something else, but I never did do the Osbournes
