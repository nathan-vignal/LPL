R:  Ah, hi cool partner, this is Steve.
L:  Um, my name is Shannon. 
R:  Hi, Shan.
L:  What do you think is first?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, the first question I, ah, huh, I'd say gossip.
L:  That's what I'm thinking.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  I mean, the other stuff seems minor.
R:  Um, yeah, I'd say except for maybe not exercising.  But, yeah, I'd -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll go with gossip.
L:  Well, I mean, basically everything you do is exercising really.
R:  Ah -- 
L:  I mean, unless you were to just lay down [LAUGH] all the time.
R:  If -- if you real- [several inaudible words] if you're really lazy.
L:  I mean, you'd have to lay down on the couch all the time and not do a thing.
R:  Ah, well, I mean, a- th- there's exercise -- 
L:  As I sit her laying on the couch.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  Then again it's like ten o'clock at night.  [LAUGH] I was like, my phone rang and I was like, "What is that?" [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, yeah, that's what I said.  But, um, I, ah, I, yeah, I mean, but there's exercise and there's really pushing yourself and doing the dishes may count as exercise but it's not like running or something.
L:  But, I definitely think gossiping.  I'm a military wife and [LAUGH] --  
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] And I get a lot of that.  My neighbour.  And I'm like, "Oh".  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, where are you stationed?
L:  Ah, Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  And they -- I live in housing and it's really bad.  I mean, you'll hear, "Me, me, me, and so and so did this.  So and so did that" and it's bad.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It gets really bad.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mean, [several inaudible words], like, "Oh, that's my friend" and then as soon as this person leaves, this person's running over going, "You know what so and so did?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I would definitely have to say gossiping.
R:  Yeah, gossiping, I think, will win on this -- on this one pretty big.  I have a feeling -- 
L:  'Cause I think it's -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- kind of vicious if we're doing that kind of thing.  But, most of the time around here it's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm sure that's, you know, what they said -- what they say in the -- in the military about -- they would agree to gossiping -- 
L:  What were the other ones that said though?
R:  Um -- 
L:  You kind of flew through it.
R:  Well, I -- I -- I obviously heard it just -- 
L:  Well, I mean, excessive eating.  I mean [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Ah, yeah, that was one. 
L:  What was that about?  [LAUGH]  
R:  Um, I don't know how horrible that is.
L:  I mean, I -- 'cause that would be a personal choice.
R:  But, yeah, I think most -- 
L:  Who would we to be to judge somebody [LAUGH] for what they eat?
R:  I think most of the other ones had, ah, [several inaudible words] was there.  But, those other ones had affects I think on, um, on you.  But, gossiping affects others and that -- that ain't right.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, everything else it seems like it would be -- it was more of a personal decision.  I don't think it would be like anything that I would say, "Okay, you shouldn't do that".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, I -- I totally agree with the -- the -- the other stuff.  Um, you know, we go and prove ourselves a little bit I guess.  But, you know, um -- 
L:  It's an overall personal thing.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Like, my neighbour had gastric bypass surgery -- 
R:  Ew.
L:  She -- yeah, she, ah, she used to wear, like, [inaudible] under it and, like, fifteen pounds and now she's, like, a hundred and fifty.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  But, it -- you know, she couldn't lose weight.  She had tried everything.
R:  Um, well, I think she found the hard way to lose it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- 
L:  But, she's doing really well.  But -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she almost died afterwards though.
R:  Thank God she's alive, yeah.
L:  Yeah, she had a really hard time.  But, she -- she needed to do it for medical reasons because she had back problems or something.  But, she had tried everything.  I mean, it -- she wasn't like she was lazy or anything.  She had tried all kinds of diet problems and exercise and everything else.
R:  Yeah, it's -- ah, it's -- it's amazing 'cause, ah -- 
L:  You know, 'cause some people could just be like, "Okay, I'm going to sit here and eat me some [several inaudible words] up on the couch and gain some weight".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  But, you know, I -- I guess some people just are luckier than others and the area of keeping weight off -- 
L:  I mean, she had been like that since she was born -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, some people are just -- 
R:  It's unfortunate.
L:  -- born that way.  I know that you see in the -- in the -- in the news and stuff, all people aren't born that way.  Well, some people are, you see, and from the time they're babies they're huge.  [LAUGH] We have a baby around the corner.  He's nine month's old, he's, like, twenty nine pounds already.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I know.  We're -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- like, "Oh, no".
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  His mama give him chocolate and whole milk, and I'm like, " [several inaudible words] you get him [inaudible]".
R:  Um, are the parents big?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe they got the wrong baby out of the ward.
L:  [LAUGH] I cannot believe.  I was, like, "Okay.  He's, like, twenty nine pounds".
R:  Or a genetic -- 
L:  That's my -- my daughter -- 
R:  -- freak. 
L:  -- is five and she weighs thirty two pounds.
R:  That sounds a little closer to right, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] He's about to catch up with her.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I think he'll pass through quite soon.  [LAUGH] Yeah, wow.  Well, bless them, like, I hope, ah -- it looks like they've got some, ah, big f- big food bills ahead of them.
L:  [several inaudible words] I'm, like, "Okay".  And she's pregnant again.  [LAUGH] Like four and a half month's pregnant.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Amazing.
L:  Gonna have her hands full.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's good -- I don't have children so I -- I'm envious [several inaudible words] you know.  Hopefully I will, um, not quite that big, but, ah -- 
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- hopefully they'll -- hopefully they'll be healthy though.
L:  [LAUGH] I think that's what all these talks are supposed to be about.
R:  About what?
L:  They -- you kind of [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Um, I've never done this before so I'm [inaudible] -- 
L:  I haven't either.  This is, like, the first time.  I think they tried to call, like, two or three times and I didn't know what it was on the caller ID and then I just got the email and -- it's funny I was looking at the email right as the phone rang.  I was, like, "That was spooky".  [LAUGH] 
R:  R- really, 'cause see I, um, y- yeah I -- I just signed up for it today.  I had no idea when the phone rang and, um, then there was this delay and I heard this automated voice so it kind of made sense what it was.
L:  But, what are the odds that I would have been looking at that email, 'cause I had signed up for it, like, last night.  And I had seen the number pop up and I was, like, "I don't know anybody in college".  [LAUGH] 
R:  How -- how did you find out about this?
L:  Um, one of my friends sent me an email.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Yeah, last night or yesterday.  And I was, like, "Oh, okay".  [LAUGH] I used to actually do studies for the University of Pennsylvania.  They would have a little survey to do, like, once a month and -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- you get paid, like, three bucks or something for 'em.  Yeah, a little -- ah, like research studies.  I guess they're doing this now instead 'cause they don't do those anymore.
R:  M- maybe I -- and I saw in one of the -- the local newspapers, ah, so I decided to sign up this morning 'cause, um -- 
L:  'Cause they used to do those instead.  They would do 'em on the internet.  You would just, um -- I guess they'd have them, like, maybe once a week and you'd sign up for 'em and you'd get paid, like, three bucks to do this study.  But, the studies were for ever long.  I just did 'em 'cause the questions were interesting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they were crazy.  Some of the questions were whacked out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] So, how does this work after, um -- 
L:  Huh?
R:  After ten minutes, I guess they tell us -- 
L:  Yeah, it tells you and it asks you to give it feedback or whatever.
R:  Oh.
L:  This is kind of interesting though.  I was wondering what kind of questions they were going [LAUGH] to ask.  I was, like, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, I had no idea what it was about.  Ah, I figured it was maybe some form of psychological research associated with it.  Um -- 
L:  They probably want to know what you're going to start talking about.
R:  Um, yeah, I -- 
L:  [MN] They probably have people, like, "Hey, where are you from, baby".  [LAUGH] It'd be, like [LAUGH] --
R:  Um -- yeah, I'm sure my girlfriend would love that.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm sure my girlfriend would love that.  But, yeah, I'm -- 
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- I'm sure that -- 
L:  -- what I'm talking about though?
R:  A- y- yeah -- 
L:  I'm sure they have people doing that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm sure some of that goes on.
L:  You know how people will be picking people up.  And then I'll be, like, "Okay".
R:  Um, maybe that's what they're trying to find out.
L:  I bet, ah -- 
R:  Um, but no.  I mean, there are, um, th- there are [inaudible] people out there that aren't truth- [several inaudible words] truthful.  So -- 
L:  People would do that though.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can see 'em doing it [several inaudible words].  They'd be, like, "Ay, what are you doing".  [LAUGH] And I'd be, like, "Okay.  I'm going to hang up now".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And my room mate's brother calls her all the time and he asks me, "Are you married?"  Or, no -- 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- he asks me -- or, he goes, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Nothing".  He goes -- he says something about, "When are you coming to Louisiana?"  I said, "I'm not coming to Louisiana to see you.  I'm married".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Where's that?  Fort Drama[?]?
L:  Huh?
R:  Fort Drama's in Louisiana.
L:  Oh, well, that's where she's from.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm from up north Louisiana.  She's from down south.
R:  Oh, okay.  I know there's, like, a big military place.  I thought it was, like, Fort Drama or something.
L:  Yeah.  That's where we're originally from 'cause --
