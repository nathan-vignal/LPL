L:  Hi, my name is, ah, Marina[?].
R:  Hi, my name is Jess.
L:  Hi.  So, we gonna talk about reality TV shows, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  All right. [LAUGH] Um, [LAUGH] --
L:  Do you watch them?
R:  Um, I -- I usually actually end up only watching the last episode. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Like, I -- I don't watch the entire thing, and then I watch -- like I saw, like, the last episode of Survivor and, like, that Joe Millionaire thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But that's about it. [LAUGH]
L:  And so you're not really into them?
R:  No, I don't follow them, really.  I --
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  Um --
L:  Like -- go ahead.
R:  No, go ahead. [LAUGH] I wasn't, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  Occasionally I'll watch them, you know, if I'm at somebody's house or -- I don't know, if I'm cooking or -- at the same time or something, but otherwise I won't watch them [SIGH] and, um, so what do you think about them?  I mean, w- why do you think they're successful?
R:  Um ... I have no idea, really.  I guess just m- -- because maybe people can, like, relate to the other people.
L:  Yeah, probably.
R:  And everyone has, like, you know, a dream of just being on TV.  Ah --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, like, you know, I -- I know a lot of people that watch them and, like, are always, like, "Oh, I'm going to be on Survivor" [SIGH] and, like, you know, they're going to submit everything but, you know, they never do.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, do you think that -- that it's actually -- do you think that, um, these shows are really real t- -- reality TV, or are these people are actors?
R:  Um ... they're, ah, probably, like, it depends on the show because, like, I know, like, a lot of times they actually, you know, like, hire people to do it.
L:  Yeah, that's what I've heard too, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I- I'm, sure, like, some of the time it's actually, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- reality, but, uh, I don't know, not -- who knows.  Sometimes the people are just a little too dramatic, though.
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I --
R:  But -- like, 'cause I watch the Real World sometimes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, yeah, there's a lot of drama on that.  It doesn't seem like those are how --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- actually, you know, people are.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I watched the Osbournes one time and I was, like, "No", 'cause this was, like, too much.  I mean, I don't know, you know, it -- it was like, um, they went shopping for furniture and then they bought puppies and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was just, like, "Who wants to see that?" you know?  And then they cleaned up the dog poop --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's, like, "Who wants to see that on TV?"
R:  I actually, like, really like that show. [LAUGH] But I -- I -- when I --
L:  You really like [LAUGH] -- I don't like [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I used to -- I watched it, I was, like, obsessed with it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I don't know, like, I -- I wouldn't count that, like, reality TV though, 'cause, I mean, that's really not realistic --
L:  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.
R:  -- unless you're, like, a millionaire --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and have nine hundred dogs and bratty children.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right. [SIGH]
R:  But it's -- I don't know, it's pretty funny. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And, um, [LIPSMACK] so what about these dating shows, um, like, um, 'cause they're kind of like reality TV too, you know, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, Meet the Parents or something like that.  Do you like them?
R:  I haven't really, um, the o- -- I think the only one I've seen is, like, Joe Millionaire, that sort of -- but, I don't know.  I --
L:  I haven't seen it.  I've seen pictures of Joe Millionaire everywhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I've never seen the show, actually.
R:  It's -- it's pretty lame.  Like, all the -- it -- I don't know.  I don't like the dating ones, 'cause it's just, like --
L:  No, you don't?  I -- I think they're funny.
R:  Well, yeah, they're funny.  But, like, they make me sad [LAUGH] 'cause, you know, it's, like, I don't know if the people are actually serious and, like, think, like what --
L:  Yeah, I don't think they're --
R:  -- they actually think they are going to get out of it.  Like when that, um, the Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire thing was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on a couple of years ago?  Like, that was just bizarre.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  And, um, what about, like, um, reality, like Cop -- you know that one, Cops?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you think about that one?
R:  Um ... I don't know.  I've never really watched it, but, like -- like, my Dad's always watching it. [LAUGH]
L:  It's a little scary to me sometimes, like when you see how people get arrested or, you know, somebody was beating up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- his girlfriend and -- and I don't know, with stuff like that, I don't really like to see it.  I don't think it should be on TV, but --
R:  It's kinda, l- like, weird that they'll be arresting someone with, like, a camera following [LAUGH] it though.
L:  I know, I know, I know.  If that was me, I would never agree to that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's just bizarre.
L:  Yeah.  And then it's just, you know, sometimes things that I don't really want to see, like, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So many problems and arguments everywhere.  So, to me, these, you know, like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or something like that is at least more -- i- it's nicer.  It's a little more entertaining, where some of 'em are just -- like, for example, that Cops, I think it's kind of disgusting but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, like, I guess the dating ones are, like, all right.  They're just -- I don't know.  It's -- it's kind of, like, good to, like, look at other people though and be, like, "Wow, I -- I would never do that". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What about, um, have you seen Fear Factor?
R:  No, I don't want to. [LAUGH]
L:  No? [LAUGH]
R:  I just saw, like, a commercial.  I'm, like -- I'm, like, "Oh".
L:  No, you're not going to watch it.
R:  Oh, no way. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [MN] Okay.  What else do we have?  Survivor.  I've never seen it.  I've heard so much about it, but I haven't seen it.
R:  [MN] I saw, like, the last episode of the first season.  But people really got into them, like, I mean, they, like, follow it, like, really hardcore.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Mhm.  Like, I remember, um, I was doing drivers ed and my instructor was, like, obsessed with Survivor.  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to the point that it was, like, sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  And, like, the entire car ride, every day, all she would do is talk about Survivor and, like, listen to the radio and try to, like, hear what happened and, um, it was -- it was --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it was pretty scary. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  And, oh, another -- I have a friend who -- who's, like, um, goes on Survivor message boards on -- online and it's just -- I don't know.  That's pretty crazy.
L:  That's too much then.  I don't know, I know, um, w- -- uh, when I was still in Chicago there was, um, auditions for Temptation Island.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, there was a lot of people going there too, and they were looking for couples.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then a couple of, uh, people showed up and claimed they were porn stars and [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, uh --
R:  People do anything to just get on TV.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  Well, see, I don't -- I wouldn't want to be -- I don't know, like, I'm in LA, so, like, I was asked if I wanted to be in, like, um, Blind Date or Extreme Dating or stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they pay you, like, three hundred dollars, but I didn't want to because that's not, you know, I would not want to be on TV for something like that.  I --
R:  I don't think it's worth it --
L:  -- I'd rather not be on TV.
R:  -- for three hundred dollars.  Like, I don't know.
L:  Would you have gone?
R:  For three hundred dollars?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, probably not.  I -- I -- like, maybe --
L:  No?  Right.
R:  -- if they paid me a lot more. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me too, like, if it would have been two thousand I probably would have -- nah, maybe.  But it -- yeah, no.  But a lot of people -- I don't know.  I guess that, you know, because it's so popular, these shows are so popular that, um, maybe they think they get discovered or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I don't think it's the case, but people think so. [MN]
R:  Uh, they do sometimes, I guess.  Like that woman from, um, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she was in, like, Playboy after and everything --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, I think sometimes, like, they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- actually do it.
L:  Do you think it's all age groups that watch these shows, or is it only, like, younger people, older people?
R:  No, I think it's pr- -- like, I think it's really mixed, like, throughout everyone.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, probably, and do you think that they're more popular in, like, the bigger cities or more, like, I don't know, somewhere in the country?
R:  Um ... I don't know.  I re- -- I don't -- I --
L:  Are you from a city or from a --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  LA, so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't know what people in the middle would do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know either.  I guess they -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  It's, like, a completely different mentality, so --
L:  Yeah.  And, um, when did these shows come out, though?  When did they really get popular?  Like, ten years ago, five years ago?
R:  Pretty recently, like, they got really popular.  Like --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- there's always been, like, the ones on MTV and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I think, like -- like, probably within the past, like, five years.  Like --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like, that's when, like, Survivor was first on and stuff.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty recently.
L:  And, um, I don't know, and I -- I never talk about these shows with my friends, but I remember, um, there w- -- I had a job once as a cashier somewhere on the weekends, and we were always watching the shows, 'cause we were so bored --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we would always talk about it, you know, like -- I don't know, we'd always talk about the people and -- I don't know.  So, we, like, everybody seemed to be really into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And had --
R:  That actually happened, like, with the Osbournes last year.
L:  Really? [LAUGH] I don't like the Osbournes. [LAUGH]
R:  Like, me and all my friends were, like -- we're, like, "Oh my God, did you see what Ozzie did?" [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, we were really into it.  And even my Dad, who's, like, almost sixty --
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  -- was watching --
