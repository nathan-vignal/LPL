L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Tammy.
R:  Hi, Tammy.  I'm Chrissie. 
L:  Where are you?
R:  I am at home.
L:  No, I mean what state?
R:  Oh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Virginia.  
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Ah, I have to be honest.  I don't watch reality shows.
R:  You don't watch reality shows?
L:  No.  I -- I kinda [MN] when they first came out I might have looked at 'em for a couple of minutes but, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] that old guilt[?] that people will do anything for money kinda thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- came to mind and I [MN] just didn't think that was anything that I wanted to watch.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, some of 'em are, ah, a bit reali- -- a bit unrealistic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I must admit I've watched a few of 'em.  Ah, I watched Fear Factor and I won't watch [MN] -- I watched it once and I won't watch it again because, ah --
L:  Now, I think I watched that once.
R:  It's a little strange.
L:  Yeah, that was just really bizarre.
R:  Especially when they're eating bugs and [MN] stuff like that.
L:  I watched em in a tank full of snakes --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- trying to get hockey[?] bugs off the bottom and I just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, I -- I -- I just said, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I watched --
L:  That's just carrying it a little bit too far.
R:  [LAUGH]  I watched Celebrity and, um, [MN] I thought that was interesting.
L:  I think it was a Celebrity one.  I think that's the reason -- the only reason I watched it was 'cause it was a celebrity one.
R:  Okay, this, the one I watched was, oh, several weeks ago and it was Help Get Me Outta Here I'm a Celebrity.  Ah, they put 'em in, ah -- I believe they put em in Australia.
L:  Oh, I watched that.  I watched that for a couple of times.  I wanted to -- I think I watched, I looked at it for a few minutes and I would just kinda look at it because I think, didn't they play it, like, every day?
R:  Just about, I think just about every night --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, ah, it was winter and, um, I needed something to get my attention [LAUGH] because I'm not much of a winter person.
L:  Nothing else was on TV.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I said, ah, I remember there was, like, nothing else on television --
R:  [LAUGH]  I --
L:  -- so you kinda just watched it and then I wanted to see who was gonna win at the end.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, then that kinda hooked me but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, Survivor, no.
R:  [MN] I think the reason why I watch it is because, um, it's the life of, kind of, like, um, you get to know somebody through television and, ah -- whereas when you're watching a sitcom it -- you know that it's just actors and they're pretending and supposedly when you're watching a -- a reality show it's -- it's for real but I'm sure they put some things in there just to make it interesting, make the show interesting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  But, ah, so, you kinda swore off of reality TV?  Why do you think you don't want to watch it any more?
L:  Um, [MN] I don't know.  I think i- it's not really real because how often are you gonna be in the outback and you have to, you know, catch bugs or whatever to eat?  I -- I just --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  That's just not a reality -- a reality [MN] that I would perceive because if I went on a -- a safari I still wouldn't expect to be eating bugs because I paid to go on this trip.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, the funny, what kind of grabbed me in the beginning is they all said, "Oh, I didn't expect it would be like this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I thought, "Oh, this is going to be very interesting" [LIPSMACK] and I kind of agree with you, ah, even though they're in the outback and they did have it pretty much rough, um, they did have some luxuries that you -- a normal person in the outback wouldn't have, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- after so many days of rain they decided -- the producers decided to -- to get some, um, some rain trucks in there so that the celebrities wouldn't be complaining so much because they were fed up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So, and, you know, if you watch, like, any other real show, ah, if they're in the outback they're having a rough time of it.  From -- from what I read about, ah, Australia, it's pretty rough over there.
L:  [MN] Well, I don't know.
R:  In that area.
L:  It's just like it just comes to my mind that people will do anything for money.  [MN]  The price is right --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, and [MN] I just think that's just kinda sad.  [MN]
R:  Right.  I -- I heard they're gonna have, ah -- I just heard, I guess it was last week, they're gonna have a reality based network.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, um --
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.
R:  They're gonna recap on all the reality shows that there are and then I guess they might have one or two of their own for the network.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I thought, "Oh, boy, there -- there's --"
L:  Wow.
R:  "-- no end to this".
L:  They've just kind of taken it to a whole 'nother level.
R:  Mhm.  I don't know.  I guess maybe the reason why they decided to start with these reality shows, this is what I heard, I don't know if it's true or not, is because the writers were on strike and they wanted more money and I guess the powers that be decided, "Well, we'll just show you, we'll start --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- having these unscripted --"
L:  "You don't have to write it".  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- reality [MN] shows that nobody has to write any scripts".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, now, it just kinda caught on.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Whoopee!  
R:  [MN]
L:  I think, ah, it really -- they really -- it really took off when they did that show on MTV called The Real World.
R:  Yes.
L:  And --
R:  That's been on for a while.  
L:  That's been on for a long time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --and --
R:  They had another one [inaudible].
L:  -- they kind of decided they were gonna, you know, pipe into that and then just kinda take that and run with it.
R:  Oh, and they had Road Rules.  I don't know if that's like a reality show or not.  I didn't see that. 
L:  Oh, kinda, except they're in a -- they're in a camper [MN] instead of in a, you know, a big house.  They have to go and they have to do -- it's kinda like, um, [MN] I think it was like the Predator, sort of Fear Factor kinda.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They have all these tasks they have to perform --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's how they make their money [MN] and that's how they eat.  If they don't -- if they don't complete the task or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't get paid and if they don't get paid they don't eat and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those kind of things.
R:  I wat- --
L:  It kinda forces them to work as a team and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  I've watched The Bachelor and, ah, at first that kind of got my attention.  I liked it when they had the female on and she was trying to choose which -- which man.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I thought that was [LAUGH] funny, just to look at all those men.  
L:  I call that slut TV 'cause I said, "Oh, look, it's slut TV".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Oh, but, yeah, she cried every episode because she just couldn't -- she didn't want to choose who not --
L:  She didn't wanna choose.  Uh-oh.  That's like, that's just not reality to me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How many times are you gonna have, like, twelve guys --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to just go out on dates and choose, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just not my reality.
R:  [MN]
L:  Anyway, it's not mine.
R:  And then they had that one show, I didn't watch it 'cause I thought it was totally ridiculous -- ridiculous, um, Married By America.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And I just happened to --
L:  I never even heard of that.
R:  -- be flicking through the channels, I think it was the last episode and they got up to the altar and -- and one of 'em decided, "Well, I'm not gonna marry you".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  And I knew that was gonna happen.  [LAUGH]  'Cause who in their right mind would?
R:  I -- I saw something called Are You Hot or --
L:  Oh, that.  Yeah.  I saw a little bit of that.
R:  What is that about?
L:  They actually -- they have a bunch of contestants, male and female, and they have judges and these judges read through these contestants, they look at their bodies --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they, they, um, look at their smile.  I guess they judge some of their personality 'cause th- they don't -- the people don't really get to see much on the stage.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I thought, "Oh, how ridiculous is that?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  They're, I guess, kind of grasping for something to put on television now.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm just wondering what you're gonna see next.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What's the -- what's the craziest thing we can do now?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's the next dumb thing we can do?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] But, hey, [MN] I -- I hardly ever watch regular TV any more.  I, um, look at the, um, the satellite dish and I kinda watch, ah, more reruns of old shows from --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, years gone by, like the, um, [LIPSMACK] All in the Family, Sanford and Son, the old sitcoms when TV used to be funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I like watching --
R:  When it used to be funny.
L:  -- old TV shows, Nickelodeon ...
R:  Ahah, that's what I do and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, just reruns of old shows, old sitcoms pretty much.  I -- there's not too much else to pick from.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really getting bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I don't -- I don't know about these reality shows.  It's just not my reality.
R:  I heard they're gonna take their course.  I'm sure maybe in another year or so.  
L:  [LAUGH]  See --
R:  People get bored.
L:  -- that means there's more to come.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What, I mean, what's gonna be next?  They've got a Bachelor and a Bachelorette.  They have the [MN] -- the Survivor people, [MN] the Fear Factor people, so what's left?
R:  I saw the very first Survivor and that was interesting.  And then as time --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- went on and -- and they had different locations, all it was, was it wasn't outwitting
