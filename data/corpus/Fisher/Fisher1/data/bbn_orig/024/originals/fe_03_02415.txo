L:  Hello --
R:  Hello.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Hi.  Let's see.  This is my, ah, first time on this service -- 
L:  Hey, this is my first time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, we're supposed to discuss what?  Smoking, drinking, overeating -- 
R:  Yeah, bad habits.
L:  -- etcet- etcetera.  And ha- bad habits.  And your feelings are?
R:  Ah, let's see, the only one that I find, ah, truly dis- distasteful is probably the, ah, the smoking one -- 
L:  Ah, you know what?  I have -- 
R:  -- 'cause I find it distracting from what I'm doing.
L:  I have to agree.  I do to.  Now, when you go into excessive then -- then I can add other ones.  But, smoking in any form is -- 
R:  Yeah, there's -- the -- my tolerance there is pretty low.
L:  Yeah.  And mine.  I feel the same.  That's amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And unfortunately my -- my daughter has recently taken it up.
L:  Is that right?  Isn't that something?  I think my -- my son did that all -- we -- neither one of us smoked -- never -- 
R:  Like social.
L:  -- never smoked in the house but then, like, well, my son decided he'd smoke. 
R:  Yes.
L:  And I didn't know it for a long time.
R:  Same here.
L:  Till I went -- till I took him to the dentist one day and I heard the dentist, when he was cleaning his teeth say, "Hey" --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I thought, "Nah" -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- no, it's -- it's still in denial, right? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then one day he turned to me and he says, um, "I need fifty dollars.  I'm going to pay to be hypnotized to quit smoking".  I said, "What?"
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  So, to this day I don't know if he's -- he said it worked.  But, you know, as soon as you go back to it, you're hooked again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm. 
R:  Yeah, it's -- ah, I think a long time ago I used to do a -- a pipe and it took me a long time to get over the attraction.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I never would -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  I was never hooked on anything like smoking.  But, I can understand it, you know?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  They can do that -- 
R:  Right.  But -- but the only other thing I have -- you now, I don't know where you live.  I've, um, ah, I live in California currently.  I've lived in Oregon, um, and most of the -- and I've lived in Colorado and, like, Oregon and -- and California are pretty much -- like, restaurants are no smoking at all.
L:  Right.
R:  Colorado is, like, partitioned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, that's how it is -- well, I don't even know if it's partitioned here.  It's like, it's -- 
R:  Yeah, you get the zones.
L:  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, California's pretty strong on that aren't they?
R:  Yeah, I think, um -- so, it's -- but, by the same token, I've lived in Colorado Springs and it was the only place I saw people walking around with air tanks.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  I guess that says something.
L:  So, what part of California?
R:  Um, I'm just north of LA.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, my cousin lives c- around that area.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, as soon as I can think of the name.  Riverside.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [inaudible] we live in, um, south east Ohio.  So, we're in rural Ohio.
R:  Okay.
L:  Actually Amish country.  So, it's, um -- but, that doesn't mean it's smoke free.  For the most part -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you visit people and things like that, you know, you're not around cigarette smoke.
R:  Yeah.  I find most people are probably more tolerant than they used to if you ask them not to.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, I know I've -- I don't know I did -- th- there seems to be differences in culture even across the US as to what's acceptable and not and so forth and so I end up seeing more smokers.  And, like, Colorado seem to be more accepting.  Their laws seem to be a little bit more lenient --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to smokers and [several inaudible words] I saw a lot more people smoking in cars.  I just -- you know, just get more visible and -- 
L:  Well, that's -- yeah, that's how it is here even six- sixty miles north of us.  Like I say, we live in kind of rural America and it's -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- but, I grew up in Akron[?], Ohio.  So, when I go back to Akron to visit, it's like, you know, everybody smoke in the house, you know?  And down here you don't have that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's just sixty miles away -- fifty miles away and it's totally different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, yeah, I guess we kind of agree on that smoking thing.  I guess the drinking to excess, you know, when you're -- I guess the more thing -- I'm thinking about that is driving, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're going to drink -- 
R:  I, um -- 
L:  -- stay where you are [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.  Make allowances, you know, if you're going to, like, a company party --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get a room.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly how I feel about it -- 
R:  Get a taxi, right.
L:  Yeah, yeah, because it -- 
R:  Yeah, as long as you don't put anybody else at physical risk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- through your behaviour.  I don't -- 'cause whatever that behaviour is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- I don't mind.
L:  Yeah, I don't drink but it -- 
R:  I guess that's what smoking is, is it puts me at risk as well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as everybody around me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I think that's what probably upsets me more is when people -- their -- through their behaviour put others at risk, not just themselves.
L:  Right.  Oh, I know it just upsets me when I see a -- like, a mother in a car or something, and a baby.  And I'm thinking, "There's that poor little lungs" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It doesn't have a chance, you know, in that little car. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just packed with smoke, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I guess that's -- we've got to talk ten minutes about this, huh?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wh- 
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I think -- I think that's, um, do they monitor us for what we talk about?
L:  I -- I believe we are.  I believe they, ah, they do.  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- 'cause that's, um -- 
R:  So, we're not supposed to change [LAUGH] the --
L:  So, we're not supposed to change the subject about bad habits?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- subject once they come to us and sensor us.
L:  I bet not.  [LAUGH] It's kind of interesting.  I -- when did you sign up?
R:  Um, my -- actually my daughter signed me up yesterday.
L:  Th- that's when I did too. 
R:  Yeah, she and -- that was the first time I walked in the door and she starts saying, "Would you be interested in, you know, signing up for this.  And --"
L:  Is this the one that's -- 
R:  "-- if I sign you up I get more money". [LAUGH]
L:  Is this the one that's smoking?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  What -- wait till you tell them.  "Ye- yeah, and I talked all about you".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, she's in the, ah, living room right now.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  Probably listening to me.
L:  Ah, that is really funny.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- I'm not -- 
R:  -- I think -- 
L:  -- even sure how it works.  My daughter just sent me an email and said, "Hey, you've got to try this.  It should be fun" you know?
R:  Oh, so it's your daughter as well?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  But, she doesn't smoke.
R:  -- mm -- 
L:  She has other habits.  But, she doesn't smoke.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think part of it is -- with my daughter it was just, I think, the -- the group that she's in.
L: Yeah.
R:  Um, her, um, boyfriend smokes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to, kind of, pile his cigarette butts when they're together.
L:  Yeah.  Oh. well.
R:  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I thought that was kind of crazy now.  But, I think the advertisers have a way of pulling in people that -- that wouldn't ordinarily smoke.  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Yeah, plus, you know -- 
L:  'Cause they [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- like any -- fashions come and go and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes, you know, being -- not smoking is fashionable -- 
L:  Yes, exactly -- 
R:  -- sometimes smoking can. 
L:  And then there's cigars.  I mean, they're -- they're big on that now too.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Girls and cigars.  Big -- 
R:  I remember I did after dinner cigars --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a little while.  These friends and I would, when I was in college -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would go out to this French bistro and, you know, we'd have coffee and dessert and stuff and then afterwards I, for a little while, I tried the after dinner cigars in the display case.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that was about [several inaudible words] for a minute with, um, cigars.
L:  Yeah.  But, I think that's fashionable again.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's -- that's back.  Mm.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, actually I was -- actually I've seen a few articles on, ah, what you might call gourmet cigars.  You know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very exclusive blends or, you know -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  And the -- 
R:  -- that kind of thing.
L:  -- and the [inaudible].  I mean, they're selling those now again [inaudible] -- 
R:  Maybe I've, you know -- 
L:  Hot item.
R:  -- every time it's -- ah, after a while they start to, when it becomes more rare they -- they [inaudible] it in to making it sheik again -- 
L:  Mm.  Well, yeah, and I don't know.  They probably have a lot of these in California also -- is the smoke shops.  They have become a big thing here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Cheap cigarettes -- 
R:  Cheap, yes.
L:  -- cheap -- cheap tobacco -- 
R:  Actually that's the name of the store.
L:  Right.  Exactly -- 
R:  Cheap Cigarettes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- cheap cigarettes or cheap tobacco or smokes, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and that -- you know, that's enticing.
R:  Yes.
L:  When you're young and you think, "Oh, I can get them cheaper".  Uh-huh.  And I don't think they follow through with the ID thing too much.
R:  Um -- 
L:  Some places do, but, ah -- 
R:  -- yeah, I don't know.  They've -- they've -- I know the, um, alcohol --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is, like, placing ads and stuff and working with, like, places like Seven Eleven for that.  But, cigarettes I'm not so sure about. 
L:  Yeah.  They're supposed to but I don't think they follow through with it -- 
R:  They're -- yeah.  And I don't -- you know, I'm not sure I would trust them either particularly -- particularly in a rural[?] area I remember it was fairly easy.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH] yeah.  It is.
R:  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  It is -- 
R:  And you can always get them from a friend who is legal.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  There's always ways around it.
L:  Yeah.  They -- they have more access than we do.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Half of them don't even drive cars and they have access to cigarettes [LAUGH] and alcohol and -- 
R:  See --  
L:  -- and have, yeah.
R:  At least I don't keep any -- I deliberately don't keep any ashtrays around.  But, she makes her own.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bottle -- pot -- or cans -- top cans [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Or, ah, kitty litter or, ah, cat food cans.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Is her favorite.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I don't know.  I find if somebody's, um -- she doesn't smoke in front of me.  So, she respects me for that but, ah, by the same token if there's a will, there's a way.
L:  Mm -- 
R:  So, if they really want to they'll -- they'll figure it out.  They just have to respect your --
