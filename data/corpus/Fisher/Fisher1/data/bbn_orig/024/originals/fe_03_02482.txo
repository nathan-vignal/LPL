L:  Hi, my name is Jennifer.  I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh hi, Jennifer.  My name is Erica and I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, nice -- nice to talk with you, Erica.
R:  Mhm, nice to talk with you.
L:  All right, uh, well, shall we jump right into the topic or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  All right, you want to go first, or shall I?
R:  You can go.
L:  Okay.  Uh, well, I do watch some reality television, not a lot of it.  I -- I'm -- I must say, I'm fairly hooked on Survivor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but that's about the only one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've not gotten into those, you know, Millionaire -- Joe Millionaire or How to Marry a Millionaire or anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  That just doesn't appeal to me, or the American Idol or anything like that, but I -- I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do enjoy Survivor.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Um ... I've watched Survivor a few times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [COUGH] I've watched, uh, Fear Factor, and I really don't care for it, because, um, one time I was watching it and it was too gross, they had to eat, like, some cheese and maggots were in it and that --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  -- was really awful, so --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that kind of put me off.
L:  -- l- like, just the promotions for it, I thought, "No, this is not for me".
R:  Mm mm.
L:  I -- I do stand corrected, I -- we do watch one other, uh, reality show whenever it's on, and that's The Amazing Race --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because we -- we find a lot of interest in that, and particularly as they go round the world, we like to travel a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so it -- it's kind of neat to see places where you've been or see places where we may want to go, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I've never watched that, I'll have to look out -- it -- it's called The Amazing Race?
L:  The Amazing Race.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's on CBS and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I think it'll be coming on again in the summer.  They usually run it, uh, you know, about every six months or something like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, it's very interesting.  They start out with, uh, teams, I -- I think, like, you know, ten or twelve teams --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of people, and they can be husband and wife or brother and sister or room mates or, you know, significant others or whatever, and they have to travel around the world [MN] doing various challenges as they go.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And getting there and -- and trying to get back to the point where they started, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the first --
R:  Right, okay.
L:  -- and so they eliminate, uh, as they reach different places, the last one to come in gets dropped off until it comes down to, like, you know, three teams at --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the end.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, anyway, I find it very interesting, and I think you would.
R:  Yeah, I'd -- I'd look out for that for sure, 'cause I love traveling too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, anyway, so, like I say, that's my big thing with reality TV or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those two things.  I'm just not real interested in American Idol --
R:  Mm, no.
L:  -- and --
R:  Well, I've watched it.  My daughter, um, you know, told me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I should watch because, um, we're originally from Alabama and there is, um, a participant, and he has a beautiful voice, so I watched him, um, the past few weeks but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was my first time, you know, really --
L:  I see.
R:  -- 'cause I really haven't gotten into, you know, those type of shows, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, you know, um --
L:  Yeah, and, like, it's, like, just --
R:  -- I've watched Who Wants to be a Millionaire though, um, a few times.  When it first came out i- -- I was, you know, I liked it a lot, but now I've kinda, like, gotten away from it, because -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't think they paid the contestants enough.
L:  Really?
R:  They sh- -- I think they should pay the last two that, you know, s- -- get to stay on.  I think they should pay that other person something, not -- not just let one take it all.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, of course the ultimate in reality TV, of course we've just had with the war --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- coverage and --
R:  Oh, I tell you.
L:  -- I just [SIGH] n- -- I, uh, well, it -- it was so riveting and -- and yet so excessive, I thought.  It was just --
R:  Too excessive.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just started t- tuning it out, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and wouldn't even turn on, you know, to it, because they -- I mean, it's just, like, an overkill.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I don't even know if they're still, you know, doing it all the time or not, on CNN.  I'll bet they are, but I just won't even go there anymore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I'm just, you know, the mind, it -- it just gets so conditioned, and all the violence and the -- you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  We -- we have enough going on in society with adding more to it, I think.
L:  [MN] Thank you very much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- that's for sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's -- a lot of the, uh, reality shows that -- that I've seen, like the -- particularly the [several inaudible words] one about who wants to marry a millionaire or something --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- just seemed demeaning to me.
R:  Very.
L:  I just, you know, "Please --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- people" you know? [LAUGH]
R:  It's awful, because I think that a man, if he wants a wife, he should go and find her.
L:  Exactly.
R:  She shouldn't be exploiting herself in front of America trying to see [LAUGH] you know?
L:  No, ex- exactly.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  And, you know, so much, you know, more for the woman.  I -- you know, like I say, we -- we have come a long way. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, we have.  We definitely have.
L:  A- and to be up there like a piece of meat --
R:  I know.
L:  -- like, you know, "Please, pick me, pick me".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, oh.
R:  And, like, it's their last chance, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And [MN] who's to say that there's going to be anything to that, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I just -- mm mm.  It's just too, um, too demeaning and too degrading for a woman to put herself through something like that.
L:  Well, yeah.  And, y- you know, it just smacks so much of some --
R:  Hold on for a second.
L:  Sure.
R:  Yes, I am. [NOISE] Okay.
L:  It just smacks so much of somebody, you know, really wanting their fifteen minutes of fame or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  "Hang on people, get a life", you know?
R:  And wanting to be dis- -- I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, "Go get a life".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And wanting to be discovered before America, you know, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Really.
R:  I don't even think that, um, how -- how would their families feel, you know, 'cause --
L:  Really.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I think about.
L:  Well, like I say, you know, with American Idol, at least you can see that they are -- okay, trying to get discovered --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they do have a verifiable talent [LAUGH] of sorts. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  But [LAUGH] [MN] --
R:  And they are competing, you know, and everything and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people are voting for them, so --
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- l- like I say, these marriage things --
R:  I know.
L:  -- or meeting -- yeah, the Bachelor and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just think, "Oh, how awful" you know?
R:  How awful, right.  I mean, they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- couldn't make up anything better than that -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to put on TV, you know?
L:  Really.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Really.
R:  I would not even wanna try and participate, because I wouldn't want anybody to see how desperate I was.
L:  Oh, a- absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- oh, that is -- oh, anyway, I just can't imagine anybody who has so little self esteem --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that they would --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, take part in that sort of thing.
R:  I know.  I just --
L:  I really can't.
R:  I can't see it either.
L:  So, what do you do, Erica?
R:  Oh, I am a part time stay at home mom --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- and, um, mhm, yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  And I do a lot of mystery shopping and stuff like that and, uh, find things online to do and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, and, um, I d- --
L:  Yeah, we're -- we're online a lot.  I'm a, uh, retired paralegal and --
R:  Oh, good for you.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Just thrilled.  So, anyway, I see a lot more TV than I used to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  So, I, um --
R:  You'd have a lot more time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when you're retired. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, I -- I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on my computer and watching TV and --
R:  Mhm, mhm.

L:  But, uh, so, like I'm saying, s- -- I'm going, "Oh gee, is this really on now?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It's amazing, just amazing.
R:  I know.  Mhm.
L:  But -- but I keep following it, and that's what -- you know, that's what just blows me away is that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- apparently these things are so popular.
R:  People are watching.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Because otherwise it -- it wouldn't keep coming on, yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But I think the newness of it -- but I don't think it's going to last, like, you know, um, Fear Factor.  I don't think that show will really last.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think eventually --
R:  It is too gross.
L:  -- it's gonna, you know, g- gross people to the max [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  But, uh [MN] --
R:  I've heard that a -- a few people have sued them also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't doubt that.
R:  Mm mm.  Me either.
L:  I don't doubt that.  But I will be watching Survivor tonight --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- to see who gets voted off. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  And then, I guess, like I say, all about TV, I guess I'll be watching George Bush's speech after that.  So --
R:  Oh, he's coming on tonight?  Okay, maybe I'll watch a little, just to see what --
L:  Yeah, I think they said at, uh, eight o'clock.  We're -- we're central time zone, so that'd be nine o'clock your time, I think.
R:  Right, yeah, we're eastern.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Mm-kay.
L:  But anyway, so, uh, I think that that's just kind of, you know, my feelings on reality TV.  I don't know where else to go with it. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I don't know either.  I mean --
L:  H- having said my piece, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that sort of thing, I think we're supposed to wait 'til they tell us that it's -- the time is up, but --
R:  'Til it's over, yeah, we are.
L:  -- uh, anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like I say, I think we've pretty well said all there is to say.
R:  I think so too, yeah.
L:  M- my husband and I are just -- we're -- we're getting ready to move to Las Vegas.
R:  Really?
L:  He's retired also, yeah.
R:  Oh, I -- I'll bet you are -- you are excited, huh?
L:  Oh, yes, we are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We are.  [NOISE] They're -- they're building us a new house.
R:  Oh, that sounds --
L:  And we'll be able -- with a swimming pool.  I can't wait.
R:  Oh, you'll have everything. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yeah, and then I can sit and watch reality TV all day. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's right, while you're swimming. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, just to stay on the subject. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Amazing.
R:  So, do you have kids?
L:  Uh, we have two grown daughters.
R:  Yeah, yeah, mine are all --
L:  And five grandchildren.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And --
R:  So, um, y- you'll be, um, a long way from them?
L:  Yeah, we'll be about fifteen hundred miles away from them at that point.
R:  Wo- -- oh, okay, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Well, you can always just get on a plane, though.
L:  Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.  They'll just have to come up and see us now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they can't w- -- come running over every time --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- they need a little thing, though. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm mm, mm mm.
L:  [MN]
R:  But you will miss them, though.
L:  Oh yeah, we will.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we -- we've gotten used to being close to them and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anyway, it's just better for my husband's health.  He has, uh, respiratory problems --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, Houston, of course, is humid and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, smoggy and stuff like that and so we need --
R:  Yeah, they have a lot of sandstorms there too, right?
L:  Uh, a -- not -- not so much [NOISE] sandstorms, but boy, we've got, you know, ozone levels that are --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- through the roof, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, dust mites and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mold spores and things like that [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you don't have where it's higher and dryer, like Las Vegas, so --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- we're moving there.
R:  Oh, Las Vegas.  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I'll bet you'll, um, be -- you'll probably turn into a gambler. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, the -- the realtor that we dealt with asked us if we were gamblers, and I said, "Well, I -- you know, we're about to move from the place where we've lived most of our lives, you know, out to a [MN] some place we don't know --"
R:  Mhm. 
L:  "-- anybody and don't have family, so, yeah, I guess that's a gamble". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that is a big gamble.
L:  [LAUGH] For sure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, but y- you'll probably just go every now and then to the casino or something.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We -- well, we enjoy it some.  We've being going there for vacations --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, for the last several years, you know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  On and off.
R:  I've never been to Vegas, but, uh
