L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Uh, my name's Tim.
R:  Hi, Tim.  My name is Amy.
L:  Hey, Amy.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Okay, thanks.
L:  Do you watch reality television shows?
R:  Uh, actually I do.  I, uh --
L:  Indeed?
R:  -- I kind of like them all --
L:  Really?
R:  -- to be honest with you.  I watch American Idol, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  I've become kind of addicted to them.  How about yourself?
L:  Oh, that's good.  So, you, uh, you'll be able to tell me something.  I don't have a TV so [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You don't have a --
L:  I've -- I've actually b- been going over to my neighbors to watch American Idol, 'cause they -- they have a little -- little party every -- every time, but --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I don't know.  Does that count?  Is it reality, I mean, I don't know?
R:  I -- well, I would think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean -- 
L:  I mean, they're -- they're singing.
R:  -- you know, it's a reality to them, right?
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  They're -- they're singing.
R:  Yeah, so, that --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- that's pretty cool.  I remember when Survivor first came out and it was, like, this big -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, new s- -- thing, but n- now it's kind of ridiculous how they have so many, um, [LIPSMACK] like that show, oh, Married by America, have you seen that?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, actually, I haven't but -- where -- it -- it's like the -- the audience picks the couple or something like that, or --
R:  Right, yeah, they pick who is going -- who's supposed to get married and they propose on stage without even seeing the other partner.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I thought that was pretty crazy.
L:  Good plan.  That sounds like a basis for a really sound relationship. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, how well could you get to know somebody in a couple of weeks or months --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anyway?
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I haven't found somebody in person, so I can't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- imagine, like, a couple of weeks, uh --
L:  Yeah, I think that's probably not the way.  Well, I don't know, though, they have all these, you know, I think it's, like [NOISE] -- like they have this game show and I mean, it's not reality TV or anything, they have this game show in Argentina where if you win, you get a job. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Like, they don't give you money or anything, 'cause the employment's so bad, you get, like, a good paying job, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I mean, [LIPSMACK] I think this, you know, this might be an avenue open to you if you're looking for someone [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  I -- you know, now that you mention it --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it may be so, like, um, [LIPSMACK] you know how people do personals and over the internet, I guess maybe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it isn't much different from that.
L:  Yeah.  I guess, I don't know.
R:  Huh.
L:  I'm -- I'm, like -- uh, w- what I'm wondering is when the -- the -- I think the next phase is going to be r- reality television shows, they're not reality any more, they're, like, supposed to be reality, but they're all staged, you know?
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  I was just reading about something like this, some, like, internet thing, some internet site, I don't even remember what it was, it was, like -- but they were, like, it was supposed to be this, like, real thing and -- and they documented all this -- I think it was like Blair Witch project, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but it was, like, it was actually, like, you know, it was made up, so --
R:  Yeah, well, I mean it is hard -- it's hard to know if it is -- it is all, you know, just for show or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you know, they -- they -- they want to make money, they want to have viewers, so -- and, you know, some people will do anything to make a buck.
L:  Well, I mean, yeah, like American Idol, it's like, I mean, it's all so -- I -- I don't know, it's so weird.  It's, like, so artificial, you know, it's, like -- l- like they're not, like, actually being selected by, like, people for their singing quality, it's, like, just this ring and call and vote thing.
R:  Yeah, well, in the beginning --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- they are, when they're screened.
L:  But it works too, I mean, that girl that won last year is, like, a superstar.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- you know, I was thinking about that too, now, with this -- the second phase that's, you know, coming up and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How many times can they do this before people are, like, "Oh, right.  Another American Idol singer" --
L:  Right, right, totally.
R:  -- you know?  What -- you know, how -- how many shows can they do?  I'm surprised that, like, Survivor has lasted so many seasons and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Fear Factor, which has become Disgusting Factor.
L:  Yeah, Fear Factor I saw once.  That was -- yeah, that was kind of fun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's becoming sort of -- your fears, it's become, like, an eating gro- -- you know, gross eating contest of [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, well, I don't know.  It's strange.
L:  It's pretty silly.
R:  Pretty strange.
L:  I wonder where all this has -- I think -- I think, like, Cops, you know, must be the original reality TV show or something.
R:  See, that I like.
L:  I mean, probably there were things even before that but -- or -- you know --
R:  I liked that.
L:  Like, kind of -- or American Gladiator, you know, that was, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they had, like, r- -- I mean, it was definitely all artificially set up, but they had, like, ordinary athletes competing against these, sort of, steroid, pumped up superstars and --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Well, yeah, I wonder, and game shows and all that, I guess it all had to come from somewhere.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  But I think with shows like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that, they tended to really use people that were your average people.  I mean, for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- shows that are there today, th- the screening processes that you have to go through, and American Idol, it's not that -- you know, it's not like I'm up there singing, like your average --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- person, they're almost a superstar.
L:  Yeah, they went through sixty thousand people, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Or something like that.  Yeah.
R:  And they are --
L:  Yeah, we -- we were talking -- actually, I -- I just watched, uh, watched this show last night, and, um, my girlfriend really liked the girl that got kicked off, say, "Oh, it sucks", you know, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it doesn't matter.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's five of them left, they're all millionaires already -- they -- as soon as she walks o- off the stage, she's got a record contract, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, none of these people are going to have any problems, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's weird though.  I'm don't -- [MN] it's such a weird show.  Uh, uh, did you see the little, like, Ford, like, advertisement they did in the middle of the show?
R:  No.
L:  It was so strange.  It was like they took, like, five minutes out of the show, with, like, the Ford logo hanging onscreen to, like, advertise this Ford, and, like, all this American Idol, like, contestants were, like, saying how cool the car was and stuff like that.
R:  Uh, no, but you know what I did, now that you bring it up?  Sure, I've seen, um [LIPSMACK] like, in the middle of the show where they go off and they were r- riding in some kind of race cars or something like that --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They're, like, subliminally, uh --
L:  Yes, all this weird promotion.  I mean, it's not that weird, it's, like, or they all, like, um, oh yeah, a- a- all of a sudden last night they had -- they go onto the set of Boston Public and, like, they shoot a little mini scene with them as characters in the high school and it was, like, well, of course, you know, like, Boston Public's, like, owned by the same network and all that stuff.
R:  Right.  Plus that girl, +Tamyra or +Tamyra that was on --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- last season.
L:  She -- she got -- she got a role.
R:  She's an actress now. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess there's a legitimate tie in there, okay, that's real.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  But anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what about -- what else about real -- why do you think they're so popular?
R:  Oh, boy.  I think I would have to say they started to become so popular because the people, the viewers at home sit there and they watch it and think, "Wow, that could be me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- but now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I mean, I thought that --
L:  But that's --
R:  -- when Survivor came out --
L:  -- I mean, that's like [NOISE] -- that's like what -- what, like, [NOISE] I don't know, a- -- television shows, uh, shows do all the time, like, why is it more interesting that -- rather than being this, like, made up fantasy world, like, you know, like, cop shows or, like, you know, I don't know, like --
R:  Well, I certainly wouldn't want to be on Cops --
L:  That's true, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I'd want to be on [LAUGH] Fear Factor or Survivor --
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  -- or something, and have the opportunity to win some great prize that, you know, maybe you wouldn't have otherwise.  But I think it's gotten to a level where it's not your average person anymore, really, that's on there.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Do you -- do you watch a lot of television?  I'm just interested.
R:  Um, yeah, I -- well, I go to school at night a couple a nights a week --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I spend a lot of my time studying, but when -- when I'm off, like, I -- I try not to miss American Idol.  The first season, I didn't miss any nights, I was totally addicted to that one.  Clare --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Kelly Clar- Clarkson won at the end, I was crying. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But did you want her to win, or --
R:  I did, I did.
L:  That's good, okay, yeah.
R:  I was crying out of joy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which i- -- thank goodness this is, like, an anonymous call --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I would never admit that to anybody else. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No worries.
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  I -- I -- I broke down reading email spam today, so I was, like, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] All right.
L:  [LAUGH] Just sort of got caught off balance, uh, yeah --
R:  You can relate? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, totally.  It happens.
R:  Yeah.
L: [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Well, that's cool.  I don't know, I -- I mean, yeah, I -- I'm, like, pretty -- I'm not -- not totally regretting not having a TV.  I don't -- I don't miss it that much, but I -- I spend many hours a day surfing the web, so I guess --
R:  Right.  So you -- when you watch the shows, you watch them over at your friend's house?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they've kind of made a thing of it, they make a big bowl of Tex Mex and we all, you know, issue witty commentary on this and that, and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, right.  Ah, that's -- that's neat though, that you could --
L:  Yeah, it's a social event more than a -- you know, like, a veg out event --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, uh, [SIGH] --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I get my vegging too, so I don't know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I don't know.  I think -- I think the whole thing's a just -- I remember first hearing about, you know, Survivor and all of those --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and thinking it was, like, the coolest thing, and then by the time, like, it came out and there was in -- you know, within a month or two there were another couple of shows, ah, it just seems like it's part of the landscape now.  It'll probably just fade into being another television genre, I think.  I don't know.
R:  Right.  But then, you know, people are just going to keep trying to beat that show and beat that show --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I wonder what does it have to come to --
L:  Extreme, like --
R:  -- public execution or something?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.  How are they going to ratchet it up one more?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think Jackass is kind like that.  I -- I didn't see it, but the reality movie, there's this thing, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- these people doing incredibly stupid things and capturing it on film.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I was also reading about this thing, which is like totally terrible, I -- I -- and I didn't totally get it, but it was, like -- like, basically these -- these kind of punk kids are travelling around, uh, New York city and, like, pick fights with bums, or, like, get bums to fight each other and then, like, tape it and, like, sell this as a -- like, video.
R:  They -- they --
L:  Totally alarming.
R:  -- [LAUGH] Boston Public did a show on that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Boston Public did?
R:  Boston Public, yeah, how the --
L:  Oh, that's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  -- the kids were, um, going out and -- and taping that.
L:  Oh, 'cause that's, like, a real thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah, well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they've -- I think they base a lot of their s- -- their, um, ideas on actual events --
L:  It's like Law and Order --
R:  -- that happened.
L:  -- or something, kinda [SIGH] --
R:  But that's, um, ah, that's pretty horrifying, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's even more horrifying that they do it because there's an audience for it.
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  There's --
L:  They're like --
