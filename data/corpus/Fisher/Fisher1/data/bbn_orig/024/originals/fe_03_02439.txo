L:  Hi, I'm Jan.
R:  Hello, this is Dick.
L:  Hi, Dick.  [MN] 
R:  What's your name?
L:  Jan.
R:  Jacques?
L:  Jan.  Jan.
R:  Jan?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, Jan.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, okay, Jan.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What do you think of the topic for the day?
L:  [MN] I think the worst is gossiping.
R:  The worst thing is gossiping?
L:  Yes.
R:  I think --
L:  What do you think?
R:  -- one of the worst is -- all of 'em are pretty bad.
L:  No, not all of them.
R:  Smoking, drinking ...
L:  But, [MN]  like, these are personal things.  Gossiping a- um, affects peo- other people, other people other than you, so ... [MN] I think gossiping is worse.  [MN] 
R:  Oh.
L:  You think all of them are bad?  Oh, you have to pick one.
R:  One?
L:  You have to pick one so you can't cho- -- you can't think that all of them are bad.  What's the worst?
R:  I don't know, I think [MN] -- I think the worst is smoking.
L:  Really?  You don't smoke?
R:  What?
L:  You don't smoke?
R:  No, I qu- I quit about six or seven years ago.
L:  Really?  And do you miss it?
R:  Not any more but I -- I don't like to be around people that smoke.
L:  Well, I smoke and I don't like to be around people who smoke.
R:  Do you smoke?
L:  A little bit, like, one -- one cigarette a day.
R:  [MN]  Oh, one cigarette a day?
L:  Yeah, it's not that much.
R:  How can you do that?
L:  How come I do that?  'Cause I like it.  Just one -- one a day.  So, I don't think it affects my health too much but it gives me, like, I like it when -- when I do it, so it's just enough to satisfy --
R:  Well, smoking's got nicotine and that's very addictive and if you're smoking one a day you'll soon be smoking more than that.
L:  You think?  Well, I'm gonna try and hold off.  Like, when I think that -- when I think that I'm -- I'm getting too addicted I'm gonna, like, stop totally.  And I know it's gonna be hard but I'll stop.  
R:  Right, because that's a very addictive habit.
L:  Have you had bad -- ha- has it been hard for you since you've stopped?
R:  [MN] Well, I broke it off slowly.  [MN] I, um, I cut back and I was smoking about a cigarette every hour.  I w- I was just cutting back.
L:  Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
R:  And, um, [MN] my doctor said I would have to quit or I would have a problem.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, he said what I should do was reduce it two cigarettes a day a week.
L:  Don't you think that, like -- like, if you come back to the same thing, like, when you're smoking it only affects you.  When you're drinking, like, sometimes it affects other people if you have, like, if you become violent or things like that.
R:  Well, if you're smoking and you're around other people it affects them.
L:  [MN]  Oh, yeah, but not -- yeah, that's true.
R:  I don't drink either though.
L:  [LAUGH] Really?  You don't do any of these bad things?
R:  No.
L:  Do you gossip?
R:  What?
L:  Do you gossip?
R:  I -- I -- I don't exactly gossip.  I will talk about people but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um ...
L:  What do you -- what's different between talking about people and goss -- like, you don't say bad things about them?
R:  I just say the reason I don't want to be around 'em or something.
L:  You say things when they are not around?
R:  No, I -- no.  If there's people I don't want to be around I will say why.
L:  Okay.  That's good.  I mean, I just think gossiping is bad because you never know what people say about you and [MN] if you say, like, it's a cycle and then everybody thinks that everybody is saying something about them and then it, like, it destroys trust and all that stuff.  You know, like, it affects -- it can affect so many people.  When you -- when you are smoking it just affects you and maybe if you choose to smoke with other p- -- in -- in front of other peo- -- like, you can't prevent people from gossiping, you cannot.  But you can tell somebody, "All right, you can't smoke in front of me.  You have to get out".  [MN]  So ...
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH] 
L:  So, you vote for smoking?
R:  That's the worst.
L:  What about abusing drinking -- abusive drinking?
R:  They didn't say abusing.  They said drinking.
L:  They said abu- -- they said abusing of drinking, I think.  No, like when you dr- -- excessive drinking.
R:  Excessive drinking.  That's bad.  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's bad too, yeah.  [MN] 
R:  They're all bad things that we're talking about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I had more trouble with smoking than I had with drinking and quitting.
L:  Really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But people don't become, like, don't change their behavior when they're smoking.  They do change their behavior when they're drinking.
R:  But that smoke gets in their lungs.  It goes all through your body.
L:  Because what?
R:  Smoking gets into your lungs, you reek of it, it goes all through your body, causes health problems, it kills you.
L:  But alcohol does the same thing.
R:  Not to that extent.
L:  You think?  I mean, the worst that can happen to you, like, if you smoke, your life is going to be reduced a little bit and you're gonna die of lung cancer.  If you drink you can, like --
R:  Lung cancer?  You can have more than that.
L:  -- affect your liver.  You can --
R:  You can have a hear- -- you can have respiratory failure. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Your lungs can fail.  [MN]  You can get kidney failure --
L:  From smoking?
R:  -- heart f- heart attack.  From smoking, yeah.
L:  Are you trying to scare me or something?
R:  No, I'm saying that's what you can get.
L:  [MN]  Yes, but I've seen so many people who have been drinking, you know, like, drinking -- they're, like, very, very much drinking, like, drunks, who've drunk all their life and they are, like, in wheelchairs because it's eaten up all their muscles and they can't move.
R:  There's been more damage because of cigarette smoking though.
L:  Sorry?
R:  There's been more damage because of cigarette smoking [MN] but usually they go hand in hand, cigarette smoking and drinking.  [MN] 
L:  You think?  [MN]  What were the other ones on the list?
R:  [MN] 
L:  Ah, +caffeine, caffeine.
R:  Gossiping, [MN] overeating.
L:  Yeah, overeating.  [MN]  Overeating's okay.  Eating is good.
R:  Yeah.  If you can handle it.
L:  Sorry?
R:  A lot of people when they're young they can y- -- overeat.  [MN]  But when they get older they can't.
L:  Because they get too fat?
R:  Right.  [MN] 
L:  Ah.  I mean, p- -- young people get fat too.
R:  Some kids do, yeah, if they eat the wrong food.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [MN]  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm so upset when I see parents giving only burgers and candy and chips to their kids because that's all the kids wanna eat.  Then at six years old they are not obese and then it's very hard for their kids to come back to being healthy again.
R:  [MN]  Right.  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  But, you know, that's only bad for kids.  When you're an adult and you're overeating it's your problem.  It's like cigarettes, it doesn't affect other people too much because it's your problem.
R:  Have you ever been in a restaurant and had cigarette smoke around?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, do you like it?
L:  I don't like it too much but usually, like, in countries where -- I mean, I'm from France and you can't smoke --
R:  Where?
L:  France.
R:  Oh, France, yeah.
L:  You can't smoke in the restaurant, like in a certain part of the restaurant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if somebody's smoking next to you it means that you have chosen to be in the smoking section so you can handle it.  If you don't wanna be next to people who smoke then you can just go away.
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, it's your choice.  Mostly people who smoke though don't smell anything.  They don't notice that.  It doesn't bother them.
R:  Well, people that do smoke don't mind it.
L:  They don't want other people to smoke next to them?
R:  People that do smoke?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't care.  [MN]  They'll just light up +themselves.
L:  Yeah, well, but --
R:  Well, seventy five percent of the people in America don't smoke.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I -- I mean [MN] since I live in America I'm very bothered by people who smoke next to me.  I think it stinks, you know.  I mean, I'd never --
R:  Well, I --
L:  I never smoke to --
R:  It ruins your clothes.  It ruins your house or apartment, wherever you live, your car.  It's just a dirty --
L:  Yeah, it does smell very bad.
R:  -- stinking habit.  And it's bad for your health.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  It's pretty bad.  [LAUGH]  [MN]  But --
R:  Right, did you ever see your car windows after you've been smoking for about six months?  After you have in the car?
L:  What?
R:  Have you ever seen the car windows inside after you've smoked for six months?
L:  I -- I mean, I never, like, I never smoke in my car so I know it doesn't smell but I know my parents smoke in the car and it does, like, it smells when they smoke in it but when they are done, like, it doesn't s- -- I don't smell it like it stays on it because I'm so used to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you are very much emerged in, like, smoke all the time, you don't smell anything --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- at all.  [MN]  You know.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  [MN]  [NOISE] 
L:  So, I -- I mean, I think, you know smoking at least --
R:  [MN]  Another bad health problem is overeating.
L:  Smoking gives you troub-
