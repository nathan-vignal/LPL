L:  Hello, ah, this is Alan.
R:  Hi.  I'm Margaret.
L:  Hi Margaret, ah, ah, pleased to be talking with you.
R:  Ah -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  Hi.  It's nice to be talking to you too.
L:  What do you, ah -- what do you think is worse from -- from that list?
R:  Oh, goodness.  There's a lot of bad habits there.  Um, of all the bad habits, probably smoking.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- I would -- I would tend to agree with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's because of -- it's because of personal experience in my family.
R:  Me too.
L:  Yes.  My step father smoked a pipe and a -- cig- cigarettes and a pipe -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for many years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, he -- he had the -- the strength to -- to quit the habit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I was really -- I was really proud of him and, ah, ten years after he quit he came down with cancer of the jaw.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And died a very unpleasant death.
R:  Ah, both my parents died from smoking, ah, lung associated smoking.  And it was a very unpleasant experience in our family and a lot of people in our family still smoke and it's very unpleasant and we've tried to, you know, tell them to try the patch or the pill or -- or other ways to quit and they're -- you know, I know it takes -- I think it takes will power but that's probably the worst habit of the list.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  To me.
L:  I -- I think so -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- also my -- my mom still smokes and she has bad emphysema and -- 
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- it's just a -- you know, ah, it's, ah, really very unpleasant and it's not that the other ones don't -- can't be -- be bad too, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think anything in excess of -- the -- the exercise one is an -- an important one.
R:  Yes.
L:  I have -- I was -- last summer I was, ah, diagnosed with diabetes and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L: -- ah, I have, ah, been able to control it, ah, fortunately completely through, ah, diet and exercise and -- 
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  -- it's amazing how much difference walking or swimming or sometimes I, ah -- sometimes I use a treadmill.  But, most often wa- just walking a -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- half hour a day -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- makes.  It's, you know, it's, um, six months after my initial diagnosis my -- my long term tests were in the normal range.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  And that's without any -- without any mediation at all and -- 
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  -- and, yeah, and I will -- I will -- 
R:  Do you have to take insulin or -- 
L:  -- no.  No medica- no insulin, no medication -- 
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  -- at all.  No, I'm -- I'm so glad it was caught at the -- at the right time.  And the other thing is -- is, a- I am eating somewhat healthier.  I'm -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I -- I don't eat, you know, I don't, ah, drink sweet pop or -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or -- or, like, lemonade or those kind of things.  But, I'm certainly not a saint about my -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ab- about my -- my eating habits.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and it seems like as long as I'm just somewhat reasonable -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about -- about things, as long as I'm -- as long as I'm keeping up with the -- the exercise my, you know, I'm -- I'm fine.  So, I think -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think la- lack of exercise is -- 
R:  I've been --
L:  [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- doing some walking myself.  Ah, I had some weight gain here -- I'm on medication though that added to my weight gain.
L:  I see.
R:  And, ah, I don't gain more weight or lose any weight but it contributed to a weight gain that never varied.  But -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- but the walking made me feel healthier.  It just -- I've never lost, I've never gained.  It just stayed at one level.  But, the walking made me feel better.  I just felt so blah and so out of shape.  I'm forty six.  So, I don't know how old you are but I was feeling elderly -- 
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  I was feeling so elderly.  I mean, forty six is getting up there but that's not elderly quite yet -- 
L:  No, it's not.  No.  You got, ah -- there's some life there.  I'm forty four wh- myself, ah -- what ar- what area of the -- of the country are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Iowa.
L:  Iowa.  I'm out -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- out here on the west coast in -- in -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- Seattle.  So, ah -- 
R:  Our weather here is quite, ah -- I used to live out on the west coast and I've lived on the east coast and the weather is so much better both places that -- Iowa is more cold and yuck, [LAUGH] to be honest.  I like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the west and the east coast better.  My son's now living on the east coast.  I'm to be going there soon and they have such nice better climate and I felt so much better when I did live there.  And now, Iowa has a -- you know, the winters are harsher and I'm telling ya I was just -- 
L:  Harder -- harder to go walking out and when the snow is, ah -- 
R:  Oh, ho, yeah.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [inaudible] snowing.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sure.
R:  I was just feeling -- and now that winter's over here, I've been getting back into the walking and I'm feeling so much better.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's -- 
R:  It -- this is quite a difference in climate and -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- and everything.
L:  Well, spring is probably pretty nice there.
R:  Ah, finally it's here.  [LAUGH].  Finally.
L:  So -- so, ah, w- did you move to Iowa for work, or --
R:  Ah, actually I had s- ah, I have children on both, ah, the east coast and here.  I moved here.  I have a son with cerebral palsy.  I moved back here to help him.  Um, my son is in the army on the east coast and then I have a thirteen year old there on the east coast.  He's living with my older son and I'm going to go back.  I'm going to be a grandma here pretty soon.  I'm going to go back --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- there for a few weeks so, that's my first grandchild.  I'm going to go back out there for a little while for a short visit and then back here.  But, ah, I miss the -- the weather.  It -- it was just beautiful out there.  I felt --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so much better there.  I walked every day with my daughter-in-law --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, the difference in health.  I just felt wonderful there and I'm feeling better though with the walking and exercise here, even though climate wise is different.  I know it was -- we had a real mild winter here and I did -- I was able to walk a lot more and -- and that helped a lot, I have to admit.  I can't remember all the others.  But, did they say alcohol and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's not a good one either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's -- it's -- I think a lot of those things it's a -- it's a case of in -- have any of a- any of it in excess -- 
R:  In excess.  Mhm.
L:  -- is -- is bad.  I can -- I can, um, pretty much I -- I feel I can drink a beer or two every once and a while and -- and not -- and not have an- any, ah, any real problem with that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I certainly have seen the dam- the -- the damage and how people can behave very badly -- 
R:  Me too.
L:  -- with -- with that influence too.
R:  Mhm, me too.
L:  So, you have to, ah, you just have to try to keep it an even keel and, I don't know, it's probably harder for some people than others pro- some people are probably more -- more chemically prone to things.  I don't -- 
R:  Mhm.  I believe so too.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I don't think -- you know, I don't think I'm, you know, necessarily more virtuous than they are or anything -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's just, ah, just how things, ah, how things end up sometimes.  You have to -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you have to know what affects you and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what -- what's dangerous for you, if you can and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, and react accordingly.  And -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, um, that's what I -- 
R:  And I certainly agree with that.
L:  -- that's what I did with the -- you know, when I found out about the -- the diabetes and -- and -- 
R:  Did you have a -- a -- a -- what were your side effects for the diabetes?  How did you -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  Na- --
L:  -- I found -- I found out I had it -- I was -- I was having -- I was -- I was thirsty sometimes at night.  But, the -- I found out that I had it quite by accident.  I'd had a, ah, another problem, a -- a urinary tract infection and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- went in for a test on that and they -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- found -- they found sugar in the sample that -- that they -- 
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- took.  And -- and then, you know, "Hey, ah, you know, we can -- we can take care of your -- your -- your infection.  But, you've got another problem here".
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lucky they found that and it didn't get out of hand and --
L:  Yeah, I know, it was -- 
R:  -- go and get any worse.
L:  -- it -- it was extremely lucky that, ah -- 
R:  Very lucky.
L:  -- that, ah -- that, ah, you know, you don't -- you know, one doesn't think of oneself as being lucky for coming down with an infection.  But -- but, the -- 
R:  No.  But, it was -- 
L:  -- world -- world works in strange ways sometimes.
R:  Mhm.  Very.  That they had found that.  It could have gotten out of hand.
L:  Oh, yeah, and it's -- but, I got it.  And, ah, I -- I decided to, you know, take everything seriously and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and make the changes and that and people -- I've gotten compliments on it and I've said, "Well, you know, I'm -- I'm happy with what I've done".  But, in a way it was, like, with a gun to my head.  You know, it's like -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, w- what were my choices and -- and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- some -- some people said, "Well, you'd be surprised.  A lot --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of people even with that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't -- don't do anything -- 
R:  Right.  I've heard --
L:  "-- about it".
R:  -- of people not doing anything about it and -- oh, man, the side effects are terrible.
L:  So -- 
R:  It gets worse and worse.
