R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Kimberly.
R:  Hi, I'm Jocelyn.
L:  That's a very interesting topic.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  Ah, definitely drinking caffeine excessively is the worst thing you could ever do.
R:  You think so?
L:  No, that's extreme sarcasm there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well -- 
R:  Well, I think -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, drinking alcohol excessively --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is the worst thing, yeah. 
L:  Yes, that can be pretty damaging -- 
R:  Yes.  Right.
L:  -- I guess, if we're close to, um -- I've met a couple of lives who've been extremely damaged by it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm trying to remember what some of the other options were.
R:  Oh.
L:  Overeating.
R:  Yeah, gossiping.
L:  Gossiping.  Hm -- 
R:  I can relate to overeating, but [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Pretty much everything can lead to overeating, can't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, not exercising.  Well, I guess -- I don't know the worst.  I mean, I think it's so individual.  It's like [several inaudible words] --  
R:  Well, the worst out of all the categories that they say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is bad was, um, drinking and smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it can damage your life pretty well.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, I -- it just -- it -- I mean, it seems -- it seems very individual to me 'cause I can think of a person who can go out and, you know, I guess light up the town one night and, you know, not have any issues with it and then somebody else who -- there is a different personality or background or whatever and -- 
R:  Yeah.  W-
L:  -- obviously will continue down a [inaudible] spiral.  But, that's the same thing with overeating or smoking or any of these horrendous of habits, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just kind of whether you keep your life in balance and -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- try not to go too far down one path maybe.  But, yeah, I guess -- I guess, um -- let's see, what can gossiping do.  Mm.
R:  Gossiping.  It could lead to misunderstandings.  Um, it's not really, you know -- I don't know, it can be compared to smoking or drinking or, you know -- 
L:  Yeah --  
R:  [inaudible] -- 
L:  -- I'd say you could pretty much ruin somebody's life [several inaudible words] I mean, depending on what kind of community you live in or what kind of gossip it is or -- I'm thinking of a case that was on the news tonight about a teacher who has been accused of, um, you know, inappropriate contact with students.  That kind of gossip could certainly do some serious damage.
R:  Yeah.  And ruin a person's, like, career and stuff like that.
L:  Definitely.  Home life, everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, mm.
R:  That's one example of how gossiping could ruin a person's life.
L:  Mm, how about -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- drinking excessive caffeine.  [LAUGH] --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- trying to turn that into something evil but I'm having a hard time, probably because that's, like, my vice.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Don't say that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] that's my life.  No, I'm more -- 
L:  It's [several inaudible words] -- [inaudible] my vice.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, right -- 
L:  I don't smoke.  I don't drink.  I -- I don't know, I suppose I gossip a little bit but nothing too extreme.
R:  But, I don't think dri- ah, drinking caffeine excessively.  I mean, coffee -- well, I don't know.  In my opinion it's not as bad as the other, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things. 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Of course, you know, twenty years down the line who knows -- who knows what the medical establishment will say.
R:  Ah, everything according to them causes cancer.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  [inaudible] and, on the other hand, everything cures cancer too.  So -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you [inaudible] gotten in your glass of red wine.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Interesting.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, [MN] so, it sounds like we're pretty much in agreement that things can -- that, like, damage your health are pretty -- pretty bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The exercising, um -- 
R:  I hate it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
R:  I hate exercising, oh my God.  I mean -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- even though -- well, hm, it could be damaging exercising excessively, you know? 
L:  Excessively?  Yeah.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- guess I was thinking that they were, ah, talking about not exercising.
R:  Not exercising?
L:  Yeah, I mean, you know, the couch potato syndrome.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That we all subscribe to at one point or another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, um, that's probably, you know, the hardest thing to not go [inaudible], if you think about changing some of these habits.
R:  Yeah, but it's so hard to do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, yeah.  I have --
L:  Oh -- 
R:  -- a membership to a gym and I don't even go to [LAUGH] it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- not funny.
R:  -- yeah.  [several inaudible words] 
L:  They -- they do a pretty good sales job I think on a lot of us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know I -- I try to do things that aren't, like -- I mean, they are exercise but they're not, you know -- 
R:  You don't know that you're doing -- 
L:  -- standing by yourself running on a treadmill or something [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I have young kids.  So, I feel like chasing after them all the time is pretty decent exercise.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  That's like a hidden exercise right [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you don't know that you're exercising but you're doing it -- 
L:  All I want is just a --
R:  -- and exactly -- 
L:  -- a portion of their energy and then I'll be able to continue.  We were playing a game of, ah -- it was sort of like freeze tag today.  I'm just like, "Holy Cow".  They run and they run and they run and they run and they don't stop.
R:  Oh.
L:  Me, I -- I -- I spend a lot of time being frozen.  So, [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Funny.  Well, have you had an personal issue or involvement with any of these vices?
R:  Well -- 
L:  Or bad habits or whatever they called it.  Personal something [several inaudible words] they called it.
R:  Well, my dad he used to be a, um, alcoholic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, he's been sober, I could say, for, like, ten or eleven years so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- far.
L:  So, was it while -- 
R:  Time flies, well, hm.
L:  -- while you were growing up with him, or -- 
R:  Yeah, growing up with him.
L:  -- after.  Yeah, that's -- 
R:  He's verbally abusive and -- I mean, ah, the whole nine yards.  He was just addicted to alcohol.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it -- I mean, that's how I know it affects a person.
L:  Definitely 
R:  You know, some people can, like you say, go out --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- on the town and, you know, drink and, you know, come back the next -- well, come back the same night, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and not have, you know -- I mean
L:  Repercussions down the line.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Have you been concerned about, you know, your own drinking or anything because of that experience, or -- 
R:  Well, sometimes I find myself being depressed and, um, I will want to, you know, drink.  I mean, I already have my problem.  I have an overeating problem, you know?
L:  Okay.
R:  I like to eat my problems away.  So -- 
L:  Mm.  And some that actually stay away, that would be my solution.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  It seems to kind of add to more problems doesn't it though?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, what's your favorite, um, bad eating habit of choice?  Mine happens to be, like, chocolate chip cookie dough.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, that's -- that's not -- that's one of them.  But, that's like on the top ten list of mine.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] Funny. 
R:  Mm, it -- 
L:  How -- how do you deal with it?
R:  Um, I don't.
L:  You don't?
R:  Like, right now I'm seeing a therapist about it.
L:  Oh, good.  Good, [several inaudible words] feel like it's being helpful or maybe just a start or -- 
R:  It's just a start.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, I certainly have done my share of therapy so -- 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I hope you find a good -- good person who's nice -- 
R:  She's very, very wonderful.  I mean, she's like trying to -- because I see a lot of negative stuff.  Like, I'm, like, so negative, negative.  She tries to bring the positive out of me.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, do they do -- I, um -- you don't have experience with, um, eating disorder -- I don't know if that's what you would categorize yourself as.  But, I've had -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've been through a lot of depression therapy and, um, we're kind of getting off the subject aren't we?  I don't know if they care or not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't think they do.  I mean, it's related though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, a- you say you're doing, like, one on one therapist also.  I mean, if you're the type of person -- I've really, um, found a lot of relief in group support, things like that -- 
R:  You see, I'm selfish.
L:  -- being able to [inaudible] -- you're selfish?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, tell me what you mean by that?
R:  Um, I'm sorry I cut you off.  But -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I -- I need a one on one, like -- 
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- therapist.  I can't be -- I was in a, um, group before --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- but I stopped going --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- 'cause I needed all the attention to be focused on me.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess I really appreciated, um, hearing that it wasn't, um, just me.  I mean, I'm sure that a lot of the feelings that you -- you have about yourself in either of our situations are probably pretty similar and it was nice to be able to hear that somebody else in the world felt -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the same way I did about things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I can -- I can totally, ah, understand about, like, the wanting to take all of the time to yourself and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having everybody to work on your problems and your issues 'cause, man, when you're in the middle of it, it's -- it's hard.
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah, I'm glad you, like, [several inaudible words] working at it.  So, it's a huge step.
R:  Yeah, it -- well, I mean, I don't know.  It's -- it's, like you said, it's hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I finally, like, dealt with the fact that I have some positive things and going off in myself.  'Cause I feel like I have nothing, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to show for myself 'cause all my friends, they're like, about to graduate from college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I didn't even finish college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel like such a loser because I didn't, you know, finish college.
L:  Do you think that's what your friends would say about you?
R:  I mean, no.  But, you know, I feel --
