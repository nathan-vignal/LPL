R:  Hello.
L:  Hello
R:  Hi.  My name's Jim.
L:  Hi.  My name is Marnie.
R:  Hi Marnie.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm all right.  This is the first call I've made, ah, or been in on, ah, through this, um --
L:  Yeah, this is my first too.  I just signed up yesterday.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, okay, well, so did I. 
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess we're supposed to be talking about reality television?
L:  Yes, we are.
R:  Ah, [LIPSMACK] and, um, I --
L:  And which we watch and why.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Ah, ah, I'm happy to do that though I guess I just wanna say something first.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, apparently, this is a test of our [LIPSMACK], ah, linguistic usage.
L:  Ahah.
R:  That's your understanding as well?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Ahah.  So, ah --
L:  I guess it's, like, the way we talk and if we do any, like, colloquialisms of the area in which we live or where we're brought up.
R:  Ahah.  And, where -- where are you calling from?
L:  Long Island, New York.
R:  You're in Long Island, ah.  I'm in Brooklyn.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I grew up in Iowa.
L:  Oh, wow.  How'd you end up in Brooklyn from Iowa?
R:  Um, ah, just came to the city, I guess, pretty much.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, after, ah, I'm fifty four and I live in Brooklyn.  I, ah, lived in Iowa until I was thirty, so ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I came to Iowa --
L:  Okay, I'm twenty four years old.  I've spent my whole life here.  [MN] 
R:  Ahah.  What --
L:  But I go to school in Manhattan.
R:  Oh, you go to school in Manhattan?
L:  Yeah, but I live in Long Island.
R:  Oh, where in Long Island
L:  In, ah, the south shore of Nassau County by Jones Beach.
R:  Oh, like Manhattan Beach or somewhere down there?
L:  No, no, no.  I go to school in New York City but I live on Long Island in Nassau County.
R:  Oh, in what city?
L:  Oh, what city do I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, on Long Island?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wantagh, like the Jones Beach area.  
R:  Oh, okay, gotcha.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, okay, so, um, you -- you wanna talk about reality television?
L:  Sure.  Which ones do you watch?
R:  Ah, actually I don't watch any reality television and --
L:  And why don't you watch it?
R:  Um, I don't watch much television.  Ah, I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, watch some news programs [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- though I guess my reality television fix from the news.
L:  That's true too.
R:  Ah, I have watched a few shows in the past.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, ah, I guess I watched Survivor once or twice --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, and, ah, I haven't watched any other more recent programs.
L:  Yeah.  I watched -- I was addicted to the first season of the Bachelor.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Totally addicted to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the girls that I wanted to win didn't win.  [MN] 
R:  Ahah.  [MN] 
L:  I wanted that girl, Shannon, to win, the brunette.  I don't know if you saw any commercials or anything for it.
R:  Ah, I don't -- I'm sure I did see commercials for it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, and I'm pretty sure I never saw any of the actual programs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I don't have any sense of who the individual, ah, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- characters were.
L:  It's pretty much like the winner is based on, you know, who puts out more and who is blonder and has bigger boobs.
R:  Ahah.
L:  That's w- --
R:  Well, that's not too surprising, I guess.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I guess those are sort of the reasons why I don't watch much television [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, after the first season I was -- when the girl I wanted to win didn't win because she had morals [MN] --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I was like, "I'm not watching this any more".
R:  [LAUGH]  Ahah.
L:  And then I watched the first season of American [MN] -- of American Idol but when Justin Guarini didn't win because I thought he was way more talented 'cause I'm --I'm a singer and I thought he was way more talented than Kelly Carson and she won because, same reasons why those blondes won.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because America thought, you know, she was prettier --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that business.  And even though j- --
R:  I have watched that show a couple of times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Though, ah --
L:  Yeah, I haven't watched the new season too much.  My mother's addicted to it though.  [MN] 
R:  Ahah, yeah.
L:  [MN]  And --
R:  Ah, is that -- would that be considered a reality TV show?
L:  Yeah, I think it's considered reality.  Like, it's going on now and America's voting who gets kicked off the island, you know?
R:  Ahah, yeah.
L:  'Cause they are going through all that stuff.  You have to deal with Simon's biting comments.
R:  Oh, American Idol is one that takes place on an island?
L:  [MN]  No, no, no.  That's like an expression, like, like, um, like, how Survivor kicks off on an island and, like, even, like, it's on a stage in Los Angeles but America votes who gets kicked off each week.
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.
L:  You know, it's just like an expression, you know, who gets kicked off.
R:  Yeah, I gotcha.
L:  And the other show that I -- I'm addicted to because my boyfriend watches, WWE wrestling.  I got addicted to WWE Tough Enough which is a reality show to see who wins and who gets the wrestling professional contract at the end.
R:  Ahah, yeah.
L:  And I watch that.  [MN] 
R:  Well, I guess, yeah, I guess, professional wrestling, ah, and reality television have something in common.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  Such as a strong emphasis on drama --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and, ah ...
L:  And I've watched, ah, Real World.  The only, um, season that I watched was when they were in Hawaii because my roommate in college was really into it so she got me into it.
R:  Is Real World one where people live together?
L:  Yeah, it was on MTV and they lived together in a house and everybody's stereotyped into whatever character.  Like, there's the bitch, there's the token, you know, African American person, and there's the token gay person, you know, that kinda stuff.
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, ah, do you remember, ah, you may be too young to remember a show called The Louds?
L:  No, I don't know that show.
R:  Mm, they -- it was a, ah, a show, this was probably more than ten years ago, and this may have been actually something like the first reality television program.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was on Public Broadcasting System.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it was a PBS show.  Ah, and it was about a family called The Louds.  L.O.U.D.S.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, which was their last name.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, ah, they had a son who I think in the end of the season, ah, came out as gay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which was, like, a big scandal and a shock.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, but, ah, this was a program that lasted, I suppose, something like a regular season, ten or twelve episodes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was just following this family around.  They, ah, ah, ah, I -- I don't know if I ever really watched the show but I'm aware of it because of its, um, kind of, the way it percolated back into the general culture.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah, ah --
L:  Isn't that kind of like the movie that they made, um, Ed TV with Matthew McConaughey, how they -- how the TV, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- picks him and they just follow him around in his life?
R:  Yeah, I did see that, ah, that, ah, movie.
L:  Yeah, I saw that too.
R:  Yeah.  Which wasn't bad, I thought.
L:  Yeah, it was kinda good. [LIPSMACK]
R:  I actually, ah, teach courses in media.
L:  Oh, where do you teach?
R:  Ah, at Hunter College.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I know where that is.
R:  Yeah, Upper East Side.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [MN] Ah --
L:  My aunt lives around there so I go visit her.  [MN] 
R:  Ahah.  Ah, so, I don't, um, I don't teach courses in television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, ah, but I do have, ah, a lot of interest in the media --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, sort of professional interest, I guess.  I also run a small book publishing company.
L:  Oh, very nice.
R:  So, ah, I do a lot of media work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How about you?
L:  What do I do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm a cantorial[?] student at Hebrew Union College.  It's in the West Village, right in the heart of the NYU area.
R:  Oh, yeah, I think I know where it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which is a very --
L:  Okay, I really don't know Brooklyn that well.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, well, this is a very Hasidic neighborhood.
L:  Oh, okay, I think I've heard about that that.  That's -- wasn't that, like, around the -- is that like that Crown Heights area where there were all those riots --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- race riots and stuff?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's not the same neighborhood.
L:  Is that, like, around there?
R:  It's not too far away and it --
L:  Ahah.
R:  There's maybe one neighborhood in -- in between --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Williamsburg and Crown Heights.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah --
L:  I'm just not familiar with Brooklyn.  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh, Brooklyn's -- ah, it's got a lot of Hasidic Jews --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're, ah -- they belong to different, ah, groups --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the group, ah, around us --
L:  Well, is it the Satmars by you or something?
R:  Satmars are the ones around us and, ah, the Crown Heights, ah, area is more Lubavitcher. 
L:  Ah, the Lubavitcher, okay.
R:  So, ah, [LIPSMACK], ah, so, it's -- it doesn't feel like Crown Heights is very close.  It feels, ah, I mean, it --
L:  Oh, it's just they're very different sects.  I lived in Jerusalem for a year and, like, we used -- we, like, learned about, like, the different sects of Hasidism.
R:  Ah, ahah.  [MN]  Um --
L:  And that should have been a reality series.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, God, 'cause it was right when, um, all the -- all the bombings started to get really bad.
R:  Ahah, that's when you were there?
L:  That's when I was there.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So it could have been its own reality series.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, well, I'm sure that's quite an experience.  Ah ...
L:  Oh, God, it was so scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why I, like, can't get --
R:  Were you in Tel Aviv or, ah ...?
L:  -- [inaudible], I was living in Jerusalem actually.
R:  In Jerusalem?  Ahah.
L:  Yeah, and, like, being woken up at, like, four o'clock in the morning a few mornings in a row hearing, like, helicopters bombing things and F- Fourteens and -- [MN] kinda scary.
R:  Yeah, well, I bet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  And then they sent us home early because this cafe, oh, you probably heard about this, Moment Cafe, right near the prime minister's house, um, was suicide bombed [MN] and if we -- we were at this conference 'cause there was a rabbinical convention visiting --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and if we weren't at the conference at the hotel right across from my apartment [MN] both of my roommates and a whole -- like, pretty much two thirds of my classmates would have been at that bar 'cause it was a really popular bar.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So, that's why they sent us home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because that's, like, places that we -- that we frequent, you know, to have somewhat of a social life we're getting bombed.
R:  Yeah, boy.
L:  Yeah, it was pretty scary.  So, that was like my own little reality show, if you can put a spin on that.  
R:  [LAUGH]  My, ah, father in law, ah, went on some, ah, ah, kind of a peace mission with a Buddhist group, ah, to Jerusalem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and, ah, might have been there at more or less that same time.  I forget exactly when that, ah, when that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- disco bombing was, but, ah --
L:  Which dis- -- the Dolphinarium or Moment Cafe?
R:  Well, the Moment Cafe thing, that's --   
L:  That was March, 'cause that's when I left.
R:  Just this past March?
L:  March of last year.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Ahah.  I've been -- they let us -- they sent us home two months before the program ended, so, [MN] I've been home for, like, a y- -- a year and a month now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ahah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well, it must have been the, ah, previous round of --
L:  And the Dolphinarium, that was, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about two weeks before I left.  That was a year ago June.
R:  But that one was actually in Tel Aviv, wasn't it?
L:  That was in Tel Aviv, right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [MN] 
L:  Which is [inaudible] because I went to Tel Aviv and we drove by where the Dolphinarium was and everything.
R:  Yeah.
