L:  Hello, this is Michael.
R:  Hi Michael, this is Angie.  I've -- 
L:  How do you do?
R:  -- never done this before.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is my second night.  I did it last night, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ah, I've -- I'll kind of get the topic going then.  They gave us the seven vices basically.
R:  Right.
L:  They want to know what we think's the worst one.  Um, I guess I'd say a lot of them are bad, but, ah -- 
R:  Well, to me-- what were they again, or -- I didn't write them down?  Ah, I've -- sm- 
L:  No, I didn't write them down either.
R:  Smoking to me is probably the worst.
L:  You think smoking's the worst?  What about over eating or -- well, over eating they've just come out with a lot of new studies that say how bad it is to be excessively obese 'cause the obese -- 
R:  Well, but, I think the w- the problem I have with smoking is that it's a combination of -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, bad for you and it's not like you have to do it to live.  I mean, e- food is actually something you do need to do to live.  But, smoking is a choice that you make, you know -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- hopefully as an adult and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and to me, even though the other ones are all, you know, serious, the -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- fact that you don't have to smoke -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Smoking -- I mean, a- foo- ah, even -- even drinking alcohol, I don't want to say you have to, but -- but the social aspects of it, or -- or whatever can make it acceptable.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, smoking -- there is no reason for smoking -- 
L:  No [inaudible].
R:  -- none whatsoever.
L:  No.  I've -- I've never smoked in my life so I don't -- I don't understand what people -- I think people start when -- when they're young because they think it's cool or whatever and then, um, they're -- they're basically addicted to it and they can't stop.
R:  Well, you know -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- I mean, and the -- and part of the reason I also have a problem with smoking too is that their industry is so, um -- they're such liars.
L:  Oh, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  You know.  So, it is -- there -- I think a- around the -- the bigger part of the -- if -- if you look at, you know, reasons why accessibility, blah, blah, blah -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think smoking, kind of, takes the cake for me on -- 
L:  Yeah, okay.  What about, um, food?  You don't have a problem with, um -- well, the problem with drinking is that, ah, if people get behind the wheel and start driving, then we have drunk drivers in which they --
R:  Well, but -- but drunk -- um, drinking doesn't kill one out of three people.
L:  Uh-huh.  No, uh-uh.
R:  It doesn't.  You know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even -- even -- you can't say there is one out of three people is an alcoholic.
L:  No, uh-uh, no.
R:  So, um, and -- and, with the exception of somebody who's driving drunk I, ah -- if -- if you're drinking at home, you're not affecting anybody else, you know?  Um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- second hand smoker is just as dangerous, if not more so, than smoking itself, so -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not only are you choosing to put yourself in jeopardy, you're putting me in jeopardy too.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Whereas alcohol, unless, you know, heaven forbid a -- a drunk driving accident or something, but --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- i- um, you know, if you're taking the bus or if somebody's driving you home, that's not affecting -- it's not going to hurt other people.
L:  Well, it affects the other people in their family like if they have children and their spouses and things -- 
R:  It does.  But, how many people are alcoholics?
L:  I don't -- 
R:  You know?
L:  -- what's the statistics?  I don't know what's -- 
R:  Of -- of people who drink alcohol at all -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I would bet it's not one out of three are alcoholics.
L:  No, probably not, not that high.  But -- 
R:  You know, it'd be kind of like getting in a huff over, ah, bumble bee stings killing people.  I mean, if -- if -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if [LAUGH] if -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's one out of a hundred people who drink alcohol, which I bet is high -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I don't know any alcoholics and I know lots of people who drink. 
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Um, if it's one out of a hundred, I'd be surprised.  So, it's not ex- you know, it's not exactly the -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a- as big of a killer as smoking.
L:  Smoking.  What, are -- what were the other, um, problems that the -- gossiping -- 
R:  Gossiping -- 
L:  -- one -- 
R:  -- gossip [several inaudible words] gossiping, ah -- yeah, I don't even see why gossiping is in that list. [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
R:  They, ah -- they must have did that one just to see if we were paying attention.
L:  Ah, yeah, just, ah -- everybody gossips I think, everybody -- 
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  -- as long as they don't -- 
R:  -- you know.  But, you're not -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- going to ask people to just not talk and -- and gossiping doesn't have to hurt anybody.  You might -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- embarrass somebody but -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  You know.
L:  Wh- what was the other ones about, um, if there was -- there was smoking, over eating, drinking -- oh, caffeine.  Over caffeine or whatever, or over use of caffeine -- 
R:  Um.
L:  But, that's hard to do, I think, unless you're -- 
R:  That's -- yeah.
L:  -- going to be drinking coffee and cokes all day long and, ah, doing it that way.  But -- 
R:  Well, and I haven't seen a study saying that ca- a caffeine will -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, that it'll -- it'll kill you, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, it'll just make you hyper and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, that's about it.  A -- a lot of people just drink it just I think to, ah -- 
R:  I think it's just it's -- 
L:  -- keep them -- 
R:  -- nice to have a nice hot beverage -- 
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, keep -- 
R:  -- really, you know?
L:  -- keep them going too, some people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, a lot of times I drink, like, Mountain Dew in the afternoon just to, um, pep me up or whatever, keep me -- make it through the rest of the day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So -- 
R:  Yeah, I drink a lot of tea, which has -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- caffeine in it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  What was the last?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I don't think there's any other ones [several inaudible words] -- there was smoking, drinking, caffeine, over eating -- 
R:  Gossiping.
L:  -- ah, gossip.
R:  Was there drug use maybe?  No.
L:  [several inaudible words] drug use.
R:  What about -- yeah, I don't remember.
L:  They, um -- 
R:  Too bad we don't have one button we can push that can --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [several inaudible words].  "Ah, can we have a refresher please?"
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know.  So, ah, I guess we wrote that smoking is the worst one of all those five choices?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that five?
L:  I think it's five.  Smoking, drinking, caffeine, over eating and gossiping.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, 'cause, ah -- 
R:  'Cause we don't remember the other ones.
L:  Yeah, we- well I don't know how people can afford to smoke nowadays anyway 'cause I've seen them, like, five dollars a pack in vending machines and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, really -- 
L:  -- and -- and they're like three dollars and something in, ah, um, in the, um, gas stations or whatever. 
R:  R- right -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- and I always think if I'm going to spend my money on something stupid, I'll save it and give myself a massage or something.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I like that, uh-huh.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  'Cause, ah, I know the people complain they don't have any money but they're out there smoking away and everything -- 
R:  Yeah.  No it -- 
L:  -- right now.
R:  -- it doesn't make any sense to me.
L:  Well, I don't think as many people smoke nowadays as they, um, did, like, ten -- ten or twelve years ago I worked in an office and people could just light up right there at the desk.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, in the early -- 
R:  Ew.
L:  -- nineteen nineties.
R:  Oh, maybe it was after -- where -- where are you?  East coast somewhere?
L:  Ah, middle Tennessee.  Tennessee.
R:  Oh, Ten -- oh, oh, oh -- 
L:  Yeah, from the south --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, I live in, um, a- ah, California so -- 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there is no -- you can't smoke in any public place which -- um, which is really nice.  I really like it.
L:  But, I heard you have, like, little bus, um, stops along -- on the, um -- in the -- like, along the street and people can smoke in there.  And the -- 
R:  Ah, I don't think so.
L:  No?  Like -- 
R:  I mean, they're outside, so you're [inaudible] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you can -- 
L:  Like, they tell me you can't smoke outside any place in California too.
R:  You can smoke outside.
L:  Oh, you can, oh.
R:  Not that many people do.  But, you can.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and -- but, you can't smoke in a restaurant.
L:  Oh, really?  We have, like, smoking and nonsmoking sections in our restaurants.
R:  I know.
L:  And then, um, you can always smoke in night clubs and bars.
R:  Oh, no, not here -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- anymore -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- thank God.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's actually really nice.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause I'm from, um, oh, north.  So, I'm used to smoke, ah, people smoking in bars.  It used to drive me nuts to go out somewhere because I'd come home and my clothes were all -- used to smell like smoke.  It's all in my hair.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  And, ah, when they -- when I moved here there's this breath of fresh air you can breath.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's nice.
L:  That -- they -- they have some rules you can't smoke in, like, outdoor baseball stadiums or football stadiums too I've -- 
R:  Oh, what here?
L:  -- [several inaudible words] Ah, what -- 
R:  Um, I wouldn't be surprised -- 
L:  Yes? 
R:  -- ah, it's really -- smoking is really frowned upon.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It would be easier to smoke pot, you know, to even smoke.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?
R:  Um --  
L:  Oh, my God.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Oh, crap, I hope our time is almost up because this is my fiancee on my other line.
L:  No, we've got like three or four minutes left.  They, ah -- they have in Tennessee that you can't smoke, like, in -- in -- in -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- places where children -- 
R:  Hold on.
L:  -- will be around.
R:  Hold on.  If I flash over will -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  [PAUSE]  You still there?
L:  Yeah, I'm still here, yeah.  They have, like, you can't smoke, like, in -- in the zoo here in Tennessee 'cause children are around there [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- [inaudible] you can't smoke at -- like, at high school football games or high schools', ah, athletic events if there's children around there.  But, those are outdo- outdoors.  So, I don't know why they don't let you smoke there -- 
R:  Yeah, I don't -- yeah, that doesn't make any sense too much 'cause it would blow away.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know.  It's up in -- it's out in the open fresh air.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't know why.  But, we -- w- we're having a big debate in our state right now, if you can [inaudible] while the people still smoke at the state capital.  But, we could -- 
R:  Ah, you -- just inside?
L:  Inside, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, I'd vote for no.
L:  [LAUGH] I would -- 
R:  Well, not to mention, if it's artifacts you would think --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's, ah -- 
L:  The smoke would damage them -- 
R:  The smoke could damage them, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, we used to -- ah, I've talked to a girl from Michigan about ten years ago and she was -- she was like, "I can't believe you guys allow smoking in your malls and everything".
R:  You do?
L:  We used -- well, we used to, like, ten years ago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We probably stopped it about five or six years ago now. 
R:  Yeah, that's pretty gross -- 
L:  But, people -- people used to smoke.  I was at one mall with this girl I knew and she took a cigarette and put it out in the plant 'cause she didn't have any -- 
R:  Ew.
L:  I know.  She didn't have any manners.  [LAUGH] So, um -- 
R:  You know --  
L:  So -- 
R:  -- you sound like you're from east coast or -- 
L:  I'm -- I'm originally from New York but I've been in Tennessee -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- for twenty --
