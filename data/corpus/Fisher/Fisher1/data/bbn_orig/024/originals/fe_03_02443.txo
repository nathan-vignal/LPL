L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, it's Arthur.
L:  Hello, Arthur.  This is Ralph.  How're you doing?
R:  How're you doing, Ralph?  [MN]
L:  Okay.
R:  Where're you calling from?
L:  I'm in Florida.  How about you?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  City?
R:  Yeah, Brooklyn.  Ahah.
L:  Oh, well, this is off the topic but I was born in the Bronx.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  As most of you Floridians, ah, have been or were born in the Bronx or Brooklyn [inaudible].
L:  Well, that's, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, so, wh- -- reality TV.  You are, um, a fan of it?
L:  [MN] Not really.
R:  No, huh?  [MN] 
L:  I --
R:  Do you --
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Um, well, ah, I -- I have enjoyed Survivor on a few seasons but I haven't watched this season at all.  Ah, but I found that, ah, it's pretty compelling when you start to get into it.
L:  Yeah, I watched some of that, especially, not -- it wasn't this -- this current season.  Maybe it was the past season.  Ah, I guess, it was because we had the sixty some odd year old school teacher from, ah, right outside Tampa --
R:  Ahah.  Mhm.
L:  -- and she was on there until almost the bitter end.  She was kind of interesting to -- to watch her, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Local -- local talent.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  It's, um, it's -- it's easy -- it's easy stuff to watch, all this reality TV programs but [MN] I think --
L:  They seem to be running out of, ah, anything that's even remotely interesting any more.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, yeah, I --I -- and -- and they seem to be dumbing down and making things trashier as it -- as it goes o- -- as it goes on its -- on -- on its cycle.
L:  Ah, I didn't -- I didn't watch it but I think, I believe it was Fox Network that has stooped to the ultimate low and had Monica Lewinsky --
R:  Right, right.  [MN] 
L:  -- as the moderator of one of their [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reality shows.  Come on!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, ah, um, the woman's picking, ah, her suitor and the suitors are all wearing masks, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's it.
R:  It's called Mr. Personality, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I think, um, something just started on ch- -- on TBS though, Manor House it's called and they ta- -- they're taking modern people and placing them in, um, servants' positions, like in a Victorian household, ah, you know, upscale Victorian household.  So, they're having, like, they're chamber maids, people becoming chamber maids and [MN] -- and, um, um, first houseboy and hall monitor boy and [MN] the--
L:  I've heard about that one.  I've seen it advertised.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but TBS had something like that a few years ago.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Is that where they, ah, attempted to get a modern family to live like a pioneer family in Montana?
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Or some, you know, some western state?
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I saw some of that too.  That was -- that was -- that was sort of interesting and this Manor House just started on Monday.  It -- it might have been just a three night show, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday might have been all of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I'm not sure.  I -- I remember something having to do with three nights but I only was home on Monday so, um, but it was -- it was very interesting.  You know, th- there's a lot of things that [MN] that, ah, you learn from -- from that type of show, you know.  I- in fact, you learn how the house- households were structured and how the [MN] -- the various, um, um, responsibilities of the various servants, ah, how they in- -- both intertwined and stayed separate as well and, you know, the things that they used to have to do like [MN], um, [MN], you know, its -- its education.  And it's, of course, that's what, you know, th- they put it on PBS for.  [LIPSMACK]  But, these reality shows they're [MN] -- they're kind of -- there's a lot of cheesiness and they're just going to get cheesier too.
L:  Well, you know, I think what it is is that in comparison to a, let's say, a regular show with regular actors in a regular studio, they're probably much cheaper to produce.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, ah, you know, and they fill up the time slot that the advertisers like, you know, th- that bring in the under fort- -- you know, the eighteen to forty nine year olds or whatever the --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the key thing is for advertisers, what they -- where they perceive the most money is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [MN], true.  [MN]  I've -- I've always -- I've always liked the, um, the non fiction TV anyway.  I mean, I remember back in the day of, um, the -- the Loud family and the -- the, ah, PBS and American family, the family they left in was Loud.
L:  I remember that vaguely.
R:  Yeah, that was, like, back in the seventies [MN] and, ah, even the Real World on MTV, you know, as of starting about ten years ago, so, even Sixty Minutes and Twenty Twenty, that -- that's my type of, ah, television, so [MN], um, yeah, no laugh tracks and stuff, just [MN] things that are possibly real, you know.  [MN]  How'd you find about -- about this phone thing?
L:  I -- I saw an ad in one of the local papers down here.
R:  Oh, really? Ahah.
L:  How about you?
R:  [MN] I, ah, I saw, ah, I guess, a -- a posting on a -- a web site [MN] and, um, someone had, ah, had -- had posted that and I guess it gave his referral number so that's why he posted it.  You know [COUGH] ...
L:  I guess we just do three calls and that's it.
R:  [MN]  Right.  Yeah, but ...
L:  So, you're my third.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, hey, um congratulations.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and did you refer other people to it as well?
L:  I did.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] We'll see if we get paid.
L:  Yeah, that's the ultimate, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reality show. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, right, right.  Well, it's pretty -- it's painless and it's, um ...
L:  Oh, I k- -- I kind of enjoy it, you know, I- I'd do it all the time if they needed someone. [MN] 
R:  Have you done -- have you done focus groups or market research things?
L:  Yeah, I have done some of that.
R:  Yeah, that can be fun.  In fact -- fact, just, um, just yesterday in Manhattan I did a pho- -- I did a mock trial once, twice in my life.  One, but this one particular [several inaudible words] mock trial it was about four years ago and, um, it had to with, ah, people who, ah, the trial, the real trial, this -- you know, it was a practice of a trial by the lawyers, and the real trial had to do with, ah, people that had left a bar in Manhattan and had a car accident and, you know, terrible, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- someone got decapitated et cetera in -- in the car accident [MN] but just last night I was -- I was at a show in Manhattan and, um, passed, in fact, the bar and I said, "Oh, that's Scruffy -- that's Scruffy Duffy's", yeah.  
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, and, in fact, it looks nice in there and we ended up going in there after for, ah, for some hot wings and some -- some beer and stuff but [MN], ah, [MN] so, yeah, and that's -- and that's -- not only is an easy way to make money but it's very interesting too.
L:  Yeah, I've done the mock trials --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, market research.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Focus groups et cetera.  I -- you have a computer at home?
L:  Yes.
R:  Have you -- have you gone to Craig's List?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Check that out.  Craig C.R.A.I.G.S. List --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and dot com and you'll -- it's like a bulletin -- it's like the bulletin board in the supermarket they used to -- everybody used to put up what they're selling, what they [MN] have wanted or selling a car and, ah, you live [MN] -- you live in a major city area?
L:  Yes, I live in Tampa.
R:  Um, I don't know whether they have a Tampa board but they surely ha- -- they surely have a Miami one.  [MN]  Um, but they have, ah, ah, check out Craig's List and then go to whatever city is closest to you and [MN] -- and -- and, ah, you might find that interesting.  That's where I found this posting, in fact, ah, for -- for this, um, ah, program [MN] and, um, [MN] yeah, it's a nice [MN] --
L:  Well, I guess -- well, I guess we should go back to the topic and just, you know, my opinion is, I guess, they're -- they're here to stay but they're on the wane.
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  You know, I think you'll see Survivor survive and, you know, maybe the Bachelor or something like that but, ah --
R:  Mm.  [MN]  There's a lot of passion to it though.  There's -- it's -- it's still -- it's still very popular and I -- I know that a lot of people are very addicted to it, um, [MN] and, ah, I -- I know, even for myself in a couple of years of Survivor [MN] towards the end of the Survivor season I've definitely started to watch it when the -- when the ranks get smaller and it be- -- you can start to focus on who's there a little more.  You can really enjoy the second half of a season.
L:  Yeah, that's true there's no, ah --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know there's no way you've really missed anything even if you tuned in on the last day. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH].  Well, you know, you do -- you do miss something, you do.  L- like Survivor, you know, there are -- there's a lot of dynamics, um, [MN] that, ah, that, ah, that you -- you would miss if you just tuned in on the last show but in the beginning they don't know each other so it's really -- it's like [MN] -- it's like the beginning of a party where everybody's just feeing[?] each other out and then [MN] someone leaves the party early and they were insignificant but after they leave, after the -- well into the season there's a significant loss but [MN] if you miss the first couple of shows where the first [MN] twenty or twenty five percent of the contestants are leaving then they -- they're pretty extraneous.
L:  I just wish I -- I knew what, ah, demonic hold they have over these contestants that they don't disclose what they know, you know [LAUGH].  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because that -- that show is over be- -- months before we watch it.
