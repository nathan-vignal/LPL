R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hey, how're you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Ah, my name's Bob.
L:  [MN] My name's Chris.
R:  Chris, how're you doing?  Whereab- -- where are you calling -- where am I calling?
L:  Ah, Florida.
R:  All right.  What part?
L:  South Florida.  B- ah, Port St Lucie.
R:  All right, all right.
L:  You in Florida?
R:  Nah, I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Up here, yeah.
L:  [COUGH]  First time you ever done one of these?
R:  No, th- this is -- this is the third and last call I can do.
L:  Third and last?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, this is my first.  So that -- it's kind of interesting.  My wife sent it to me.
R:  Oh, all right, cool.
L:  Do you watch reality shows?
R:  No, no.  Go ahead, you can talk a couple of minutes and I'll -- and I'll -- and I'll rebuttal.
L:  Okay.  [MN] Um, well Survivor --
R:  Well, first of all, what -- what do you think of 'em?
L:  Well, tonight's Survivor.  Um, they're not really -- I don't really think that they're reality shows.  They're, ah, a bunch of, ah, most of the time spoiled people that, um, [MN] are very out of touch with reality it seems, like, especially after they're on the show very long.  Ah, the Real World is one my wife watches all the time and annoys the hell out of me.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.  [LIPSMACK] But it's just a b- it seems like it's a bunch of people trying to be friends and buddies and -- and be fake and, ah, I really don't think there's anything real about it.
R:  Well, I think, y- -- ah, th- they know they're gonna be on TV.  There's producers, directors, so they know, you know, I -- I -- I -- I -- apparently think that they know exactly wh- what they got -- it's like a script almost.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's not like there's hidden cameras.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  Well --
R:  You know, if -- if that, you know, something like that would be.
L:  I -- I think it's, um, just like --
R:  I've never really watched them to tell you the truth.  I try to stay away from 'em 'cause they don't pique my interest at all for TV.  TV's something, you know, you want something like [MN] written stories, you know, like NYPD or even comedy, you know.
L:  Oh, I like the comedy better than the drama shows, you know.  I don't really hoe[?] much into those either.  The, um, thing about reality shows that I think, ah, interest people is everybody I ever talk to and -- and, ah, see out they always talk about, oh I could win that game or I could do better than they could.
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- I think, ah, what we see, [MN] the finished product is on most of these shows a week worth of filming in an hour.  Um, we don't see a whole lot of really what's going on.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that's kinda -- kinda sad too.
R:  Right.  There's [inaudible] I think if there was more bickering behind the scenes and more fighting and more, you know, controversy people would watch it more.
L:  Ah, I'd be interested to see -- I'd -- I'd be interested to talk to somebody, actually talk to somebody that's been on one --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because I think it's funny, um, they find a -- a flaw or a problem with somebody and they really exploit it.  Every time they do that [MN] they show it over and over again.  They show it in the commercials and -- and I think a lot of times [MN] some of these people that they call jerks on the reality shows are probably pretty nice people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they found the flaw or the problem and I wouldn't want to be on one and -- and have them point out the problems I have, you know, week after week after week.  
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I think they really blow that up and make it, ah, into a bigger issue.
R:  Right and, I guess, you know, they're trying -- I mean, it first started out with one.  What was the first one?  Sur- --
L:  Well, I thought, I -- I'm sure there was something before Survivor but I think it was the first big one.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [MN] I don't know what the first one --
R:  Now they got Millionaire, How to Marry a Millionaire, Bachelorette.
L:  See, those are the ones that annoy me.  I -- I can't even stand to watch those.  Now, Survivor I still watch, um, sometimes, but the -- the Joe Millionaire --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the, um, How to -- Want to Marry a Millionaire --
R:  There was a q- -- there was a question on my Internet and it had, you know, there's a daily question.  It had, ah, if there was a reality channel, like a TV show, TV channel just for reality shows would you ever tune in.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I put no, myself.  And then I could see the results.  [MN]  And believe it or not about three to one were -- were not -- w- wouldn't watch this.
L:  Really?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Ah, I wonder who's -- I mean, they're getting good ratings, ah, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somebody's got to be watching.  My wife --
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  -- goes to a website called, ah, Television without Pity.
R:  Okay.
L:  It has a bunch of reality show stuff on there and --
R:  Reight.
L:  --and, ah, it's fairly interesting now --
R:  Now, now, on, like -- like on a -- on a cable show?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, G String Divas, or something if you got some stuff, you c- -- well -- 
L:  Taxi Cab Confessions.
R:  The -- well, that's like the kind of reality I would watch.
L:  [COUGH]  Well, I've -- we've watched something, um, this week, we've been watching a -- a show called the Manor House on PBS.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which is very interesting and it took people into the Edwardian times and, um, they had to live as servants and then that other family lived as the, ah, ah ma- the owners of the house and those are very interesting to me because it seems like, um, [MN] they're not playing a game.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think the games -- the -- the whole game show idea of this television series, ah, reality series things, really are -- are what's annoying to me more so than -- than the show itself.
R:  Is The Fear Factor like a reality show?
L:  Beats me.  I never saw it.
R:  Oh, you never saw it?
L:  Don't care anything about it.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I saw the commercials on TV and this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this whole thing about them eating worms and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- bugs, I don't understand how -- i- it's not really fearful, it's gross.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It seems like that that's what they're trying to get into more is -- is gross on there, to me.
R:  Right.  Well, it's all for money.
L:  It's all for money, that's right.
R:  Like, even -- ev- even the reality shows.
L:  Now, one that I watched, ah, last week on -- I think it was on FX was, um, oh, [MN] it wasn't -- it was -- it was about scaring people basically that -- that hide cameras --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, they would tell somebody, you know, they got hidden cameras in the truck and they put a train on the train track --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and act like a train's coming at it and they can't get out and just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- scare people.  Now, that's interesting for me to watch.  I'd probably be pissed off if somebody did that to me --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, ah, it -- it was very interesting to watch.
R:  Right, right.  Bec- -- ah, the -- the reality shows w- -- I think it would be better if they didn't know that they were going to win money until the very end of some- -- when somebody did like last.
L:  Well, that's kind of how they Joe Millionaire though.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, ah, did you watch any of it?
R:  Nah, no, I just read it -- I just read some articles in the paper about how they were all duped.  He wasn't even a millionaire or something like that.
L:  Right, he wasn't a millionaire and, you know, supposedly at the end of the show he didn't know but they give him a million dollars, at the end of the show they give him a million dollars.  He's supposed to be a construction worker.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, well, it was interesting to watch 'cause I'm -- I'm originally from Arkansas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and grew up around farming and all and he's supposed to be, ah, this construction guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when he first got on the show he walked in with his -- his working clothes supposedly and [MN] he was talking about his shirt being ripped up and he said he got it caught in a combine.  [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, you know, I grew up around a farm.  You get a -- a shirt caught in a combine you're going to be all minced up.
R:  You're going in with it.
L:  But, you know, it's just a bunch of -- a bunch of bull.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, I think that's what the producers of the show, they try to make these people, you know, who they're not.
R:  Now, aint Monica Lewinsky supposed to have one now?
L:  Um, it was on last week, I believe, but I don't --
R:  Is that a reality show too?
L:  Yeah.  I don't remember what it was.
R:  Now, somebody like her, I can't even comprehend how she's in front of a camera.  All she did was get down on her knees.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And become fa- -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  And become fa- -- it takes something like that act which, I mean, don't get me wrong, but -- but for them to publicize her in the media as being nothing more than what she actually is [LIPSMACK] and giving her a TV show and making her popular, it doesn't make goo- good role models for girls.
L:  No, it doesn't and -- and that's part of what's wrong with society now, you know.  [MN] C- --
R:  Right, I mean, all they -- always telling girls that, well, if you do that then you can get your TV show.  
L:  Right.
R:  Just do it to the right person.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know.
L:  It's, ah, it is rather interesting, I guess.  I [MN] --
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, like, one or two of those shows wouldn't have been too bad.  But I think they're definitely bombarding the airwaves with them.
L:  I know.  Well, I guess it's what sells, so ...
R:  Oh, of course.  They wouldn't be doing it if they didn't get the ratings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But why do you think people watch 'em?
L:  [MN] You got me, 'cause I don't, so it's, you know, that's hard to say.
R:  But if you did, I mean, if you did have to think --
L:  My wife watches, um, ah, Real World --
R:  Right.
L:  -- constantly, because of the bickering and the fighting and -- and all their little problems that they always have.
R:  Well, is that people who live in the same house or something?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's on MTV and it's a bunch of eighteen to twenty one year olds.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It had -- it had to be one of the first ones because I think I -- I -- I, you know, saw that, like, years ago, right?
L:  Actually, it probably was one of the first ones and I remember watching the first, ah, two or three years because it was interesting because they give them all challenges to do --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, they had their little conflicts in the house and stuff like that [MN] but now it's w- -- the same people that were on the first show, now they have Real World verse Road Rules --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they have th- the same people and these damn people don't even have jobs.  They don't know what life's really about.  
R:  Right.
L:  They go out and play a game for -- they've been playing a game for five years.
R:  Sure.
L:  And, ah, that's irritating to me.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I don't think enough young people understand what it's like to have to work any more.
R:  No, I don't think they do.  [MN] Now, these -- now, these people who are on these shows are like so called s- -- ah, co -- contestants or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they end up making some bucks in the media afterwards, right?  Even the people who don't last through the [inaudible] -- like the, um, [LIPSMACK] Survivor.
L:  Yeah, well, I was, um, listening to, on the radio there talking the other day about, um, a college up in Missouri paid, ah, the guy that was on Joe Millionaire fifteen thousand dollars to do a one hour speech.
R:  You gotta be kidding me.
L:  Yeah.  You know, ah, ah, that's --
R:  Talk about what?  His -- how -- how he -- how he bullshit?  Do you remember, you know, how he BSed everybody?
L:  I guess that that's it.  I don't know if, ah, I don't know, you know, I don't know.  That's the problem.  A lot of the students were mad because they -- they spent, you know, I assume, government money --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- to get him there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they said, you know, I -- I'd rather talk to a rock.
R:  Well, you figure the guy's, you know, living his fifteen minutes of fame.  It's probably gonna last longer for that.
L:  Right, and I guess that's what they're all -- all kind of --
R:  Even the second place.  Ah, I read in the paper the second place girl that he didn't choose --
L:  Yeah, she's going on Playboy, isn't she?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, even she's making her bucks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  But we're all paying.
R:  Right.  Now, reality sports -- reality shows about sports I wouldn't mind watching.
L:  Well, they doing --
R:  Something that interests -- something that interests me.  Reality shows about a band --
L:  Like, I like the Behind the Music on in VH One but it's not really a reality show.  I think it's more of a --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, just, I d- -- I don't really know [inaudible] what you would call that.  
R:  That's like a documentary.
L:  Yeah, a documentary.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, they're doing a reality show I saw the other day on NASCAR.
R:  Okay.
L:  They're going to start a reality show.  They're gonna follow one of the drivers around and, um --
R:  Well, look, that's interesting.  I mean, like, they -- they would probably get an audience, you know.  
L:  Yeah, they'll have their audience, [MN] ah, but I just don't know how they can make that interesting enough for somebody to watch all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  And, but, you know, I don't see how they make the rest that's interesting for people to watch.  They do anyway.
