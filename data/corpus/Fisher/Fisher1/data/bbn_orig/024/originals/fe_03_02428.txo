R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi [MN].
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm doing pretty good.  And you?
R:  Good.  I'm, ah, Dee.  And what's your name?
L:  My name is Wanda.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, [MN] so, what do you think is wor- I didn't hear all the choices.
L:  I didn't quite understand the choices.
R:  O- gossiping -- which is worse?  Gossiping [LAUGH], not exercising or wh- which ones did you hear?
L:  Something -- I think it was about a personal hygiene.  Drinking or something.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know.  But -- 
L:  This is weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I didn't quite get it either.  But [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anyway, so which one do you think is worse of the ones that you heard?  The choices that you heard?
L:  Um.  I think gossip is the worst.  If that's what you're asking me -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what -- and I -- and that's -- and I agree.  Because when you're gossiping you're -- you're hurting other people.
L:  Yes, you are.  And if someone entrusting something in you, I mean, you should not disclose that information.  That's how I feel about it.
R:  Right.  Ah -- so, do you have any -- any habits that you, um, that you have a hard time trying to break that you -- maybe you'd like to break, or if you'd like just to -- 
L:  Smoking.
R:  [LAUGH] That wasn't hard was it?
L:  No.  [LAUGH] Smoking.
R:  And I do too.  Mine is eating.  [LAUGH]
L:  Eating?  Oh, Lord.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I like to eat and sometimes, because I like -- I'm just a food person, I like food.  So, ah, as -- as quite a few Americans do.  I mean, it seems like everything we do in America calls for eating.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, at work somebody's always bring- bringing dishes --
L:  Something good to eat -- 
R:  -- from home.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, and I think that's why we're so fat as a nation, you know?
L:  Yeah, true.  Because at my home I feed everybody -- neighbors, kids. 
R:  Really?
L:  'Cause I love to cook.  I love to bake.
R:  Mm.  Do you take baked goods to work and that kind of thing too?
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah.  See, everybo- and -- and it -- people do that a lot.  I mean, everything we do, you know, when we haven't seen an old friend a long time we say -- we, you know, we see him we tend to say, "Well, let's do lunch" [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Well, that's m- -- 
R:  -- [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- that's my motto, "Let's do lunch" or, "Let's do something.  Let's have a picnic or" -- 
R:  Yeah, let's go -- or let's go out for dinner?
L:  Sure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and it -- I mean, that's just kind of -- I don't know if they do that in other cultures as much.
L:  No, they don't.  Because I travel a lot -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I have not seen that much of anywhere.  I mean, it's just -- ah, like, I travel Tennessee.  Not very friendly people.  I have been as far as New York.  Not very friendly people.
R:  What part of Tennessee were you in?
L:  Chattanooga, Birmingham.  Ah, I've been through Nashville, Memphis.
R:  Mm.
L:  I've been all over the world.  I used to be a truck driver.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I know [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] Every day was about eating.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And people just kind of look at, you know, and I'm -- you make friends along the way and you say, "Let's do lunch or something if we meet up" and they kind of look at you, you know? 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Why would I want to do lunch with you?"
R:  Mm.
L:  But, it's just the way people are nowadays.  I mean, if you're looking at the [inaudible] -- I mean, even kids nowadays.  That's all they do.  They eat to escape the problems, you know, they have.
R:  That's true.
L:  And it's just outrageous a lot of these young, pretty, ah, teenagers are s- just overweight because of the depression.  I guess, it's better to have them eat than opt out and shoot +themselves or commit suicide. 
R:  Right.  Right I -- and I agree with that.  But, it's better to find some other more constructive way to -- to vent your -- your feelings or emotions than --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- than eating or -- ah, overindulging in anything can be unhealthy.
L:  You know, join a YMCA, you know or start a little summer group or something, you know?  [MN] Or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- start a -- a night thing, you know, after school.  Meet and talk about your problems or find something creative to do.  Give your time to the homeless people or something, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I think those are all good ideas.  [several inaudible words] compared to just sitting around eating and getting bigger and bigger.  Because when people -- well, normally when people overeat and you start gaining weight, then y- you don't feel as good about yourself.  You're down on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yourself even more.
L:  Self-esteem goes down.
R:  Yeah, and you -- you -- and -- and you -- you ate in the first place to make yourself feel better, just temporarily.  I guess it's just like drinking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The more you drink, the better you feel up to a certain point.
L:  Right.  You -- 
R:  And then, of course, as long as you're high.  Then --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- when the high wears off -- 
L:  And then you face the consequences of -- of your actions.
R:  Right.  And then it's even worse.  Because not only have you, um, gotten drunk and -- and -- I mean, not only are your problems back but you've got more problems 'cause if you get in the car and drink while you're drunk then you're probably going to end up in jail.
L:  Killing somebody or -- 
R:  Or killing somebody or something.
L:  -- you killing yourself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, drinking is a very bad thing because, I mean, a lot of teenagers turn to drinking and stuff and a lot of people opt out to drinking because that's their escape.  You know, and I -- I really -- drug- I mean, drugs and alcohol should be +banned.
R:  Well, when you were driving a truck did you ever take drugs to keep you awake -- 
L:  Stay awake?  No.  Coffee.  Caffeine.
R:  Okay.
L:  Coffee i- is my -- my wake up.  My get up and go.
R:  Got to have it.
L:  Yes.  But, I have seen a lot of truck drivers drink, drive, do drugs, and that was just not something that I -- I was really -- wanting to get to know the other truckers because when they started that [inaudible] you know, "Hey, here's some pills.  It'll keep you up tonight" or, "Here's -- here's a little bit of vodka.  Something to keep you warm and y- 'cause you're hitting the snow".  No.  You know, because we're out of here with big rigs and some of these people in these motor cars don't know how to handle the snow and stuff.  We might end up running over 'em, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I didn't really even appreciate someone asking me to take any type of drugs or alcohol.  You know, and that was just -- ah, that's my motto.  Don't drink, don't do drugs.  I mean -- 
R:  Well, that's -- that's good.  How long were you a truck driver?
L:  For eighteen years.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's a long time.
L:  Then I was a nurse.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then I got into real estate.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You went from being a truck driver to being a nurse?
L:  Yeah, I had little bitty kids and they were in school.  So, it was time to quit.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  Kids start school, you've got to quit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wait.  So, you -- so, you weren't -- you didn't have kids when you were a truck driver?
L:  I had some babies, ah, at there at the end.  I had some little bitty babies.  I had five kids, raising 'em, doing -- being a truck driver.
R:  Well, the money was good wasn't it?
L:  Yes, it was.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As a matter of fact, I was out there I was a single mom and I ended up with, ah, two trucks of my own working 'em.
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's another issue.  A lot of these single moms, they said they need to go in bars and drink and stuff and pick up a man in a bar to help raise their kids and stuff, you know?  That is not the case.  Anybody, any single woman can make something of themself in this world.  You've just got to get up and do it and just don't think that you have to depend on someone to -- to get you by.
R:  Well, you're story is certainly an in- an inspiring one for -- for single mothers.
L:  Oh, yeah, because I'm -- I've done it.  I've got myself where I am today.  I'm in to real estate.  I have rental property.  I'm doing this, shopping.  I mean, I -- I love it.  I've got to have my hands in everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When you say you're doing this you mean you -- you do this, ah, studies and surveys and -- 
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, I love it.
R:  So, what -- what are you -- tell me, oh, which ones, ah, mystery shopping companies and survey -- online survey companies and all that -- which ones are the best do you think?
L:  I really like, um, [MN] ah, oh Lord, you caught me off guard.  [LAUGH] I have so many are my favorites.  Ah, Quest for Best is my best one.  Shake[?] Mark[?]
R:  It's c- -- It's called, what now.  Quest for what?
L:  Quest for Best.
R:  Quest for Best.
L:  Mhm.  Shake -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- Mark.
R:  -- is that quest for best dot com?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Okay.  Which one is that?  Mystery shopping or -- 
L:  Yeah, they do a lot of restaurants and stuff.  A lot of your steak houses and stuff.
R:  Okay.
L:  Today we're going back to the same question, eating.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Do they pay well?
L:  Yes they do, and they pay on time.
R:  Quest for Best -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- Q.U.E.S.T. for Best?
L:  Yes.  And -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- another one is Infotel.
R:  I.N.F.O.T.E.L.?
L:  No, I.N.F.O. dot com.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Infotel -- 
R:  -- Info- -- 
L:  -- let me see -- make sure so I don't tell you wrong.
R:  -- dot com. 
L:  'Cause I have so many [MN] um, I might have forgot to pull out my list.  I'm not going to tell you who's my favorites.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've been trying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to find some online survey companies that really pay well.
L:  Have you joined, um, it's called, um, I mean, ah, [inaudible] hang on, one minute.  Yeah.  Go to Violation dot com.
