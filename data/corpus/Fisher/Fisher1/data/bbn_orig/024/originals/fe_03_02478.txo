R:  Hi, this is Phoebe.
L:  Hi, this is Hazel.
R:  Hey, how are ya?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My first phone call.
R:  Oh, this is my second one.  Okay, reality television, huh?  Well, do you watch any?
L:  Uh, the only one I watch is Survivor.
R:  Okay.  I -- I don't really get a -- a chance to see that often.  I saw the first one and not all the way through, but I read up on it every -- you know, every week they have something in the papers regarding it, so that's how I keep up with it.  But I watch, uh, Anna Nicole Smith and I watch the Osbournes.  I watch that kind of stuff.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- because I -- I -- I'm a cable fanatic, I don't really watch, uh, regular television.
L:  Okay, great.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Yeah, I kinda wondered on that Anna Nicole and if it was any good. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, let's put it this way, i- it's unbelievable.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, let's put it that way.  I don't know if it's good, you wouldn't say it was good, but it's unbelievable that someone could be like that every day.
L:  Okay --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- well, I know with Survivor, here at our house, when you wake up Thursday morning, it's Survivor day and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and we set our schedule by it, and I never thought I'd be a person to watch that.
R:  Wow.
L:  So --
R:  What's it like?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I -- I guess the reason I like to watch it is because you get to see the sneaky underhanded way people work together and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- i- -- I mean, you get to see everything pretty much that's happening while, you know, the -- the members there don't really get in on what the other people are thinking and -- and plotting and [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] It's just kinda like, um, being a fly on the wall, I guess, to all of this.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what, ah -- o- on the -- those that have actually won the money, the winners, what did you think of that person, do you think they were entitled to the money, or should it have gone to someone else?
L:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] I -- you know, I've only watched a couple of series all the way through, but I don't think the person who really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- deserves it ever wins. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  I -- I know the first one, that older guy, Rudi?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought he should have won.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.  I thought he should have won.  I thought that he, um, handled himself very -- [MN] I don't know.  I just thought he was just a gentleman throughout, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I guess, as y- you said, you can't be that way, you have to be cut throat. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's true, yeah, the nice people don't win.  It's the people who are more devious and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are into the Survivor game, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, the -- it's -- i- -- I always wonder at what cost, you know?  I mean, they win all this money, but then everybody who knows them or --
R:  Now knows what they're like.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They're deceitful people, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] So, you lose all your friends. [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you think on why they're so popular?
R:  Well, I think p- people need something different, I think that, uh, you know, i- it's an environment now that, um, I know that, uh, post nine eleven, it's been really tough for people, um, and I -- I happen to live in New York and worked in the Royal Trade, i- it was very difficult.  I think now you just want to see the world as it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no rose colored glasses, you just want to see it, you know, whatever's there is there, and you know, you try to, as you say, survive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How do you survive when you, you know, have been through something that's so traumatic, so it --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think part of it too is it's not movie stars, it's people.  Just --
R:  Yeah, but what about the one with the movie stars?  Did you see the one -- there's really a show now that has, uh, like +Melis- -- Melissa Rivers in it and some models and whatever.  Same thing, they're like -- it's -- it's the +Survivor -vivor but with actors and actresses.
L:  Mm.  No, I haven't --
R:  And they are really cut throat.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy, I bet.
R:  Oh, it was something else.  I mean, it was really -- and you know who ended up winning?  Uh, Jennifer Lopez's second husband.
L: Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  And he was really nice.  Actually, the whole show, he was really nice, and I thought, well, that's nice that he won, and yeah, that's the first time I've ever seen somebody in a -- but Melissa Rivers was really exceptional.  She was an exceptional survivor.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, her mother taught her well.  She hung in there no matter what, and I love the fact that I saw the stars without any make up on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Made me feel good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] All those beautiful women, I was, like, "Okay, now we really see", so that was pretty good.  I don't know, um, what about yourself, what do you think, why people watch?
L:  I -- I think, um, that, probably, you know, not [MN] -- it's not stars, you know, um, otherwise a- -- maybe 'cause it's not plotted out necessarily --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I have no idea why.  I mean, I can't even say for sure why I watch it.
R:  Right.  But you get hooked, don't you?
L:  Yeah, something's appealing about it, but --
R:  Exactly.  It is, it's just -- it's a -- very appealing, I don't know.  And once, to me, you really start to g- -- you -- you look forward to next week, you're, like, "Okay", you know?  It's almost like a book, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you get to that book and it's really interesting, you're like, "I can't wait to the end" and then when you get the end, you're like, "Ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   "-- I don't know.  Maybe -- I'm hoping the author writes another one", you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of the follow up, and then you buy it, and you know, [MN] that's just how we are, we want to keep going, especially if it's a -- i- if it's a good theme or a good thought, you wanna see, and you know, I think we like survivors, we like those people that are able to hang through it all, you know?
L:  True, a- and you pick someone that you want to win and -- and you follow 'em and --
R:  Right, you're rooting for them, like -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- "Come on, you can do this".
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What happens when the person that you were rooting for, though, doesn't make it?  Do you stop watching, or do you continue to watch?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, this just happened, like the week before last, my favorite person got voted off and I wanted her to win, but I knew she wouldn't just because I -- you know, I felt like she was a strong leader and stuff and I just knew that eventually they'd take her out, and she did, and I thought, "Well, I don't wanna to watch any more".  Well, the next show, there's a big turnaround and all of sudden it's interesting again, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  So, I'm right --
R:  So, then you pick a new hero what -- it -- i- it appears that -- that the watchers were flexible.  "Okay, well, the one we wanted to go didn't, we're not going to keep watching.  Let's see who is going to win", so we choose a new favorite.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I tell you, our allegiances, you know, we hang right in there, don't we.  We're, like, "Okay, you didn't make it, okay, now I'll pick Ted over here". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, there's someone's gotta win. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, someone's gotta win, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I tape -- would you, if you -- would you ever think about being on one of shows?
L:  Absolutely not. [LAUGH]
R:  No?  I wouldn't either.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, i- -- I -- I -- I'll have to work for the rest of my life to make that kind of money, you know, and another life after that, but I -- I just couldn't do it.  Just couldn't do it.
L:  No, I just -- I have no interest.  I think my fiancee would be terrific at it, um, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, mine too, actually, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  But he's too p- -- he's too, uh, private, he would never allow, you know, his -- to be exposed like that, just never ever.
L:  Oh, y- yeah, my -- my fiancee, he is definitely, um, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he would be a survivor.  I -- I don't know if he can be devious enough --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but otherwise, I mean, I think he could do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, that's good.
L:  I would feel sorry for everyone. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Oh, boy.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  Okay.  I -- I'd vote for him, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's excellent.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I tell you, I wonder how they select -- I've never seen, um, anything, like, on a website, [NOISE] when they start to select those -- those people that -- you ever seen, like, an application or something?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't even know how those people are selected.
L:  I have -- I have seen a few things here and there passed around the net, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know what they go through, but I know they have to b- -- uh, send in, like, tapes of themselves and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- all kinds of stuff like that, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Almost like a -- [LIPSMACK] what's the -- the Real World.  I know --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- how the Real World in, uh, R- Road Rules, their reality shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as well on cable, same thing.
L:  I used to watch, I think it was the Real World.
R:  Oh, y- -- I love that show.
L:  Was that through MTV?
R:  Yeah, that's one of my favorite shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, I mean, those people, I mean, living together in a household for four to six months is not easy, you know?
L:  Yeah, and most of 'em are pretty young, yeah.
R:  Yeah, they're like under -- you're supposed to be under twenty five.
L:  Yeah, so they kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes their interpersonal skills are [LAUGH] lacking.
R:  Exactly.  And they all come from different backgrounds and that, you know, that's interesting to see how you all work together, you know?  And so, wow, but that -- I like that.
L:  I believe that's like -- th- that might have been the first reality --
R:  It was.  That -- exactly --
L:  -- TV s- --
R:  -- the Real World was the first, then Road Rules --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- came along, was, like, a spin off of that.  It's almost for those people who didn't quite make the first cut of -- of, uh, Real World.  They then got a chance to go onto, um, Road Rules.
L:  Uh, y- -- I saw Road Rules a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- few times too, but I didn't -- I don't think I quite liked it, n- -- you know, as much.
R:  Well, you gotta be really athletic to be on that show, and if you're not athletic, um, y- you -- you won't --  you won't make it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] We -- we tried to start watching, uh, something called Amazing Race.  I don't know, I think it's called Amazing Race.  Isn't that out of, like, Canada or someplace, or --
R:  I don't think I've seen that.  Is that on, uh, cable or is that on regular television?
L:  Uh, regular television.
R:  Oh, I've not seen that.  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, it's a -- i- it was pairs of people and it was a survivor kind of game but it was more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like a big, um, almost like a big scavenger hunt.
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  And -- and each time, you know, whoever was slowest, they're the ones who got dropped. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Well --
L:  So --
R:  -- you know, y- you -- that's what -- the weakest link, you know?  Goes bye bye.
L:  Yeah, it w- -- it -- it was, yeah, it wasn't about picking who you thought was your --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- your favorites or anything.  I mean, whoever was slowest was done, they're out.
R:  That's pretty much how, um, Road Rules is too, nowadays, you know, if you're slow, you -- you're dropped, you know.  Wow, couldn't do it.  Just couldn't do it.  I think it's gonna run its course though.  I believe that people are gonna go back into their fantasy worlds, and they're gonna want to start seeing something different, so I think that, you know, give these reality shows another two years and people won't watch them again.
L:  True.  Like the more ridiculous they get to, um, I -- I think the more -- [LAUGH] more people that will just finally say, you know, "I've had enough". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  "I have had enough of this, let's -- let's do something else", you know?
