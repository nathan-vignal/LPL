L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Reality TV shows, I don't watch any.  I've watched pieces of -- of, um, what did I watch.  I watched pieces of bachelorette. 
L:  You do -- how do you like it?
R:  Ah, it's alright I -- I thought -- I felt bad for the guy of course in the end who ends up being dumped cause he's so close and he ends up dumped but, um, [SIGH] I don't think I would do it.  I don't think I would pick somebody you know -- like I don't think that I would go into a pool of people and -- and then date them for that short period of time and end up in a marriage situation. 
L:  Right, now --
R:  What to you think? 
L:  Let me ask you a question are you -- are you a survey -- are you what's the story?  Are you just -- so are we just connected just by -- 
R:  Somehow they connected us. 
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Because we both chose six PM I guess to talk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So they let us talk and um, tell us when your ten minutes is up. 
L:  I see -- so, um, all of those shows for instance my wife watches these shows and she really loves this thing she thinks it is just neat to see who the heck is gonna get to the level that's going to win, and when on top of it when, uh, like I don't really keep in touch with those things because it's not me, you know what I mean, I'd rather watch a movie or something but -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I see her rooting -- rooting for a certain individual or a certain party -- she's not like I can see where like you know these shows do capture the regular you know people at home -- you know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Like me I like -- like I said I like more interesting things like, um, uh, to -- to me I feel like a good comedy or like a -- a good like, um, mystery or just science fiction stuff like that I like -- okay you know but as far as like, you know like it bachelorette and survivor and all of that other good stuff, you know it I just think it's just a bunch of crazy things like reality TV is even another crazy show -- I mean as far as saying crazy is, is that you know these people out there really are coming up with some unique ideas -- you know. 
R:  Right that's one of the questions they asked was why do you think they -- they are popular, and I think  
L:  I mean would you go on a show and eat bugs and jump off the side of buildings or have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- them pull flags from a building, I mean it's at little scary and my wife said she would go on survivor -- yeah right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- let me tell you something is not so easy and she sits there and you know they -- they say it looks easy when you watch other people do it -- it's really not that easy [inaudible] -- 
R:  No. 
L:  Where are you calling from? 
R:  um, Florida. 
L:  From Florida, I'm from Jersey. 
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Well one of the -- one of the shows that I see -- that I saw a piece of cause I really have to go my son was playing a baseball game and I -- was running a little late and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the thing was on, um, was, oh, gosh it was Fear Factor. 
L:  Fear Factor. 
R:  That was wicked because they, you know like I guess they -- they just capitalize on your fears and if you're scared of spiders -- what's going to be on there, so it was kind of weird and this one -- the poor people who were on it were, um, they -- they were trying to shoot hoops and then unfortunately they both stunk at it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so if you miss a hoop you have to drink this milkshake, except there's no milk in it and there is nothing that you would like -- they're hundreds worms and bugs and roaches and -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- all of this nastiness and these people just swallowing the stuff just straight and I was nauseous looking at the show --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't see how people put up with watching it. 
L:  Believe it or not it's just like being in that movie with Tom Hanks with, uh, Cast Away, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is just the same principle, you know like what are you going to do to survive?  And that's basically what they try to do, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, what's your name? 
R:  Maria. 
L:  Maria, hi I'm Jerry. 
R:  Hi Jerry. 
L:  Hi [inaudible] now you're -- you're husband doesn't mind you calling and talking with people? 
R:  I don't know this the very first time I've called, and I don't have a husband so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll ask him when I marry one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That was a good answer Maria, and [inaudible] and it was nothing personal you say that you are getting ready to get your boy to play baseball? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, right -- great -- great --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well I guess we'll probably never be talking again to each other. 
R:  I know I don't know how they -- how they connected us but, um, it's an interesting topic and I don't know if the ten minutes are up or if we're supposed to keep talking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Cause I don't want you feel like you're being paid for a survey.  Do you have my home phone number? 
R:  I don't think so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My computer just kind of --
L:  Popped up --
R:  -- popped up. 
L:  Okay no --
R:  So --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  How did -- how did you end up in the loop? 
L:  I -- I don't know.  I don't know to be honest with you I was just playing around through the, uh, crazy sites you know and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what happens is that when you pop -- when they -- when you go into the crazy sites you just keep popping up left and right but maybe this might of been one of the other sites that I'm playing with, you know it's something that, um, does -- the wife you know she -- not that she, uh, goes into the sites that I do it's just, uh, that I just was playing around and the next thing I know I get an a phone call and it's you, and so --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I was, um, driving home and all of the sudden my cell phone rings so I pulled off on the side of the road and wondering what this is about and, um, --
L:  You're on the side of the road right now? 
R:  Well I -- I'm in a parking lot in a shopping centre because I just came from somewhere and -- and my cell phone rang and I said, "Okay I can do this, I'll pull over and chat with Jerry from New Jersey".
L:  Isn't that that funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Jesus well if you have a pen maybe you should take my number.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Next thing you know we'll have a pen pal situation going.  Um, I got a pen.
L:  You do? 
R:  Sure. 
L:  It's six, oh, nine. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Three four three.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Zero zero two four.  You can reach me everyday but Wednesday and Thursday that's a work number.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Is that okay? 
R:  [NOISE] That's fine.
L:  Alright Maria.
R:  Um, and -- so I don't know -- again to the thing I don't know why th- -- why those [inaudible] shows -- oh, you know what I think -- why I think those um, shows last is because people are bored with their life and -- and I think that you know as much as you enjoy a good comedy I love a good comedy but --
L:  I don't know Maria.
R:  But a lot of -- a lot of the comedy and a lot of the drama movies and a lot of that the script has been done over and over and over so many times. 
L:  You know you hit the nail on the head, it's got to be a thing where people are bored. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know what it is but it goes to show the boredom is that strong that people have nothing else better to do than to, uh, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put out this kind of money for these big kind of game shows.  Hey [inaudible] I'm playing with a proposal in the city of Atlantic City, uh, and I'm trying to get like you know the three major theme parks with ten thousand rooms -- it's in the billions and I'm playing two years with this, and my wife called me a dreamer, so what I did I called myself Jerry's dreams --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that's why I call it Jerry's world nineteen at hot mail, that's my e-mail.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So like what I'm doing is I'm still playing with this, but now when I get on a computer and I try to e-mail Billy Gates Microsoft --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Roger -- Roger [inaudible] production -- I don't know if you're familiar with these names --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they're very wealthy people.
R:  Right.
L:  And what I am trying to do is if you've been down to Atlantic City, we have what they call a -- a Casino City but then again the rest of the city is not cleaned up like what you have down in Orlando. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So basically what I'm trying to do is -- is -- is form a corporation to get a group of investors together and so far like I said Microsoft they read my proposal, Apple Computer read it and my -- my friend that I can say he is like my friend from King World Production, uh, you know he's coming in next month to be able it go over and see so far how far I've gone with this, and I have done nothing but done research, research and then what happens is that when the mind gets tired, what does a man do he goes towards stimulation -- no the little screen on there with all of that Internet uh, little pop up baloney things I always try to stay away from that.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- if that's how I met you -- I think I might of met you through -- has anybody gave your name to me as far as a survey for something else.
R:  Right.
L:  You following what I'm saying? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't want to disrespect you because I don't know you from Adam, I gave you a work number and may give you a home phone number so you think that I'm for real because I am a married person and I wouldn't jerk your string.
R:  Oh.
L:  You can respect that, can you? 
R:  Of course.
L:  Okay, now would you rather have just the contact work number and say hello at work.  If we're -- what do you -- how do you feel comfortable with? 
R:  I can call and chat with the wife and you any time. 
L:  Okay very good it's six, oh, nine --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- three four three and um, six, oh, nine seven four eight nineteen ten.  That's -- that's and her name is Stacey and also I'll show you that I'm not being a wise guy.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Now if you ever want to be able  able to talk about like does, uh, surveys like the ones shows she's into that crap big time.
R:  Excellent
L:  [LAUGH] Me my -- me, myself and I -- I -- I sit there I watch it, I think it's neat some of the things they do I think is very unique
