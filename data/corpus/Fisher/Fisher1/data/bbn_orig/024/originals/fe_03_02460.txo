L:  Hi, my name is Pamela.
R:  [NOISE] Monique.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Pamela?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, hi, this is Monique.  My name is Monique.
L:  Okay.  I've never done this before, so this is my first time doing this. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Um, do you watch any of the reality TV?
L:  I've watched Joe Millionaire.  I've watched the, um, Mr. Personality, I've been taping that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Um --
L:  And, I mean, why I watch it, um, I thought -- the guy I thought was cute on Joe Millionaire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the other ones, I thought, on Mr. Personality were really ugly but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  you could see, like, the way she's, um, I guess, going for different guys that you don't know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she doesn't know how ugly they are 'cause she doesn't see them.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, do you --
L:  Survivor I've never watched.
R:  I -- I didn't really like Survivor.  I did watch some of the -- the millionaire show where he wasn't really a millionaire --
L:  Right, that's -- I've watched that.
R:  Yeah, I watched that one.  But, now, this one, where she -- they -- they're all masked is she has to choose one --
L:  Right.
R:  I -- [MN] -- why do you think it's so popular?  Why do you think so many people watch them?  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, to see that she's picking, um, the guys not by --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, it's not by -- it's not by how they look but it's how their appearance is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And most people, I guess, they don't look at the appearance.  They look first at -- at the out- outside person not the, um, [MN] not the inside person.  Here she has to, [MN] like, use, like, a lot of different senses and she has to, instead of just looking at physical, she has to see how they are maybe mentally or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- their personality, how they talk and then they were getting drunk on the last one --
R:  Ahah.  I think, um, [MN] I don't know, I don't like the double standard with the -- the shows between the men and the women on the reality shows.  [MN] Like, the Joe Millionaire, he could kiss everybody all night but then they had the female version of the Bachelorette and they were very concerned about her kissing different people and -- and what she did and her interaction.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, a double standard and I'm, like, well, the guy did the same thing.  [MN] So, what's the big deal?  I didn't really, [MN] oh, like that, but I just think there are so many because people aren't creative any more.  I think we've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- resorted to, you know, let's just take it -- let's just spy basically.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, just spy into the lives of people, you know, and market that, you know.  I watched one where, um, these -- the couples were getting married [MN] and --
L:  Oh, no, I didn't see that one.  I know what you're talking about. [LAUGH] 
R:  That was so good and then in the end both couples that made it to the end, neither one ended up getting married.
L:  Right, that -- I saw the end.  That's what I saw.
R:  Yeah.  There was so much pain there and, I mean, and then after, I felt bad even watching it because it's like, you know --
L:  Because they were crying and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I'm like, [MN] "Who am I to even be watching", so -- and then but I couldn't tear myself away. [LAUGH] 
L:  All right, but I do watch the Real World and sometimes on and off --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It -- it's about, like, real life and it's not all staged and --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't think they're act- -- I don't think they're acting.  I think everything is really real.
R:  I think that's closer to r- -- a reality show than these other ones.  The Real World that comes on MTV [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause it -- it's very raw but it seems to me, like, The Bachelorette and all that stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  It, I mean, they edit things and I just think -- and they already know the outcome and I just --
L:  Did you watch, um, Temptation Island?
R:  [MN] No.
L:  Everybody -- part of it I watched where they cheat on each other left and right and they're married or they're going out with people or something.
R:  [MN] Oh, and they were ch- -- somebody was cheating or something like that --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and got caught or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Pretty much like a soap opera.
L:  It was for, um, it was a committed couple.  I don't think they were married --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they were testing, like, the strength of their relationship and there was, like, I think, thirteen women and there was thirteen men --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were doing stupid things and they were insulting each other and [MN] I don't know, I watched it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  I taped it so I could, like, fast forward it.  That's basically it.
R:  Yeah.  Someone was saying earlier they didn't think it was really reality TV but more escape TV.
L:  Right.
R:  I think part of it, the reactions and [MN] the -- the insight into human character is real --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, the situations are unlikely but it's still real but, um, they're definitely popular and you are -- you're watching them and you're, like, "Oh [MN] --"
L:  Well, they're better than --
R:  "-- what happened?"
L:  -- something else that's out there, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I've seen, like, ah, I mean, the soap -- the soap operas are getting boring.  I've been watching General Hospital and Port Charles.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then those talk shows are getting ridiculous [MN].
R:  They are -- they're getting to be -- and -- but that's a part of reality TV.  Now, that is, that's -- that's the part -- that's the reality for some people.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, for very few of us.  I don't think it's a reflection of America on the whole but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they dig up some strange things and that's part of reality television and I think that's part of what started it all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, these crazy talk shows, "Well, let's go home with them and find out how they live at home".
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, with that, um, Ozzy Osbourne.  I haven't watched that one yet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but that looks so -- she -- my f- -- my daughter watches it -- it looks retarded though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, I watched Anna Nicole and, you know, before I didn't --
L:  She watched that too.  I didn't watch it yet. [MN]
R:  But, you know, I didn't even know anything about her before.  I didn't even like her really but since I've started watching her reality show, I like her.
L:  Right.
R:  Because she is every day people who -- who happen to have come into some money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but she is still so country.
L:  Yeah, supposedly --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- she slept with that old man, she [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [inaudible] she got a lot of money.
R:  To get his money but she's still a regular every day working girl, single mom --
L:  Yes.  Well, now, because he's dead -- [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  Well, he's dead but -- but I don't know if she'll get his money but she'll definitely get money from this reality show.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I think -- and I think that's part of it.  You know, you -- you identify with the other person and you're, like, "Oh, well, they're just like me", or they grew up with the same things or --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know, she can't get a date either, or you know, or she has problems just like any one else --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and that may be what makes it popular but [MN] I -- I don't know, I don't want to be overrun with reality TV.
L:  Um, I've been reading a lot about what they say -- it's like taking a peek at the lives of the other people and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what they like about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can see how other people live.
R:  Mhm. [MN] It's like being a nosey neighbor.  
L:  Definitely.
R:  But you don't have to leave home. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You don't have to pull out the binoculars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause you just turn on the television set.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But did you see the reality show with, um, [MN] this guy, he's a millionaire already.  His family, Firestone -- the Firestone --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, he has these mi- -- he has the, um, tire company.  Yeah, I 
R:  And I'm, like --
L:  -- heard about it but I didn't see it, no.
R:  I -- I saw a little bit of it.  This girl from Atlanta, 'cause I live in Atlanta --
L:  Ahah.
R:  She -- she asked him, "Well, do you like the [inaudible]?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was, like, "What is that?" you know. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He was just really serious --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Why is he on TV?"
L:  Well, did he know that, um, on that one, that -- that he had money?
R:  They know, yeah, they know --
L:  Oh, they know.
R:  -- he's Firestone.  They know he's Firestone --
L:  ah.
R:  -- but, I mean, when you have millions like that you must really be bored.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, you save that for the -- the average Joe that -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You got millions of dollars, you know you're not going to take home any of these women.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know you're not going to take 'em home to your mother or your father.
L:  Sure, that's true.
R:  So, this, I think [inaudible] --
L:  Most of 'em are probably just after the money. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  Yeah, and he knows it.  [MN] And so that was kinda boring to me.  I really think I liked most the one where the guy was -- the girls didn't know that he was a millionaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he was such a cutie potootie[?].
L:  I know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then he didn't marry her anyway, or he didn't --
R:  W- --
L:  He -- I -- I heard at the end he never married and they -- they've, ah -- they lost contact.
R:  Yeah.  She wasn't that kind of girl anyway.  When they were in the hot tub and the other girls came and she got up and left, he didn't say anything.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  I knew then that she -- he wasn't on her level.
L:  Right.
R:  And he stayed, he didn't even move but I knew he wasn't going to pick the other girl 'cause she was so highfalutin' and nasty.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and nasty acting --
L:  Yeah, she was, she said, like, "He's mine, he's mine". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and then she did the hoochy behind the scenes, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, you know, "You need to cut that out".
L:  I wonder where she did the --
R:  Huh?  You know where she did [inaudible].
L:  Well, I know she did that but I wonder what she did.
R:  She did.  I think somebody at work told me she admitted it or he admitted it or something.
L:  Right.
R:  But she played herself though.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  She really made herself look real bad on national television, but I guess that's what it's all about --
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause how -- how many women and men in America would do just about anything --
L:  To --
R:  -- for a dollar.
L:  -- make money or for TV.
R:  Right. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or get exposure.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And, so, we watch, we go on.
L:  Ahah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Well, I'm waiting for this little thing to tell us that it's ten minutes 'cause I believe it's about ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  I believe it's about ten minutes.  I never -- now, how do we get paid for this?  I have no idea.
R:  Well, we are supposed to keep talking about it until a prompt comes on to let us know when our ten minutes is up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then we can hang up and then after --
L:  Right, but they don't know me.  This is the first time I've done this.
R:  Well, they don't know me either but they have your information. 'Cause they knew [inaudible].
L:  Oh, from the phone number you mean?
R:  Yeah, they have your infor- 
L:  Okay, yeah, 'cause the phone is in my name.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they have to call and then after your third call evidently, um --
L:  Right, no, this is my first one.  I've never, I mean, I've tried --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I've never gotten on to [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the talking and [MN] just kept saying that they didn't need me or something and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] and they hung up on me.
R:  Oh, yeah, so [NOISE] -- yeah, it's crazy and I'm talking all this [inaudible] but you know what, I'll probably turn on my television the very next time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And we're gonna watch it again. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, well, it's more exciting than my life, that's for sure.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess -- I guess that's why people are tuning in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To watch someone else's drama is always better than your own
