R:  Hi, I'm Ashley[?]. [NOISE]
L:  Hi. [COUGH] Excuse me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm Gennabra[?]. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry, what was your name?
L:  It's a weird one, my name is Gennabra. [NOISE]
R:  Gennabra?  That's pretty, that's a very pretty name. [MN]
L:  Thank you, mm.
R:  So, uh, have you done this before?
L:  Uh, yes, actually.  I did for the first time yesterday.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, have you?
R:  I just did it for the first time two days ago.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty new with it too, but this sounds like a good topic to me.
L:  It is.  My last topic was really boring. [LAUGH]
R:  What was yours?
L:  It was, um, yeah, what do you think is worse?  Uh, drinking, smoking --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- not exercising.  I don't know.  It was just --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and the stupid guy I was talking to wouldn't talk about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  Anyway.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  Reality TV is -- it's -- [inaudible] the fun stuff to talk about. [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Um --
L:  So, do you w- --
R:  -- well, did you wanna start?  Or do you want me to?
L:  Uh, you go ahead, you start.
R:  Okay.  Um, my guilty pleasure is that -- I mean, I am completely obsessed with reality TV shows --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so you can even say whatever you want against them and it won't bother me at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I -- you know, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but since, um, since this is a survey about it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll be honest.  Um, I generally watch every reality show that I can get my hands on.  I started with --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I started watching the Real World when it first came out --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and then -- yeah, and then, um, I quit watching the Real World to watch Survivor and Big Brother.  I watched every single night of Big Brother that it was on.
L:  And were you on the web as well?
R:  Yeah, I was.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  As sad as that may be, and, um, and I thought Joe Millionaire was fantastic, I was addicted to it, I couldn't go out last night because The Bachelor was on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm pre- -- I'm a pretty sad case myself.
L:  Do you watch --
R:  How about you?
L:  Did you wa- -- well, uh, I'm -- there's some of them, like I really didn't like, uh, the, like, Date Your Daughter shows.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  What's -- what was that --
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  I watched a couple of those, but they didn't really work for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] I -- I don't watch the Real W- -- I watched the first Survivor and I was really into it, and I was on the web all the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I was shocked that Rich w- won.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I tried to watch the most recent Survivor that was men against women and then, like, i- -- I've been -- I've been taking a class at night now, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it didn't -- it didn't work.  But I also really like the Channel Thirteen shows, uh, Frontier House and the Manor House, that's on now.
R:  The Manor House?  Actually, I don't think I know that one.
L:  It's, uh, w- well, I guess it's Channel Thirteen here in New York, but it's TBS.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, public television?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, and -- so the Manor House is -- it's a ho- -- it's -- it's like a -- it's in England --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's a -- it's like they're pretending they're at the turn of the century, and there's some volunteers that are the servants in the house, and there's some volunteers that are the family in the house.
R:  I see.
L:  It's been tense, and, um --
R:  I -- I don't think that's out here yet, or I -- I mean --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, that's funny.  The guy I talked to yesterday was in LA.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the guy that I spoke to the other day was in New York, so --
L:  How funny.
R:  -- maybe they want both points of view, I guess, from New York and LA.  But, um, well, yeah, I'm not familiar with that one, but, um, I'll keep my eyes peeled.  Um --
L:  I'm going to be, like, ten minutes. [NOISE]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] Sorry, I was talking to someone else.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so -- well, let's see, so we w- [MN] --
L:  So, well, like, [MN] although, yes, I think that it is a guilty pleasure, because although I watch them, like, I think, "Who would subject themselves to being [NOISE] on this show?" 
R:  Right.
L:  Like -- and I -- you know, and I -- I feel like it's sort of, [NOISE] um, like, I -- I see that people w- who are in relationships with each other, like me and my husband, for instance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sit on the couch and watch other people living their lives.  Like, it's this weird disconnect thing that I ha- -- think happens in society.  I mean, I'm totally guilty of that myself, but I can't help but thinking of, like, how it's -- it's weird, like, it's -- it's weird and seems not good. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, actually, I don't think it's so bad.  I studied a lot of psychology in -- in college and I've been kind of obsessed with that ever since --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that this is a wonderful way to learn about people, um, unfortunately these people are put in certain situations so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not an accurate portrayal of people in their everyday lives, because of course --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these people are being filmed all day.  But, it's, like, having, um, you know, watching people under a microscope, and certainly with Big Brother, you get to watch them twenty four hours a day if you -- if you subscribe online, you can watch them twenty four hours a day.  It's really interesting to see how humans interact in certain si- situations and you can compare and contrast your own behavior and modify your own behavior accordingly.  If you don't like that way that somebody presents themselves in a situation, you get to see that in a way that i- i- -- where you -- y- you are able to have an objective opinion of it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, instead of being involved in the situation yourself and so you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can take that information out and apply it to your life, I think.
L:  Well, I see your point.  I mean, I've often, especially on Big Brother --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've -- I think it was the second one that I watched, really, I thought, like, I would never make it.  Like, I would never make it on the show.  Like, this -- I would just crack up.  Like, I couldn't -- I care too much what people think about me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I couldn't stand the idea of, like, being voted out, like, I just -- I'm not cut out for that.  But have you ever -- like, so, you know, what you say is kind of interesting, like you can observe people's behavior and possibly modify your own.  Do you think that you've ever, like, modified your behavior based on something you've seen on a reality TV show?  Or, like --
R:  Hm.  That's a good question, um --
L:  I -- I mean, I -- I don't and -- oh, and before -- before it [several inaudible words] also -- I mean, this isn't, um, [LIPSMACK] do you watch -- do you watch Anna Nicole and the -- and the Osbournes --
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as well?  Of course, okay, yeah.
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, you know, I wouldn't say that there was a specific event that happened to me that I can say, "Oh, I -- I a- acted this way because of the reality show" but I can say that when I see a character that I don't like on a reality show that I make sure that I never do anything that would remind me of their behavior --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I think their behavior is so distasteful or whatever.  So, yeah, and it does come into my mind, every now and then I'll be saying something kinda gossipy or whatever and then I think, "Oh God, I sound like Lisa" or I sound like -- you know? [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And, um, and so, yeah, I -- I kind of keep it in mind, I suppose.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  Do you?  Have you ever done that? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I think -- I think if you -- no, I mean, I don't think I've ever changed my behaviour, but it's true, like if you -- especially, I think, Fox did this when they had, like, the reality show -- I think Mr. -- Mr. Personality and Joe Millionaire, it was like this two where they're on, like, three days in a row --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it feels like it really does become part of -- like the characters become, you know, people who are part of your consciousness, like almost like when you read a book and you get really get involved, and the characters are in your head.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes, I definitely think that, um, you know, they become almost like peripheral friends.  Like soaps -- like when I used to watch soap operas when I was in high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, like those people are sort of part of my life. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah, right.
L:  It's sort of -- it becomes -- it becomes like that.
R:  Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons why they're so popular, is because people do, they -- they find friends in these characters.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- and it is -- it's like a real life soap opera.
L:  I guess it is, it's like a soap opera.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's exactly like what Dynasty and Dallas used to be.
R:  Right.
L:  For --
R:  But [MN] --
L:  -- people.
R:  And it's got another level of excitement, because you know it's real and so i- -- you know, a lot of people are voyeurs and what you're doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is you're basically --
L:  Right.
R:  -- watching somebody else's every move and -- and so that's exciting in its own way, and these are your captive people.  You know exactly where they are [LAUGH] and, um, you can --
L:  And it is kind of fun to predict, 'cause I was watching the first -- I only saw the first episode of Mr. Personality --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I was, like, "Oh my God, I can't believe that guy said his Dad just died three weeks ago" or whatever it was.
R:  [MN]
L:  It was, like, she's never going to pick him now.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And she -- and she was, like, "Oh, he was so honest and he really opened up to me, I thought that was great" and I was, like, "What?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like, it's interesting to see -- I don't know.  I find that I really [inaudible] there has never really been a character on any show that I've related to, like, "Oh, I would be just like her", like I just -- I -- I watch people say things and I'm, like, "Are they serious?  Are they just saying this because they're on TV?"  Like, stuff like, oh, like the Extreme Makeover show. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my God, I watch so much TV, it's really embarrassing.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I'm embarrassed talking to you about this too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Um, like, the women get on the Extreme Makeover show and they're, like, "I'm so proud of myself.  I'm really doing something to change my life" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm thinking, "What?  Are you out of your mind?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean -- and I think a lot of people, I'm not the only one who feels superior when I watch these shows.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, I think that's something else people get out of them as well.  I guess they feel superior to people on TV, like, it's not -- they're not stars, but they're, you know, still on --
R:  Exactly.  That's -- I think that's a really good point.  And also, watching those reality dating shows, you -- yeah, I mean, i- -- you're married, but I'm not, and, um, you know, it -- it gives me reminders about, you know, what definitely not to do on a date. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it also makes me feel better about myself, makes me think, "Wow, I'm really a catch, because --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I would never act like that".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, I think that those are a bunch of reasons why people find them appealing, and just also for the laugh factor.  Of just -- just laughing at these ridiculous people, how these people behave.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think we've covered it, but we're supposed to wait 'til they tell us to, um --
L:  I know.  I -- I'm surprised it hasn't -- but this -- this talk is going much better than yesterday's.
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It was -- I actually lied to the guy about my name. [LAUGH] I got all weird, like, "Oh my God, what if he finds out who I am and --", I don't know why.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, don't worry, I won't -- I won't come --
L:  No, no.  I --
R:  -- and stalk you or anything. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but, uh, yeah, I -- let's -- let's see what else, um, what else can we talk about?
L:  So, you live in LA?  Do you work in the entertainment industry?
R:  Um, no, I'm an English teacher.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, yeah.  What do you do?  
L:  Um, well, I actually did, ah
