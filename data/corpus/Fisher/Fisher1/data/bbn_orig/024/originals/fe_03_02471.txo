L:  Hello, this is Vicky.
R:  Hi, this is Carl.
L:  Hey, how are you doing?
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good.  Do you watch reality television?
R:  Ah, no, I don't.
L:  No?
R:  Do you?
L:  Oh, wow, I do.  I love it.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  I do.
R:  Why?
L:  I don't know.  I just do.  L- last night I watched The Bachelor and it was pretty interesting.
R:  What's that?
L:  It's the show where there's one guy and then he gets to pick the one that he wants to marry out of, like, twenty four women and --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- then it goes for, um, weeks.
R:  I- -- do people wind up, ah, voting women off of this thing, or does he pick everything?
L:  Um, yeah, he picks the person that he --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, it starts out with twenty four girls --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then he picks, um, the ones that he wants to keep and then each week it goes down, but last week --
R:  Jeez.
L:  -- or last night, it was down to four girls and he took off one and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- only one got to go home and she was really disappointed, but it was very good.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I love it.
R:  [NOISE] He's probably a schmuck. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he's lucky.
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  He's actually, um, m- married and -- I mean, he's, um, Firestone, his --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- last name's Firestone, so he's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   like part of the Firestone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   family.
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess that's the tires and all that stuff, so --
R:  Oh, I see.  W- w- -- he's the millionaire --
L:  So, yeah, he's rich.
R:  -- guy, is that someone else?
L:  No, it's not the millionaire guy, but --
R:  Because I remember there was a millionaire thing where this -- did that guy ever turn out to be a millionaire?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, he wasn't a millionaire.
R:  Okay.
L:  You're talking about Joe Millionaire?  Yeah, he never was a millionaire.  I watched that one too.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but at the end of the show, they surprised him --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and he -- the -- the lady that he chose --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and gave them a million dollars, Fox did.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, that was pretty neat.  So, he actually was a millionaire --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- and they really weren't lying, but he didn't know it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  That's funny.  So, you don't watch any -- you don't watch, like, The Mole or any of those things?
R:  No, I've heard of 'em, you can't avoid it, but I -- I really think it's kind of fucked up, so, um, I kind of avoid it.
L:  Really?  Oh, but they're so fun, you should just at least get into one of them.
R:  Yeah.  Don't you think it's kind of voyeuristic though? [LAUGH] I don't know.  I ge-  --
L:  [MN]
R:  I remember -- I, um, I'm actually French and my last year before I came to college there was, um, they call in Loft Story in France --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is pretty much equivalent, like they film a whole bunch of young people in a house stuck together, and then you end up voting off whoever you don't like or whatever.  Like [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's like, um, the -- like Big Brother and stuff.
R:  Um, anyway --
L:  You don't even watch, like, the MTV Real World and stuff like that?
R:  No, I don't actually have television. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] It's a very conscious choice.  But anyway, I -- it was like a big debate in France when they started Loft Story, you know, like, it's reducing, you know, human beings to, you know, consumer good etcetera.  It may be a little too far, but I still think it's kind of fucked up.
L:  Really?  So, what do you think about this new movie, the Real Cancun?
R:  Um, I don't think I'm familiar with it.  I think -- oh, actually, yes, that's, uh [NOISE]  isn't it like this, um, lustful woman jumping in the air from the water, is that the ad for it?
L:  Oh, I don't -- I don't know what the ad is for it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's about --
R:  All right.
L:  -- it's about -- they get a bunch of college students --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they take them to Cancun.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  And they, like, push 'em into doing all this crazy stuff and then they're --
R:  I see.
L:  -- making a movie out of it.
R:  Oh, wow, wow.
L:  So --
R:  It sounds fun.
L:  -- and they got, like, cameras in all the --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh God.
L:  -- rooms and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  -- I ha --
R:  -- I bet they'll f- -- they'll feel good when their grandchildren see it. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] Jeez.
L:  It's, like, I can't even believe they would want to show America -- them -- them doing them things like that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, i- is it really bad?
L:  Yeah.  Like, they -- like people were having sex all the time with different people and --
R:  Really?  And it's filmed?
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- [MN] like, every day, every minute was filmed.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  You couldn't get away from the cameras.
R:  Wow, jeez.
L:  And it's -- it's crazy, 'cause I seen it on Twenty Twenty, like -- like a little briefing of it --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L: -- and, uh, it was pretty -- it was something.
R:  [NOISE] Boy.
L:  I don't think that I'll be one watching that, but --
R:  Yeah, that seems kind of insane. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm here.  I thought my phone was messing up, so I have to change.
R:  Oh.  So, where are you actually, right now?
L:  Where am I?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In Georgia.
R:  In Georgia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Excellent.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Uh, New York City.
L:  Wow.  That's cool.
R:  Are you a student?
L:  Um, actually, no.  I'm a stay at home mom.
R:  Okay.  Cool, cool.
L:  That's why I get the chance to watch all the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I mean, that's my favorite, I wouldn't -- I don't know how I would -- would live without reality TV, and when I h- heard that was the topic today I was like, "Oh, my goodness.  My favorite".
R:  [LAUGH] Excellent. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] That's funny.
L:  I absolutely love all the reality, The Bachelorette, all that stuff.  So, it's really cool.  Have you done this before, talked --
R:  No, this is actually my first time.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  You?
L:  This is my third time.
R:  Okay, so it's like your last, right?
L:  I guess so.
R:  What's with the deal with it?  Do you know anything more than what they've told you?  Well, I assume -- w- what have they told you about it?
L:  Um, nothing really, just I got the email, just in -- it said that the University was doing a study on conversations --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- phone conversations, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- how people talk -- that they don't each other, how they talk and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the topic, and I don't know, that's all I know about it.  So --
R:  That's kind of funny.  So, where in Georgia do you live?
L:  Atlanta.
R:  [NOISE] Where?
L:  Atlanta.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Excellent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a good friend from there.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you a student?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm nineteen.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Twenty seven.
R:  Twenty seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you hear of this thing, then?  Through --
L:  How did I -- how'd I hear about it?
R:  Because it's through Penn, I think, right?
L:  Yeah.  I -- ha- -- I got a email.  I do, like, um, mystery shops.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, I'll go to the companies and then I'll be, like, the mystery shopper and then complain or --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- tell them the good stuff or the bad stuff --
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, they just sent me an email about it.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  I was, like, "Oh, I'll try it.  It sounds fun, I ain't got nothing else to do".
R:  [LAUGH] Cool.
L:  So, I watch all the kids in the neighborhood play on their bikes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I figure I could do it just for ten minutes, it wouldn't be too bad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I don't know, they did say that you probably should stay on the topic for at least eight minutes.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, I don't know.
R:  I don't know what else there is to say about it, to be honest.
L:  Really?
R:  I'm kind of appalled by the whole thing, but, uh --
L:  Oh no!
R:  -- I don't know.  I don't know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- don't you find it's kind of denigrating to the people on it [NOISE] and -- and --
L:  Sometimes it really is, it really is.
R:  -- and therefore doesn't that extend to the person who watches it?
L:  Oh really, you think?  I don't think so.
R:  Really?
L:  I -- I think I'm a nosy person, so ...
R:  Yeah, oh, but nosy -- nosy can be healthy, but this is kind of -- I -- I find it goes too far though.  I mean --
L:  Well, sometimes it does, but [SIGH] don't you ever wonder, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what really happens in -- when situations like that in real life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and they show the real --
R:  But this is not real life, it's not even close.
L:  W- well, yeah, they set it up and it's set up, I'm sure, of course.
R:  Yeah, it's not real life, it's --
L:  And they don't show all the stuff that really happens and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just show the things that they think America will be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make 'em interested in watching again the next week.
R:  [NOISE] Right, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  But, I mean --
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  [COUGH] Well, like, I watched The Bachelorette and actually, the -- the last Bachelorette, they fell in love, they were really in love, she actually found somebody that she was really in love with and they're actually going to get married.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I really believe that it's real, that they -- what they did for themselves was really real.
R:  Yeah, I'd like to see what happens next year. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  When [inaudible].  I don't know.
L:  It -- there's a lot of the new television, I mean, the shows coming out, reality shows --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like Married by America, some of those w- weird ones I won't watch, but the ones that have, um [MN] --
R:  Wait, what was the real weird one, you said it?
L:  Married by America, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you get to choose, um, like America will choose the person that the lady was supposed to marry or the man was supposed to marry.
R:  Oh my God, so you don't even choose?
L:  No, the person doesn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get to choose at all.
R:  Oh, my God.  That's taking it to a new level.
L:  Yes, that is crazy.  I w- -- I -- I didn't really -- wasn't interested.  And they got this new one that just come out is, uh, Mr. Personality.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Where, like, all the people wear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the masks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she chooses the guy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that she likes the best, compare -- you know, just by his personality only.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she can't see what he looks like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because he has on a mask.
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's got like, a little moral to it, I guess.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But then some of the guys are, like, really ugly.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Some of 'em are cute, but then, she doesn't know anything about them except for their name.  She can't find out, you know, where they work at or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  Oh, but that's part of their personality though, in their jobs.
L:  Well, I guess it would -- it would lead her into thinking, "Well, if he's rich or he does this and that makes him rich" --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- so that really wouldn't make it his personality.
R:  Yeah, but, like, what if one's a poet or a painter or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that would be a big part of his character.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But one of the guys was like, a millionaire, so --
R:  Oh, really?  So, what, you get to know what these guys look like and what they do, but she doesn't?
L:  Yeah, it shows 'em, like, as -- as they, like, introduce them.  It shows their face and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then it tells what they do at the bottom of it.
R:  And some of them are really hot and some of them really aren't?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some of 'em are really ugly, but they have, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- their friends would all say, "If it was based on personality, you would have got the girl", you know, and that's how they got on the show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's actually, like, ha- -- like maybe four [NOISE] of them are from Atlanta --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even the girl that -- that, um, even the girl is like, from Atlanta, the -- the lady that's getting to choose the people.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Maybe they've already seen each other. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe, yeah, maybe.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's been, like, a really big thing on television, like the news and stuff.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, uh, like, they've interviewed the people that get kicked off.
R:  That, like, elevates the definition of blind date, don't you think?  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Oh, definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my gosh, that's ridiculous.  [LAUGH] I guess it's kind of better than having someone choose who you're going to marry.
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- it's --
R:  Well, I guess you can always annul it afterwards.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, you always can, and I don't think that none of those -- those ones like that ever really work out --
R:  [NOISE]  No.
L:  -- because it's kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kinda crazy, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's really fun to watch, you get to --
R:  I imagine --
L:  -- you get to ex- --
R:  -- I imagine you can addicted really fast.
L:  Yeah, you get to see the expressions, [NOISE] the real life expressions of people when they get their heart broke and --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- 'cause the cameras are right on 'em, you know. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, like, the Joe Millionaire [NOISE] thing was really weird because -- take 'em over there -- the Joe Millionaire thing was like that one of the ladies and him had went back into the woods --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the cameraman I guess couldn't follow them ba- -- as far back as they were going, but they still had microphones on and you could hear everything that they were doing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I don't know if they were like, thinking or saying things that they were doing back there and just making up all this stuff --
R:  [NOISE] Or [LAUGH] --
L:  -- but at the bottom of the screen, it was going, like, they were kissing and, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a zipper unzipped and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was crazy.  It was really crazy.
R:  [NOISE] Oh gosh, I bet people love it.
L:  Yeah, they loved that, that's what kept 'em tuning in. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah, no kidding.
L:  Ah, that's why I was, like, "Oh my God".
R:  So --
