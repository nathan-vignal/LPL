R:  Hi, my name's Jennifer.
L:  Hey Jennifer, my name is Ben.
R:  Hi Ben.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Ah, Philadelphia.
R:  Okay.  I'm calling from Los Angeles.
L:  Wow, okay, that's -- I've been out there before.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Just, ah, I used -- I lived in San Diego for a little bit, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in the Pacific Beach and I went up to -- to Hollywood a couple of times.
R:  Oh, will big deal.
L:  Yeah, have you ever been over there to the east coast?
R:  Ah, I'm from the east coast.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, I'm from New York.
L:  Okay, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and then I -- I lived in Providence and then in Boston and Chicago.  Well, that was mid west, so -- 
L:  And --  
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- you made it out?
R:  What was that?
L:  You made it out west?
R:  Yeah, I made it out west finally.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's nice out there.  And I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I mean, I hav- haven't -- haven't spent a long time in LA but I liked, ah, living in San Diego once. 
R:  That's a nice area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we should -- so, we should talk about the topic.
R:  Yeah, um -- 
L:  Right.
R:  So, I -- I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] I mean, I think there are bad aspects to each one but, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then again I participate in some of those bad aspects -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there [LAUGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so, you know, but, you know, I think out of all of them, um -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- overeating's really bad.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think, um, that's prob- I would probably agree, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- your smoking is -- is horrible but, it seems to me, ah -- I mean, I -- I -- I smoked for a long time -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I was able to quit and, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you know what, once you quit you ha- I mean, there is -- it's -- I mean, you can -- you can reverse a lot of the negative -- 
R:  Yeah, I know -- 
L:  -- side of it. 
R:  -- your body reverses.  I know.  I know that one -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] -- that's true and then the same thing with, ah, yeah, with [inaudible] drinking.  Well, I cert- with drinking if you destroy your liver you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really destroy your liver.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] right.  
R:  But, um, but still you could stop drinking and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you can also do both -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- in moderate -- in -- in moderation and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you'll be fine.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean, smoking is maybe harder to do in moderation than drinking.  But, it's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it depends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I couldn't, ah, I couldn't -- I c- I couldn't smoke just one cigarette, you know, every once and a while.  I had to smoke a -- a pack a day eventually.
R:  Oh, you know -- you know, I -- I'm like I can, isn't that weird?
L:  Yeah?  Some people can -- 
R:  I can smoke -- 
L:  -- some people -- 
R:  a -- a -- one cigarette today and then I can smoke -- chain smoke t- later on tonight -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then go for a month and not smoke.
L:  Wow, how the heck.  That's great -- 
R:  So, I was thinking, "Am I really addicted or not?" because I've been doing this on -- off and -- more than off and on but, I mean, I -- I do smoke but, I've been doing this -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right -- I -- there are periods of time where I'm not with my gang of people to -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my camaraderie -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then I will, and I'm really busy and I don't have access then I will not smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it will be -- and it's been going on for about five years now.
L:  Yeah, and -- 
R:  I don't know -- it's --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] don't know about.  I mean, people say, "You're really addicted or you're not addicted" and y- and I was like, "Well, I must not be addicted then".
L:  I think you're not addicted.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess not.  I mean, but you know what?  Smoking's really easy -- really addictive.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- I have -- have -- I mean, I know some people  that have been -- were like that and for -- you know, were like that for a few years just, ah, sm- smoking a cigarette every once and a while and eventually they started smoking a lot.
R:  Yeah, but I can smoke a lot and -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's why I -- I mean, when I -- I mean, I know smoking is bad for -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- you in excess but I -- but, you know, the effects of that -- [several inaudible words] asthma the effects are -- are not as immediate as with, like, over eating for instance -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where if you -- that becomes a really, really strong psychological need.  Like, just like smoking is like also -- if it becomes an addiction it can be psychological and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- also bodily.  But, if you over eat it hits all your organs at once.
L:  Yeah, exactly -- 
R:  Because of -- 
L:  -- that's right.
R:  -- because that becomes the -- not only psychological but it also becomes -- it hits your endocrine system if you eat too much sugar because that generally is the path of eating a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then you have -- you develop diabetes which is -- which then involves medication or diet change.  Then, you could also develop other miscellaneous -- 
L:  Sure, heart attacks, and -- 
R:  -- medical conditions -- 
L:  -- yeah [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- I mean, yeah, heart attacks from the coronary -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- [inaudible] build up from eating fat and so, you're not even doing sugar anymore you're doing the fat from the meats -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- and fats -- 
L:  It has -- 
R:  -- I see -- 
L:  -- yeah, and once you're -- and once you're, you know, dangerously overweight I think, ah, it's -- 
R:  -- that's hard. 
L:  -- one of the most difficult things, ah, you know to -- 
R:  Yeah, that's -- 
L:  -- to -- to lose [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's why you hear about it all the time on TV.  You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hear about these new things to, um, help you lose weight or --
L:  Or -- 
R:  -- medical advances for obese --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- people.  Well, yeah, because they- they'll just die.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- obese -- one -- once you're obese you've already damaged the majority of your bodily systems -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you get to that point.  Obese is really -- it's not being just overweight, it's obese.  It's --
L:  Yeah, but there -- 
R:  -- really overweight.
L:  -- are a lot of people in America that are obese.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty -- 
R:  It really does affect your, ah -- every system.  Smoking affects a lot of systems eventually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, first and foremost, it's the respiratory system --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, obesity, over eating affects every single system right away and -- 
L:  So, do -- so, do you drink a little bit?
R:  I do drink, yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Not so fast though but -- 
L:  And me too, right.
R:  -- it's fun to drink and smoke.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except they have that law here in California where you can't do that.
L:  I know, yes.  San Diego th- all the bars.  Yeah, I notice --
R:  Well, see -- 
L:  -- it's been -- it's been like that for a couple of years, so -- 
R:  Yeah, you see I've only been here for almost three years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, it really killed me so, now I don't even go to bars.  Isn't that sad?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I don't go to any bars because I can't smoke in the bars unless it's one of the secret bars where they allow you to smoke --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because you're in with the, ah, the guy --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- behind the bar.  But -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's really difficult.  But, people do smoke outside.  I mean, we do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We smoke in the parking lot and we just wait for a cop to come up to us and spend time giving us a ticket because -- 
L:  Wait, y- you can't smoke outside?
R:  -- you're not supposed to smoke in public places.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And a parking lot is a public place, like at the mall.
L:  So, you can't -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- smoke on the sidewalk?
R:  Well, that's a public place too -- 
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like you can't smoke anywhere.
L:  I didn't know that -- 
R:  So, I was thinking well, where can you smoke and, I mean -- and the other thing too that I used to do all the time when I was in school was I used to go to coffee bars and, like, coffee places a- outside and just smoke -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, that's a public place now.
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  Here, here.  And even -- I'm from New York originally and so, like, New York, they just passed that law.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And I'm like, "Oh" and they're up in arms because it's so new.  But, I guess they don't realise that in a few years it's going to be really relaxed and people -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you will find places where you can do that.
L:  Well, I mean, I -- I think, I mean, in -- I've read a- that the Cali- in California the rate of smoking is a lot less than it is in a lot of other places.
R:  It is now, but -- 
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, that's a- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that's good.  You know -- 
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, I guess so.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, it's -- 
R:  I mean, you know, but there -- it is relaxing though.  It -- maybe that's just the -- the initial -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, like, experience and then it's going to change because people do smoke outside.  You're not supposed to but they do.
L:  Yeah, well, you can't have a million cops out -- I mean, ah, it's -- it's [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I mean, [several inaudible words] and, oh -- oh, not only that let's -- well, you know, I heard that in New York that because people were so upset that they're starting to do recipes with tobacco and that.
L:  Wow, that is -- 
R:  That's kind of weird though.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] --
R:  That didn't happen in California, I don't think.  I think that's really weird --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and out there and --
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- well, it's -- you know, it's not good for you.  You know, this -- I mean, ah, folks, ah, folks should quit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, but there's, you know, there's a line, you know.  There's, ah, it depends on how much you value your personal autonomy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, you know, and if you value it really highly, you know, it -- you sort -- I mean, there's sort of -- sort of want people to have a right to do stuff.  But, if they're not smart, you know, just -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- because they have personal freedom to do it and as -- as long as you're not hurting anybody else then the government shouldn't really be, you know, telling you what you should do, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if they're worried about the health cost, that's why.
L:  I think -- I think, I mean, I think, yeah, that's a big part of it.  I -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- I don't know -- I don't know if there's a lot to, you know, I mean the second hand smoke that you get when you're wander- when you're working outside.  I mean, I don't -- I don't think, ah, there's -- 
R:  You'd have to really be in contact --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for great amounts of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is dangerous but --
L:  Yeah, if you live -- 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  -- with somebody that smokes all the time then you -- I mean, that's one thing, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I think -- I mean, yeah.  Part of it is they want to, you know, reduce smoking figures.  People are -- a lot of people get lung cancer and don't have health insurance and -- 
R:  Yeah, and then it -- 
L:  -- the state has to -- 
R:  -- goes to the government.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's -- you know, that's -- that's sort of -- that's semi-legitimate, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you [LAUGH] -- I don't know.  But, it's -- it's -- 
R:  Well, the same thing with, um, being obese.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  We're not even -- the obese are just even overweight for some people genetically predisposed to problems.
L:  Right.
R:  But, the government doesn't like covering those things.  But, they need to talk about that if -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Give us all free health club memberships.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well, um, there's like -- ah, there's talk about giving people tax deductions for their health club memberships -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  -- and some states have tried to put taxes on -- sort of sin taxes on fattening foods like, ah, you know, like regular soda and Big Macs and that.  They -- they wanted to put an extra -- extra ta- tax on foods they think -- they thought that, you know, were -- 
R:  Was bad?
L:  -- yeah, were bad.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, my gosh.  You know how awful that's a- that's g- they're going to start crossing lines and they're going to start saying, "Well, what is bad and what's good?"
L:  Right, well that's the problem -- 
R:  And then you're going to get into, like, pregnant women saying, "But, that's supposed to be good for me --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and you're taxing everybody" and then, you know, see -- I can see the problem with that.  But, I could -- but, they also already tax us more for fast food, did you know that?
L:  Yeah.  Why?  Is that right?
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Is they -- they tax more -- 
R:  -- go through a drive through.  Go through a drive through and watch her tax.  Go take a look at your tax.
L:  Is it more than a rest- than other restaurants?
R:  Well, yeah, it's more than -- because of the drive through tax or it's a fast food tax --
L:  Really?
R:  -- it's like twelve percent rather than five or seven or whatever.
L:  Wow.  I guess they have it.  All right.
R:  Well, I mean, they -- every state I've lived in so far has done that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I'm like, "Okay" 'cause in Iowa -- I've lived there --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, there was -- I've lived everywhere.  But, I've lived in Iowa and they didn't have tax on food, and then they had twelve percent tax on fast food.  I'm --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like, "What is this?" and then I went to Chicago for grad school and they did the same exact thing, like it was, I think -- I've forgotten what the tax was there, maybe six point two five.  And then it was twelve point five percent --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- for fast food.  And then I moved to Providence and then to Boston, and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I was like, "Why is there a tax on my --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- fast -- it's higher --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- than normal" --
L:  It's horrible because, yeah -- 
R:  -- and then I think it's the same thing here.  Let me see.  I think it is the same thing here because, um, I mean, why wouldn't Cali- California follow suit?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They're usually --
R:  They -- 
L:  -- the first ones to come over the 
R:  -- they're --
