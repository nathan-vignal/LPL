L:  Hi, my name --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- is Stephanie.
R:  What is your name?
L:  My name's Stephanie --
R:  Stephanie.
L:  -- and I'm from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
R:  And my name is Jim Spradley, and I'm from Plano, Texas, just north of Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay, good.  Nice to meet you, Jim. [LAUGH]
R:  All right?
L:  Okay.  Well, I watch them a lot.  I'm kinda hooked on them.
R:  Now tell me again, exactly what did she say --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- what was the topic?  I didn't catch it.
L:  Ah, reality TV.
R:  Oh, reality TV?  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I watch -- well, I've watched Big Brother, Survivor and, uh, Joe Millionaire, they're the three I've watched so far.
R:  Okay.  Well, I -- I've watched, uh, Joe Millionaire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've watched, uh, the Survivor.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't -- I -- I -- I -- w- when the Survivor first came on, I watched it religiously.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  And now I watch it, uh, off and on.
L:  That's kinda how I am too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's w- wearing out.  You now, it's kind of wearing out its welcome a little bit.  But I -- but I still like it, but Big Brother last year was better than the first year, so that -- but I always watch it, even though it's a little boring.
R:  Well, apparently, I didn't even watch Big Brother.  What's it about?
L:  Um, it -- it -- they -- they just put a ca- -- put, like, seven people in a house and -- and they each vote --
R:  Oh, oh yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I did -- I did watch that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, uh, oh, I do watch The Real World too, on MTV, when I can.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh, you know, I -- I -- but I like them, I -- I think if they -- they're talking about [MN] reality network, I probably would watch it. [LAUGH] I don't know, but I enjoy it.  And I think the reason why [SIGH] is, um, it's fun to watch other people just go -- in their day to day lives, you know, when -- when the camera's on, I think, sometimes.
R:  You know, I think it -- it --
L:  If they're interesting personalities.
R:  [COUGH] I think -- although it shows that, uh, when you -- when you take a group of people, uh, especially of, say, uh, seven or eight or ten people, close them up in a house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, y- you know the old saying, that familiarity breeds disgust?
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, it doesn't take long 'til they -- they snipping at each other.
L:  Yeah, especially when there's nothing else to take their minds off that, you know?
R:  [MN] That's exactly right.
L:  Uh, there's no reading and, you know, I can't even -- I couldn't stand it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think! [LAUGH]  Jus- --
R:  Oh, no, I don't think I could either, n- n- knowing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, uh, uh, everything I do, uh, i- is being, uh, [MN] i- is gonna be on television.
L:  No, I know, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  And -- but I like Joe Millionaire 'cause it had -- it had a twist at the end, that was fun.  And I do like the ones where they do stunts and stuff sometimes too.  But, I don't think -- I -- I haven't watched The Bachelor, yet.  So ...
R:  I have watched The Bachelor, maybe three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- episodes.  In fact, I watched it last night.
L:  Did ya?
R:  He's d- [MN] -- he is down now to three p- -- three girls.
L:  Oh.  You know what I'm watching now, um, Mr. Personality.  The one with the masks.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]  Now that's fun.
R:  I watched that -- listen, I watched that for the first time -- w- was it on last night?
L:  I think it was Monday night.  But y- [LAUGH] yeah --
R:  Oh, whenever it was, I watched it for the first time.
L:  That was fun, I thought.
R:  And I thought then, how d- can these guys go around with these masks on all the time?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Yeah!
L:  So, I think that might end up being a hit.
R:  Well, I kinda of, um, I kinda liked, uh, Joe Millionaire.  Uh ...
L:  Yeah, that was my favorite too.
R:  Uh ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'm -- I think he put on a pretty good show.
L:  Yeah, he did.
R:  But you know, really -- I can understand ... uh, for instance, uh, this boy, uh, d- w- what's his name?  His -- Firestone's his name.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, they, you know, he -- he's a, uh, one of the heirs to the Firestone fortune.
L:  Okay.
R:  But they own, uh, he owns, uh, vineyards in California.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I -- what I'm wondering is --
L:  Oh, okay, I didn't see what they did.  I knew one -- one guy was a motivational speaker, but I didn't see what the rest of 'em did.
R:  No, I'm talk -- th- this is The Bachelor.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, I see, yeah, I haven't seen that yet. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah, where -- where he started off with twenty four girls and now he's down with three.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And actually, it seems as though he is serious in finding -- trying to find a wife.
L:  I know.  But I was disappointed with Joe Millionaire 'cause you thought they -- I thought that was -- they were gonna b- stay together and they didn't.
R:  I'm glad you said that, 'cause I was too.
L:  Yeah.  So I don't, you know, the -- I think they were both faking it a little at the end, that bugged me. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Was it?  Uh, the last I heard, let's see, so she was from Kansas?
L:  Oh, yeah, uh, p- Pennsylvania.  Th- the reason I know that is because --
R:  Oh, she's from Pennsylvania?
L:  Yeah, she's from --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  -- like, Langhorn or something.
R:  Okay.
L:  'Cause that's where -- I'm from Pennsylvania --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so I remembered that, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  She seemed like a nice lady.
R:  But they didn't, uh, uh, [MN] I -- I thought they were gonna hit it off better than that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I guess it's -- h- h- -- it went to his head! [LAUGH]  You know?
R:  I tell you what though, they're getting to point, uh, you know, uh, if one station has a hit or -- or -- or one broadcasting company has a hit, then they all, uh, eventually they all have, uh, s- something along the same lines.
L:  Yeah, and that --
R:  And, uh, and that's what's happening now.
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think they're gonna have to keep coming up with unique stuff because I think it's gonna start getting boring, just like you said you watched Survivor religiously the first time.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I'm watching it less and less, you know, now, too.
R:  And that's exactly the way I doing it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that's -- that's true with probably, uh, the majority of the people that -- that originally started watching these things.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kinda disappointing, 'cause I -- I mean, I would never miss it, you know, now I'm just like, "Oh, well, we can tape it or not", you know.  And I don't have TiVo or anything, but some people tape all that stuff.
R:  That --
L:  But I don't think I would.
R:  -- [COUGH] -- that's kinda like when I was much younger.  Incidentally -- incidentally, I'm seventy nine years old.
L:  Oh, how'd you hear about this? [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A friend of mine, uh, w- an email friend of mine.
L:  Oh, for goodness sakes, that's great!
R:  Who I've never met.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, she -- she's a girl that lives in -- I say a girl, I think she's, oh, probably fifty s- something.
L:  Okay.
R:  But anyway, she lives in San Antonio.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh, uh, she emailed [MN] me this and I really wasn't interested in it and she said, "Oh, yeah, Jim, go ahead, y- y- you'll -- you'll get a kick out of it".  Well, I did and -- and I have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've gotten a kick out of it.
L:  So how many calls have you made?
R:  This is the third one.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, then they -- now you might be to m- make more but this is my first, so ...
R:  Okay, well.
L:  Okay.
R:  This is my third one and I've initiated all the calls, I haven't waited for 'em to call me.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I initiated this one too.
R:  Oh did you?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  And where -- what -- do you say you live in Harrisburg?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  So, we're finally getting nice weather out here.  I tell you, we have five -- five feet of snow! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Before -- yeah, this -- this winter we had l- like, a foot every other week it seemed like, you know, it was terrible.
R:  Stephanie?
L:  Yes?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never will forget the first time I drove through Pennsylvania.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a retired insurance adjuster.
L:  Oh, my -- that's what my stepfather does for a living.  Did.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Well, he -- he's retired too.  He's -- he's around your age.  Uh-huh.
R:  Who'd he -- who'd he work for?
L:  Uh, the State of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... and my brother works --
R:  Well, I retired after -- I was with one company for thirty eight years.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I never forget when I drove -- I, uh, it was either January the first or second, and I'm sure it was the second, I was on my way to Newark, New Jersey, and I dro- -- and I p- of course drove through Pennsylvania.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I believe I spent the night in Harrisburg.
L:  Did ya?
R:  But, I had never seen so much snow in all of my life!
L:  [SIGH] Oh God, it -- we're so sick of it.
R:  Here was a poor boy -- here -- here was a country boy from the south --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- up there, and -- and I'm driving down the highway and the snow is banked up [MN] --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- higher than my car.
L:  Oh, I don't doubt it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's been bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, well, we ear- -- we earned this spring, that's what they keep saying, we earned this spring [LAUGH] you know, so we deserve it, finally.
R:  Incidentally, uh, we were talking about, uh, [inaudible] of course we're supposed to be talking about this r- --
L:  Yeah, do they cut you off after ten minutes or how do you do that?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  D- do you know?
R:  Its' --
L:  Do they cut you off and say you have to quit after such and such an amount of time, or --
R:  Oh no!  Oh yeah!
L:  Oh, they don't?
R:  Yeah, w- when the ten minutes is up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, I mean, th- th- they cut it off and give you thirty minutes to say goodbye.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then you have a minute to [MN] anything you need to add, uh, to the program --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or whatever you want to say, you have thirty, uh, sixty seconds to say.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Okay, good.
R:  But you know this reality TV?
L:  Yeah, could you watch it twenty -- could you wa- -- could you watch a network if they had it on?
R:  Uh ...
L:  'Cause that's what they're thinking of doing, having a -- a reality TV network.  Believe it or not, but -- I read that -- about that.
R:  I don't, no, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I don't guess I did.  Uh ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I'd turn it on once in a while but I wouldn't watch it all the time.  Right now I watch the food channel a lot.  That's the only thing I watch a lot at one time, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, like I say, I -- I -- I watch it at times and, um, I -- I don't watch it as religiously as I -- as I did when -- when it fir- -- when it first came on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, and I guess th- th- the first show, the Survivor, uh, where fat Richard won the, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, Richard, it would happen to him!  Boy, he's outta there, you don't see him anymore.
R:  Well, [MN] uh, now, I see him every now and then, he appears, he -- he -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Reportedly he came -- became quite famous from being on that show, and -- and then also in winning it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which surprised me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I -- I see him every now and then at -- at some festivity that, uh, where you -- you see the Hollywood characters, well, th- there's old Richard.  Of course, he -- he lost like, oh, I don't know, a hundred pounds, something like that.
L:  Oh, I know.  I wonder how he did that!  Goodness.
R:  [MN] yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh!  So, he wasn't shy, I'll tell you.  And plus that other -- that other girl, she was something else too, you know.  That --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it was Susan, was that her name?
R:  Susan.
L:  Yeah, Sue --
R:  Yeah, [MN] she was a truck driver.
L:  Yeah, the truck driver! [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I think from Idaho.
L:  Oh my God.  She was -- she was rough around the edges.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you're not kidding, she was tough as a boot!
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm forty.
R:  Forty!
L:  I just turned forty, yes.
R:  [MN]
L:  Just had my fortieth birthday la- uh, just last month.
R:  You passed the big four oh.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yes, I did.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... [LAUGH]  That's why I'm surprised that people your age are watching the reality shows, I didn't think you'd get into it much, you know.  My grandmother sure won't.
R:  Oh really?
L:  She won't -- she refuses to watch that kinda stuff.
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.  She --
R:  I watch a little of everything, just to be frank with you.
L:  Do ya?  Yeah.
