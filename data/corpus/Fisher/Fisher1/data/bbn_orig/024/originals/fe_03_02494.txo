L:  I watch a lot of that also.
R:  That's cool.
L:  And --
R:  But -- uh --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  No, um, 'cause some of the ones that are on TV now, like Married by America and Joe Millionaire, whatever, are just so, like, what is going on in society that these shows are on?
L:  Exactly, exactly.  You know, I mean, it's just -- there's so much going on, and I tell you, you just have to really, uh, y- you -- you really -- it really tur- -- it kinda turns you off, really.
R:  Yeah.  It's really weird, I think. [LAUGH]

L:  Oh, you're in New Jersey?
R:  Yeah.

R:  So I watch [LAUGH] --
L:  You're nineteen?  I see, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay, so you watch a lot of the, uh, mostly teenage type, so --
R:  Yeah, I like MTV a lot.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That I don't -- I don't -- I don't really watch a lot of that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watch more of the, uh, uh, more relaxed type shows, you know?  I like, uh, I like movies, I like, uh ... uh --
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, do you, uh, Fear Factor?  Do you --
R:  Oh, I hate that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is -- it's r- --
R:  It's so gross.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Um --
R:  Um --
L:  It -- very, very.  You -- you -- you, uh, you wonder those people -- well -- well, pe- -- some people will do anything for money.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  But -- anything for money and, uh, uh, it's -- it's surprising that -- that -- with what they would do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It really is.  And it's dangerous.
R:  It's crazy.  I can't believe some of the stuff they do.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  It -- it grosses me out, when I see the commercials I'm, like, "Oh". [LAUGH]
L:  I know it, I know it.  I know it.
R:  But, yeah, I watch MTV, [inaudible] shows on, like they have, like, college, you know, they -- they go to colleges, you see other people, like, our age, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, it's fun to see reality.  I mean -- but it [inaudible] the question how much is reality and how much is, like, staged.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Well, you're right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- what grade are you?
R:  I'm, uh, finishing my sophomore year at college.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, right, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  What's your -- what's your major in?
R:  Uh, psychology and Spanish.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Real good, uh-huh.  That's very good, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  All right, then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you have other sisters and brothers and, um --
R:  Yeah, I have two.  An older brother and an older sister.
L:  They're younger than you?
R:  They're older.
L:  They're older, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they -- what do they normally watch?  Are they -- are they mostly on the same line are you, or they, uh, little more like --
R:  Um, they watch -- they watch a little bit of MTV, but they're a lot older, and my brother is thirty two and my sister is, uh, twenty seven.
L:  I see.
R:  But they watch some young stuff, but they also, like, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I guess it's just different things for different folk, you know?
R:  I'll watch, like, the dating shows with my sister sometimes.
L:  Yeah, and I like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I like that, you know.  A more relaxed type of, uh, atmosphere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the dating shows and stuff like that.  I don't like all this, uh, all this, uh, violence and all this -- you know, it's just the w- -- some of the stuff they're bringing on TV now is ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  It's really ridiculous, and it's bad for the younger --
R:  It's, like, distasteful.
L:  Pardon?
R:  [LAUGH] It's distasteful.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  It is.
L:  Yes, it is.  It's -- it's, uh, it's not good for the younger crowd that's, you know, even under you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that's -- that's watching, you know, 'cause it all -- all it does is put a lot of ideas in -- in their heads and a -- a lot of kids are -- they see this stuff on TV, and it really takes effect.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'll go out and try to do these things.
R:  I know.
L:  Well, in fact, not try, they'll do 'em.
R:  Shows like, uh, have you heard of Jackass on MTV?
L:  Yes.
R:  Where they think up, like, wild things and ... they had -- they have a disclaimer, like, "Please do not perform any of eve- -- things at home".
L:  Right.
R:  And teenagers are gonna go out and try to do things and, like, get hurt.
L:  That's right, they do that, they do that.
R:  Yes.
L:  They just -- 'cause just some of 'em will try it.
R:  Yeah, it's nuts. [LAUGH]
L:  They will -- will try it, they surely, surely will. [COUGH] But it's -- it's bad.  It's -- it's -- it -- it makes a bad atmosphere and it makes it bad for, uh, people that have to be around people that does that.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh, 'cause it's -- it's just -- it's -- it's really not a healthy situation.
R:  No.  I know.  And some of the talk shows, too, really --
L:  Oh, i- -- they're awful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're -- they're really -- I don't -- I don't -- really, I don't even watch some of 'em.
R:  Like, it's just amusing to watch, but I don't think -- I don't -- can't imagine that's real, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if it is or not.  If it is it's kinda sad, but --
L:  And some of them, they really need to take off, you know [LAUGH] like, uh, the, uh, all these other, oh, um, uh, what is it?
R:  Jerry Springer.
L:  Uh, Springer, yes and ah, ah, what is it?  Phil D- -- what is it, Phil Donahue?  Is he still coming on, uh --
R:  I don't know if he is.
L:  Yeah, they need to -- now, that's really awful.  But h- he doesn't -- he doesn't care 'cause he -- he's making money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's all about money for him. [LAUGH] So he don't care, I guess, if th- those crazy people come on there with that.  Uh, he'll entertain it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I wonder, because my brother, he works at [inaudible] CNBC --
L:  Your brother?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Wh- --
R:  -- ah, I wonder what he thinks, like, about the -- the reality TV.  I've never really asked him.  I don't know, like, I wanna ask him now.
L:  Yeah, you have to ask him just -- oh, he works for NBC?
R:  CNBC, the --
L:  Oh, C- -- oh, does he?
R:  -- isn't it?  The market, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, just to know what he -- he really would think about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, one of these times maybe, you -- you know, when you're talking to him ask him and see just what his ideas about it and how he feels about it.
R:  Yes, I will [several inaudible words] be interesting.
L:  Right.  It's -- it's -- it's, uh, but I think those shows are -- those shows like that -- that, uh, come on like that, I think they do a lot of damage to the teenagers now.  It -- it -- it, uh, it really puts their mind on something that, um, uh, they -- in other words, they, you know, they bring it on and i- i- it used to be a time they wouldn't air TV shows like that.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.
L:  It -- they wouldn't air 'em and -- and it really -- they think it's something great.  You know, they -- they really think it's something great, like it's something, uh, um, uh, with the -- with the time, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They think nothing of it.  It's -- it's if you're not with it, if you're not doing that or participating, then you not with the in crowd.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know what you mean.  And even younger kids, like I have a niece who is seven and she's into ones like [inaudible] you can definitely tell.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And it's just, like, ah, if she sees these things, like, "Oh my God".
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's, um, it's -- it's really bad.  We're kind of breaking up a little bit, aren't we?
R:  No, I'm okay.  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah, I can hear you.  You -- I can hear a little static every now and then. 
R:  Oh.
L:  It might be over the line, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah, so -- so what -- what are your intentions when you, uh, when you finish, when you finish school?  You, uh, you, um --
R:  I don't know.  I wanna maybe go to graduate school o- or maybe go into social work type of stuff.
L:  That's good, that's good.
R:  Like therapy or something.
L:  Yes, yes, that's -- that's real good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, that type of thing, you -- you have a chance to, uh, get involved with people that sometime, if you can be a help to them, you know, maybe they having different problems, because, you know, uh, even, let's face reality, uh, the -- one of the main things that's -- that's hitting this, uh, nation now is drugs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And -- and it's, uh, and -- and if -- it is a reality, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh, the -- the type of thing, it is really -- we have ruined n- not even the younger set, but older people, you know, 'cause they get hooked on it.
R:  I know.
L:  And, uh, people need -- they need help.  They just -- they get s- -- to be where they --
R:  I -- I feel like s- -- a lot of people don't have good influences in their life --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and that's why, like, I feel like if I can maybe help somebody [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true, 'cause somet-  --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- sometime, yeah, some people, like you say, a lot of people don't have good influences and --
R:  'Cause I wanna, like, to be maybe a high school, like, uh, psychologist.
L:  Yeah, right.  Now, that -- that's good.  That's really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that -- that
