L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  My name is Tom Dunn.
R:  [MN] My name is Marge Caldwell.
L:  Marge, how're ya doing?
R:  Pretty good.  How about you?
L:  Good.  Where are you located?
R:  Houston.
L:  Houston?  Okay, I'm in Syracuse, New York.
R:  Oh, quite a little distance there.
L:  Yes, a little bit of distance.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, I guess the topic is, ah, reality --
R:  Reality shows?
L:  I don't watch 'em, do you?
R:  Well, I did watch a couple when they first came out.
L:  Did you?  I-- I might have seen maybe one or part of an episode of Survivor but that's about the extent of it.
R:  [MN] I watched one that was filmed in, ah, I think it was Belize and it was called, it wasn't Fantasy Island but it was something like Fantasy Island.  The name, not the show.
L:  Okay, I, ah --
R:  Ah --
L:  Doesn't ring a bell with me.  As I say, I probably seen, oh, maybe a few minutes of, ah, one of the first few Survivors but that was about the extent of it.  And I did read something here very recently that they're -- they're talking about a, ah, whole network on Sur- -- ah, reality TV.
R:  Oh, you're kidding --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like a cable channel?
L:  Ah, yup.  Just exactly like that.
R:  Right now, w- -- instead of having Animal Planet we'll have E- Erotica Planet or --
L:  [LAUGH]  Who knows?
R:  -- Exotica Planet.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  No, I think -- I think they're overdoing it.  [MN]  But apparently it must work.  They must make money for the networks.  They -- I guess they wouldn't, ah, put 'em on otherwise.
R:  [MN] Well, you know, when you consider that somebody like Anna Nicole Smith can have her own, ah --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- her own channel or --
L:  Yep.  [COUGH] 
R:  -- her own program.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH] 
R:  Then you think anything's possible.
L:  Well, that's it, the junk they put on television, ah, is, ah, is -- is unbelievable at times.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it really is and I -- I, you know, I think that the cable industry makes a mistake by not giving you a, like, a cafeteria plan where you can go in and pick what you want and pay accordingly --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- or let you pay by show.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, w- we do have that up here.
R:  Do you really
L:  There -- it's almost like a pay per view.  Yes.
R:  So, what could you get?  I mean, can you get these, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- these, ah, reality shows or ...?
L:  Well, I don't know if you can get that.  The -- the -- the biggest, ah, group utilizing that are the real sports fans and that.  Th- --
R:  Yeah, well, we have pay for view where you can get blocks of sports and blocks of movies and order this and that but, [MN] you know, I'd like it so I could order if [MN] [COUGH], pardon me, if I wanted to watch reality shows which I -- I don't, um, but I could, you know, dial in like you do a sports show.
L:  [MN]
R:  And pay for it and if, then if a week later I want to watch something on the history channel dial it and pay for it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  [MN]  Well, as I say, something similar to that in sports a- and there are some other programs but I -- some of the other types of programs it just doesn't ring a bell to me right now.
R:  So, why do you think that the viewing public likes this salacious kind of garbage?
L:  [MN] I don't know.  It's beyond me.  You know, after you -- you watch one of them they're pretty much the same, in my opinion.  [MN]
R:  Have you seen the previous or the latest one where all these, I -- I think it's like twenty or twenty five men and they all wear different colored masks?
L:  [MN] Oh, yes, yes, yes.
R:  And one woman.
L:  Yeah, I did see the preview for that, yeah.
R:  Who would wanna make time with someone wearing a mask.
L:  [LAUGH]  Who knows?  Who knows?  But there's gotta be money in th- -- in it for these contestants and everything so, ah, I guess that's what the real motivation is.
R:  Yeah, well, now you know why the -- the Islamic culture thinks that we're degenerate.  We are.  
L:  Well, we are in a way is right, exactly.
R:  Yeah, we are.
L:  Yep.  Just out for the --
R:  And it's pitiful.
L:  Just out for the thrill of it a lot of times.
R:  On the other hand, if I got a chance to participate in one of those shows I'd probably do it.  
L:  I probably would too if, you -- you know, you d -- you put enough money [inaudible] to make sure.
R:  Yeah, well, that's part of the problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's greed, you know.
L:  Well, it's that do- -- motivated by the almighty dollar is right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's the same as those guys in, ah, Iraq that found those big boxes of money.
L:  Exactly.
R:  There were some that just couldn't keep their hands off of it.
L:  Oh, that w- w- -- I mean, w- -- I often say to myself, what would I have done, [MN] you know, in that situation.  Would I stash a few hundreds away or a few bundles away?  Oh, you- you'd think about it, that's for sure.
R:  I wouldn't say I wouldn't do it or I wouldn't say I would.  Ah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- I'm not that, ah, rigid that I'd say absolutely I'd never do it but --
L:  Oh, I w- -- I wouldn't say that either.  It's like, you know, if you were driving down a freeway and, ah, there were an armored truck in front of you and a bag fell off of it, what would you do?  And that happens --
R:  [MN] Hijack the truck.
L:  -- every so often, you know, you see it in the newspaper.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I mean one never knows what one will do till one's tempted.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  So, i- is this something new to you?  This telephone thing?
L:  Yeah, matter of fact, my wife, ah, somehow she found it on a -- on a website and she signed up for it and she says, "Hey, you know, Tom, go ahead and, you know, I'll sign you up", so she signed me up on it and, ah, bingo, here's the call.
R:  Well, who are the people behind it?
L:  Well, it's the University of Pennsylvania, I understand, the ling- linguistic group, ah, from Penn State.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, University of Pennsylvania, not Penn State.
R:  In Philadelphia?
L:  I believe it -- it is in Philly, yes.  
R:  Yeah, can you imagine an Ivy League school wanting to know why people watch, ah, these kind of shows?
L:  Well, y- -- I don't think the University of Pennsylvania is considered Ivy League.  Penn State would probably be more in the -- in the Ivy League.
R:  No, it's the other way around.
L:  Is it?  Is it really?  No kidding?
R:  Yeah, really, that really is an Ivy League school.
L:  Oh, no kidding?  I was not aware of that.
R:  Ahah, yeah, along with Brown and Harvard and --
L:  Yep, yeah and, yeah, and who knows else, yeah.
R:  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, it's kind of like, who cares but, ah, you know ...
L:  [MN]
R:  What do you do in your real life?
L:  I am a, ah, salesman for, a sales manager actually, ah, for a company in Skaneateles, New York, which is about twenty miles from here.
R:  Skinnyapolis?
L:  Skaneateles.  Ah, w- -- this region --
R:  Oh, Atlas?
L:  Skaneateles, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a, ah, lot of old Indian names here.  Skaneateles means deep lake.  We're in what we call the Finger Lakes district --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of New York.  It's -- it's -- it's a pretty section, it really is.
R:  Do you have any Loch Ness type monsters up there?
L:  Ah, not that I have -- aware of, no, no.  [COUGH] 
R:  Now, wouldn't that be interesting?
L:  Wouldn't it?
R:  To have twenty Loch Ness monsters male and one female --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and see -- see which one she picked.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, it [inaudible] similar to s- some of these reality TV shows, right?
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Where does the word reality come from, by the way?
L:  I don't know what the derivation of it is.  I really don't.
R:  I mean, is that any more real jut because it's real life, I guess, and not actors?  If that's --
L:  Means, I, you know, ah, that's a good question.  I don't know how that -- how that in -- -- you know, originated and why do they call it reality?
R:  You know, it's almost like the old Roman sports, isn't it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, almost.  [MN]  Well, I wouldn't say it's like the -- we- -- somewhat similar to the coliseum, maybe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  [COUGH]  Somewhat.
R:  And -- and it always cracks me up the way you see these people on TV afterward trying to make, ah, the big career for themselves and there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was one gal on this one show I watched, she was a redhead and, ah, the w- -- I should say the one and only one that I watched from beginning to end, she was a real good looking redhead and she sang country and western music [MN] and, ah, she got on, oh, who is that creep?  Howard Stern?
L:  Oh, yeah, I can't tolerate him.
R:  She got on the Howard Stern Show and someone called up from one of the big recording studios and offered her a two year contract but they said you'll have to change your hair and we'll have to do a little dubbing with the music, blah, blah, blah --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and big dollars and she said, "Oh, absolutely not, I would never change anything about myself", you know.  And I thought well, you sure did on that show.
L:  Boy, yeah.  [MN] W- -- you -- with the one show you were talking about with the, ah, the twenty men and-- and the mask and everything, isn't Monica Lewinsky somehow in on that one or she's on --
R:  Yeah, she's -- she's hosting the thing.
L:  She is hosting it, okay.
R:  Ahah.  Ahah.
L:  [MN]
R:  She's a good looking woman.
L:  Well, she's -- she's -- she's lost a considerable amount of weight.  She -- she looks much better than --
R:  Yeah, well, she gained a little bit of it back too.
L:  Oh, has she?  Oh.
R:  I wonder if she's sitting at home reading Hilary's book.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Talk about reality.
L:  Oh, th- --oh, reality, you know, she -- New York State, where I'm calling from and that, we have her wonderful Hilary here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you vote for her?
L:  Oh, God, no. [MN] No, I didn't.  
R:  She is --
L:  No, she was [MN] pretty much -- ah, New York City runs the state for all intents and purposes and that's heavily Democratic and, of course [inaudible] --
R:  Is -- is the rest of the state as heavily populated?
L:  [MN]  Oh, no, no, no way.
R:  I mean, there's -- what do you have?  You have Schenectady, you have Syracuse ...
L:  Well, you get -- you get -- the big ones would be, after New York City, would be, ah, [MN] Buffalo --
R:  Albany.
L:  -- Albany, Syracuse and Rochester.
R:  [MN]
L:  Just really about four cities -- and Yonkers, which is immediately outside of New York City.
R:  So, even if all of you got together, there's no way you could overcome --
L:  No, no, there'd be probably, I want to say seventy five, seventy, seventy five percent of the population is in the metropolitan New York area.
R:  Well, why don't you kick New York City out of the state.
L:  Well, we tried to do that.  We have, ah, there- there's always talk about that in, ah, what we call the upstate arena but it'll never happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [inaudible] constantly go down to New York, New York City.
R:  That's kinda like they do in California where they try to separate it into three parts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, a- actually the only thing that's gonna separate that in three parts is an earthquake.
L:  That's right.  The San Andreas fault, exactly.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  You know, and those reality shows must just cost a fortune to put on unless, like the one I watched -- it -- it -- it was in this just super resort in Belize [LIPSMACK] and, ah, I know for a fact that you spent three hundred dollars a night there just for a suite and, ah, you know, unless they -- they, ah, volunteer their facilities just to get the publicity
