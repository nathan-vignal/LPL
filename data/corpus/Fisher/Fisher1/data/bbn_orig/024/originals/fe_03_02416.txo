L:  My name is, ah, Marilyn and I -- I feel that the topic of the day should be, ah, not exercising enough.
R:  Okay, um, my --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- name is Carrie.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  Is there anybody else on here or is it just the two of us?
L:  It's just the two of us.
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Um, what -- I didn't hear the next to the last choice, did you?
L:  Oh, smoking, a- drinking, a- a- 
R:  Okay.  Excessive caffeine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gossiping and not exercising.
L:  Right.
R:  And was there --
L:  Overeating.
R:  -- one more?
L:  Overeating.
R:  Reading?
L:  Overeating.
R:  Oh, over eating.  Okay.  Um, gosh -- 
L:  Yep, can -- can -- can you hang.  Just a second.
R:  Sure.  [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, I, um, well a- I -- I, ah, just feel that way because I think, ah, exercising's something everybody can do.  It doesn't -- 
R:  Yeah, well, sometimes not everybody.  I mean --
L:  No, I mean, not everybody can.
R:  -- I mean, I guess it depends on what kind of exercise.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I'm just talking about a simple walk.
R:  Yeah, a simple walk, I think -- I think so.  I think it's good to get out and do that.  I don't know.  I'm going to say maybe the worst would mainly be gossiping.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- ex- excessive gossiping.  You know, every now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then you've got to same something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I just think, some people go overboard.
L:  I do too.  What -- what region are you from?
R:  Um, well, I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Oh, California.
R:  Oh, okay.  Good.  So, do you -- do you exercise regularly?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I mean, we --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- go on walks in the evenings.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have to say that's about --
L:  I walk every day.
R:  -- the extent of that for me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you walk -- do you walk every day?
L:  Ah, yeah, just about.  Um ... and --
R:  I've always wanted to be the kind of person that, like, gets up and works out.  But, I just -- I don't know, I just don't do that.  [LAUGH] I wish I did.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I used to -- 
R:  But, I do enjoy -- it -- it makes a big difference when you just get out, you know, in the fresh air --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and walk for a little while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It makes you feel so much better -- 
L:  I really does.  It really does.  Like now, I know, I understand people and a lot of people can't do it because I see these elderly people and it looks like they can barely walk --  
R:  I know.
L:  [several inaudible words] it's so sad.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  You know.  Mm.
R:  It is sad 'cause they -- if they cared then they probably could feel better.  But, unfortunately -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can't.  Now, gossiping -- if you can talk, you can gossip.  Um, ah -- 
L:  I don't -- I don't really like it either.
R:  What I don't like is when people do it every time someone from the group is gone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, whoever's not there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is going to be talked about.  I don't, like, appreciate that.
L:  Mhm.  I don't either.
R:  You know, I used to work at a place that every time whoever wasn't at the lunch by day was going to get talked about.  So -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you kind of felt like you had to go to lunch or you're going to get talked about, sort of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that -- that kind of bothers me.  But -- 
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.
R:  I mean, I -- 
L:  It's like people are two faced because they're, um, you know, they're -- first they're talking to the person and then they talk behind their back and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not right.
R:  I try to -- I mean, I'm -- I'm not going to say I never do it 'cause of course I do, you know, I'm human.  But -- but, I'm -- I trust try to -- um, I try and I, like I said I, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't always succeed but I try to -- whatever I say to someone, only say whatever I would also say to that person's face.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I just don't like gossiping of all those things.
L:  Mhm.  Me neither.  Terrible.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We could discuss all of them, we could.
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Smoking, no, I don't know.
R:  I've never been a smoker.  I don't --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- I mean -- 
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- I don't think badly of people that do it.  But -- 
L:  No, I don't either.  They're addicted and -- 
R:  They say it's harder to quit smoking than it is to quit drinking.  That's what I've heard.
L:  It's what?  
R:  I've heard --
L:  Harder -- 
R:  -- that it's actually harder to quit smoking than it is to quit drinking.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.  Yeah -- 
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  -- I've heard that too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, ah, now is the new [several inaudible words] of invention of nicotine gum [LAUGH] nicorette gum or whatever it is.  Um -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- is that what is it, or the patch and -- 
R:  Yeah, they have all kinds of stuff now.
L:  -- there's all kinds of ways -- huh?
R:  And it seems like not -- I mean, I don't know, I could be wrong.  It just could be that I'm looking at it from a different perspective than when I was younger.  But, it seems like not as many people do that now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Smoking -- but I don't know.  You know?
L:  Um -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- how -- so, how are we going to -- are they going to send us our cheque? [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  I need to call them because, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I signed up it brought up my summary of my information and it -- half of it was wrong.  It gave another girl's name.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So, I don't even know if they have my information on there.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh, [inaudible].
R:  I am not sure how that works.  Did you -- 
L:  You get it through Craig's list?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  On the internet -- you got it through the internet?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Craig's list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Well, I don't know if it's Craig's list but -- 
L:  Just last night.  It's so quick.  I didn't know when it would start.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I signed up last night.  I wasn't really expecting them to --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- call tonight.  But, um, what were the other ones?  Over -- over eating and -- 
L:  Overeating.  Yes, it's always been -- 
R:  I don't know how I feel about --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's sad.  I mean -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- ah, I don't know.  But -- 
L:  Sometimes it's the only pleasure somebody can get.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I mean, I just --
L:  You know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I know people feel differently.  Like, some people think -- well, I don't know.  I -- I just don't think that -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] some people just -- some doctors think if you're overweight you're just -- gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins and, I mean, my gosh you should be -- you know, they just don't like to deal with, ah, overweight people -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- know.  But, I just really think that some people can't help it.
L:  I know.
R:  And I know that some people think that everybody --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- can help it to a certain extent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I just think some people can't help it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's a -- you know, unless it's hereditary or -- I think it's a -- a physical problem -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for some people.  I don't think they -- they can help it.  So, um, and then let's see, caffeine.  Excessive caffeine.
L:  Mm.  Hm.  Coffee.
R:  I used to drink a lot of caf- a lot of pop during the day but now --
L:  [MN] Yes, yes --
R:  -- I try to limit it to one -- just one soda a day.
L:  -- we've all done it.  [LAUGH] Coffee, [inaudible], I can take it or leave it --  
R:  Do you drink coffee?
L:  Ah -- 
R:  Yeah, I don't like coffee.
L:  -- if it's there.  I try to just drink caf- decaf.
R:  Really?
L:  If it's there.  I don't go around -- out of my way for it, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe once a week, a half a cup.
R:  Uh-huh. Ah, yeah -- 
L:  You now?
R:  -- I used to be, when I'd wake up in the morning I'd be like, "I have to have a Pepsi right away".  But -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't have to do that anymore.  So -- 
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  On an empty stomach?
R:  I you used to, yeah.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I used to drink a lot of Pepsi.  My diet used to consist of Pepsi, chocolate chip cookies and Advil[?].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  That was several years' ago.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the caffeine is a -- it's very addictive.  I mean, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's very hard to not drink that much pop.  I mean, um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't do it--
L:  Oh, I know, because -- 
R:  -- anymore but it took a while to get over it.  It took some headaches -- 
L:  -- it's, you know, why I drink it because I need that carbonation.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe that's what it is.  I mean -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that after the, kind of --
L:  Yeah, I just -- 
R:  -- I guess carbonation, that's a good way to put it.
L:  -- I just want th- I mean, with water just doesn't do it I need some air bubbles down there.  [MN] You know?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah -- 
L:  If we feel sick if you've eaten too much and it -- you know, Seven -- Diet Seven Up works the best.
R:  Diet Seven Up?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  Oh, anything carbonated.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Just some kind of soft drink, mhm.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Some kind of refreshment.  And it seems like a good -- diet soda on a nice hot day.  It gets hot here.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever been -- 
R:  What -- 
L:  I mean, California, San Fernando Valley?
R:  -- um, oh, okay.  I've been there, I just -- I think I've been there just once.  We went to San Francisco on our honeymoon.
L:  Mm.  Oh, how neat.
R:  And it was cold.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I haven't been there in four years.
R:  Really?
L:  It's so nice [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  My husband loves it there.
L:  Oh, yeah, I do too.  Um, what part of Texas are you in? 
R:  Ah, Dallas.
L:  Mm.  That's neat.
R:  Yeah, it gets hot here too.  Humid.
L:  Mhm.  I'm sure it does.
R:  So --
L:  Um, what else -- 
R:  -- so, you think not exercising is the worst?
L:  Well -- 
R:  I mean, I don't know that any of them are --
L:  I don't know -- 
R:  -- I mean, drinking -- you know, I'd have to say drinking is probably the worst if you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an alcoholic.
L:  Because it ruins families and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's definitely the worst.  I -- 
L:  -- ruins lives.
R:  -- I would have to take back my worst.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- 
R:  -- That's worse than gossiping.
L:  -- I think I -- I think I agree with that, the drinking -- 
R:  Okay.  So, we agree.  That's good.  'Cause I mean it -- it -- 
L:  Okay.  Now we're in agreement.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] But, it's true.  Um, that's like a disease.  You know -- 
L:  It is.
R:  -- the other things are things that you can -- well, I mean, I guess --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- you could rank the importance of them or the -- 
L:  Yeah, I see that exercising is a life style.  You have -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to incorporate it.  You know, work at it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  And, um, then the, um, but the drinking -- I mean, the drinking is a lifestyle too.  They can all be lifestyles.  But, I -- I think that is the worst.  
R:  If it's -- 
L:  You know, if it affects your  -- 
R:  -- [inaudible] -- I think if it's done in excess.
L:  -- affects your family and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- so many divorces.
R:  And the kids, and -- 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Or i- i -- if you put yourself in danger and other people in danger.  And that's not good.
L:  That's right.  Mhm.  You -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- don't know what you're doing or saying.  Terrible.  Yeah.  So, have we been on the [several inaudible words]? 
R:  I don't know if they're going to cut us off?
L:  Or do they say time -- are they timing us?
R:  Oh, I -- I hope -- 
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- they're timing us otherwise we'll sit here all night and talk.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  Yeah, um, let's see, what else -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- um, what was the other one?  Overeating -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the second was exercise -- 
R:  We kind of talked about that one a little bit.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess over eating would kind of be like drinking too much.  Just don't -- you can't stop or something.  I don't know.
L:  Mm --
