R:  [MN] Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] My name's Mary.
L:  Okay, my name is Marla.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How's the weather in Ohio today?
L:  Oh, it's very, very beautiful today.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  We have rain here today.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we usually get your weather, like, the next day, you know, it --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- it comes across, you know, heads east from --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you guys.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] So, what do you like about -- do you watch reality TV?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I'm not sure which ones are considered the reality TV shows.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not a big fan of Survivor.  I've -- I've watched it, um, maybe once or twice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I- I'm trying to remember the other ones they meant.  Oh, the [MN] -- the millionaire thing.  Um, [MN] I don't really care for those.  Only because I think that's very deceptive.  I think that the women, like the -- the Joe Millionaire program, I think it -- it made women think one thing when it wasn't the truth.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, to me, if you're setting up a relationship based on lies then there really isn't anything there to base a relationship on, [MN] so I think that was not -- I -- I don't care for those kind of shows.  If you're not going to be realistic about it and be -- and actually be up front about everything then to me it's [MN] -- it's not, you know a good show.
R:  Yeah, and I think there's another one coming out like that too where it's deceptive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, whereas, you know, at least the Bachelor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's usually a rich person but, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not a lie.
L:  Well, the only thing I don't like about those though either, to me, is it's sort of, like, you're putting yourself in a position to be on display for, like, um, one person who's deciding among all these women, d- dating all of them at the same time and all that and there's nothing wrong with dating different people, I mean, if you're not married and that, I understand, that's not a problem at all, but [MN] I don't know, I just feel like that they -- they go into it with the impression, like, [MN] you know, that, um, he's only going to be with her or -- [MN] because I've seen the first one I think it was and I think that there was a lot of fighting among the women based on what they were doing when they went out on their dates and that and I think that's kind of ridiculous.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is ridiculous and the other thing is, like, p- people can't possibly get to know each other well enough --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- for him to decide anything.
L:  Especially to get married right after.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  Well, at least they're not ge- -- like that last one, that last couple there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that broke up.  That was sad.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it was.
R:  But, ah, but it's like, you know, what made her think she knew him all that well anyway?
L:  Oh, I know, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, to me, for them to get upset with each other too is kind of, like, ludicrous because they know going into that what they're putting themselves into.  I mean, it's not like they're thinking this person's only dating me.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  They know he's dating, like, thirty other women.
R:  I know.
L:  So, why would you go into that and then get into these cat fights with these other women?  [MN] 
R:  Well, it's kind of --
L:  You know ...
R:  -- interesting 'cause with the Bachelor -- I didn't -- I've never watched the Bachelor --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but from what I hear there was all this cat fighting but then I watched -- I did watch the Bachelorette.  For some reason I was into watching the Bachelorette --
L:  Yeah, I did too.
R:  -- but not the Bachelor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the guys were all, like, "Hey, man, good luck to you".
L:  [MN]  "Pick me", yeah.  [MN]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, they were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- much more understanding than the women.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, it is interesting to see the differences between men and women --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's -- it's such a goofy thing.  It's so goo- --
L:  It is, yeah.
R:  I don't know why people want to watch it so much either.  I -- I don't know why people like it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I did watch the first Survivor --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but I thought that's all they needed. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never watched another one because I'm like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why do I want to watch it over and over again?
L:  Right.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, ah, I -- I've watched -- there was a celebrity type of -- I don't know if you've caught that one or not. [MN]  Um, it was sort of like a Survivor, I think, program.  I'm not sure what the name of it was.
R:  Oh, was it that goofy one, I'm a Celebrity Get Me Outta Here?
L:  Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
R:  And the title turned me off so I didn't watch it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I've watched, like, maybe two or three of the shows --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, just because I thought it was funny some of the things they were asking them to do that -- that they were, like, freaking out about.  [MN]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I thought that was kind of funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I just -- I don't know, I think it's kind of strange to put yourself in a position ...  I wouldn't want to do that, honestly.  I wouldn't want to go to some far off place and be kind of secluded and have to deal with bugs [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  My daughter goes, "Mom, you should sign up for that".  I'm like, "Are you trying to get rid of me?"  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I'm like, "I could never do that".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that -- that's exactly what I was saying, like, "No, I don't think so".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know but for a chance for a million dollars I can see why people have -- have done it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, my God, some of the things that they've gone through.  [MN]
L:  I know.
R:  Like in the first one that girl who got, um, all those scars on her legs from being bitten by bugs and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- um, other one, you know, losing all that weight because they're starving --
L:  Right.
R:  -- out there.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is -- is Fear Factor considered one of those?
R:  Oh, it is. 
L:  It is.
R:   I've never watched it.  I- I've seen commercials for it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think I would be too grossed out to watch it.
L:  Now that one I probably watch more than the rest of them, to be honest with you.
R:  Do you watch it?  Yeah.
L:  Well, when I -- when I am around and it's on but I mean I don't make a point of having to be home for it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something.  [MN]
R:  I've never seen it.
L:  But, um, i- it's pretty, I don't know, it's pretty out there.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it -- well, it was funny because at one point they had four couples on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and two of the couples were just dating but they had been dating for, like, two or three years or something and then they had two couples that were married.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you notice -- did you happen to catch that one at all?
R:  No, no, I've never seen it.
L:  Okay, well, they put 'em in this, like -- the -- the girls were put into this encased plastic, like, box that they put in the water --
R:  Oh.
L:  --completely submerging it in the water and the men, um, had a key and they were locked in there with padlocks, three padlocks, and the men had to jump in, [MN] swim to the box and open it and let 'em out.  And then they had to catch -- grab this flag and whoever got it fastest, I guess, was, like, the winners, and two of the couples would go on --
R:  Oh, my God, I c- -- I could never do that.
L:  Well, what was so funny about it was that, you know, the ones that were dating are, like, "Oh, yeah, we can handle this, we're gonna do this", you know, kinda thing and both of the ones that were dating the men, f- -- once they got into the water it freaked 'em out and they had -- the women had to be let out from the other side because the men couldn't get 'em out.  Whereas the -- the dat- -- the one -- the ones that were married actually trusted their spouse enough that they did go down and get 'em out.  And I thought that was so funny because --
R:  Wow.
L:  A- and to me it just says a lot about being married --
R:  I guess I would trust that my husband would get me. 
L:  -- and, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's why with me I'm thinking, well, you know, if you're just dating somebody and you haven't made a commitment, to me there's still that thing there that you're not committed fully to each other.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that show really proved that and I thought that was just so interesting.
R:  That is very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I hadn't heard anything about that either.
L:  Yeah.  But um, so, that was a good episode of Fear Factor, I thought.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, there are some really, yeah, really gross ones.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, ah, oh, have you seen the -- the latest one, what was it?  There's a girl, she's dating all these gu- -- Mr. Personality.  That's it.
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that one at all.
R:  Um, there's a girl, she's picking the guys, um, without seeing what they look like.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They have to wear this thing over their head --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like -- and, um, [MN] one guy let her have it.  She dumped this -- you know, she had to say goodbye to, like, four of 'em --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and this one guy let her have it.  He took off his mask and he goes, "Oh, you're going to regret this".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my God, he was so rude.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought, what was he expecting out of this.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, you put yourself in that position so what else can you expect, like you said?
R:  I know it.
L:  I mean.
R:  Well, how about that, what was her name, um, Marla?  Was that her name?  The one that -- from Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?
L:  Ah, I'm not sure which one you mean.
R:  Um, well she got chosen and they were supposed to get -- they -- they did get married, right there at the end of the show --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then she didn't, um, want him any more.  She had a boyfriend and she really didn't want to be married to him so I couldn't figure out why she went on the show to begin with.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And it turned out the guy wasn't even really a millionaire.  I mean, he had a lot of money but he had kind of exaggerated his assets and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, that was kind of a fiasco.
L:  What about -- um, I'm not sure if these shows are the ones that are considered reality based either but what about the ones where they have couples, or not couples, but people that go into a house and, ah, s- -- they have to stay there for, like, eight weeks --
R:  Yeah, that's considered -- like Big Brother?
L:  I -- I think that's what it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm thinking of.
R:  Yeah, that's considered reality too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was kind of fun to watch.
L:  Yeah, that was probably pretty neat.  I kind of thought those were kind of neat, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except that I thought a lot of those is, when I watched them I thought some of the couples on there -- of course, well, I'm a Christian so I mean I look at things maybe different than you would [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but to me to be in that kind of environment and then just let yourself become active with other people when you're not married [MN] is just, I don't know, it's kind of weird.  I mean, and kind of set up these kind of, like -- you know prob- -- you know there's gonna be a problem if you're dating or not really dating I guess 'cause you're living there but you know what I'm saying, I mean --
R:  Oh, something could happen with one of the other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- contestants, where you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stop liking each other and stuff.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That was kind of a strange situation but, yeah, I mean, [MN] that was a neat show as far as I -- I remember.  I can't remember everybody that was on it but I thought -- there was one who had Amy on it, a blonde girl --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and a black guy, Marcus, or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- something.  You remember that one?
R:  Yeah, Marcus was like one of the girls?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was funny.  I liked that one.
R:  It was good.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it's interesting to see the different personalities and how they conflict and who gets along with who and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who's lying to who so they can win the game and ...
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  I could never do it.
L:  Oh, I couldn't.
R:  I don't think I could play the game well enough to be so
