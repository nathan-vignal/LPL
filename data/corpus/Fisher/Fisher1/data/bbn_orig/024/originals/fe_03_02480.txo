R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Vicky.
R:  Hi, this is Katherine[?].
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you from?
R:  I'm from England, but I live in LA.
L:  Oh, and you live in LA?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Knew you sounded like you were foreign.  I live in Kansas, but I spent --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- six and a half years in Germany.
R:  D- did you like it?
L:  Y- -- oh yeah, I loved Germany.  I would --
R:  Why -- how did you end up there?
L:  I was in the Army.
R:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
L:  So, that was pretty neat. [LAUGH]
R:  Cool.
L:  Okay.  So, what are we supposed to do?  This is my first time.
R:  Oh, this is my second one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so the subject th- that we have to talk about is reality shows.
L:  Okay, they were --
R:  Do you watch those?
L:  Uh, I watch that, um, didn't -- didn't they say Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I watch that one a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever watched it?
R:  I wa- -- uh, um, is that the one where there's a bunch of millionaires I saw, there was --
L:  Well --
R:  -- Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire --
L:  -- this one is --
R:  -- and -- and Who Wants --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- to be a Millionaire and [LAUGH] um, wasn't --
L:  Oh, I watch the Who Wants to be --
R:  Joe Millionaire --
L:  -- a Millionaire.
R:  -- or something?
L:  Yeah, where they answer questions and then --
R:  Yeah, I watched that one.
L:  I think that's pretty neat.  I mean -- but I don't understand how these people get chosen for it.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, I like watching that one because I like trying to answer the questions, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't watch the other ones, do you?
L:  I've watched it, I think once or twice, but that -- I mean, it's like -- the -- it's like the girls are just trying to marry some guy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's rich.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're letting these, uh, whoever puts the thing on, they let them pick out the rich guy and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they're going -- they're trying to get his money.  It's like, "Jeeze, ladies".
R:  So, you don't like it, huh?
L:  No, I --
R:  No, I don't like it.  It's like all those shows, it's, like, I don't get it, because they're so popular, but to me it's not interesting.
L:  No, to me either, because to me i- it's, I don't know, i- i- it's like a premade date, but it's -- I don't know, 'cause to me those are just money grabbers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that are going for those guys.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I was watching a little tiny bit of the, uh, Bachelor show last night.  I just watched, like, the last five minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this -- I guess the guy, he's like a millionaire or something.  [MN] Do -- do you watch that?
L:  No.
R:  And, um, he has a bunch of girls and he has to pick -- he -- he gets rid of one at a time that he doesn't like, and this one girl, she got kicked off and she was crying and was so upset and everything, and I was, like, what -- that's just so stupid because, you know, she -- h- how can she, like, be in love with the guy or something, you know?  It's just some guy that the producers have picked out and, you know, she's probably just known him for, like, a couple of weeks or something, and she's all crying, like he's the love of her life or something.  I'm sure she's just interested in his money.
L:  I know and --
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  -- it's, like, he -- he must not have been interested or he wouldn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have gotten rid of her.
R:  I know.  And then it's, like, he -- he's -- and then they show the clip from next week's show or whatever and he was, like, kissing every one of them at different times, and I'm, like, "How could they be interested?"  I mean, they know he's, like, going off on a date with the other girl and making out with them, whatever, and then the next night, it's the -- the next girl, whatever [LAUGH] and they're all still interested in him.
L:  I know.  I --
R:  So, I guess it's for the money, huh?
L:  It's gotta be, because, I mean, I wouldn't wanna guy that's sitting there kissing on another --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fifteen girls in, like, the same week that he's kissing on me.
R:  Yeah, it's horrible, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess they, uh, they just want the money or -- or they just wanna win or whatever, you know?  They don't want to be embarrassed on TV or whatever by getting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kicked off, so they -- they're just acting like they really like him or whatever, but --
L:  I know, but I'm like you, I think it's just the money and I think if he would happen to marry one of 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think he'd make 'em sign a prenuptial agreement --
R:  Yeah.  And I'm sure it probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wouldn't last e- either.
L:  And I bet they wouldn't want to marry him then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they might, because they might be able keep him happy long enough to get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- of his money, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Get some jewellery --
R:  'Cause they probably wouldn't care really, they'd be just running around with -- spending his money and not really [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I can see that.
R:  -- having, like, a real marriage or anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But did you --
L:  But --
R:  -- see that, um, one called, um, Married by America?
L:  What's it called?
R:  Married by America.
L:  No.
R:  It was -- it was really bad.  It was, like, they, um, they had these, like, five single people and then they had this other group of single people and they had, um, they picked, like, five people for each of the five singles, you know?  And then, um, they -- their family and friends picked two out of those five, so they were ba- basically left with a choice of two people for each si- -- each of the five singles, and then, um, the five singles didn't get to see any of the people or meet them, and then, uh, people had to call in on the phone [LAUGH] and, um, choose which one they liked the best, you know what I mean?  So, it was like America got to choose which one that they were going to end up with.
L:  Oh, you're kidding.
R:  And then they had to actually propose to them on the show without even seeing them, like, propose to 'em through a screen, and then that was it, they were engaged before they'd even met.
L:  You're kidding.
R:  It was crazy, and I didn't watch the rest of it, 'cause then I guess on the following weeks they showed 'em, like, living together and whether they got along or whatever, but I didn't watch it, I just saw that first one and I thought, "No, this is terrible, this is --" you know?  That's just so --
L:  I mean, that's even worse than the money hungry ladies.
R:  Yeah, that's like just totally making a mockery of marriage, really, isn't it? [LAUGH] It's, like, [LAUGH] it's --
L:  Well, in a way, it's similar to the way they do, like, in -- isn't in China or somewhere --
R:  Yeah, I guess, huh?  They --
L:  They prearrange --
R:  The arranged marriage.
L:  -- but then the families do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not -- 
R:  But this is, like, people calling in on a phone and dialing the eight hundred number or whatever [LAUGH] and saying, "Okay, this is the person you're going to marry [LAUGH] and spend the rest of your life with" so, it's kind of crazy.  I just thought it was terrible.  Like a -- I don't see how any of those marriages could last, really. 
L:  I don't even understand how they could get married in the first place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, who would marry somebody they'd never met?
R:  I kn- know.
L:  I mean, I can understand if it was your custom and your country.
R:  Yeah, and like, why are they doing it, do you know what I mean?  I guess because they wanna be on TV and -- in probably --
L:  I bet they don't actually get married.
R:  Yeah.  I bet they don't, or if they do, it's going to be terrible, probably, they're going to be, you know, it's not going to last, it's going to be a big mistake.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I'm sure there was a big money prize at the end of it or something as well, because I don't see why else they would be doing it, you know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's --
L:  It's just so goofy.  I n- never even heard of that one.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess I don't watch enough -- computer --
R:  You didn't miss anything, trust me. [LAUGH]
L:  I spend too much time on the computer, so I don't watch enough TV.
R:  Yeah, I don't watch any of these reality shows, really.  I've seen, like, a -- I'll see, like, maybe half or a quarter of an episode of one 'em and I'm, like, "Oh my God, this is terrible" and then I change the channel, you know?  But, like, everywhere I go, all my friends are talking about it, "Oh, did you see, you know, The Bachelor last night?" and, "Did you see --" whatever other one was, o- oh, American Idol.  Do you watch that?
L:  No, I don't --
R:  So, everybody's talking about it.
L:  No, I like the one with the little kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, have you seen that one?
R:  I didn't see that one.  I -- no.
L:  Oh, my God, they had a four year old boy who played a piano --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like a concert pianist.
R:  Oh, that's amazing, huh?
L:  And he was four years old.  I'm, like, 'cause when he got up there on the bench, I'm thinking, "This kid's so little, you know, he's not going to be able to do anything" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he was so good.
R:  Oh, my God.  I wonder how he learnt to do that?
L:  I don't know.  They said -- I think he started playing at two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  But you would even imagine that his little fingers would be able to, like, do that, huh?
L:  Oh, I know.  Now, that one is good.  That's one that I do like.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'll -- I'll have to check that one out then.
L:  Yeah, it's just little kids, though, and they divide 'em up by a- age categories.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's, like --
R:  And they're really good?
L:  -- it's, like, four to seven year old and then, like, eight to eleven and then, like, twelve to seventeen or something.
R:  Yeah, I saw it advertised, but I didn't think that all the kids would be that good, though.  So, they're really good?
L:  They're really good.
R:  Wow.
L:  I think they're better than, um, than the ones on the real one.
R:  The -- wow. [LAUGH]
L:  But, now, see, I like to watch that real show only because that one guy, I can't think of his name, he's got the dark hair, one of the judges?
R:  What, Simon?
L:  Yeah, Simon.
R:  The British guy?
L:  I -- yeah, I love to hear him kill those people.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I [MN]-- 
R:  I've never really watched it, but I've heard, ah, yeah, yeah, I've seen, like, little clips and stuff and commercials or whatever, and he's really mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- huh? So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, he -- he gets down and dirty, he, like, he --
R:  So, you like that? [LAUGH]
L:  He, like, he, like, says, "You know, I hope you didn't quit your job, because you need it --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you can't sing".
R:  I heard he was really mean.  I -- I think some of the people though, they can't sing though, huh?
L:  He is, but he's honest.  Huh?
R:  And they think that -- that some of the people, they can't sing and they think they can, for some reason, you know?
L:  Oh, I watched them when they did the, um, the tryouts and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- showed some clips of 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some of these people sang as bad as I did.
R:  Yeah -- yeah, and, like, what made them think that they could do it, you know, and that they should be going on the show, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they had a -- I've watched -- I've watched it a couple of times, only because I like Simon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there was this one, uh, I think they were brothers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they really got into it with Simon and said, "Well, your opinion doesn't count.  Just who do you think you are?  You don't know anything".
R:  [LAUGH] And what did he say?
L:  And he was, like, "Well, look, I'm telling you, you don't have it" and the guy's saying, "You don't know anything.  We know we do have it".
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And I mean, they kept going on and on and, I mean --
R:  A- and so they were really bad?
L:  They weren't --
R:  They couldn't sing?
L:  -- really bad, but they weren't [SIGH] -- they weren't any better than a high school choir.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  So, they were nothing special, huh?
L:  Yeah, and I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- even the other two judges agreed with Simon --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I figured, "Well, if all three of 'em think it".
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I mean, some --
R:  -- what -- what did they do in the end?  Did they have to, like, drag 'em off the stage or something? [LAUGH]
L:  No, they finally le
