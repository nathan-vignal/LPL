R:  Hi, my name is Kimberley Charmaine[?].
L:  Kimberley. [PAUSE] Are you there?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Hi, my name's Avalon. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Hi, Avalon.
L:  Uh, have you participated in the Fisher Project before?
R:  No, I have not.
L:  Well, we get to talk for ten minutes, and the topic today is reality TV, and we'll go back and forth and talk about things like, do you watch this -- this genre of television, and if so, which shows, and why do you think it's so popular?
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you watch reality TV?
R:  Some of it I do.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  So- some shows I do.  Yes, I do.
L:  Which ones do you like to watch?
R:  Ah, I've watched, um, [LIPSMACK] the one that's on, let's see, Tuesday and Wednesday night on Fox, it's called American Idol.
L:  Really?
R:  And also the one that's on Wednesday nights on ABC, um, I have to think of the names, [LAUGH] um, [LIPSMACK] um, the one with the guy and the twenty four girls and then he gets, I don't know, engaged at the end, um --
L:  Something about a bachelor?
R:  Yeah, The Bachelor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Bachelor.  The Bachelor and Bachelorette.
L:  What about Survivor on CBS?
R:  I -- I watched that when it first came out, [LIPSMACK] and I haven't been following it.
L:  Oh, it's gotten better and better. [MN] [LIPSMACK] Uh, I didn't watch it when it first came out, and I got hooked on it, I think about the third time they did it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've been hooked ever since.
R:  [LAUGH] I think once I start, yeah, once I start I'm -- I'd probably be hooked if I started again.
L:  Yeah.  Which one is your favorite?
R:  Ah, I would say --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- The Bachelor or The Bachelorette.
L:  Are there any others besides those?
R:  And then Ame- -- and then American Idol.
L:  Yeah.  Besides those?
R:  Yeah, uh, I'm trying to think if there's any other ones, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Jamie K- -- I don't know if you could call Jamie Kennedy really a reality show, but it seems like his -- y- you know, he pulls these stunts that are, you know, where people are fooled, you know, it's not --
L:  What --
R:  -- it's not like a sitcom or anything like that.
L:  What station is that, or network is that on?
R:  Ah, Jamie Kennedy Experiment is Channel five and it's on Thursday nights, it's on tonight for an hour, in two episodes.
L:  Is it on a network or --
R:  Ah, Channel five, it's called the WB -- the WB network.
L:  Huh.
R:  Warner Brothers.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN] Well, we're on satell- [COUGH] satellite dish, we live way out in the middle of nowhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I recognize some of these, but not all of them.  Okay, tell me why you like reality TV.  What got you engaged in it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or involved? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think most of it silly, actually, [LAUGH] 'cause a lot of the people that -- that go on it are kind of s- -- kind of til- -- silly and attention starved or [NOISE] um, but then, some of it's just -- it's just, you know, if there's nothing better on TV to watch, y- you -- you watch it while you're doing other things, you know, and you have something to talk about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the next day with your friends, you know, or your friends are watching it and they try to get you to watch, you know, so then you agree to watch it and then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know how you just kinda, you know, you have something to talk about week to week.
L:  Well, I've --
R:  What about you? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I really like Survivor a lot, but when we moved back out here, we couldn't get CBS --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] uh, they changed the satellite dish reception --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we're supposed to get it from the local broadcaster sixty five miles away, [LIPSMACK] which would work if I had a second TV or if I -- or engineering -- engineering minded enough to get my dish and the antennae on the TV to both work.  But I'm not yet, so I've been missing [SIGH] Survivor a lot, but, [LIPSMACK] oh well, life goes on. [MN]
R:  Do -- do --
L:  But --
R:  Oh, do you have Tivo.  You can --
L:  No.
R:  -- you can't record 'em?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah, I don't have that either.
L:  No, I -- I'd have to get 'em in order to record 'em --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- I just don't get the networks.  I get everything else on the satellite dish --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- can get excellent reception and with the antennae, we d- -- we don't get good reception.
R:  Hm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Have you ever watched, um, the Anna Nicole show?
R:  [SIGH] Yes, actually, yes, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Doesn't that make you feel good about yourself?
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I was saying, like, silly, like a lot of 'em are just kinda -- they're -- I mean, they're funny, but they're -- they're -- you know, they can get -- they -- or the other one, the k- -- ah, you know who I'm thinking of, the O- -- the Osbournes, yeah.
L:  The Osbournes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never watched them.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] The dogs, you know, those dogs running around.
L:  Well, the Anna Nicole thing, because I live in Texas, in case you couldn't pick it from the accent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] I watched a few of those shows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she reminds me of some of these good old girls that I've met in -- in Texas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that -- if -- if her IQ was any lower, you'd have to water 'em twice a week. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they married for money, you know?  And they luck out, because they've got big chi chis[?].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she's just -- [MN] she's almost a parody of herself.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and I've watched it a couple of times, but it moves so slowly, I get out of patience and go onto something else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But what's scary, you know, I -- when I've seen bits and pieces of that, I think, "My God, there are people who really watch that".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It makes me wonder about them. [LAUGH] But --
R:  I guess they don't get enough d- -- you know, during the day, all these -- there's all these reality -- these talk shows, you know?  I guess they figured there wasn't enough of that on TV.  Now they're making -- it's, like, almost all TV is becoming reality TV.
L:  Why do you think it's so popular?
R:  I -- yeah. [SIGH] God, I -- I don't know.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, voyeurism comes to mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I -- I don't want to be anybody but me, I --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  -- I'm a pow wow[?] dancer and I've -- my hair has gotten white now in places and what's not white or graying is blond --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] [LIPSMACK] um, I'm fair complected in the winter time, in the summer time I get real brown real easy, but when I go to pow wows, I have two -- two long braids, so only the white parts show after the braid ties are on -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I look like somebody's Indian grandmother ghost --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or ghost grandmother and I pointed out one time to a little gal that made a snippy remark, di- digressing from reality TV, this is my real life, but, uh, she didn't like these white folks coming in, you know, one of these.  Well, it was a contest pow wow and I beat out all of the other grandmothers in my division except one, and I pointed out, "Well, I'm not a wannabe", you know?  I really am part Chachow[?] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I don't want to be anything but what I am and I'd rather watch my own life than watch somebody else's life, 'cause mine's a whole lot more interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  E- except for Survivor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think it's real intriguing.
R:  Yeah, I think the first one got a lot of buzz, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kinda like when, uh, was it -- that Who Wants to be a Millionaire, when that came out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was, you know, real popular, people were glued to that, was -- it seemed like it was on a lot more.  Now -- now I don't -- I don't really talk to anybody who watches it.
L:  Well, I wouldn't be interested in that unless I was one of the contestants, and then I'd be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- real interested.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And real competitive.  I wonder what the audience profile is for reality shows, if it's more women than men.  Have you ever heard?
R:  Uh, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  That's a good question.
L:  Well, the reason that -- the reason that came to mind, I was thinking I'd rather watch paint dry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that watch reality TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause my life is really interesting.  At -- at -- least it keeps me going. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I've -- I've seen men that would just get absorbed in sports and I would think, "Why wouldn't you rather be out playing sports?" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why watch somebody doing something?
R:  It's like decompre- -- I think it's like decompression time.
L:  You reckon?
R:  Pr- -- at least the sports is, you know, it's like their cave, they go into their cave and they just forget about what they did all day long and you get kind of absorbed in someone else's life and people like to have people trophies.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know?  So --
L:  Well, that's a thought.
R:  -- they can just see their -- the people they idolize on -- on TV, whatever, playing sports.
L:  Well, that's something else I don't do.  I've never been able to find any idols that didn't have clay feet. [SIGH] I -- but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- when you talk about decompression, [MN] first of all, my life is not real, real stressful, 'cause I -- I can do pretty well what I want to, but I do a -- a -- an Oriental exercise every day called Shagong[?] and that just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- makes stress non existent in your life.  I mean, it just --
R:  I have heard of that.
L:  It is wonderful stuff.  If you ever have a chance to learn it or take it up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I think everybody ought to do Shagong and then they wouldn't have any stress and they wouldn't need to decompress. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I think I'll pay more attention to that, 'cause I know I have a file at home on it, and I -- I remember reading up on it, and it did seem very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm certainly much more open, I think, than the average person to all these different modalities and therapies.  So --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I got a book, and I can't recall the author's name right off, 'cause I got it several years, the Eight Eas- -- Easy Movements, or the Eight Pieces of Bro- Brocade, and it's, uh, called Shagong for Beginners and [SIGH] it has a lot of pictures in it, and you can look at them, you know, and take -- it shows you how to take each move until you get it memorized and -- and then do 'em, but there's an awful lot of information out there on -- on Shagong, [NOISE] and --
R:  So, you do ten minutes of that a day?
L:  Well, the guy that wrote this book says you can do it in ten minutes a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I usually go slower and do it -- do more of each move for, like, twenty minutes, and I do a ten minute warm up before.  He's a PhD and I don't have his book handy, I just got the Shagong catalogue handy, and our time's going to be up, and the computer will say that our time is also up and we've gotten --
R:  [LAUGH] This is --
