L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is interesting.
R:  Uh, I know.  I'm kinda -- I was kinda nervous.  It's like, uh. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what's going on at first but now I understand. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think I do too.
L:  I thought I was just gonna talk to a machine. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I thought so too.  I thought, okay, do I just answer the machine or what?
L:  Okay.  What is your name?
R:  Deanne.  What's yours?
L:  I'm Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um.
L:  Where are you -- where are you at? [MN]
R:  W- where am I at?
L:  Yes.
R:  In Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Florida. [LAUGH] 
R:  Florida?  Oh, how nice.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I bet y'all are having some pretty weather.
L:  Yeah, well, some rain. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Some rain?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, so what are we supposed to talk on?  Um, reality TV?
L:  We're supposed to -- reality shows, yeah.
R:  Do you watch reality TV?
L:  Um, I watch a couple of 'em.  I watch -- I don't know if American Idol is considered one of 'em.
R:  I think it would be.
L:  Okay, I watch American Idol and I watch, um, Survivor.
R:  Survivor.  See, I have never gotten into Survivor but, ah --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I watch the Bachelor. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, the Bachelor. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's my big ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, um, I'm not so into this one as much as I was the past ones but, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they- they're really cool and I love American Idol.  I've gotten --
L:  I- I'm pretty addicted to American Idol.  I'm pretty addicted.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, now who's your favorite?
L:  Yeah, I think that's my favorite one and I think, um, I guess, it asks why people like it.  I know I like American Idol because, um, [MN] well, I like the arts and music --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I just really -- I really think it's a good -- I think that's the best reality show 'cause it's not -- it doesn't seem hokey.  It's -- it's really good singers and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- um, talent and art and the way the business world and the arts works, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all that kind of stuff, so ...
R:  I think it's wonderful.  I -- I love it.  I love just seeing how these kids, you know, can, you know, they get discovered even if they're in the top --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- five or six of 'em.  I mean they've done all kinds of stuff and --
L:  Yeah.  Now --
R:  I just think that's --
L:  They all have different qualities too, like, some country, some blues, some jazz.  Like, their voices are --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  I'm really enjoying listening to, um, Clay.  I think he, like, he --
L:  Yeah, he's my favorite.  [MN]
R:  I know, he's my favorite too.  I think he's so cute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hope he wins.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, yeah, I definitely like Clay and I like Ruben.
R:  Yes, I -- I --
L:  And I was surprised at last night actually.
R:  Ah, yeah, that he was in the bottom --
L:  I was really upset, yeah.  I really thought Josh should have been, um --
R:  Yeah, I think Josh thought he probably would have been. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [MN] I know.  He's ha- --
R:  That's what I heard.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, definitely.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I think, I don't think Clay's ever been in the bottom three --
L:  Uh-uh, yeah.
R:  So, that might be a good sign.
L:  That's a good sign, yeah.
R:  So, he -- he just -- he's too cute and to be -- have been put back in the wild card --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- and barely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- made it.  You know, I think that's -- I think that shows a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, now, Survivor, now, I don't -- see, I've never gotten into that.  I --
L:  I -- I used to not watch Survivor.  It just bothered me.  It kind of bothered me that people were competing for a million dollars.  It just seems kind of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- shallow to me.  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just, like, no offence, but just, like, kind of the bachelor and these married reality shows that -- everyone's watching 'em but --
R:  I know it.
L:  I -- I got into Survivor, I think it was the Australian one and I don't know, I just started watching it 'cause it was so -- what I liked best about Survivor was, um, the games, how they had them compete, not the eating bugs part.  I don't like that.
R:  Argh.
L:  But they have -- they're making it more like puzzles and using your mind and it's real interesting how things wind up or psychological games.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's what I like now about Survivor.  That's what got me involved, I guess, with watching it.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, where is it at now?  Where's -- which one -- which country or --
L:  That I might -- wait, let me ask real quick 'cause I forget.  The last one was Thailand.  Wh- where is it, the Survivor?  Oh, the Amazon.  
R:  Amazon.
L:  It's in the Amazon now.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And, yeah, the -- one guy got bit by a piranha.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Not -- a little nick, but that's what they have to eat.  They, [MN] you know --
R:  Eat piranhas?
L:  Yeah, ahah.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And, to me, it's only like [inaudible] like, where they fish but they might catch, you know, they have to catch piranha.  That was one of the, um, contests too to catch as many piranha as you could to test your fishing skills.  I- it was interesting.
R:  Oh, my.  See, I probably would get into that show if I just --
L:  Yeah, the only thing I don't like about this time, the Survivor, is that people are kind of shallow.  They're real into the girls' bodies and they're showing the girls, like, taking baths but, I mean, they're covered with their hands but it's just like, all right [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, let's get past this.  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're really trying to get the reality going.
L:  And it's that -- that annoys me but I think if -- if there is a reason why it's popular I think the guys like watching it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's my opinion.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Well, I -- I just -- I hadn't -- I just hadn't gotten into that one.  I did --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I did watch when they did the, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm a Celebrity Get Me Outta Here, that one.  I thought that was --
L:  I've never seen that.  What's that about?
R:  It -- well, it was, um, a whole bunch of celebrities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that went and stayed for [MN] [SIGH] oh, I think sixteen days or something in, Au- -- I think it was Australia in the jungle and [MN] they got voted off every night or every two nights or something by -- by the audience.
L:  Okay.
R:  They would get to vote em off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they had all kinds of challenges and things to do and, um, and then one -- whatever -- whoever won I think it went to a charity, whatever they were gonna win or something.
L:  Mhm
R:  It's kind of interesting.  It was a little cheesy but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was okay, yeah.  Um ...
L:  And you watched the Bachelor one.  Why do you -- now, why do you watch that?
R:  I wat- -- I don't know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think just to escape life for --
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  -- for a little bit.  [MN]  Um --
L:  It's a little rom- -- it's romantic too, I guess, some of the things they do and ...
R:  It was romantic.  The -- the one I really have liked the best was the Bachelorette with --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the Trista, um -- she was the first Bachelor, the one that got, um, not picked the first time.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they -- so they brought her on to do the Bachelorette.
L:  Oh, how about that?  Okay.
R:  It was really, really good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I liked it better than the Bachelors because it was twenty five men --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and men are so much more -- to me, they were just so much more debonair and they -- they just respected each other.  They weren't out to be petty and --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  You know how girls, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they just -- it was just so much more fund to watch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just enjoyed watching the men.  And they actually became really good friends --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and they were like well, if it really, um, you know, they -- they wanted the person that really fell in love with her to really be the one to win.  They weren't out to just, oh, I'm going to be the one that wins.
L:  Right.
R:  Like girls sometimes do.  Even that's what's happening on these other ones.  They're like, "Oh, I'm gonna win" --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- even if they haven't even met him yet.  You know, I'm like, "You don't even know him".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How do you know if you're gonna like him or not?  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, he might not even turn you on, you know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just looking at him.  But they're like, "Oh, I'm going to be Mrs., you know, whatever" but --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- um, so the Bachelorette to me was the -- the best one --
L:  The best, yeah.
R:  And I hope they do another one but, um, [MN] I don't know, it's just kind of nice to get away and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- i- in -- in that and just remember what it was like to date [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Before you got married.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, 'cause after that ...
L:  Right.  And I guess, ah, the reason why I think American Idol too, I think it is an escape, like, I'll -- I get it -- I get excited when we wat- -- like, me and my fiance watch and he's a singer so we really like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I'm a -- I'm a dance teacher so we watch it and it's neat watching when they go off and meet stars and --
R:  See, that's neat.
L:  -- they get their hair done and just seeing the -- it's kind of a fantasy, you know of --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- wow, look at them, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Hearing some of them are getting a star attitude.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I -- I really like American Idol.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I did not watch the first time around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I watched the very last one when Justin and Kelly were, [MN] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get- getting p- -- whoever the American Idol was gonna be, but, um ...
L:  Right.  I heard a lot of people saying that this is a better one --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I didn't see the last one.
R:  See, I didn't -- I -- I didn't watch it either.  Ah, um, just at that last part I thought, um --
L:  And, in my opinion, I actually like Simon and I might be weird but --
R:  Oh, I do too.
L:  -- I -- I like his opinions.
R:  I do too.  I think he's being honest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think the other ones are not being honest.  I think they're trying to be, you know, just sit there and --
L:  Not like --  Yeah, they're kinda nice or in a roundabout way, especially Paula.  Sometimes I don't know what's come out of her mouth [MN].
R:  Well, she probably is the dancer part of it.  I notice she says a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about dance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that maybe what she was kind of -- I know she can sing too but I know she was probably there a lot --
L:  She's more.  She was a choreographer and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To see if they can kind of do all the moves, you know --  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] in there.
L:  But I think Simon, you know, although he's harsh sometimes I like, I think he is, um, he gives the right, most of the time, gives the right opinion.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, I really --
L:  Most of the time I agree with him.
R:  I like Simon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think he -- I think he just flat out tells you like it is and I think --
L:  And he's professional.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even what he said last night because I was freaking out that Ruben was in the bottom two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was nice to hear Simon go, "Well, you know, we have to respect America and this is who -- this is what they d- -- they wanted", you know.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I was surprised he said that.  I thought he c- -- he would, like, freak out or something.  [MN]
R:  Well, I bet you, I guess Ruben was probably kind of shocked himself.
L:  Ah, yeah, and I think Ruben's gonna step it up a little 'cause I think that made him -- I think that shook him up.
R:  Shook him up a little bit?
L:  Yeah, I think, and I don't know why [MN] I don't know if it's 'cause Josh misses, not because of the war and everything but because he's a marine.  I don't know but it was just weird.  It was really strange 'cause singing -- singing wise and their voi- -- their voices, I mean, Ruben is -- is much better.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm -- I'm not real -- yeah, I wasn't really impressed with Josh.  I was kinda like, mm --
L:  Yeah.  I think he's a good kid but I don't -- I don't think he's a s- -- American Idol.  [MN]  You know.
R:  No.  I'm surprised -- I was a little surprised Trenice -- but she -- I like -- she's really done a good job.
L:  I like her sometimes.  I really liked her when she sang, um, the first song last night.  She was real -- that was really good.
R:  See, I didn't watch --
L:  And sometimes I feel like she swallows her voice, so, I don't know, it's -- it's back and forth with her.
R:  And, ah, yeah, and Kimberley's pretty --
L:  Kimberley -- Kimberley's good, I think
