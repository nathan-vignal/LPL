L:  Hi, this is Jerry, how are you?
R:  Hi, I'm Mike.
L:  Hi Mike, how are you doing?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Ah, Jersey City.
L:  Oh, I'm in [inaudible] New York
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Not too far.  So, we're talking about all these bad habits tonight, huh?
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's tough because I think I've been guilty of all of them at one point or another.
L:  [LAUGH] As have I, yes, as a matter of fact I'm still smoking, that's the bad thing, but ah --
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's the thing that's on everybody's ah, agenda right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ah --
L:  Ah, drinking -- ah, drinking's a big thing with me because um, I came, um, my father's an alcoholic --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um, he's been sober for twenty seven years now --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah, god bless him.  And ah, he's doing well, and ah, I do remember as a child though, a couple of episodes that he had and stuff like that.
R:  So, like, did that keep you away, or ...?
L:  Um, ah, yeah, I would think so, yeah, during my teenage years, I mean, I guess I was just a teenager --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but ah, now, you know, I've got my own family and everything so um, yeah, it's not ah, and ah, especially --
R:  Do you not drink a drop, or do you just ...?
L:  Oh, no, no, no, I drink socially and stuff like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but um, nothing, I don't need to have one when I come home or anything like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and I'm thankful for that because I know it can be ah, genetic sometimes.
R:  Sure.  Yeah, and it can run in families, too.
L:  Yeah, it actually did, actually on both sides, my mother's and my father's side.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah, I'm a -- I'm not a big fan of ah, DWI either so [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I've seen what it can do, um, my occupation, ah, I deal with it one on one basically, so um, it's ah, it's not a good thing.  I've seen the results of it, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's ah, one of my biggest fears ah, as a result of it, you know, my wife and my child in the car, will get hit by somebody who's been drinking or something like that, it's just --
R:  It is.  It's scary.
L:  -- the idea blows my mind, it really does.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, I mean, and -- and people it -- it's m- much more widespread, I think, than people even realize.
L:  It's far more widespread --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I mean -- I mean, in the city, you got kind of, not as much probably, but ah, if you go out into a rural or suburban area, I mean, there's r- I mean, people don't use cabs, people don't use public transportation, so --
L:  Exactly, everybody relies on their own transportation.
R:  Yeah.  And nobody designates a driver, I mean, some people do, but it's a very small percentage.
L:  Well, take a typical bar, I mean, how many -- how many people are leaving -- how many patrons leaving the bar, perfectly legal to drive?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, a very small percentage.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And, I mean --
L:  Maybe the bartender.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Possibly.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But then that's about it as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, again, it's the legal limits have come down so far, where I mean, you can't have two drinks.
L:  No.
R:  -- and drive, I mean, officially, legally --
L:  And if you think about it, if you -- if you go out, right, and you have two drinks, let's say, and you're fine to drive, you really are, but somebody hits you --
R:  -- oh -- yeah.
L:  -- just taps you in the rear and you need a police report.  Y- you're in a lot of trouble.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And ah, financially it's -- it's ridiculous what it's gonna do to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it was a car, your insurance goes up, it's crazy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, to th- it's a pretty -- pretty silly crime if you ask me.  Caffeine?  Not a big deal with me, I'm like, ah, one cup in the morning and then I'm done.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I actually stay away even more than that.  I -- I mostly drink decaf.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I've been -- I've been -- I kind of think it messes with your cycles a little bit, you know --
L:  It could, sure.
R:  -- yeah, if you get -- if you get too involved with it.  But I'll have a caffeine every once in a while, no big deal.  I just try not to be, like, every day, you know, gotta have my caffeine in the morning because --
L:  I got to admit, I like my coffee in the morning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But just one, that's all I need.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of people like that.
L:  And then ah, during the day even, ah, I drink ah, generally I'll drink soda that doesn't have caffeine in it, ah, your Diet Sprite, Diet Seven Up, that type of thing, and I don't like ah, regular colas, hm, once in a while, but i- i- it really doesn't affect me.  It won't keep me up at night.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, ah, I just prefer not to have it.
R:  Yeah, it's just one more thing in your system that you don't really need.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  It's not -- not -- not a serious thing, I don't think.
L:  No.  What -- what else did they mention?
R:  Ah, what is the worst out of all these things?
L:  The worst one [SIGH] I don't know, it -- it's ah, it's between the alcohol and smoking, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Probably.
L:  It's gotta be.
R:  For your health.
L:  Yeah, for health purposes, especially, I would say, to the public, the alcohol is more dangerous, to the individual, the smoking's more dangerous.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And ah ...
R:  Over eating though is a huge problem in America.  I mean, there's a lot of obese people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- out there.
L:  Yeah look at all the over weight people too, that's another consideration.  Luckily I'm still a size thirty four.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean, I just keep it under control.  I've just started exercising which is, um, I -- I hadn't exercised for years, really, and I just started kind of getting in the program, so it -- it's good.
L:  That -- yeah, that's a good routine for you.  I gotta do the same thing.  Um, um, the ba- our baby's ah, eleven weeks old, so it's been a little crazy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.
L:  But ah, yeah, we gotta, ah, my wife ah, belongs to the gym and she -- she hasn't been back since, but um, she's itching to go back and stuff like that, so when we get a little more routine --
R:  That's good.  That's dedication.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But I think, ah, if you make a part of your routine, then y- then you -- I -- I guess you're conditioned to either need it or like it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I know some people enjoy it, I know some people don't and -- and people will ah, in both cases they'll do it regularly anyway.
R:  Right.  
L:  And ah, I do definitely have to get back into that.  Although I work out, you know, with weights once in a while at the gym, just to -- I have to [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  That's ah, I gotta be prepared, but ah, yeah, exercise, definitely important.  But my -- my feeling would be ah, I can't decide which is worse, but ah, definitely the smoking and the drinking would be the number one and two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And everything would follow in suit from there.
R:  What do you think about the smoking ban in New York now?
L:  Ah, oh, with the restaurants and everything?
R:  You know what?  I like it.
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.  See, even with -- with my baby and everything I -- I we don't smoke in the house at all or the car --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or nowhere around him, um, change our clothes and wash our hands before he's handled, so, um, and we've -- we've nar- we used to smoke in the house but that was years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we don't do it anymore.  I -- I've quit a few times, ah, one time for a year and a half and a couple of, you know, eight months here, six months there, so I -- I'm -- I think I'm reaching my point where eventually, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- just -- it'll -- I'll hit the point where, okay, now I'm definitely stopping and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm hoping so anyway.
R:  Well, it would be nice to be able to bring the, ah, kid to the -- to a restaurant and not worry about somebody at the next table smoking.
L:  Yes.  I -- I do enjoy that, I really.  And um, even as smoker, I could say we -- we don't like sitting in the smoking section.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I -- I think it's a little tough in the bar situation, ah, I know they go hand in hand for a lot of people.
R:  I know.
L:  And I can understand the business owners going a little crazy over it, but I've got to be honest with you, we went out -- we went out to Friday's last weekend and they still had a smoking section, so I don't know how they --
R:  Did they really?
L:  Yeah, I don't know how they're getting around this.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it wasn't -- wasn't like, enclosed in glass or anything like that, it was just higher than the rest of the restaurant was.
R:  I don't know if they've started fining yet or maybe they'll wait another few months or something.
L:  You would think a chain like that would definitely --
R:  -- yeah, yeah, a chain, you would think would definitely be right --
L:  -- you know, go according to the rules, no questions asked.  But ah, it's been a tough[?] I know the smokers have rights too, but you know what, the -- the rights of those who don't smoke I think over ride that.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, my girlfriend just ah, just gave up smoking and she -- it's been so much easier for her to be able to go out and not have to see everybody smoking.
L:  Yes, that's definitely going to help her, absolutely.  I know what she's going through.
R:  So ...
L:  Good for her though, good luck to her as well.
R:  Yeah, I think in the long run it -- it's you know, it -- it'll hurt the business in the bars at first but in the long run a lot of people are going to quit smoking.
L:  Yeah, um, there's a few restaurants that we've been to around here as well, where -- where everybody's just smoking outside.
R:  Right.
L:  And ah, you know, that's it, but yeah, I was very surprised by that, you know, last week at Fridays.  It blew my -- actually, it blew my mind.
R:  Yeah, it would.
L:  But we had a couple of hours away from him so we were thrilled[?]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And ah, yeah, drinking is ah, drinking is number one, I think.  The dangers it poses to everybody else and --
R:  Yeah, excess, obviously.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, social drinking, yeah, and -- and well, the driving too is, but --
L:  Oh, the driving, yeah, but even -- even what it does ah, just to the family structure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, a couple of uncles I've had have died due to drinking.  Ah, my grandfather as well, on both sides.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So, um, and it's tough to go through, it's tough -- it's tough to see what effect it had on my mother, I, you know, I had to -- I still have memories of that, and ah, but ah, she's a strong woman and luckily my father was as well and they managed to pull through it and -- and they're both better people as a result of it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd have to say due to my family history, smoking would be the worst 'cause the heart disease on both sides of the family and then my --
L:  Is that right?
R:  -- grandmother had lung cancer, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she smoked until --
L:  How old was she?
R:  She was about early -- about -- early eighties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  An- but she smoked up until like, a year to two years before she died.
L:  Yeah.  And then once -- once they stop it's like the body goes through a change too --
R:  Oh, I know when you've been smoking for sixty years, I mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] your body needs it.
L:  It's tough, yeah, exactly.  It does -- it does build up a dependency, that's for sure.  Ah, luckily, ah, not that it's a better thing, but I don't smoke that much, maybe, a -- not even a half a pack a day at this point --
R:  Right, yeah.  Th- I mean that really helps -- ev- every -- every little bit helps, you know.
L:  Yeah, I suppose.  And ah, I smoke ultra lights, you know, like they're safer now.
R:  Right.
L:  Silly, silly.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Really is.
R:  Yeah, that's -- my girlfriend did that for the last, like, year.  She's like, well, I went down to the ultra lights --
L:  Yeah, interestingly enough they put little holes in the filter, they call it ultra lights but they're exactly the --
