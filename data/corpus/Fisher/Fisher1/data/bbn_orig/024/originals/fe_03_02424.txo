L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Virginia.  A-
R:  I'm Karen.
L:  Karen.  I'm calling from [inaudible], Texas.
R:  Oh, well, I'm in New York City.
L:  New York City, okay -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, I'm a former yankee myself.  But, I was born and raised in New York.
R:  Oh, my goodness -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- well, I'm actually from -- originally from Florida.  I've -- but, I've been here since college.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I did not get the last -- the l- l- the second before last thing before exercising.  Did you hear that?
L:  Um, caffeine, smoking, drink- alcohol, ah, overeating.
R:  Overeating.  Okay, that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [inaudible] okay.  
L:  Yeah, and -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- gossiping was one of them.
R:  And gossiping.  [LAUGH] Right -- 
L:  Yeah.  So, where do -- 
R:  -- where would we be without gossiping?  [LAUGH] --
L:  What is -- to decide which is worse, right?
R:  Which is the worst, yeah.  Which is the worst thing -- 
L:  And what do you think?
R:  I think, um, I guess I have to say smoking.
L:  Smoking.
R:  Although overeating is in there, plus smoking, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, why do you say smoking?
R:  Because I think it's the -- the one thing that has been seemingly, um, a- medical evidence that seems to show that it's harmful for many, many people.  And it's hard to counteract it.  Like, if you overeat you can exercise.  If you don't exercise -- some people it never bothers -- I don't like -- for everything else it seems -- seemingly like there's, you know, somewhere that to -- to counter -- counteract it.  Um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I don't see any counteraction to tobacco.  You're just lucky whether you, you know, whether you, ah, have the gene that takes it into -- into stroke, cancer, heart attack, whatever.  So, what do you think?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I probably will take alcohol.  But, I -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I agree with you to some extent on smoking because my husband smoked all his life and he had -- ended up with, ah, emphysema -- 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and then cancer of the lung which -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- he, ah, he didn't live very long after he was diagnosed with that.
R:  Oh, my goodness -- 
L:  And, ah, you know -- 
R:  -- that's to bad.
L:  -- a- and he probably would have lived for, um, several years if it hadn't been for that.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because it -- it definitely ruined his lungs.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And you know, you can't replace lungs.
R:  No.  No -- 
L:  But, I also, um, I -- I don't l- like alcohol -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- no -- ah, this, ah, programme didn't say to what extent -- 
R:  No, no -- 
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- that is sort of, um -- my guess is -- 
L:  So, I mean, ah, alcohol in -- in small portions, you know, I mean, if they just had, like, were a light drinker or -- or maybe just socially once in a while --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe on a weekend or something, you know, that would be different.  But, what I'm talking about is an alcoholic.
R:  Ah, right, but they -- they didn't.  Yeah, because my -- my father was an alcoholic and I certainly have seen -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the damage that that -- 
L:  I mean -- 
R:  -- that does.
L:  -- they're abusive.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  They're abusive.
R:  My father -- 
L:  They abuse -- they abuse their partners.
R:  Ah, I say, well, my father was just -- he didn't do anything physical, he was just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of, um -- 
L:  Well, some are --
R:  [inaudible] -- 
L:  -- quiet drinkers -- 
R:  Right.  Well, he was l- he was -- 
L:  And -- and then -- 
R:  -- he was verbally abusive -- 
L:  Yeah.  But -- 
R:  -- which is bad enough.
L:  -- yeah, but some are physically abusive -- 
R:  Yeah, that's awful.
L:  Yeah.  And -- 
R:  Ah, when -- 
L:  -- you know, it destroys, um, their marriages.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And it destroys, um, their health.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah -- 
L:  Ah, I had a brother-in-law that, ah, drank.  Now, he was a pretty happy drinker, you know, like he didn't -- really didn't fight or anything.  But, he drank to excess and he had to have his pancreas removed.
R:  [MN] Gee -- 
L:  And that made him a diabetic.  He w- he wouldn't have been a diabetic if he didn't have to have his pancreas out.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, this made him a diabetic and, you know, he just went down.  I mean, he would just break out in perspiration even though he took insulin.  He'd have to be just real careful, you know, to eat at a certain time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, a- and then there's alcoholics -- after they've been alcoholic for so long they have an alcoholic psychosis.  And you know, th- that's really bad too.  There's so many -- many things with alcohol.  I mean, smoking y- yeah, you know, emphysema's real bad and cancer of the lung is terrible.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you know, when you can't breath, that's one -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- of the most important things in life -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- is to breath.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But, it's also, ah, terrible with alcohol.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, ah, drunk drivers, if they've been drinking, they may kill somebody.
R:  Oh, absolutely, yeah -- 
L:  Yeah, they might not even mean too, you know, but they'd be on the road and maybe fall asleep at the wheel and you know, kill somebody -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and then they would have, um, manslaughter -- 
R:  They're hurting other people not just themselves -- 
L:  -- charge on them, you know?  Ah, there's so many different things, um, of course now -- I have a tendency, ah, to use caffeine.  I -- I used to when I was, ah, younger just drink coffee.  You know, that's how I kept my weight down.
R:  Ah.
L:  But, I've had to cut it out since I've been older, you know, but I still like my coffee in the morning -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a couple of cups.  You know, I can't quite give that up.  But, um, I am more sedentary than I was when I was younger -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, um, I guess now I -- you know, I tend to overeat when I get nervous, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah, I know the feeling -- 
L:  But, um -- so, of course -- 
R:  -- but how -- how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
L:  Seventy one.
R:  Seventy one.  I'm sixty.
L:  And I -- I gained weight, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's what happens.  Metabol- metabolism slows down -- 
L:  Right.  And -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I gained weight and I'm not as active.  I used to be active all the time, you know?  But, then I worked eight hours on my feet all the time and, ah, so -- but, you know, overeating is real bad.  You know, when you're obese it -- it's bad for your health too. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I'm going to pick alcohol and you're going to -- 
R:  Okay.  I'm going to go with the smoking, right [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- pick smoking.  [LAUGH] And we didn't even touch gossiping, did we?  [LAUGH]  
R:  Ah, well gossiping again, [inaudible] 'cause they don't talk about the degrees -- I know it can sort of be, you know, it's just kind of a wasteful waste of time and it -- it -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it, ah, sometimes, I think, puts road blocks into getting to know somebody because you -- you hear something about them that you perhaps shouldn't know or it might not -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- even be true and it -- it colors your -- your opinion of them and that's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's really not, ah -- however, th- again, though everything's not really well defined.  Gossip is really -- you know, sometimes it's interesting -- interesting facts and well, obviously in New York we have lots of gossip columnists in our newspapers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and of course the TVs full of them and -- and some of it's just kind of, you know, it's just made up just to sell a record or sell a movie or, you know, it's just kind of silly stuff.
L:  Well, you know -- 
R:  But, there is very harmful vicious kind of gossip that can be -- 
L:  Yeah, because people sit up and take notice to that and what they -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- want, you know, is something else.  They really pick up on that and add to it.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly -- 
L:  Mm, there's several things and I don't know what they meant just by smoking, whether they meant smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana or what, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, ah, there we go again.  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  Marijuana.
R:  Well, interesting -- in the alcohol, ah -- really getting back -- getting back to the alcohol is that -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, you know, like, y- y- you've -- I've heard [several inaudible words] read some of the studies that indicate wine is -- and beer have actually, ah, different studies that -- I think it's four ounces of wine a day has been associated with, um, a le- lessening of heart attacks --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and something else, I -- I forget what -- 
L:  Well, see, that's in moderation.
R:  Ah, right. Exactly -- 
L:  You know, uh-huh -- 
R:  -- exactly.  Especially what I'm think, because I don't -- I don't drink wine every day but I always remem- remember that when I do have wine.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink wine, you know.  But, um, I -- I have to go along with you on the wine.  It does -- it relaxes 'em -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and there is some beneficial effect from that.  But, ah -- 
R:  And it's fun that -- for me to try different wines 'cause the -- 'cause the taste [several inaudible words] what they put in it, the -- the different kinds of grapes and the -- the seasonings --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all, k- it's really quite remarkable that so many different --
L: Yeah.
R:  -- kinds can come out of it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, you know, ju- ju- we had -- 
L:  Are you -- do you use caffeine.  I mean, do you drink coffee?
R:  I -- I used to drink coffee when I was younger and the last, let's say, five years it just -- I kept -- I'd have coffee, I'd say, "Boy, they don't make coffee well here".  And then after a while I realised, you know nine times -- nine out of ten places it must be me and not the coffee makers.  So, I realised --
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- it was -- I just didn't like coffee any more so I switched to tea and once again --
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- it's fun discovering different kinds of tea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then I've now read that green tea is good for you especially.  So --
L:  Yeah, that -- 
R:  -- I'm very happy with mine.  And -- and tea is kind of, um -- um, my ancestors go -- go back to England and that's -- that's a kind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of a tradit- my grandmother always had tea --
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- and stuff and so I -- maybe it's, you know, my -- maybe my genes are [LAUGH] breaking through, like --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- "You were meant --"
L:  Ah -- 
R:  "-- to drink tea all along" -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so -- 
L:  I had an aunt that raised me and she lived on tea.  Usually with tea and toast, you know -- 
R:  Oh, yes, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  -- but, it was the tea that kept her going.  Yeah, she was a little thin lady.  Real prim, pert, you know [LAUGH], but -- 
R:  Well, it's picking up in popularity.  Tea is really coming -- coming on strong and that's [inaudible] -- 
L:  Yeah, they're really suggesting that you either -- and green tea especially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, black tea is, you know, is helpful.  But -- 
R:  It's good.  But, the --
L:  -- I think in any form I -- I don't think it matters whether you have it in ice tea or hot tea, do you?
R:  Exactly.  Ah, no.  No it doesn't.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the green tea with mint is a -- is, um -- it makes the -- the green tea especially palatable --
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for -- for new -- new green tea drinkers -- 
L:  I bet it does, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so there's the -- you can get -- you get the combination, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- green tea with -- 
L:  There's different kinds of coffee, you know?  But, I -- I just stick to the regular --  
R:  The regular, right.
L:  -- yeah, uh-huh.  And, ah, I don't know, I've just never been -- when I was little and younger I just never really cared even for coke, you know?  It was either water or milk, you know, something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, now I drink diet coke and, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- b- but, there's caffeine in that -- 
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of caffeine in that, yes.  [LAUGH] --
L:  -- too, you know?  [LAUGH] But, I drink more of it right now in the summer time, you know, than I do in the winter.  I mean, I d- in the winter I can let it go, you know, but -- of course, it doesn't have any calories.  So, that's one thing you don't -- 
R:  That helps, yes, yes.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  What about, ah, you as far as eating?
R:  Ah, no.  I'm an extremely fussy eater.  I'm a vegetarian so I don't -- I -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I r- I always try to, ah- mostly fruits and vegetables are what I have so, um, I'm -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  You make meat loaf out of your vegetables and like that?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't -- I don't cook much.  [LAUGH] So, I'm a big salad person.  But, and I like, you know, tofu, ah -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I -- I do eat fish.  Um, I don't say I only that, but I do eat, ah, fish.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, ah [inaudible] --
L:  What does that tofu taste?
R:  Tofu's great.  It's -- it's basically it's -- it's pretty, ah -- it practically has no flavors.  It's what you add to it.  So, it's like when you --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- have stir fries you add those nice, ah, sauces to it.  You know, the -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the ginger kind of sauce -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and whatnot.  Are, it's -- it's pretty --
