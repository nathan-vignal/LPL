R:  [MN] Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hi, I'm Jennifer. [MN]
R:  Hi, I'm Clare. [MN]
L:  Hi.  [MN] So, do you watch reality shows?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] no, I've only -- I've seen a few.  [LIPSMACK] I don't really have TV.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I was visiting a friend and -- for several days in Kansas and I saw a bunch of real- reality TV when sh- -- when I was there 'cause she was really bored.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, do you watch reality TV?
L:  [MN] Um, some of 'em I like.  Some of 'em I like, um, American Idol, if that's considered reality.
R:  Oh, yeah, I saw an episode of that.  That was really funny.
L:  I'm hooked on that show.  I watch it all the time.  [MN]  
R:  They're really mean.  I think that's why everyone likes to watch it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, because, just to see the bad stuff that happens to people. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess, you know, watch people get humiliated, I guess that's entertaining.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, it's interesting because it makes you realize just how many [MN] bad people are out there, like, how untalented people are but it's also it's, like, really depressing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think.
L:  Yeah, I think [MN] [COUGH] I think, um, they get a lot of, like, all of 'em, all of the reality shows get a lot of, um, [MN] a lot of attention because of all the bad stuff that you see happen, like, they're no fun.  Like, Blind Date, it's no fun if they get along, you know, people ...
R:  Oh, no way.
L:  It sells a lot better if they're, like, cussing each other and [MN] talking bad about each other.
R:  It seems like they split them up so that -- [MN] so that they'll get mad at each other and they'll hate each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I like to watch Blind Date sometimes.
L:  I do too. [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause that just, like, I used to watch it and I would stay up really late --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- back in, like, my home, [MN] because, um, the only thing on in the middle of the night that was interesting.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think if they show it during, like, don't they show it earlier in the day now, like, ten o'clock or something?
L:  Not that I know of.  Here, I remember, well, I'm in DC, and they only show it at nighttime here.
R:  Oh.
L:  That I know of, [MN] so, [MN] but, yeah, I think that's -- that's the hype about reality show TV. [MN]  It's just [MN] humiliating people, seeing, like, with the, ah, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire or whatever.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I saw it when I -- when I was in Kansas I saw an episode of that.  That was -- that was pretty frightening [MN] but I just --
L:  [MN]
R:  I never really like any of the characters.  I wish I -- that they had people on there who were, like, normal or somewhat interesting --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I end up just being really bored by them, I think, usually.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah.  Like the, um, what's the new one is Mr. Personality or something.  The guy wears a mask and the girl's supposed to pick -- like, all the guys are wearing a mask and the girl picks which one she likes [MN] without ever getting to see him, or something.
R:  Yeah, they would never do that with women.
L:  Yeah, isn't that right? [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, maybe they wouldn't but the guy w- -- the guy wouldn't choose based on her personality, he'd choose based on her tits.
L:  Yeah, based on it, yeah.  [MN] Guys don't really need to see the face as much, I guess.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, anyways, that's [MN] that's just, um, like the -- did you ever watch Joe Millionaire?
R:  Well, maybe that was on -- I saw Joe Millionaire.  I didn't see Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
L:  Yeah, Joe Millionaire, [MN] I watched that one.
R:  God, that guy was so stupid.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, but they had to choose someone, like --
L:  They had no intelligence at all.
R:  -- really dumb.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah, he was, [MN] yeah.
R:  Like, he could be a big hunk and he could be a construction worker and not be, like, from some kind of fancy background and he could still be intelligent.
L:  Right, [MN] right, they had -- he was a dummy.  [MN] They, um, but, like, just to fool somebody like that and see these girls, [MN] you know, you looked at these girls, and like, "You're so stupid.  He has nothing and he's stupid". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, couldn't they catch on --
L:  And you're competing for --
R:  -- that he didn't, like, have a personality at all?
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] [MN] But, just, I mean, basically what the show did was humiliate the girls.  You know, I'm saying, like, afterwards, it's like, ha ha, you're competing for this guy who makes twenty thousand dollars a year.  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  What happened with, ah, with the end of that?  Did they, like, did the --
L:  They --
R:  -- woman he ended up like him still?
L:  [MN] Um, supposedly, yes.  Well, like, he -- the last episode, he told her that he didn't have the million dollars and that he chose her and she was, like, okay, well, you know, that's fine, I still, that's good, I wanna, you know, date you or whatever [MN] and then the show gave them a million dollars together, like as a surprise.
R:  Oh. [MN]
L:  And then, I think a couple of weeks later I heard that they -- they broke up, like they split the million and [MN] went their separate ways. [MN]
R:  That's a nice deal.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH] They could fool me for a million dollars.  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  Did you ever -- I saw -- one day I saw --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, um, the last fifteen minutes of some kind of show where they locked all the people up in a house and -- but they, like, they had arranged couples and then at the end, like, one of them was gonna get married but they hadn't met before the beginning of the month, or something like that?
L:  No.  I didn't see that one.
R:  It was, like, on Fox.  It had all this really graphic sex in it and it was kind of --
L:  I didn't see that one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, [MN] they picked six random people or, like, ten random people and then they matched them up and then every couple of days they would, like, eliminate one couple and the couple had to, like, get to know each other and fall in love and then at the end of the month one of the couples was gonna get married.  
L:  Wow.  No, I didn't see that one.  I saw, um, [MN] wasn't there one, I think it was a coup- -- a year or two ago, [MN] but they -- it was people that -- that already had a girlfriend or something and they went on to an island, [MN] Temptation Island or something?
R:  Oh, right, yeah.
L:  Do you remember that one?  [MN]
R:  I do remember that.
L:  That was a bad show.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  That was -- that was kind of funny.
L:  Yeah, but those are the more entertaining ones.  There are --
R:  [MN]
L:  That's what I'm saying, like, the people that are getting completel- completely humiliated. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Or the -- doing things that you would never do, like Fear Factor.
L:  Mhm.  [MN] Yeah.  Seeing what people would do for money.
R:  I wouldn't do all of that stuff.
L:  [MN]
R:  Just the stuff with bugs, I couldn't do any of that.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, I couldn't have spiders crawling all over me or anything.
L:  [MN]  I could do the stuff that, like, one of 'em I saw and they were, like, car surfing.  They stand on c- -- top of cars while the cars are going and try to surf on the cars.  Like, stuff like that that I knew I could really get hurt at, I wouldn't be able to do it.  That'd scare me. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
R:  And then I guess there's that kind of -- I guess it's considered reality TV, it's like, just stunts, like, um, what is it?  Oh, Jackass, on MTV --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Is that reality too?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I guess.
R:  I saw the Jackass movie.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.  It was --
L:  Oh.
R:  A lot of it was really funny but the stuff that was funniest wasn't just, like, [MN] what they did to hurt themselves, like, they would -- they -- they cut the webs of their fingers and feet --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with -- with paper and they, like, hung from their balls and, I don't know, they just did all of this painful stuff.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But the stuff that was funny was, like, [LIPSMACK] the gags they pulled, like when they pretended to be old people and then they'd, like, like this guy pretended he was an old person who'd lost a brace on his wheelchair and was going down a hill or this guy, like, went into a hardware store and took a crap in one of the display toilets.
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Like, that was really funny.  [LAUGH]  I- it was kind of just disgusting s- some of the other stuff though.  It wasn't that good.
L:  That sounds a lot like the -- the regular show that comes on MTV because I've seen one, like, a guy in a wheelchair, like, he falls down flights of steps, like the wheelchair and he f- falls out of it.  They're like, "Are you okay, are you okay?"  And he's acting like [several inaudible words] and he just gets up and walks off.  [MN] Just stupid stuff like that but, I guess, I think it's entertaining.  [MN]  Or I saw one episode where they, umm, um, this guy went to an outhouse or what's it called, ah, not outhouse, um, port a potty --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- and they locked him in there in the toilet, like a used port a potty, and they pick it up with the crane, like, upside down, squash him, like, you know, he gets crap and stuff all over him.
R:  Oh, are you kidding?
L:  No.  [MN]
R:  Oh, my God, that's --
L:  He gets out and he's like --
R:  -- so disgusting.
L:  -- got poop dripping from him.  It's disgusting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, when the guy was gonna take a crap in the, ah, in the hardware store too, like, he, like, had to go really, really bad beforehand --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and he, like, accidentally just did it in his pants.  And then there was 'nother thing --
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when they took, like, snow cone ice, and a guy peed on it and then ate it.  [MN] Like, it was a snow cone.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Gross.
R:  I actually think that that kind of stuff is way more entertaining than like the -- [MN] I really hate it when they make reality TV, like, really dramatic, like, "Okay, only one of you gets a rose".
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  "Only one of you gets to go on".
L:  Yeah.  They draw it out, like, like it's some big huge thing.  [MN]  Yeah, that's the way American Idol is getting now.  Like, it, they're [MN] doing everything, inviting people to the show, [MN] like, doing everything just to waste your time and not just getting to the results.
R:  Ah, is there anyone good on American Idol right now, like, interesting?
L:  Um, there's a couple.  Yeah, there's -- there's only -- I think there's only four people left now.  [MN] So, there's -- there's a -- a few good ones.  [MN] There's a marine on there that's in the top four.  He's horrible but every single week, like, you think that that's the one getting voted off because he's been the worst one for the past three months or for the past month or whatever, three weeks, but --
