R:  Hi, my name is May.
L:  I'm Kath.
R:  Who are you?
L:  My name is Kath.
R:  Hi, Kath.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thanks.  [MN] So, the question I guess is d- do we watch reality TV?
L:  Right.  Um --
R:  Do you?
L:  I don't.
R:  I do.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]  I don't watch all of 'em but I have watched some of the reality TV shows before.  [MN]  Any particular reason why you don't?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I'm just not really interested but what makes you wanna watch them?
R:  [MN] Um, [MN] just because I c- -- find them interesting and o- oftentimes I actually find them irritating and I don't know if that means I enjoy being irritated or [MN] -- or what.  Or maybe I'm just nosey.  I don't know.
L:  Do you think it's because you're able to relate to the -- people on the show more because they're real characters?
R:  Um.  [MN]  That's qui- -- that's a possibility, although, like, I -- I watched, um, [LIPSMACK], Joe Millionaire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, I couldn't relate with the women at all because I f- -- I thought they were phoney and I couldn't see how anybody could convince themselves --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that they were in love with a man that they'd only known for, like, twenty four hours.
L:  Mm, that's true.
R:  [MN] You know, so, but I haven't watched -- I watched Survivor only maybe once or twice.  It was a little bit too intense [MN] for me.  I didn't find it, ah, fun.  I -- I don't like to watch the ones that -- where people are, like, miserable and unhappy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've w- -- I watched the Bachelor.  Um, I watch American Idol.  I guess that's considered reality TV.
L:  Is that the one where they pick people to perform and try and find a pop star thing?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I've watched -- I'm -- um, this is the second time that I've watched that.  I've watched -- I watched that from start to finish last -- last year and I -- I --I've enjoyed it a lot this year.  A lot of talent on there.
L:  Yeah, one of my sons watch it.  Ah, do people actually make big breaks with that show?
R:  Yes, absolutely.  There -- there was a woman named Tamyra Gray that was on last year who I think should have won the contest but was voted off towards the end and [MN] she's got a guest appearance on one of the weekly TV shows that I haven't watched.  I think it's Boston Public or one of those.  She -- she c- -- she's on there --
L:  Mm.
R:  And a couple of them have made a movie together and they've got recording contracts and so, yeah, [MN] I think that [LIPSMACK] they get a lot of exposure -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, [LIPSMACK] just by being on the show, on American Idol itself, so ...
L:  Yeah, when I think about that show, I, um, I think of that guy with blond hair.  Was he on that show?  The curly blond hair and he looked like somebody from NSYNC or something.
R:  Um, Justin?
L:  I -- I don't even know his name but whenever they had advertising for that show that's what I saw on it.
R:  Oh, you know who that was, I think?  It was, ah, probably the, like the master of ceremonies.  A young guy?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that -- that -- yeah, that -- yeah, he does have blond hair and I've never really [MN] -- I don't know NSYNC that well but I could see where he could be -- he could look like he would be in a group like that, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's -- that's who that is then evidently.
L:  Is he the one who won?
R:  No, no.  I think who you were seeing was not a singer.  Were you seeing him singing or just seeing him on stage?
L:  He was on stage.
R:  Yeah, I think he's just the MC for the show.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, [MN] [LAUGH] let's see, what other w --  Since you don't watch reality TV, let's see what other ones have I seen.  A -- a couple of years ago there was a show called, um, Temptation Island.
L:  Hm, I've never heard of that.
R:  [LAUGH]  That was --
L:  Oh, yeah, wasn't that when --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- two couples, ah, or two p- --members of a couple went and tried to see if their partner would cheat on them or something?
R:  Yes and that was very -- it was very irritating too.  [MN] It was [LAUGH] -- it was very irritating and I used to watch it with my daughter and we both would gripe and complain all the way through it and then we'd be the first ones to be tuning in the following week.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it was just kind -- it -- it was kind of evil.  It really was.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did people usually end up cheating on their partners?
R:  Oh, some of them did and -- and, again, why would you, if you were a couple, why would you put yourself through an experience like that?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Why would -- you know, I mean --
L:  You'd have to be pretty insecure about your relationship.
R:  Yeah, or -- or way too secure, one or the other.  But, either way, I just don't see how you could come out of it with a healthier relationship.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, but it -- it was fun watching but it was irritating.  It [MN] -- so, i- in answer to your question as to whether or not I relate, I don't actually think I do relate. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's just -- I just look at it as -- as fun, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, like, I would never even consider going on one of those shows.
L:  Yeah, I wonder if people just do it for the money or th- -- whether they're driven by the topic of the show, you know.
R:  [MN] I think -- I think a lot of it is just the opportunity to be on television.
L:  Right.
R:  I really do.
L:  Yeah, 'cause then the entire country knows you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's like instant fame.
R:  Mhm, exactly.  [MN] And I guess they -- they do become -- some of these shows do become very popular.  I know they've got websites on -- on the internet and I know there's a lot of talk rooms and stuff, ah, chatrooms where people -- some of the people that watch these shows are [LIPSMACK] -- I remember when Big Brother was on a couple of years ago I went into one of those chat rooms once just to see what the people were talking about and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- you could watch the -- the people in the home on Big Brother on the Internet --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and some of those people were literally tuned into the Internet --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- twenty four hours a day.  It was kind of scary.
L:  It becomes, like, an obsession.
R:  Exactly.  It was kind of creepy to think that somebody was so obsessed with what was going on in that house that they were literally [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- glued to the Internet just to see what those other people were doing twenty four seven, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of -- it's kind of scary.
L:  I think the first reality T- TV show was the one on, um, MTV, the Real World.  Do you remember that show? 
R:  Actually, I do.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  There was one in LA, I think.
L:  Yeah.  And they all shared, like, a huge house and just -- the camera --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- followed them around all --
R:  I saw a few episodes of that because one of my kids used to watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, yeah, I do remember that, and, ah, you're right, that is like the first.  I think [MN] Big Brother was very much like that.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then just recently there was this huge resurgence of, um, and a bunch of them came out.  Ah, it was -- I think Survivor was the one that sort of sparked all of them.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was Survivor, I know that.
L:  I -- I haven't watched that show even once but I heard so much about it.
R:  I watched it once and I didn't like it.  It was too --
L:  'Cause it was too intense.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Too intense.
R:  It was.  Those things they wanted them to do and -- it was just -- it was too much.  I just --it made me uncomfortable, some of the things, the physical things, that they put them through, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It ju- -- it bothered me.  It was -- they were not having any kind of a good time and so therefore neither was I. 
L:  What was the point of the game?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, whoever could go through the hardships and was the last one to remain, I guess, in the location wherever they were --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- won, I think, I'm not sure how much they won but I think it was like a million dollars or something.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah, it was a lot of money.  [MN] Plus they got, like you were saying, instant fame 'cause I know they go on David Letterman and ...
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And they're the big topic of conversation on Jay Leno and a lot of the talk shows and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, but I don't know.  I was surprised that Survivor is still around.  I think they're in their, like, their fifth year now, or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just location, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But that one I don't watch.  [LAUGH]  [MN]  [LIPSMACK]  So, ah, w- -- so, you've never watched any of 'em?
L:  Not really.  I mean, I've seen a couple briefly like the Real World one but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- like, a regular watcher --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, the only one that I really watch faithfully now is American Idol.  I do enjoy that.
L:  Right.
R:  But I --
L:  Because everybody's happy and everyone --
R:  And -- and they're singing.  [LAUGH]  I like music.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And I like to -- to see who's good and who isn't.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And, like, you know, who's going to win.  You -- you pick a winner and it's kind of like rooting for your favorite football team, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]  So, it's more like a --a -- a contest than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything else, and I like that.  [COUGH]  [LIPSMACK] Because I guess game shows don't fit into the reality category.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm a big game show watcher, so ...
L:  Yeah, they're kind of similar though.
R:  Yeah, in some ways.  There's a winner.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and they're not actors.
R:  No and they have to follow the rules.  
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So, I don't -- i don't know.  [COUGH]  So, what do you watch?
L:  [MN]  Um, let's see.  I don't -- I spend more time on the Internet than I do watch TV but, um ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] I love the Internet.
L:  Yeah, it's -- yeah --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- because it's sort of [inaudible] possibilities whereas TV, youre limited to what's on, but ...
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [MN]  In fact, you wonder how you ever went without the Internet, or at least I do.  
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  I was talking about that with a friend of mine the other day, the fact that -- that it used to be if -- if you, if there was even the name of a song or there was something you couldn't remember and it would drive you crazy, you'd lie awake at night trying to figure the answer to something. [MN]  Now you can just go on the Internet and in -- in two seconds you know what the answer to that thing was that was haunting you.  
L:  Right, yeah, you know, it's really weird, you know, you just have one question, whether it's a name you can't remember or anything and --
R:  You can get it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.  I love it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  [MN]  It is and -- and when -- are we supposed to still be talking about reality TV, I wonder?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, right.  Um, how long have we been on for?
R:  [MN] I don't know.  I don't even know if we're supposed to time it or what.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Um, I think it said a minimum of eight minutes and I'm --
R:  See, I thought it was ten.
L:  Right, they said, um, it's a ten minute phone call but a minimum of eight minutes or something.
R:  Okay.  Is this your first call?
L:  Yeah, I've never called before.
R:  I haven't either.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I don't know if they just cut us off or if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they said something about you have a chance to -- to enter your own comments at the end.
L:  Oh, huh.
R:  Where are you, by the way?
L:  Oh, I'm in Massachusetts.
R:  I -- I'm in South Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, that's interesting too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I guess, I assume then that we d- -- did you look at the clock before we -- when we started?
L:  Um, no, I don't -- I didn't register.  I think it was something like two o'clock though.
R:  Mm-kay.
L:  Yeah, it was definitely two o'clock when we called.
R:  [MN]
