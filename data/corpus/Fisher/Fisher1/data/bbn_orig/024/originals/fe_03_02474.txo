L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Terry.
R:  I'm Christine.
L:  Oh, so we're talking about reality TV? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, this is so weird. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, uh, do you watch any shows?
R:  Um, you know, I really don't watch too many of them.  Um, you know, it's kinda -- you flip through them and -- and you kinda get sucked in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's pretty much -- I don't have, like, one that, you know, that I watch all the time.  Do you?
L:  Right.  Oh, I don't know.  Like, yeah, I'm kinda in the same situation.  I, um, I follow what's going on, but I don't always watch the shows.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but the creepiest one right now I think is that Mr. Personality one.
R:  I just saw that the other night.
L:  Where the guys have masks on.  It's just so weird. [LAUGH]
R:  It really is.  I -- I'm -- I'm not really sure I get why everybody watches them, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know what I mean?  Like I know you kinda get sucked into, like, if there's nothing else on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's kinda my -- my thing is that if there's nothing else on and if -- you know, if it's more on for background sound or anything like that but ...  Like, my sister in law is stuck on Survivor.  Like, they -- they literally tape it.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they have -- well, they have Tivo.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, they -- they will actually, like, make sure that if they're not home, Tivo will tape it and they sit and they watch it.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Like the -- they're absolutely stuck on, "Survivor's on.  I have to watch Survivor.  I have to see what happens".
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't really know why, um, you know, why that is.  I -- I don't really get it.
L:  Oh, I know.  Uh, yeah, I really -- I never really got into Survivor or Big Brother or anything like that.  I just thought they were kinda weird.  But I kinda like the ones, like the Joe Millionaire one or American Idol or something.  I don't know why --
R:  D- do you watch it?
L:  Yeah, I kinda do.
R:  I --
L:  It's kinda like watching karaoke. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, you know, I don't know- --
R:  Like, what?  Having a look at a car accident on the way by?
L:  Yeah, kind of, especially when they do disco, because, like, nobody can sing disco well without, like, you know, eight million tons of synthesizing effects, so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's pretty interesting. [LAUGH] But, um, yeah, I don't know.  Uh, [SIGH] I'm trying to think of what other reality shows there are.
R:  Um, you know, because I don't watch them, I don't really know.  I mean, there is --
L:  Oh, what about stuff like the Osbournes?  I --
R:  Um, are they on HBO?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't have HBO.
L:  Or MTV or something.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't really watch -- I -- you know, I just can't -- I just can't tolerate it, I guess.  Um, it's just -- it almost seems like it's a waste of my time to actually sit and watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I don't even know, like, I don't -- I wouldn't flip through and look for them, um, I g- -- I really, I don't get why [LAUGH] watch them.  Though, I mean, the Osbournes, it's just like, to me, from what I've seen, it's just, um, you know, this family that is, um, what's the word I'm looking for?  It's just like this, um, crazy, you know, like a car accident, you know?
L:  Yeah, seriously.
R:  It's, like, you know, swearing and -- I mean, that's basically all his conversation.  Everything comes out of his mouth, it's -- you know, on regular TV gets beeped.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's like, you know, I mean, that's -- it's just kinda like a car wreck, you know, and just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I mean, that's how I feel about, like, the judge show, like in Divorce Court and things like that.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I'm just, like, I think some people are so desperate to be seen, so they'll just do -- like, do anything for fifteen minutes.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, they h- -- you know, and it's -- it -- I don't know, I guess it's, um, you know, you think your life is pathetic, you can turn the TV on and see a more pathetic life.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And make yourself feel better.  I'm not really sure --
L:  Yeah, seriously.  And like, Jerry Springer --
R:  Oh, that's bad.
L:  -- that's just -- yeah, that's ridiculous.
R:  That's really bad.
L:  It's like all you have to do to be on that show is show your chest or, I don't know, have some sort of weird lesbian affair on TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, uh, it's pretty gross.
L:  Uh, oh, but, yeah, it's just like, I don't know, I guess they're cheaper for the networks to make or something.
R:  Probably.  I mean, cost wise, although some of those reality shows, I mean, they're on, you know, I mean, they're being flown to these islands.  Apparently they don't have to feed them all that much, so they cut down on food costs, but, I mean, they're flying people everywhere, or --
L:  But still, they're not paid actors, they're not, you know, union actors, they're not paying them a million dollars an episode or anything like that.
R:  True.  That's true.
L:  You know, these people volunteer to be on the show.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  So --
R:  Uh, but, you know what, the Great Race, that one always seems kind of cool.  Have you seen that?
L:  W- -- is that the one where the couples have to go, like, all over the world and they don't know where they are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't they -- yeah, that seems cool, and I think that I would actually like to do something like that, but at the same time, it seems kind of really scary. [LAUGH]
R:  It does seem really scary, it does.  But they, um, the one episode that I saw, they were, um, like, you know, that you have to find clues that lead to you -- you know, you're in a foreign country and they -- they give you this race where all these couples, you know, you have to -- I don't know, whatever it was, either choose to cross, um, like this desert area either on horseback or on ATV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and whichever choice you got, you know, you went to the end and found your clue by either a really easy method or a really difficult method.  I think it -- like, they were really easy -- like, you had to ride the horse but then you got your answer really easy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or you rode the ATV but the -- and to try and get the answer at the end was a little more difficult and then --
L:  Oh, that's really interesting.
R:  -- and then you come back and, you know, you have your clue, and then you have to figure out what your clue means, and then you have to, you know, whatever, get to, um, a certain point at a certain time, like the clue is to get to a restaurant at, you know, such and such a road or whatever, and, um, you know, you have to figure that out, because, like, in whatever your clue was with the title to the restaurant or, you know, something like that.  So you have to ask people, 'cause of course it's in a foreign language, 'cause you're in a foreign country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to try and find people to help you figure it out and -- and so then you have to figure out how to get there and see, you know, whether you take a taxi or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  And you actually get there and then, you know, they -- over a certain period of time they, um, what was it?  They o- -- you know, like, so and so won this day and they -- you know, they got so many points along the way or whatever, so you get on a, like a rating team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- it was like if you're on, like, the last -- you know, the person that shows up last gets kicked off.
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- but it -- you could get -- you didn't know where you were, you knew you were, like, close to last.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, like, you know, they'd say, "Well, I'm going to go get --", um, they'd have things that you could go get and say, "You have a bye for that day" or -- or, you know, whatever, so you could go, you know, you race to get your -- your free pass.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you -- so you didn't have to go through the test or you didn't have to, you know, you didn't have to deal with that that one day, and you could just -- they'd just hop kick over to the next day.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  So, it was actually pretty interesting, but I don't know if it's still on.
L:  Oh, that sounds, like, really cool, 'cause it's not just people, you know, getting on TV and doing stupid things, it's people actually, like, you know --
R:  Like Fear Factor.
L:  Oh, my God.  I hate that show.
R:  Isn't that the grossest thing?
L:  Yeah, people sticking bugs in their mouths and just, like, ugh.
R:  That's really nasty.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I --
R:  So, yeah, I mean that was -- I -- like I said, I don't if it was -- it's still on because, you know, maybe it was -- it was too close to [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:   -- being a decent show and so they ...
L:  They canned it.
R:  I don't know if it -- if it had a lot of draw.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think -- was it -- I don't know, was that on CBS or something?
R:  Um, you know, I don't really know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what station it was on.
L:  Oh.
R:  Again, it was just one of those, like, I kinda clicked on and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'd heard about, and it was, like, "Oh well, let's see what it's all about" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of thing.  So ...
L:  Uh, yeah, oh, man, but it just seems like every time I turn on the TV there's more and more of those reality shows.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That one that's on Fox right now, it's Mr. Personality, just freaks me out though, because, like, I can't even imagine being in a house, like, which is a r- -- all these guys in masks and Monica Lewinsky.  Like, come on, that's so scary.
R:  Uh, yeah [LAUGH] I know.
L:  You don't know -- and any these people and they show her, like, kissing the guy and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and like, this is some dude in a mask that you don't know from anybody. [MN]
R:  You know, all of them seem like that, like the -- what was it, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette?
L:  Mm.
R:  I just -- I don't know, that's -- to me, it's a little creepy to be, like, you know, you know, twelve girls fighting over one guy and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, he's going to go on a date with me and then he's going to go on a date with you two hours later.
L:  Right.
R:  That to me is just really creepy.
L:  Yeah.  It is really weird.  Like even the dating shows and all, where it has like, you know, five girls against one guy and, you know, it's just so weird.  It's so weird to see girls get so competitive over, like, the dorkiest guys. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, it's --
R:  I know.
L:  Well, whatever, but [inaudible].  Um, eee, trying to think what other reality shows I've seen.  Oh, wh- what about this reality movie, MTV Cancun or something like that?
