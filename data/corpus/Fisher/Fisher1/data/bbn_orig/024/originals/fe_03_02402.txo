R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Donna.
R:  M- Melissa [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, how are you?  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, California, southern.
L:  Oh, I'm in New Jersey.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What time is it there?
R:  Ah, you know, I think it's about, what, four o'clock?
L:  Oh, okay, it's like, eight o'clock.
R:  Oh, five o'clock, that's it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, okay so, we're supposed to talk about what we think is the worst habit, I guess.
R:  Yeah, I guess, bad habits.
L:  Yeah, um, well, the one that I probably um, experience the most is gossip.  I work in a childcare center and there's a lot of women --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and it, ah -- they tend to get, you know, even the older ones tend to get very petty.  It's like being in high school again sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that the one you ah, come across the most often?
R:  I -- I'm sorry, you're kind of quiet.
L:  Is that the one you come across the most often, I said.
R:  What, the gossip?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I don't know.  Sometimes I -- actually, I'm in the theatre arts --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, ah, word of mouth is kind of a big thing and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what people gossip as far as me, but I hear like, m- you know --
L:  A lot from everyone else?
R:  Yeah, I -- I think there's um, this one guy, everybody calls him fun vacuum man or something because he's so boring, but like, so they just constantly like, they give each other nicknames and I'm like, okay, stay away from this person and this person --
L:  It makes you wonder what they're saying about you, right?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my boss is like that a little bit.  She ah, tends to like, tell little lies all the time and, you know, like, nothing that is really serious but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, even when there's no reason to lie, you know what I mean, like, if someone will call and she never got back to them, so just make up a reason instead of the actual reason --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and stuff like that.  It makes you wonder how much, you know, they're telling you lies and how many times she's told you things that, you know, didn't actually happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  I'm actually not real tolerant of the whole gossiping --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I -- I've already said, I've heard comments made, I mean, behind people's backs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- too, and I still, like, [inaudible] lots of people, like [several inaudible words] after that, I -- sometimes, I like, you know, th- they think oh, because you're standing there with them you're not this other person's friend.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just, I don't know, sometimes it's hard to deal with.
L:  People never grow up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you're in college?
R:  Yeah, actually I'm graduating.
L:  Oh, great.  And then are you looking for a career in the arts or ...?
R:  Yeah, I'm a -- a dancer.  So ...
L:  A what?
R:  I -- I'm a dancer.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have a specialty or ...?
R:  Um, ballet and modern mostly.
L:  Oh wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah, so, that other one about the exercising, I'm like, [LAUGH] I don't know, I -- I'm notoriously bad as far as like, exercising outside of dance. [LAUGH] 
L:  But you -- but you -- technically, don't you exercise a lot while you're dancing?  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, but um, most dancers tend to um, go to the gym after class and --
L:  Really.  Huh.
R:  I'm horrible at that.  I'm just, like [LAUGH] 
L:  You have a required amount of -- of exercises you have to do with your classes and stuff, or ...?
R:  Um, well, classes themselves take up about four and a half hours a day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of just dancing.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, --
L:  Sounds like enough exercise to me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do -- do you smoke or drink?
R:  I -- yeah, [LAUGH] which is also bad.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like, I -- I totally don't approve of it, I'm like, actually trying to quit, but [LAUGH] 
L:  Must be -- yeah, must be, you would think like, as an athlete, you know --
R:  Well it -- it's kind of strange because growing up, like, I remember when I was younger, um, there was -- I went to the school at the Corvallis[?] Dance Academy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and every day we had to walk through this cloud of smoke of all the company dancers outside --
L:  Wow.
R:  And I mean, it's like, this stigma that goes on, that being a dancer is like, pretty much, I mean, a lot of them smoke.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's -- see that's the thing I don't understand, because my girlfriend was like that and then she became a vegetarian and, you know, all this healthy stuff, yet she smokes, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you think, like, you -- you have a respect for your body because you're, you know, basically using it as a, you know, profession --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and yet you're, you know, treating it badly.
R:  Well I think, like, for personally, it's like, become my one vice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  Is it nerve thing?  Like, that you're nervous about, you know what I mean, you think that it -- that's why you tend to smoke more?
R:  I -- yeah, it's like, it's a combination of things, like, um, 'cause I know as a dancer you have to like, you're supposed to um, stick to, you know, the good food and stuff and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like, I am a vegetarian and I -- I do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- everything else is healthy, but like, because I can't indulge in that --
L:  Right.
R:  I indulge in something else --
L:  Right.  And it doesn't have any calories, I guess [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's actually like, I -- a lot of reasons why um, not so much any more, I um, but um, because when dancers used to be like, anorexic and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they would smoke instead of eat.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  It kills your taste buds a little, I guess.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And what -- what was the other thing?  Smoking, drinking --
R:  Um, exercising, there was something else --
L:  Oh, exercising.  Yeah, I don't exercise at all.  I -- I have three um, children, myself, I have an eight year old, a five year old and a three year old, so --
R:  That makes it kind of hard. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't [LAUGH] yeah, I don't have much free time, but I'm one of those people that like, I've weighed the same since I'm like, sixteen, so I don't really have a problem with my weight at all, but um, I guess just like the toning and stuff, but it's so -- I mean, by the time I like, sit down at eight o'clock it's like, the last thing I feel like doing is exercising.
R:  [LAUGH] Taking care of kids that age is exercise.
L:  It is.  It's tiring, yeah, especially the youngest is, you know, in the defiant age now and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, but I was doing a lot of walking um, I was -- I did a breast Avon[?] breast cancer three day walk --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, it, you know, a lot of training, 'cause it's like, a sixty mile walk over three days, so I did a lot of walking over the summer but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I haven't really done much since that.
R:  I've -- I've actually found that walking is like, the one thing that I -- because I remember wh- when I was at the age, I have two younger brothers, too, and I was about twelve and my mom got -- she just, um, I don't know if you- you've ever heard of mall walking?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- they have like, these little clubs --
R:  Yeah, and you just walk around the mall before the store opens and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but she got me mall walking, and over, I think, over the course of like, six months, I think I lost thirty pounds.
L:  Wow.
R:  -- as a twelve year old. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  Were you overweight as a twelve year old?
R:  A little bit --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but not like, extremely, I like, really like, thinned down to a real -- and I think m- because of -- because we did it like, two of us in the morning for one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it like, gets the metabolism going and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then, I don't know, it just like -- because I -- I ate whatever I wanted --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it wasn't like I did anything else, I just walked, like, we did like two or three miles in the morning, every morning --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and ah, that was it, and I don't know, I -- personally, think it's the best because it's low impact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and like, I remember most of the people who were there were like, you know, older --
L:  right.
R:  -- senior citizen type --
L:  Mhm, and it's good to do in the mall because you don't have to worry about the weather and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all that --
R:  So, yeah, that's actually my favorite thing too, [LAUGH] is just go for a walk.
L:  I find it to be a little boring but --
R:  Yeah, well, it helped that I was like, that I would have my mom to go with --
L:  Right.  You need someone to talk with, yeah.
R:  -- you have someone to talk to.
L:  I had a girlfriend of mine that I would -- I would go walking with and we ended up just, like, complaining about work [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff like that, or our husbands and you know, just before you know it, you know, your time had gone by but --
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  We still have about two minutes left, let's see.
R:  Okay [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Ten minutes is a lot longer than you think, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yesterday, what was it, I did this yesterday too, and it was illness.
L:  Now, did you get a phone call, or -- because ...?
R:  Yesterday I got a phone call.  Today I called in.
L:  Oh, okay, because I called in, because after I -- did you have to reregister?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, I did this initially like, months ago, I can -- ah, I don't know, it was like, two months ago and I got like, one call and then everything stopped, and then they said they guess they were having some problems with their platform or something --
R:  -- oh, and then they --
L:  -- but they wanted everyone to like, re um --
R:  Re start.
L:  --re- like, yeah, I guess, like, re sign up and um put the times that they were available and all that, so I did all that to reactivate it and then I still didn't get any phone calls and my sister is also doing it and she -- she received two more phone calls, so then I'm like, I'm going to look at the email again, because I remembered the number and I'm like, oh, let me try this, so I just called and did it myself, today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So this is my second call altogether.  How many have you done?
R:  Um, this is actually my third. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I just like, I found out and I -- I called in once just to see what it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the topic was food --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then um, and then they called me yesterday and I figured just get all three calls.
L:  Right.  Is that all they're allowing, is three calls, or ...?
R:  Um, yeah, for one study it's three calls and then if you have like, five different phones --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can sign up for that one, and they want twenty five callers.
L:  Wow.
R:  So.  Um, my mom's decided to do that one because it's a lot more money. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, ten dollars these ones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  But you have to -- you have to call from the different phones, is that how it works?
R:  Yeah.  I think they --they're um, testing not only like, the way people converse, but like, the way they converse in different format.
L:  Different -- okay.  Huh, I guess I can do that.  I have -- between -- my parents live with me, so I have five phones between -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then I guess if you do cell phone as well --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we have about twenty seconds.  I thought they were supposed to -- well, maybe it's like a minute, I think I started the timer sooner, but I thought they were supposed to give us like, a three minute warning?
R:  Oh, no, they -- the way they did it yesterday, they just cut you off at the ten minutes and then they give you thirty seconds to say goodbye.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  But yeah, the -- the illness talk, I mean, it's just like, we were still talking when ten minutes was up.
L:  Really.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What other topic did you get beside food?
R:  Um, well the topic was, as far as the illness, it was like --
L:  Oh, 
R:  -- with the other topic was food and like, do you like to eat out or eat in --
L:  Uh-huh --
