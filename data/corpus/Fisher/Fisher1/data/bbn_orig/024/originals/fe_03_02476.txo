L:  Hi, I'm Sarah from Los Angeles.
R:  Hi Sarah, it's Angela from Virginia.  How you doing?
L:  Cool.  How you doing?
R:  I'm doing good. [LAUGH]
L:  Excellent.
R:  How did you --
L:  So, um, do you watch reality TV?
R:  Uh, I do watch it occasionally, yes, I do.  It's kind --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of, uh, interesting to see if it -- I try to f- figure whether it's for real, or whether it's just, you know, fake and they're saying it's real. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which shows do you watch? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I watched the Joe Millionaire series, a couple of those.  Not all of 'em, 'cause that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really got boring after a while.  Um, Anna Nicole, I've seen that a couple of times.  Um, I like, um, [LIPSMACK] what's that one?  Those daredevil things, I can't think of the name of that.  Um, goodness --
L:  Fear Factor.
R:  -- you kn- -- oh -- oh, I'm sorry?
L:  Fear Factor.
R:  Yes, Fear Factor.  I like that one, that's pretty good.
L:  I -- I like Fear Factor, um, I think I've watched half of an Anna Nicole.  I've watched most of the, um, Joe Millionaires, only because I was at a friend's house, he has parties every Monday night, and so we would watch it at his house.
R:  So cool.
L:  Um, and I -- I watched it, but just for the comedy value, you know, I certainly didn't think that any of it was for real --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- um, you know, and I watched a couple of the, um, Married by America, which is just so ridiculous.
R:  Right.
L:  I've never watched Survivor, I can't -- just -- it just doesn't [NOISE] appeal to me.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Um, I've watched Fear Factor, you know, a few times, but mo- most reality shows just do not appeal to me, 'cause it's just so fake.
R:  R- right, exactly, that's -- y- yeah --
L:  You know, it's just, like --
R:  -- it -- it seems fake to me too, i- -- totally.  I mean, you know, re- -- Fear Factor is kind of, like, they really can't fake that [LAUGH] you know? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, they're really up, they're high, they're really over water, they really, you know, fall off the helicopters, that kind of stuff.
L:  Right, you know, Fear Factor, yeah, you can't fake it, it's a really cool stunt show, basically that's what it is.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's really cool when you see their, um, [LIPSMACK] when you see the celebrities that do it, because they're raising money for charity.
R:  Yes, I -- I've -- I've seen two of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And those were pretty nice, um --
L:  I -- I can't deal with the eating the -- the squiggly things that are still moving --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- though, that --
R:  I was just going to say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the food that they come up with though, boy, I just can't, ew, I can't fathom eating any of that stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  I've often thought, you know, I wouldn't mind doing Fear Factor, 'cause I have no problems with, like, throwing me off a building or, you know, suspending me from a helicopter or any of that kind of stuff, I'm like, "Whatever, [NOISE] cool, I'd try it".  But you want me to eat a cockroach, I'm might die.
R:  Yeah, right, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd have to give up -- give up the -- give up the -- the challenge at that point, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's just, like, "Sorry, I can't do that", you know?  Or put my head in a casket full of spiders.  I'm, like --
R:  No.
L:  -- "No.  No way on this planet", you know?  I'm sorry, that will damage me mentally for the rest of my life.
R:  Right.  Or lie in the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] lie in the coffin of scorpions or whatever that was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's, like, oh, that was just, you know, scary.  Um --
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  -- some of the --
L:  No.
R:  -- some of the other reality shows that, uh, that I've just, like, looked at once or something, um, you know, there -- there's, well, there's that new thing on by Shannon Dougherty called Scare Tactics.  That's an interesting one, it's not a really a re- -- well, it is kind of reality because --
L:  I haven't seen that.
R:  Yeah, it's on, um, Sci Fi, I believe.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Sci Fi channel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, she hosts it and they -- they put people in situations and then scare the crap out of 'em basically, is what they do.  Um, they, like --
L:  W- --
R:  -- an alien abduction, a -- a f- -- you know, a fake, uh, Sasquatch, uh, Big Foot, that kind of thing, situation.
L:  So, it's more like a study in w- watching human reactions in -- in, you know, different circumstances?
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  But they -- they put people in situations to a point where I just -- I would be scared to do it as a -- as a, uh, a host or as a producer of the show, because, you know, if somebody dies from a heart attack from being scared to death --
L:  That's -- yeah, that show could backfire on you big time.
R:  Right, exactly.  And -- and so --
L:  You know, it --
R:  -- so I kind of wonder if that's even real after all, because why would the producers put themselves in a position where, you know, a guy could pass out and have a stroke from scaring him so -- you know, from being scared and -- and --
L:  Well, they most probably get, like, 'cause you -- you -- no doubt you have to get somebody to put them forward, right?
R:  You have to do what?
L:  To -- to volun- -- [NOISE] they're mostly friend -- friends or family that would volunteer this person to do this.
R:  Y- y- -- uh, yeah, they --
L:  So, they most probably --
R:  -- set 'em up.  Right, exactly.
L:  -- most probably ask, like, the friends and family, do they have any history of, you know, mental illness?
R:  Oh yeah, that could be true.
L:  [LAUGH] Heart disease?
R:  That might be the w -- that might be the way --
L:  You know?
R:  -- they pick 'em, you know?  Do they have -- do they -- do they pass out from the sight of blood, that kind of stuff, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That might be --
L:  Yeah, you know, they -- they most probably have to do some kind of -- because even when you're on TV and y- you're doing nothing, you have to sign a disclaimer.
R:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
L:  You know?  So -- so therefore, you know, they -- they have to sort of do research on the people from their friends and family to find out, you know, what will affect them, what won't affect them and then, at the end of the day, those people will have to sign a disclaimer to say that they will show that footage, they'll allow that footage to be shown.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure that there's more people not signing it than there are people signing it though. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  You know, because people just don't wanna be seen on TV being scared to death, I don't think.
L:  Yeah, crapping their pants.  It's not a good thing. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  Not really. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I never ever -- did you ever watch a- any of those, um, Big Brother shows?
R:  Um, actually I did, uh, watch them last season, and I think the s- s- second season that they were on, I looked at 'em, but I didn't really watch 'em, um, like, for, you know, like on a regular basis.  But, yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I have seen those and there's some other ones too like that, like those, um, like Real TV and Real World, I mean, yeah, Real World on MTV and -- and -- shows like tha- --
L:  Yeah, I saw Real World, like, years ago [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they first starting doing it, and I thought it was kind of interesting --
R:  Real --
L:  -- but I haven't watched any of those Big Brother --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, things.
R:  I've only seen a couple of those episodes and they didn't appear to me -- they didn't -- they didn't appeal to me all that much, and what's really interesting about the Big Brother series though is the fact that they've got them online twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, see --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so you watch them on -- you can watch the cameras online all the time, and there are so many people that got into that, I could not believe, you know, some of the num- --
L:  It takes voyeurism to a whole another level, doesn't it?
R:  Oh, doesn't it?  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  And that's --
L:  And it's kind of startling to think that people are so interested in knowing what other people are doing at any given time.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I mean --
R:  I- i --
L:  -- it also takes away e- every --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- kind of ounce of your privacy --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  See, I can't --
L:  So, I -- I --
R:  [COUGH] I'm --
L:  -- I can't deal with that.
R:  No, I wouldn't -- I would never sign on to be on something like that.  I -- I personally wouldn't never do a re- -- a -- a -- a real TV type, uh, you know, thing, uh, uh, y- -- I -- I just couldn't do that.  You know, there's no way. [LAUGH] 'Cause --
L:  I'd do The Bachelorette.
R:  You would do The Bachelorette? [LAUGH]
L:  Hell, yeah.  Why not?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but --
L:  You know, if they're gonna, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- set you up with twenty really good looking guys, they're going to pay for everything --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're going to have great wardrobe, great make up, great hair, and you may even get decent shag out of it, I'm, like, why not?
R:  Hey, you know what?
L:  You know, I mean, look at -- look at the money that, like, Joe Millionaire, um, +Evan what's his face is making in endorsements.
R:  Yeah, five hundred thousand dollars each, right, and then all the contracts afterwards, yeah.
L:  Yeah, he's making so much money from all the endorsements since he's done that.  I'm like, sure, I'll do that if I'm going to make a couple of mill in the next year and then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just, like, fade away into oblivion again.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Why not?  But, I mean, all the other shows, I'm just, like, not interested, and I'm not interested in watching them, I'm just, like, p- -- I'll participate if you want me to, but I'm not going to be one of fifty girls that you're going to choose from, 'cause I know you're going to boot my ass out.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- that's a -- that's -- that's the -- that's the thing there, that, you know, I think my husband would have a problem with me doing The Bachelorette. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, you could do the merry widow. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, if I told him how much -- I don't know, if I told him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, although if I told him how much money was involved, he might not be so upset. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, you could be the merry widow.
R:  No, yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry, honey, you gotta go. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's very funny.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I -- I'm just not attracted to those, um, those shows at all.  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm -- I'm addicted to, like, the History channel and the Learning channel and --
R:  Me too!
L:  -- at the moment I'm watching -- I'm watching a -- a wonderful documentary all about, like, the ancient Egyptians and who was the real, um, ah, Scorpion King, you know?  And it's just, like --
R:  That is so amazing that -- I'm -- I'm not watching that particular series right now, but I'm -- I'm addicted to those channels as well.  The Home Garden, the, uh, um, the TLC netwo- -- you know, the network for TLC --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all those, you know, like, my -- my -- all them --
L:  Um, all about history and -- and w- -- and also the crime shows, like, um, the forensic science shows and, um, like, crimes that have happened in the past and the cold case files and that kind of thing.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm kind of -- I'm into all of those types of shows, but as far as, like, reality TV, I'm, like, it's a waste of space.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, obviously they're trying to put trash out there, I'm not really into it, but [several inaudible words] fall into that category. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I -- I think you're absolutely right.  It's, uh, that's amazing that they connected us together, that we're both interested in those kind of things and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not interested in reality TV at all.
L:  You know --
R:  I mean, you know, it's a -- maybe a -- like I said, a passing show I will look at, you know, and like the --
L:  Exactly.  If I'm flicking around and I see something that looks kind of interesting or if I'm at a friend's house and it's on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I won't -- I won't deliberately sit down and, like, you know, set my timer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that it comes on, you know, or, like, "Oh my God, it's Fear Factor time" or it's, you know, Big Brother --
R:  Right.
L:  -- time and --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, uh, people are so into, like, the Scorpion King and even, like, American Idol.  I haven't watched any of that.  I think I watched, like, the first show when they had all the really bad auditions --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I was just, like, you know what?  That's just really sad that someone's going to be that harmful and that cruel to someone, you know, like Simon.
R:  Simon, you're talking about? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, Simon, and it's, like, you know, I'm pretty sure that he really sucks at some things as well, and I'd really like to see him, you know, be put in his place.
R:  Yeah, that would be g- -- well, uh, I think that, uh, I think that, uh, what's her name?  The, um, oh, I can't remember her name now, the, um, uh, Paula.  I think Paula put him in his place one time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I remember.  She really got, uh, she really ragged on him, 'cause he -- he made one of the girls cry really bad, and she wasn't that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she wasn't that bad.  I saw that episode, she wasn't that bad, and Paula really kinda said some things that kind of got even a little bit for the girl for him, so -- you know, on him, so that was pretty cool.  But, yeah --
L:  Yeah, but it's, like, the number of times
