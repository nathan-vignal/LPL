L:  Hello -- 
R:  Hello -- 
L:  Hey, um, this is Jenny -- 
R:  Hi.  Um, this is Andrea.  How are you doing -- 
L:  Hi.  How's it going?
R:  Um, okay, I kind of missed the -- the list of options that they gave in the beginning. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I caught smoking.
L:  Okay.  Um, there was -- this is my second time doing this.  Am I supposed to, like, did they -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, put me on the list twice or something?  But, um, it's gossiping and, um, hm, I think -- 
R:  I think it was -- 
L:  -- lack of exercising, overeating.
R:  Oh, I heard -- yeah, I heard that one.  Um, okay, well, I know that a personal habit that I found annoying from -- from other people that I know is, um, smoking 'cause -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of my friends and my sister smokes at least -- she smokes at least a pack a day and it's annoying because she -- if she does it in the same room then it fills up the room with smoke and the smell.  And if she has to leave the room then it interrupts whatever we were doing.  Like, if we were talking or eating or watching a movie then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, like, it's just really -- it's really anti-social kind of behaviour.
L:  Yeah.  Ah -- 
R:  I -- I -- I -- I don't -- I'm not against people smoking in public.  It's just that when it's somebody I personally know, it can -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be annoying.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- a lot of my friends smoke and [several inaudible words] okay and I guess they're used to other people not wanting them to smoke because every time that I say it's okay to smoke in my car they're just completely shocked.  They're like, "You're the nicest person on earth".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, like, no matter how poor they are they always have money for an extra pack of cigarettes and that's why -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- the thing that causes them a lot of stress too, like, every time they can't find a cigarette I see how much they panic.  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- 
L:  -- It just sucks.
R:  -- that's true.  I -- I know I've heard that one of the best ways to quit smoking is just to have a jar and put all the money that you would have spent on a pack of cigarettes in the jar and at the end of one month just see how much you've saved and buy something nice with it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  I -- it's -- it's expensive and it -- all it does is shorten your life, I guess.  But -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  Um, I guess the other pet peeve [LAUGH] that I have, um, is when people gossip.
L:  Yeah, oh, my God -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's, like, the biggest thing.  I went to an all girls high school -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and everybody gossiped to everybody.  I just hated it.  I just never went to school.  I just -- even the teachers would gossip and so, like, I personally have been affected more by gossiping than smoking -- 
R:  Ah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] but, then it's like, I gossip too.  It's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so fun when I gossip.
R:  Well, that's true, I -- you -- [LAUGH] --
L:  So, it's like I can't speak that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I know that I -- I get annoyed when people do it to be malicious.  But -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it's okay if you're in the middle of a conversation and -- or -- or, like, you're -- you're two friends and you're just having a good time and you're -- and it's a big joke.  I think it's okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, when you're doing it to, I don't know, to ruin somebody's reputation, then that's when it's a problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  I guess gossiping -- I mean, gossiping sounds bad.  But, then it's not like you're -- I don't know, like -- 
R:  I think it's ha- I -- I find it hard to tell what's gossip and what's just, like, "So, this is what happened in my day".
L:  Yeah, like, "This person got pregnant" or, "Look, this person got into Stanford" or something like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is that gossiping?  I guess it is, like -- 
R:  Um, I don't -- I don't know.  Well, I think it depends on what intentions you have.  If you -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if you don't -- if you're not really concerned about the person, like, if you say, "Well -- well, this person -- something -- family member passed away and blah, blah, blah" and you're doing it just because you have genuine concern -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or you're doing it because you want to sound like, um -- are you -- you just doing it to get the word around.  I think that's gossip.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, that doesn't -- I -- I guess gossip in general isn't always bad.
L:  Yeah.  Do you think girls definitely gossip more than guys, or are equal?
R:  Um.  I think it -- I think it's equal but it's completely different topics -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- types of gossip and I think what people generally consider is gossip is what girls talk about.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But, I know guys that they're like, um, well, they'll talk about -- about their, like, lovelife or something with other guys and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or they'll talk about girls that they know or, um, or like work.  What's happening at work.  Which is gossip I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I know in my high school there is -- the -- everybody who knew or made a point to, like, know what was going on, especially [several inaudible words] -- it was, like, the more popular people, the more popular crowd -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I guess -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess it was kind of -- it was kind of frustrating especially if -- if you didn't mean for it to happen.  Like, you told somebody who you told not to tell anybody else and --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- of course, that never works.
L:  I think, like, one of my friendships was ruined by my gossiping.  But, I have no clue.  Like, I know I gossiped about her but -- but, she also didn't have that many friends, so she was always, like, hanging around me.  But, everybody would gossip and I'd chime in too.  And, like, after high school we lost touch.  But, I know she moved to Paris and I was going to visit there this year so I called her, just like three weeks ago just to ask her, like, you know [several inaudible words] visit and maybe teach me some French and I thought she'd be delighted -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to hear from me.  And she, like, practically hung up on me [LAUGH].  Yeah, it was like, "Oh, God".
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Is it because of what happened -- 
L:  It must be my gossiping.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, was it stuff that was bad about her or just general --
L:  Yeah, everybody -- 
R:  -- general information?
L:  -- had something bad to say about he.  Like, not about her style, but just about the way she was.  She really kept to herself, was always pissed off and, I guess, that was just not acceptable.  And you know, everybody was all cheery and she was the only one --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- who's like, gloomy.  So -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, I can see.  Well, what do you think -- well, would it be okay if -- if, like, is there a difference between when you're talking about something that's personal that happened to that person, or you're talking about, like, things that you notice about them?  Like, say, well, is there a difference if you were going to say, "Well, this person got pregnant because she slept around a lot" and -- or is she like, "Got into an accident because she was drunk driving" or something or if you were saying something like, "Well.  Well, whenever she passes by, like, she always gives me a stare" or something or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or, like, you know, "He's smelly" or whatever.
L:  I to- --
R:  I think -- I'm sorry?
L:  -- um, the personal stuff is -- I think the personal stuff is more gossipy.  Like, I know that with her.  Just anything that was going on her -- in her life.  Like, people were curious about -- 'cause she would ignore people and so, like, whatever things she told me, I would just let it spread.  Like, "Oh, my God.  She kissed a guy at a bar" or [LAUGH] something like -- that's totally gossip.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Gosh.  I wish -- I mean, I tried to confront her about it.  I was, like, "Can you tell me why you're avoiding me".  And she was, like, "Well, after high school I just really don't need to talk to you" [LAUGH] and she hung up.  So, I really think it was my gossipiness
[?].
R:  Oh, it could be better.  It could be that -- I don't know, maybe her personality -- she just -- I don't know, she didn't want to keep in contact or be bothered or -- 
L:  Yeah.  You would think everybody needs to be bothered some time.  Like, it's really difficult for her to make friends, or at least from what I've seen.  So, I thought, you know, even like a distant friend would be appreciated friend.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I definitely know what you mean, because I have some friends who -- who just, like, are horrible at keeping in touch and it's cool because, especially when you're people who travel a lot and you call them and you want to visit or you want to -- or if they visit they could stop by and stay at your place or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, and, I mean -- ah, especially when you're not going to see that person, what could you possibly have to dislike about them?  Like, if you don't see them that often.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Like, it's not like she -- is your friend, like, sitting at home thinking about how much she hates you or how much [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.  It just somehow managed to linger.  I don't get it.  How about exercise?
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  What are your views on exercise?
R:  Um, I have -- I go through stages, like, especially during the summer I get really hyped up and I go jogging and I do sport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the winter, when it's really cold and crappy out, I hate -- I hate the cold weather.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I tend to, like -- 
L:  Oh, um, are you like in the east coast?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I'm on the west coast where it's [inaudible] -- 
R:  Oh.  That's a little different.
L:  Yeah.  But, I never work out.  I think the more --
