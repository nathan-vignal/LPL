L:  [NOISE] Hi,  it's Rachel. [NOISE]
R:  Erica[?].
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Good. [NOISE]
R:  Good.  Um, so, I guess we're supposed to talk about reality shows.
L:  I guess.  Have you done this before? [NOISE]
R:  I did it once.  Have you?
L:  This is my first time.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  [NOISE] This is the first call that I've actually been available for.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did -- did they call you, or did you call them?
L:  Oh, they called me this time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Next time I'll probably call in to them. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess they've called my cellphone a few times --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I think my --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- phone wasn't working. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Yeah, so we just have to talk for ten minutes, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  So, do you watch reality shows?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, like, Survivor?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I wa- --
L:  Are you going to watch it tonight?
R:  I actually haven't watched it this season, but I watched, um, I think, the past two.  I had a, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- room mate who was obsessed with it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we always had that on.  She actually, um, applied for it and I took a video of her and everything. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh, wow, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, it was kinda crazy, but whatever.
L:  Yeah, my husband and I watch it all the time, but we haven't -- every week he has to tape it, because he [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's how -- that's how I was too.  Um --
L:  We missed [NOISE] the first season [NOISE] but we've been watching [NOISE] this one pretty regularly.
R:  Good to keep it up. [LAUGH]
L:  It's pretty good this -- this time. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's pretty good.  Um, I also watch, like, Real World and some other trashy ones. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What's your favorite trashy one?
R:  Um, pro- probably Real World.  I'm trying to think of other ones that I even watch.
L:  They have, that, um --
R:  Oh, there's, like, Bachelor and all those.
L:  There's like, yeah, like Married by America.
R:  I haven't watched that.  It sounds interesting, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, and I guess American Idol would be considered a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, reality type of show, perhaps?
L:  Right.
R:  Maybe.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's reality based, 'cause you're voting for --
R:  For a real person. [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so why -- why do you think that they're popular?
L:  Um, well, I think because people can relate to 'em.  It's not -- you know, because you know that it's someone's real life that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is being affected and [NOISE] um, I -- I guess 'cause they can relate to 'em.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.  I mean, also, it's -- I guess it probably makes us all feel better if, uh, we see other people are worse off or, uh, that we're not the only ones that make, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ridiculous judgements or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mistakes.  But some of 'em are -- are pretty, um, you know, like the Bachelor and stuff, I don't think most of us would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get married on television or allow somebody else --
L:  I [MN] --
R:  -- to choose.
L:  Yeah, and the Married by America thing is j- just ridiculous. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's crazy.  I mean, come on.  It's funny --
L:  Right.
R:  -- though, because when it comes down to it, like on Bachelor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff, they don't -- they don't actually get married.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I think --
L:  Even after all that.  I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's more for the publicity or --
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  -- um, you know, they probably -- [MN] well, at least the Bachelor himself probably gets paid a lot of money to do it.
R:  Yeah, I w- -- I wonder --
L:  Well, he has a lot of money this time anyway.
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] He doesn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- need it.
L:  Jeeze.
R:  Yeah, I wonder what the -- y- you know, you never know what goes on behind the scenes or what, you know, with the money and stuff.  Or, like, did you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- watch Joe Millionaire?
L:  Yes.
R:  That was --
L:  I did watch it.  It was fun to see them --
R:  I watched it, but it was awful.  Like [LAUGH] --
L:  It was awful.  It was [LAUGH] --
R:  And I couldn't stop watching. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it's just kind of addictive.  You can't ever just turn it off.
R:  Yeah, he was such a tool and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I was just amazed that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these girls who gave themselves to him and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  It was crazy.
L:  Without even thinking about it.
R:  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, the -- I don't know, I think people are also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just desperate to get married, maybe.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  So, I don't know.  I've seen a lot of ads in, uh -- 'cause I -- I don't -- where do you live?
L:  Um, Pennsylvania area, right outside [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay, 'cause I'm in -- I'm in Los Angeles, so there's tons of ads for even -- they're still doing new reality shows and I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- surprised, I thought the trend would die out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I thought it would too, I thought people would get really tired of it.  But --
R:  They probably will though, but they just, you know, they like to suck everything dry , so --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  Well, and even after, like, after the college generation watches it for a while then it'll move down to, like, middle school and then --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] all the elementary schools [several inaudible words]
R:  Be, like, yeah, ten year olds. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, all the [LAUGH] --
R:  Seriously.
L:  Especially with the Bachelor and all those.
R:  Yeah, that Real World show has been around for, what, like, twelve years or something?
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Now, that was the old original reality TV.
R:  Yeah, it's just so good. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And I don't know why.
L:  Right.
R:  But then you have, uh, like, [MN] MTV has some bad ones, like Dismissed.
L:  Right.
R:  That's -- that's painful.
L:  I haven't seen that one.
R:  Oh, it's awful.
L:  I've seen, um, some -- HBO has some too, and there's one on CBS, like, that you, um, watch this family that goes to this mansion and they live there for a while and the wait -- the -- the, like, um, servants are the ones who vote 'em out.
R:  Oh, I didn't -- what is that on?  What channel?
L:  I think it's on CBS, um --
R:  Oh, okay.  I don't know that one.
L:  It was on -- I saw it back, I guess, in February.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, somebody that had cable, so I couldn't see it for a while, but, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, the [LAUGH] -- the butlers and the cooks and everyone, and the people don't know that they're being judged by them.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  So, it -- you know, so if they're rude to the waitress --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or the -- you know, the servant [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, that's smart.  See, that's funny.
L:  -- then they're out. [LAUGH]
R:  That would be funny.
L:  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  That's --
R:  Or -- or they -- yeah.
L:  Hm?
R:  Or they have that other one, um, [LIPSMACK] on, like you were saying, on HBO, that Project Greenlight.  Did you ever watch that?
R:  Uh, uh-uh.
R:  They gave a, um, director they chose -- is, uh, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and they chose a -- a, uh, as- -- an aspiring director to direct whatever he wrote with a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- million dollar budget.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then you just watched, but it was kind of -- in a way, it was a s- slight disaster, just because you're throwing a guy who doesn't have much experience into such a big thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, ma- making a movie is a big deal, you kind of need to, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pressure on you and stuff, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you kinda --
L:  Right. [NOISE] Well, and because [NOISE] there's such a community of people who've been doing it for so long that --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- y- you know, you put yourself out there on the line, and then all of a sudden, someone comes and says, "Oh, your movie sucks --"
R:  Right, no, that's --
L:  "-- and you can never make a good one".  You'd still be banished. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and that's kinda what happens, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  I don't know, people think that they're gonna -- but I know on -- for Real World -- Real World, a lot of people do, um, [LIPSMACK] um, do it, you know, a lot of actors do it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Just because -- but I think that kind of ruins your career.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Because then they --
R:  Because why would anybody cast you? [LAUGH]
L:  I know, [NOISE] no one wants to see the -- that girl from the first --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- season of Real World.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Who was grouchy and, you know, her par- -- she hated her parents --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all that or whatever.
R:  Right, exactly.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Or they have, uh, those blind date shows, or, like Fifth Wheel.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Those are kind of funny.
L:  Right.  Well, I like the, ah, ah, host of that, Aisha Tyler.  She was --
R:  Oh.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- on Friends last week.
R:  She's hilarious.
L:  Yeah, she's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  And then Blind Date with, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the little blurbs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they put.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's really funny.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] I love how they do that. [LAUGH]
R:  And those people get paid two fifty --
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  -- um, per show.  Yeah, and then they get a -- a free meal, but man, they're not very smart.  I mean, it's LA area so you can't really expect much, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's pretty lame.  I actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I actually know a couple of people who have done 'em, and it's ho- -- it's -- it's pretty funny.
L:  I always wanted to know about, um, [NOISE] that show that the Learning Channel does, Trading Spaces.
R:  Oh, it's, like, my favorite. [LAUGH] I totally agree about that.
L:  They do that -- they have 'em out here all the time, 'cause they're based, like, in this area. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, but I wonder if -- I wasn't sure if they paid you to be on the show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, if they paid that thousand dollars or if you have to pay it because you're getting the re- renovations done --
R:  No, I think --
L:  -- and you're getting all the free work.
R:  I think they cover it.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you're -- you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- giving them money by being on the show, basically.  You're giving 'em, you know --
L:  [NOISE] What you're getting on your room and your house --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and you're helping to make stuff too.
R:  So, no, I'm pretty sure that they -- they pay for it.  That's -- because nobody would do it otherwise, 'cause they're not the greatest rooms, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  They're kind of giving it up.  But, yeah --
L:  Yeah, but at the same time you're getting, like, free carpentry and free --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- free labor and free -- a free designer to come and look at your stuff. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  I guess -- I guess that's the deal.
L:  Yeah, but I think --
R:  But --
L:  --  they should pay you too, if they're gonna -- if you're gonna --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because you don't know what you're gonna get.  You can't agree --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- to it for s- --
R:  Yeah, that's kinda --
L:  But --
R:  -- scary.  But maybe that's -- that's part of the deal, that you can't, you know, go against it or you can't, uh --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- complain.  But, yeah, they definitely should get paid, seeing that they're getting -- I mean, reality is so easy for the networks, because they don't -- they're not actors, so they don't have to pay you.
L:  Right.
R:  Or, I mean, they might but --
L:  You --
R:  -- they don't have to give you residuals and all that stuff.
L:  They do the same thing with, like, um, if you take a survey online or something, they -- they give you bonuses and they give you, um, the chance to win something.
R:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, you don't get it for free.
R:  Right.  That's funny.
L:  That's the way that marketing can make money for themselves and not have to spend it on everybody else. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I mean, Trading Spaces, think about it, if you have to pay a thousand dollars a show, it's not -- it's not too bad.
L:  But -- no, not at all.  Because -- and plus they run 'em so many times.  Like, you see the same episode every four days. [NOISE]
R:  Right, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I guess it's really once a week, like Saturdays or something, that the new show is.  But, yeah, and I mean, actors --
L:  Well, they have two episodes back to back and one's a repeat --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and one's new.
R:  'Cause, um, you know, actors get paid a lot more than a thousand dollars, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  For one -- one taping.
R:  Yeah, so that's a lot.  That's a really good deal for all these networks.  I guess they're, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- using what we've g- -- the public has given them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What we enjoy.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] Did you, um, did your room mate ever get called back by S- Survivor?
R:  No, she wasn't very interesting, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, but she was trying.  I mean, even if you got kicked off the first time, it would still be worth going, just to say you were on it.
R:  Yeah, you get to go to, like, Africa, or wherever, that would be great.
L:  Right.
R:  Some great place.  They're -- they're looking pretty skinny this time.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Like --
