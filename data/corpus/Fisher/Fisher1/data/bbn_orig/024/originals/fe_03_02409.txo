R:  Ah, my name is Andy Chin.
L:  Hello, a pleasure to meet you.  I am -- I'm Nina Presty from Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I am fine.  How are you?
R:  I'm, actually fine.  I'm having dinner.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Sorry to interrupt you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no, it's all right.
L:  A-
R:  I just [several inaudible words] out, so it's okay.
L:  What is your choice about all these unhealthy choices.  What do -- what do you feel is worse?
R:  Um, actually, I didn't really hear clearly.  It's, ah, recording is kind of some, um, awful.
L:  Okay, [inaudible] -- 
R:  Like which is the worst was gossiping, smoking, drinking and excessive c- excessive caffeine.
L:  That -- I believe that -- that's basically it.  That's the -- the most important ones.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How's it?
L:  You -- you've -- you've got -- you've got most of them.
R:  Um, okay.  So, from those [several inaudible words] I say -- well, it depends because gossiping would be kind of bad but if then you talk about health wise I would say smoking.
L:  I agree with you.  I think that, although all the choices are unhealthy I think if -- if I'm forced to make a s- choice like I am now, I think it would be alcohol because it does two things.  It causes social unrest, ah, you know -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, and health.
L:  And health.  It causes liver disease.
R:  Right.  [MN] Well, is it just like in general?  Like, which is the worst in general?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [several inaudible words] I agree with you, the alcohol.
L:  Well, you know what -- 
R:  'Cause it affects m- it affects more than just one category.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Um, I  -- I feel that gossiping -- it can be -- it depends on how you look at it because let's face it there's always people who will listen to gossip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And gossip -- 
R:  Right. They could hurt a person's reputation -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they also can endanger someone's life if you gossip.  So, it -- it goes on many levels.
L:  You know, I -- I believe that with alcoholism -- I could be wrong, but I believe that with alcoholism it's like [MN] a double barrel gun.  In other words you're causing -- I don't mean you personally -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but the person that drinks -- I don't drink myself, but, the person that drinks, they're causing, um, even a possible danger for other people as well as endangering themselves for just drunk driving.
R:  Yeah.  I would have to say that for drink -- drinking and driving.
L:  I -- I wish -- I wish that with the choice drunk driving.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, excuse me?
L:  I wish that was one of the choices that would probably win out, you know?
R:  Yeah, that -- that would have been a lot better.
L:  You know, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know what -- what I find very distressful is that there's such a -- a social acceptance of alcohol.  You can even go to a ball game or bowling and there's always liquor available. 
R:  Yeah, that's the thing.  Those are the places where a lot of, ah, fights break out too are ball games.  A lot of riots and stuff.  [NOISE] It's like recently I remember on the news that, ah, a fan ran into the field and beat up the first base umpire.
L:  I read that.  I read that in the New York Post.
R:  Right.  It was -- I forgot -- because he didn't like the call.  And I was like, "Wow, that's a huge fan.  He's --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- a tough fan".
L:  And, are you -- 
R:  I'm not trying to be wrong or anything, but that is kind of crazy.
L:  Well, have you noticed there's always been a strong connection, at least in American culture, between, um, sports and -- and drinking.  It's supposed -- both are supposed to be acceptable for macho men.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It happens in for a lot of occasions, like, for certain things where people are considered, like, not normal unless you drink.
L:  Hm.
R:  It's al- it's almost like, ah, like, ah, the smoking ban in bars.  People -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like, "Oh.  What's go into a bar if you can't smoke and drink at the same time".
L:  I know.  And people are starting to get summonses.  Do you know what the latest thing with smoking here in New York, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a- the latest thing is if you own a restaurant or a bar -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and your customer smokes.  Now, you cannot be on top of everybody at the same time.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You have to run the place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it said in the newspaper that if you are, let's say, a restaurant owner -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, somebody lights up a cigarette.  And -- 
R:  You have to tell him to put it out.
L:  -- if a cop -- if a cop comes in, you can get jail time.  The owner.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I didn't know it's jail time.  I thought it was just a summons.
L:  Well, in -- 
R:  I don't -- don't they get, like, three warnings?
L:  Well, um -- 
R:  They changed it.
L:  I -- I -- you know, you could be correct.  But, I did read something about jail time.  But, I don't know how soon. 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Maybe it is three strikes and you're out.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I remember that's how it was for the restaurants when they first did the ban.  But, that one makes more sense than a bar ban.
L:  But, I think that they're going too far.  That they're going to far --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- overboard.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess it is in the citizens' good nature --
L:  But, you know --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] like people's good nature.
L:  You know human nature, the -- the more they say, "The more something is taboo, the more people will --"
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  "-- do it".
R:  -- 'cause people tend to break rules.
L:  Yeah.  That's actually -- 
R:  That people are.  It's like little kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, "I'll do this" and they just [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and -- and you know, um, I -- I -- I know there are restaurants in, um, [several inaudible words] smoking in Brooklyn where they set aside special rooms that -- and they -- they have barrier -- they have door barriers so that if people smoke, the smoke doesn't get to the other people and the other -- and the other rooms.  And there's been no problem with that.  But, now I don't even know if they'll allow that.
R:  Oh, that's a good question actually.  Yeah, I -- I'm not a smoker but, um, that's a good question.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think you're -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- correct though about the three strikes and you're out.  I think I was wrong.  Um, I think they give you three -- three -- like three summonses or three inspections or something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm not sure.  I -- I -- I don't really go out and, ah, like, I'm not a big smoker or anything like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I used to smoke.  But, the problem was when I was, um -- I started at age twelve.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, well, I'm -- I'm fifty one now but [LAUGH] -- but the thing is by the time I reached my thirties I couldn't breath anymore.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  You know, a drink -- 
R:  So, you're quite right, yeah.
L:  Drinking I never tried ever.  Have you?
R:  Wow, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I have.  Well, I'm not being recorded am I?  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no, no.  I'm -- I'm just an ordinary -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- person at home with the -- with the, a -- a -- a cordless phone.  I have no answering.
R:  Oh, I -- I know.  I'm just wondering 'cause I'm -- I'm kind of under age also.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, how old are you?
R:  I'm nineteen.
L:  You sound older.  You sound very mature.
R:  Oh, well, I was raised that way that's why.
L:  You see, I was raised, believe it or not, not only was there no alcohol at home but, the neighborhoods I've always lived in as a child and a teenager had no bars.
R:  Oh, I see.  That's -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] 'cause, well, I live in Long [inaudible] so, like, basically all the bars are right there.
L:  Oh, God yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  And of course I'm also Asian so Asian families tend to -- tend to drink a lot.
L:  Are you currently in Manhattan did you say?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Are you currently living in New York?
R:  Yeah, I'm still living here.
L:  Oh, I'm not that far.  If I tell you my neighborhood you'll know exactly.  I'm in Brighton Beach.
R:  Oh, that's the -- oh, my girlfriend lives at Shifter's[?] Bay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I used to have a re- my family used to have a restaurant at Shifter's Bay.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  It was a --  
R:  -- it's for --
L:  -- n- there was a restaurant that closed.  I wonder if the -- was it by, ah, the corner of Shifter's Bay [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Close there used to be -- 
L:  -- Shifter's Bay Road.
R:  It closed about almost ten years' ago.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm trying to picture.
R:  It used to be called Lucky Bay.
L:  The what?
R:  Lucky Bay Restaurant.  Chinese restaurant.
L:  O-
R:  It used to be next to, ah, the Italian pizza place, diagonally across [inaudible] -- 
L:  Was it -- was it -- a- 
R:  -- from what used to be [several inaudible words].
L:  -- was it on z as in zebra or Shifter's Bay Road?
R:  Ah, it was on Shifter's Bay Road.
L:  Um, no, that's not the one I'm thinking of.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think yours was like, I'm thinking [several inaudible words] on the other side of -- of -- 
R:  It's a law firm now.
L:  The other side of -- 
R:  It's a law office now.
L:  What?
R:  It's a law office now.  Oh, oh -- 
L:  I don't -- 
R:  -- wait.  Actually, you know where the -- the TK Tang, the karate place is?
L:  Is that near the post office?
R:  Um -- 
L:  The Shifter's Bay post office?
R:  It's on Avenue Z I think.
L:  Z goes down a long way -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] that's on Avenue Z.
L:  See Z -- 
R:  I'm sure it's -- it's right near the train station.  It's right around the corner from the train station.
L:  So, it must be around East Sixteen Street, around there, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's around there.  It's more like -- actually [several inaudible words] Sixteen 'cause when I got [several inaudible words] right there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Lower Manhattan has changed a lot.  It got really upperfied.
R:  Yeah, it has.  But, I'm exposed to it.  So, I don't know, I guess I got kind of used to everything.  But, I -- 
L:  I never -- 
R:  I -- I still know it's reality.
L:  Oh, you know, I never thought that -- that Asians had -- had such a high, um, ah, drinking, ah, drinking a- ah, drinking, um, tradition.  I know the Russians -- 
R:  Oh [inaudible] [MN] -- 
L:  -- are terrible.
R:  If you go to some Chinese restaurants they will, ah, like -- like -- like big togethers, they'll bring out, like, several -- just for like ten people to bring out, at least, like four or five bottles of Cognac --  
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Up -- they'll drink it out -- straight up -- straight out.
L:  It -- would you say that the Chinese people in general have a high degree of alcoholism?
R:  Ah, well, I wouldn't say alcoholism, 'cause I haven't really seen many drunk Asian people.  But, I know -- Asian people tend to have a really high tolerance.
L:  Well, tolerance is -- I guess tolerance is good in a sense because at least, a- you know, it does -- at least they're acting civilized.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I bet you their liver doesn't tolerate it.
R:  Ah, well, I guess you can say that.  But, I don't know.  I see, like, sixty, seventy year old men that still drink and smoke.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, God.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] So, it's either they're very extremely fortunate or, I don't know they got lots of livers or something.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, you know, there could be a genetic predisposition towards fighting the -- ah --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the effects of alcoholism, you never know.
R:  It could be that, but, I -- I think it also has to do with, ah, like the As- the Chinese people, um, the Asians always drink tea.  They drink a lot of soup and herbs and everything.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it kind of -- and -- and the Chinese medicine -- 
L:  Like an antitoxin.
R:  You could say that.  Oh, 'cause there's a lot of Chinese medicine that's not legalized in America. 
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know, a lot of the Chinese people still use them anyway 'cause it's -- we know that it works because it's been around for centuries.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's just not legalized.
