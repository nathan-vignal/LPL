L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Tansy[?].
R:  Hi, thi- -- I'm Diana Keen.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Diana.  I, uh, I guess we're supposed to talk about reality TV.
R:  Right.  I guess -- what do they mean?  Like, um, I guess Survivor or those shows?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Um, have you watched them?
L:  Um, I -- I'm not really too much into them.
R:  Well, you know, I'm not either, to be honest with you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've seen Survivor a few times, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I think I saw How to Marry a Millionaire or something once or twice, you know?  But I -- you know, I'm not really into it.
L:  Yes, neither am I.
R:  Y- you're not eith- --
L:  I -- I watched, um, Millionaire maybe two or three times and then I watched, like, the last show of the, um, the female one?
R:  Oh, i- is that the one where they wind up with the b- -- does she pick -- the bride or something, the bride?
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- you know, I saw that one too, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- what did you think?
L:  Um, I -- I -- I mean, I think they're slightly entertaining.
R:  Well --
L:  I don't think I had anything else to watch on TV that I liked that night --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I'm not -- I'm -- I'm not really into them at all.
R:  Well, actually, you know, I'm not either, um, you know, and I almost want to even -- and I know I've heard about that, you know, um, Survivor and those shows, I think I saw it maybe once, [SIGH] and, I don't know, it just didn't make any reality check with me.
L:  Have you seen the ads of the one, that M- Mr. Personality?
R:  You know, I did, but I haven't watched it.  Is that the one with Monica Lewinsky?
L:  Yes.  I ha -- --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I haven't watched it either, but the, uh, like, the, um, [LIPSMACK] the ads on TV where they show the guy is very upset, and he can't take it any more and he's going to take his mask off?
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think I saw that too.
L:  I mean, my fourteen year old is someone that tells me that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these shows are, like, very, very silly.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I have to probably agree with her for, you know, the little that I've seen of 'em and it doesn't excite me at all.
L:  I know.
R:  You know?
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, you know, you almost wonder if it is really a reality thing or -- or something else, you know?  But, I suppose it is, but, um, and even the one is -- r- remember the one that was on where, um, he picked the bride, their -- they got married or something?  Her name was Darma[?] or Darva[?] or one of those --
L:  Oh.
R:  Did you see it?  Remember that one?
L:  That -- that was the first one.
R:  Was that the first -- you know --
L:  The very, very -- the -- yes.
R:  Did you see that?
L:  The w- -- that they went on a cr- -- no, well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I saw parts of that one, actually.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I did too.
L:  Where you -- where -- yes, I did watch, um, a couple of episodes of that one, where you had the women dressed actually in --
R:  In their wedding go- --
L:  -- their wedding gowns.
R:  Ah, yes, yes.
L:  Yes, a- --
R:  You know, and --
L:  But that, yes, after that one, and the whole thing just blew out and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they had the other -- then -- then came Survivor, and I'm not really into --
R:  No.
L:  -- watching people eat bugs and --
R:  No, I'm not.  I -- you know, actually, to be honest with you, I'm not either.  I'd rather watch a good movie or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on TV, if I'm going to watch it.  I -- you know, sometimes I think the news is better than those shows, to be honest with you.
L:  The only ones that -- well, they're not really reality shows, are like the -- the m- -- the star search ones.
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  I enjoy that more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than any of these --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- even though --
R:  Yeah, I think you're -- I think you're right.  Actually, you know, you can probably call it a reality show in a certain way, because, I mean, they're down to earth people, you know, in doing that.  But I think they're more reality than these other ones were.
L:  Yeah, I think these other ones are people that want to be famous.
R:  I think so too, and they -- you know --
L:  And they want to be noticed and -- and obviously it takes a special personality to want --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to do that kind of stuff.
R:  Well, I suppo- -- you know, I suppose it does, I mean, I wouldn't want to do it.  I couldn't do it, but --
L:  No, neither could I.
R:  -- y- you know, I'm sure there are people that can, but, no, you know, I don't -- I don't even see what people get out of it, I mean, and I've heard people, you know, if they're missing the Survivor and then they have to tape it and have to watch it again, and all this craziness, you know?  [SIGH] And I don't -- I don't see anything in it myself either.  I agree with you a hundred percent -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know?
L:  How old are your -- are you?
R:  Well, I'm fifty seven.  So, I mean, I'm -- you know, been around [LAUGH] a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm forty three, and the little time that I have to watch TV, I really don't want to spend time doing [LAUGH] --
R:  No, actually, me too.
L:  -- watching that stuff, you know?  Ah --
R:  Well, this is it.  This is it.  I mean, you know, um, there's not that much time in a day when you think about it, you know, a- -- with working and everything else, you know, you come home and I -- I just don't want to see a show like that.
L:  No, me neither -- either.
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  Um, I mean, it almost seems like, you know, it's -- you know, even though, like, even the one where they had the bride and groom on and they said they were going to get married, you know it wasn't going to be -- it wasn't going to last, or it wasn't going to be a true thing, you know?
L:  No, and what are the odds of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um --
R:  Well, this is it.
L:  -- people that don't know really anything about each other and go on a couple of dates and --
R:  I know, and --
L:  -- for one, it's just --
R:  You're right.
L:  -- kissing and making out with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the whole other group.
R:  Oh, yeah, you're right.
L:  I m- -- I mean --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- what are the odds of a relationship like that really lasting?
R:  That's right.  I mean, you know it's not going to last.  I mean, people that are in a --a good relationship, you know, to go -- to start with end up separated or divorced too, you know?  Um, and these people don't even know each other, you know?  But I think you're right, I think they're in probably for the name or the fame or somebody would know who they were, you know, something like that.
L:  But let's face it, a lot of people like just crappy TV.
R:  Well, that's true, that -- yeah, you're right, they do.  They don't care what [SIGH] -- you know, it's --
L:  If -- if they didn't, they wouldn't have picked Monica Lewinsky to --
R:  To M- MC it, right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Isn't that the truth?
L:  Y- you know what I'm saying?
R:  I think they s- -- you know, somehow, in -- even in that respect, you think they're probably gonna -- people are gonna to look at it just to see her.  They don't care what the show is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  A- --
L:  But I'm not even interested in her.
R:  And to me, I couldn't care less about her myself too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I -- I really couldn't care less about her.  I think she got too much publicity as it is.
R:  Right.  Oh, I think she did too.
L:  You know?
R:  And I think she only did it for publicity.
L:  Probably.
R:  You know?  I mean, number one, if you or I had an affair with the President, I don't think I'd want anybody to know.  [LAUGH] You know? [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  You know?  But, ah --
L:  No, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I agree w- -- I agree with you too, and -- and I think probably even the guys that are going on that show just wanna go on because she's there.
L:  But did you hear that there's going to be a new, um, reality TV channel?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, are you serious?
L:  Yes.  I -- I think it's, um, some of the people that were involved in some of the reality s- shows.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Um, the actual participants.
R:  Oh, yeah, right.  Oh.  No --
L:  Um, yes --
R:  -- you know, how is --
L:  -- they're putting together a channel --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where it's all r- reality.
R:  All reality?
L:  Yes, all reality.
R:  Can you believe it?  I mean, you know, I don't even think it's reality, to be honest with you, you know?  I mean, [SIGH] how -- how long -- how is this going to last, you know?
L:  Y- you know what's reality is, um, you know those blooper shows where -- like Candid Camera?
R:  Oh, yes, yes.  That, now I --
L:  Well, there you go, that's reality, 'cause people react in a normal way.
R:  They're under normal cir- circumstances.
L:  Un- -- exactly.
R:  Exact- -- you're absolutely right.  I would think that was a more reality show than these --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- other crazy -- yeah, I agree with you on that, too.  And that was kind of funny, because, you know, it -- it could happen.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  You can see yourself, you know --
R:  Yes, you're right.
L:  -- in those situations.
R:  Yeah, you're right, you're right.  And I think -- yeah, I think you're right, I think that was more the reality than what's out today, you know?  And people don't know that.  I think the people that are into these other shows don't even think of that show.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know?  Which is sort of sad, you know, but, I mean, [SIGH] I don't know, I don't -- I don't agree with it either.
L:  Well, you know what it tells you is that there's a lot of -- there's a huge amount of lack of love and warmth --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- out there in the world that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people have to really connect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with TV --
R:  I think you're right, you know, and --
L:  -- and have a fantasy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about being --
R:  I think you're -- yeah.
L:  -- one of those people with a mask and taking it off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and being the bride --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  Absolutely right, you know?
L:  -- you know?
R:  And I think people can't relate on a one to one basis with each other, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  And that's -- and that's what it is, and they feel this is the w- -- this is their outlet to do it, you know?  But, no, I [MN] I don't -- you know, I --
L:  Do you know professionals that like to watch those kinds of shows?
R:  I don't know.  There are, I'm sure there are.
L:  I'm -- I miss -- I'm -- I'm wondering --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- the type of people --
R:  Oh yeah, you're right --
L:  -- that like to watch it.
R:  -- what kind of people would watch it.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and it's sort of sad when, you know, people pick this as a priority to watch on television, as compared to other things that they could be watching or could be doing.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Right, absolutely.
R:  You know?  Um, yeah, you know?  And -- and --
L:  No, I'd much rather spend time with my children.
R:  Well, there you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There you go, I know, uh, you're right, you're right.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Or with my husband.
R:  That's right, you know --
L:  I mean, there's so little time every day for --
R:  When you think of the hours in a day that you're --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- apart, I mean, between work and going here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and er- errands and all this and everything, you don't spend that much time together anyway.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You might as well do quality time instead of sitting and watching a show like this, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  Having some kind of personal connection.
R:  Well, this is it.  And, you know, I've had so many people put themselves in that exact situation and say, "Well, if this was me, I would do this or that and the other thing", you know?  Um, but I -- you know, I agree with you, I don't think it's -- it's anything worthwhile.
L:  I wonder how long they'll last?
R:  Yeah.
L:  As long as people continue to watch 'em --
R:  Well, that -- I'm sure that's what it is.
L:  -- or advertisers continue to --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, pay money during those slots.
R:  Well, that's it.  And look at the advertising that even people are paying to -- to put them on, you know?
L:  True.
R:  It's sad.  It's sort of sad, because this isn't -- you know, this isn't life.  I mean, you know, you figure reality is life and that's not life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  No, it's all fake, and you have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go in under false pretenses --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the guy that pretended to be a millionaire, but he was a construction worker.
R:  Oh, was a cons- -- right, e- exactly.  There you go.  Exactly.
L:  I mean, like, why would you want to do that?
R:  Why would you e- -- you know, and he knew all along he was -- he wasn't a millionaire, you know?
L:  And he picked this girl --
