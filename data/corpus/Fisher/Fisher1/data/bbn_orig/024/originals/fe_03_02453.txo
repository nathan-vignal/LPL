R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Kristin.
L:  Ah, this is Yolanda.
R:  Um, okay, so reality television?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I just watched American Idol last night.  That's the one that I'm most addicted to.
L:  Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, I like, um, the Road Rules and Real World.
R:  Okay.
L:  I really like those shows.  If I miss those shows that's like, ah, what it is, is like, ah, I don't really have nothing going on in my life, no drama, nothing like that, so [LAUGH] -- so I watch that drama.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I w- -- I just watch American Idol.  I used to watch Real World but I haven't watched it in a long time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I think they're so popular because it's real life --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on the television.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, we're getting a -- I guess we're getting a peek into [MN] --
L:  Yes, i- is -- the Real Life is brilliant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] but, ah, the new show now they have is, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, Mr. Personality.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, you know, I think that's great that people really don't get to see because f- -- ah, y- -- if the person looked good you automatically think [MN] that that's gonna make a relationship work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, looking good doesn't make a relationship work.
R:  Although, but you do need chemistry so I don't know.
L:  You know, really getting to know somebody also.  The chemistry could be there but if the person ain't about nothing, you know, you can have chemistry all day long.  You understand what I'm saying?
R:  That's true.  I guess you need to find the -- you also might not choose to meet someone because of how they look.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, you might miss out.
L:  Yes.  So, those the kind of shows that, um, I like and I like the, um, I guess those reality shows too like the, um, what ya call those, um, the court programs?
R:  Oh, on Court TV?
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't think I've ever watched any of those.
L:  Yeah, those, I like those too.  You know, um, [LIPSMACK] um, Texas Justice, ah, um, to me those are like reality show- -- I don't know if those -- those are reality shows or not.
R:  [MN]  I think that, yeah, I mean, now I think reality TV, I think of the ones that are on now because there's always been reality TV and that's been on for a long time.
L:  Yes.  So, um, that's what I like, the Road Rules and Real World 'cause they have, um, they also have, like, um, [LIPSMACK] like, they have to do things to, ah, get money.  They have to do certain events to get money.
R:  On the Road Rules, oh the Road Rules Real World Challenge or something?
L:  Yeah, it's like, you got, um, different strangers come from all over the world, they have, ah, different nationalities and they all come together to live together.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you know you're gonna go through problems with people, [LIPSMACK] you know, some people maybe, you know, have phobias about gays --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, they're probably stuck with one.
L:  Yeah, and some people are like, um, biracial, so you're talking about a black, you're talking about a white, you know, they're like on both sides.
R:  And they're all stuck in a motor home or something, right?
L:  Yeah, so that is the kind of shows I like.  I used to watch the, um, [MN] what you call that other show, um --
R:  On MTV?
L:  They -- they eat all kind of -- they make 'em eat all kind of stuff in the outside, in the wilderness.
R:  Survivor? [MN]
L:  Survivor.
R:  Oh, I never watched that.
L:  Yeah, I used to watch that too but that -- to me that's a lot of backstabbing. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, for money.
R:  'Cause you have to vote other people off to stay on.  
L:  And that Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire ...
R:  That was a long time ago.
L:  You know why people -- e- everybody wanna marry somebody with money.  [MN] So, that show, you know ...
R:  And Joe Millionaire too.
L:  Oh, Joe the Millionaire?
R:  Joe Millionaire too was similar.
L:  Oh, okay, similar to that.  Well, they making all these reality shows is, ah, like one started and everybody started the same trend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like, now you can't get rid of the reality shows now.  They --
R:  Now it's overload.
L:  -- just making up more and more.
R:  Yeah, it's overload.
L:  Yeah, but they just copy off the, you know, what they see somebody else do.  Well, I guess anything to make money, right?
R:  [LAUGH]  But I guess it makes everyone else's own life look so -- look better [LAUGH] when you're seeing all these people.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's true too. 
R:  [MN]
L:  That's definitely true.
R:  Especially, like, [MN] some of the people on the Bachelor and the Bachelorette.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  They don't -- I don't think I would ever be friends with any of those people, but it's interesting to watch them all on television.
L:  Yes, yes, it is, it is, and see how people, you know, really react.  I mean, you know, you know, I wonder if they acting that's like because they on TV or this is how they normally act.
R:  Yeah, seriously.
L:  And most of them really normally act that w- -- the way they act.
R:  I know.
L:  That's why I like the Road Rules 'cause it's like, so real.  People, you know, the people are themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I like to see people be they selves, you know, you express your mind whether you right or wrong, you still express yourself, you know, you don't hold back there because, [MN] um, Samantha there or whatever, you know, you're just being yourself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So if everybody be they self, like, some people have not been exposed around white people.  And some people have not been exposed around black people.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, but I know this -- you know, like, race is always a thing to come up. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, sometimes.
R:  [MN] But didn't they come from -- didn't they come from, the R- -- like, where did they come from that they weren't -- I don't understand.  'Cause isn't -- isn't it -- the Road -- are you talking specifically about --
L:  Yeah, people pick -- they pick someone to come on the show.
R:  Okay.  I thought you were specifically talking about, um, Real World Road Rules, like the challenge.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Th- they have that too.  They go, like, um, they pick people from all over the world.  Like, say, a thousand people went for that, um, interview --
R:  Mhm.
L:  About a thousand people -- they don't pick the people who they want to be on the show.  
R:  Okay.
L:  So it always be mixed, you know what I'm saying?  A little bit of everything on the show. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you have your blacks, you have your whites, you have your Hispanic, you know.
R:  And -- and MTV probably picks the most controversial people that they can, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah.  So, I really -- I really like the show.  They -- they, um -- I like most of the reality shows.  You know, give me something to look at, give me something to do.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  I guess it makes everyone's life seem a little better too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  They're very interesting.  I was, like, "I wish I could be on one".
R:  Yeah, I -- well, I'd like to be on American Idol.  I think they have a pretty good ...
L:  Well, American I- -- American Idol, American Idol ...
R:  That's the one where they're all singing.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't really watch that one too tough[?].  I'm not too crazy about it. 
R:  That's --
L:  I'm not too crazy about that show at all.  
R:  That's the one that I'm watching right now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I -- I said, "Let me go do my survey".  So, m friend told me they was doing it on reality shows so I was kinda, you know, that's a good topic to talk about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's not --
R:  There's a lot to say 'cause everyone's watching them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I like them.  I like them.
R:  Like, when Joe Million- Millionaire was on everyone at work was talking about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's another reason why people watch it, because everyone's talking about it.
L:  Yeah, and, you know, it's exposure.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Once they get the exposure then, you know, i- i- it -- it becomes -- it becomes a hit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- it becomes a trend that everyone follows.
R:  And -- and --
L:  Now, everybody like those kinda shows 'cause the more you see it the more you gonna wanna watch it.  
R:  Yeah, and they --
L:  Especially if they have some juicy stuff in it.  You're like, I can't watch it next week.
R:  If there's controversy, exactly.
L:  Yeah, just like, you know, you know when the talk shows used to come on?
R:  Like Jerry Springer?  These have re- --
L:  Like Jer- Jerry Springer.
R:  Yeah.  These have replaced him, I would think.  I think they're more popular.
L:  His -- his shows still come on.  I think his -- his show's garbage to me.
R:  I think that's more staged than the reality shows.  [LIPSMACK]  I -- I think reality shows are more real than him.
L:  Yes, yes.  His show's a fake.  His -- his show is not -- I don't think his show is a reality show.
R:  No, now we know what real- reality is no one watches him any more.  [MN]
L:  Yes.  But I wish I could be in a reality show.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know any one --
L:  See, just to see how I'll act, you know, being on a camera, you know, will I really be myself?  Can I really be myself?  You know, knowing that the camera's on me all the time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- 'cause you know, they'd be laying up on the bed having sex and they'd be talking about each o- [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about each other.
R:  It's crazy.
L:  So, you wanna get to see how two faced the people really are on reality shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [several inaudible words] start talking.  It's a lot of, ah, controversy, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  And then you have some on this side and then some are [inaudible] on the other side --
R:  [MN] Yeah, and you also --
L:  And then, you know, you've got to vote people off the show and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's when it becomes back stabbing.  There's somebody on my other line and I can't answer it.
R:  Oh, yeah, it will disconnect you.
L:  Yeah, I c- -- I can't answer it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, I thought [MN] -- it seems like ten minutes is up already, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's been like, um -- I think we have a few, ah, like, another minute.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, so ...
R:  [MN] But I don't even know if people are really acting like they do on these shows.  You don't know how m- -- [MN] I don't know if it -- if it shows them how they really are ...
L:  Yeah, some of them show how they really are.
R:  [MN] Well, I -- I know that they do but I'm wondering if people are acting for benefit of the camera [MN] 'cause they all want to be on TV eventually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when it's over.  So, you're wondering if maybe they're doing more than they normally would.
L:  On the rally, o- o- o- on, ah, Road Rules -- Rules it all seems too real to me.  It don't seem like -- it don't seem like they acting in front of the camera or anything.
R:  [MN] Also, now on Real World they have to get a job or something too, so that's kinda ... I liked it better before when they didn't, they could all just, like, sit around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] But now they have to actually work somewhere, I think.
L:  Yeah, they go, like, different places.  
R:  Yeah, they have, like, challenges and things which is weird.
L:  Yes, yes.  And, you know, you gotta win money for your team or they had the, um, the men against the women. 
R:  [MN]
L:  That's what I like about Road Rules.  I mean, I used to watch it every day --
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm watching it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I miss it now because they don't have the new one.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, they'd be in Vegas, they'd be in Chicago, they'd be all over the world.  Some of them would be on a ship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you get to really travel all over the world.
R:  Yeah, it's been all over the place.
L:  And then some go to, ah, the family's house.
R:  Mhm
