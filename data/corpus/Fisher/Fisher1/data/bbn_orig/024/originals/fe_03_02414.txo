L:  Um, hi, my name is Jennifer.
R:  Hi, this is John.
L:  Hi John.  Ah, I'm sorry, I wasn't too clear on what the topic was.
R:  Ah, I think it is what do you find, um, most offensive and it gave you, um -- 
L:  Like smoking.
R:  -- a number of choices like smoking -- 
L:  Drinking.
R:  -- ah, drinking, um -- I guess individuals that are over weight, um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- etcetera.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I see, okay, ah, so have you -- have you done this before?
R:  Well, gossiping.  Gossiping was a --
L:  I see.
R:  -- um -- 
L:  Offensive topics.  So -- so have you actually done this before yourself?
R:  No. This is the first time.
L:  First time for me too, okay.  But, ah, so we just are supposed to talk about it, right?
R:  I think so.  Um -- 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Well, I find all people are offensive, how about that?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] You've got to wait.  I can't -- I can't right now.  [NOISE] I can't.  [NOISE] I have no idea, all right.  Um, anyway, okay, so what do you find most offensive?  People that interrupt you while you're on the phone.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah, actually it's -- 
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- probably -- yeah, probably -- I'd probably have to say maybe smoking -- 
L:  Smoking.
R:  -- especially if I'm out at a restaurant -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and, um, you know, if I'm dining -- 
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- um, you know, I -- I kind of -- I find that, ah, somewhat offensive there.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but, um, especially more so with your cigar smoking and pipe smoking -- 
L:  I see, mm.
R:  -- than, yeah.  Although -- 
L:  What -- 
R:  -- you know, occasionally I will smoke a cigar.
L:  I see.  Well, I'm actually --  
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- a -- a -- I'm actually a smoker myself but, I mean -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I have -- I have two children so, I mean, I'm real cognizant of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't smoke around my kids and I don't smoke in the car and I don't smoke in the house or anything like that.  So -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, I know how it is, ah, because most of them have problems and, I mean, it's my choice.  You know, th- the way I see it, I know most people don't at all, but I see it as my choice and, you know, to smoke and if I want to do it I should, you know, with myself and that's it, you know?  If somebody joins me that's one thing but I shouldn't push it on anybody else -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just like anything else, like cussing or -- 
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think, ah, I think a lot of this is, ah, you know, it depends on the environment --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- If I were at -- at a movie -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I would find gossiping, you know, ah -- 
L:  Right, that's true -- 
R:  -- you know, individuals who are, you know, ah, you know, whether they're -- they've seen the movie and they're gossiping about the movie or whether it's about, you know, ah -- 
L:  Nothing to do with the movie.
R:  -- nothing to do with the movie -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Right -- 
R:  -- right, um, that bothers me.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, so, I mean, how about yourself?  What do you find offensive?
L:  Um, mm, I'm really not easily offended.  I -- I -- I [inaudible] -- I mean, anything's disrespectful is -- is most offensive to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, regardless of, you know, the person that's receiving it or that's giving it.  I mean, I don't think there's any reason ever for anybody to be respectful at all.  Like, you know, if you really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if -- if you have a respect then, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it makes the world go around, I think, and you know, it makes even life a lot easier for everybody and just makes the life, the world just a lot easier to live in if people just have mutual respect from the beginning.  I mean, if I'm going to the grocery store and I'm having a bad day, you know, there's no point in me taking it out on the guy who's bagging my groceries or putting them in the car.  You know, I mean, he's got a job to do and that's what he's doing it.  I mean, likewise, if he has a bad day, I mean, he shouldn't, you know, smash my eggs down into the back seat of my car.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I mean, it's -- it -- it goes both ways --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and that's, ah, I guess maybe it's mostly about pet peeves that we're supposed to be -- a- a- a- that's the way I see it anyway and that's like the biggest one I have.  I mean, I give out respect to people and I just expect it back.  You know, there's no reason -- I mean, unless I do something offensive or wrong, I mean, I don't really see any reason at all for anybody to -- to do that and that's pretty much where I am.  I mean, if you drink, that's your business.  If you smoke, it's your business.  If you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gossip -- sometimes I get in on it, sometimes I don't, you know?  [LAUGH] But, I mean, for the most part it's -- it's -- it's respect issues. 
R:  My big thing was smoking, um, this is -- 
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- ah, I don't know, you know, I guess, many years ago and, you know, how they -- at least when I was going through high school and -- and how they used to teach ya, you know, second hand smoke -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- is -- 
L:  Right.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know, [several inaudible words] takes ages, you know, just as bad as whether, you know, it's almost equivalent to as if you were smoking -- 
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know, but then again, you know, I think, um, you know, in public places now the -- the designate areas for individuals to -- you know, smoking, like you said it's, you know, someone's choice and, you know, if I'm a non-smoker I don't particularly have to be in that.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  In that particular area -- 
L:  Yes.  I mean, I personally, if I'm in one of those areas and I'm smoking and somebody walks by and they make a face or they don't like -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it, I mean, to be quite honest with you, I mean, I particularly get offended.  I mean, this particular country was founded on the rights of our people and, I mean, just because I choose to smoke, I mean, that is my choice and I have the right to choose that.  I mean, just the same as they have the right to not choose and if they choose not to, that's okay.  I mean --  
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm going where I'm supposed to go to smoke a cigarette and, you know, I don't -- I mean, I find comments like that particularly offensive because I'm doing what I'm supposed to do if -- if I make that choice.  I mean, I'm not doing it outside of an area or I'm not forcing it on anybody.  And I mean, I do get that myself, like, people will walk by and they'll, like, start choking and they'll look at me and it -- it's like, well, I mean it's clearly marked that this is an area, and if it's something that irritates you or bothers you, I mean, there's always a way around that area.  So, you know --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, in a -- in a sense that's offensive to me as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, I mean -- 
R:  See -- see -- see some things they will -- you know, when we consume alcohol the only person you really, you know, ultimately are hurting or affect- it affects you.  You know what -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I mean?
L:  Ye- yes -- 
R:  Unless, ah -- ah, you know, unless you go to the extreme of, ah, you know, in- intoxication and you, ah, get -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- behind the wheel of a car and you -- you -- you wind up, you know, ah -- 
L:  Right, or you're pregnant.  I mean, I -- I -- I -- I find that offensive -- 
R:  Well -- or -- exactly, exactly.  Yeah, that's a good point -- 
L:  -- I mean, I find that extremely offensive, women who are -- 
R:  So, that --
L:  -- pregnant --
R:  -- I mean -- 
L:  -- and drink, you know.  I've -- I've -- I've seen people do that --  
R:  Like, see, I don't find drinking -- I -- I think drinking is a great social thing, you know?
L:  Right, I mean, I'm the same way -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- I mean, I'm completely the same way.  But, I mean, I've -- I've actually seen somebody who was pregnant and drinking -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I was just like, "What are you thinking?"  I mean -- I mean, to me that is highly offensive.  I mean it's -- it's disrespect for life.  It's -- it's disres- you know, it's irresponsibility completely.  I mean, there's nobody who forced that person to have sex.  Nobody forced that person to have a child, you know, or to --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get pregnant.  And I mean, you're not, you know -- you're not being responsible with the gift that you have.  So, I mean, I -- but, I'm -- I'm the same way.  I mean, I -- I know people who find drinking very offensive and like you say, I mean, as long as you're not -- I mean, there are people who get drunk and get very belligerent.  You know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what, there's also people who drink and can't handle it and they choose not to drink because of that and somehow they have some problems with it usually because they can't handle it +their +self.  But, I mean, I'm a drinker, I'm a smoker [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I mean, I'm -- you know, but, at the same time I'm, you know, again it goes back to -- 
R:  Are you -- 
L:  -- I'm very respectful of other people and their choices.  I don't ever force it upon anyone or, you know, if somebody doesn't want it in their house, I'm not going to bring it in their house, and I'm not going to smoke around anybody else if they find it [MN] you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- offensive, you know?  I mean, that's just the way it is.  I mean -- 
R:  Are you from, ah, Philadelphia?
L:  What's that?
R:  Are you from Philadelphia?
L:  No, actually -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in Houston, Texas.  I'm originally from Louisiana and I migrated here, like, seven years ago and -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, here -- I'm from -- I'm right outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Really?  Ah, um, my best friend used to live -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- right over there.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] area.
L:  I see.  I'm not too familiar with the area.  But, she was in, um, Jersey somewhere.  I did, ah -- like, she was like an hour outside of Philadelphia or something and it's somewhere in New Jersey.  So, ah -- 
R:  See, yeah, I'm in the -- I'm in the restaurant business and, um -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- um, well, a lot of that goes on.  You know, obviously in the restaurant business --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] you know, out drinking and smoking -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, and there's everything that'd be brought up between gossip and, you know?
L:  Yeah, you've got it all right there in a restaurant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For sure, yeah.  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  But, um, I don't know.  I mean, are you -- w- with smoking, that's just something that, you know, I never really -- I don't know, I -- I -- I -- 
L:  Considered.
R:  -- yeah, I never really got, you know, got into.  Um, but, like I said every now and then one thing that I -- you know, I tried.  You know, I tried, like, smoking a cigar --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I actually find that, you know, kind of relaxing.
L:  Right.
R:  And if anything's offensive it's cigar smoke.  [LAUGH] You know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- people should probably -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, cigarette smoke.  The -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- they've grown up.  My parents, like, when we used to sit down and have dinner, um, you know, my -- my mom [several inaudible words] she would smoke right before we were -- you know, before I was finished eating.  And I mean, that's something for -- for, um, going back to my childhood, that really bothered me.  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, eventually, you know, the -- I just caught on.  You know, like, "Wow.  You know, why isn't John finishing his meal.  Eat it up". 
L:  Right.
R:  It came to the point where they couldn't really control their cravings for the nicotine where they would, you know, [several inaudible words] smoke.
L:  Really, wow -- 
R:  They came -- yeah.  I -- I mean, they would smoke.  Both [several inaudible words] um, eventually -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] they walked into the other room and, you know, had their cigarette --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and eventually they were able to, ah, control the cravings and just kind of refrain from doing it, you know?
L:  That's really funny -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- 'cause I mean, I -- I smoke and it -- I mean -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- really it's not so much a social smoke.  But, my -- my mother smoked -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as well and now that my -- my kids are younger, like, eight and one's about to be three in July.  But, you know, I've made a conscious decision that, I mean, not right now I'm not going to do it right now but within the next three or four years, I mean, I'm going to stop.  Because I mean, when I grew up I saw my mom smoking and it sounds really silly, I mean, nobody really understands it, I guess, unless they've been in it.  But, it's like, I never smoking as being a bad thing because my mom did it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I realised you're one of m-
