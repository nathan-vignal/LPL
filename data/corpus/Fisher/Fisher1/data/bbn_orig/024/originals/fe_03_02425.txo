R:  Ah, Majonu[?].  How're you doing?
L:  I'm all right.  How're you doing?
R:  Ah, I'm all right.  Ah, this is my, ah, second time of doing this.  How about you?
L:  Yeah, mine too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good.  Well, for me the bad habit is like smoking and probably, like, not exercising a whole lot.
L:  Yeah, well, I would say that and -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and kind of drinking too, you know what I mean?  Just like -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you do that too much and really got some issues on it.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel that.  So, um, um, I would -- I couldn't see myself doing -- doing that too much but I have seen other people.  They're, ah, overeating, overdrinking, then it's like and they're -- they're just like sick dogs and stuff.
L:  Yeah, oh.
R:  It's like, "Man.  I don't know how you can deal with it".
L:  Um, you know, it's just like -- 
R:  And then they, um, then they consider that [several inaudible words].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm not a, you know, big alcohol drinker.  But, you know, I do drink beer occasionally.  I just -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't make it a real, real big habit, you know, 'cause, um -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  Habits are hard to break sometimes.
R:  That's true.  Yes.  And it -- it -- it's hard to get into habit too.  Like -- 
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- I'm trying to get into this habit of exercise.  I've been trying for about three months now, trying to get into a regular routine.  And then it's like I'll go for a couple of, you know, a -- a couple of times a week and then the next week I'll -- I'll fall off and have to start all over again [several inaudible words] like I hate -- I can't get over that first initial -- ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have to go again.  I have to go again.  What about you?
L:  Well, I -- I kind of like -- I kind of had to make -- broken out my hab- you know, it's like, hardcore habit, you know.  So, I kind of had to make that my habit, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  It's like, um, because I'm -- I'm a model, you know, so it's like -- 
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- they always expect you to keep in shape, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I'm one of the lazy ones.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, I'm a procrastinator.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, it's like, "Ah, I'll do it later".  It's like the -- 'cause later never comes and then --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I say, I'm not looking -- I'll look in the mirror or something and it's like, "Damn, I can't -- I can't zip these clothes no more --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- what happened?"  Oh, I guess it's all about eating and not exercising.
L:  Definitely.  Definitely.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  I don't know.  Cigarettes, you know -- I'm -- I'm a smoker too and I'm trying to quit.  So, yeah, very, very bad habit.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, was is the -- what's the hardest thing about trying to quit.  Is -- is it -- it's just knowing that you -- that you're used to doing it all the time or -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or is -- or do you feel the urge?  Are you addicted to the nicotine part of it?
L:  Mm.  Um, I'm pretty much -- it's, ah, it's pretty much the urge, you know?
R:  The urge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's like, if I'm -- 'cause I've been smoking since I was, like, maybe nine -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, it's, like, kind of weird to not having a cigarette, you know?
R:  Yes.  Yeah, it's just like what you do when you do, you know, instead of.  You're doing the cigarette thing, huh?
L:  Yeah.  It's like -- yeah.
R:  Ah.  But, that's it, er, I mean, if you're a model -- that kind of life, one of those things that you d- it's kind of a requirement or, at least -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] typically speaking, it's kind of one of those things that, like, you have -- if you're a model you have to smoke or something like that.  Is that true?
L:  No.  I mean, I [several inaudible words] -- I was like every day when [several inaudible words] the women do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know, most men they're like -- oh, it's -- it's -- it's easier for us to keep in shape, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  So, we -- we pretty much do whatever we want.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I suppose.  That was kind of cool that y- y- you stay pretty busy then, huh?
L:  Yeah, I do.  Well, now since, you know, since September eleventh everything has been real slow lately.
R:  Mm.  Was it just that time of year?  I know, like, ah, for -- for doing, like, sales and stuff like that, it's kind of slow right now because everybody's on hiatus and all that crap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that the same way for your -- your industry too?
L:  Most definitely.  Especially for -- for +urban, you know, I know it's like really, really, really, really slow.
R:  Mm.  I know for er- and partly it's -- it's really what you say cut throat.  How do you call it, cut throat, when you're very competitive?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it's not, um, 'cause it's so concentrated, or something like that.  And, ah, if there's a lot of, um, models like yourself.  Are you black?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Are you black?
L:  No.  I'm Puerto Rican.
R:  Oh, you're Puerto Rican.  Oh, cool.  [LAUGH] Well, then you have -- you have more than one way you can go.  You can play the black card or you can play the -- the Latin card then, huh?  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  A lot of people mistake me for black though.
R:  Ah, is that right?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause like if you was, like, if you saw me I would actually look black to a whole lot of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then, you know, the way I talk and the way I carry myself -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody's like, you know, always questions, "Are you black?" "Ah, no --
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- it's just the way I was brought up".
R:  I hear you.  So, what you was in a predominately black neighbourhood then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It rubs off don't it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm black and, like, I -- I don't think I'm -- I d- I don't think I act that black.  A lot of my friends tell me I need to take herb and want to know why.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm like a valley person 'cause [LAUGH] I grew up in the v- in the San Fernando Valley, right?
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That area.  So, it was like, ah, ah, I would -- I became more accustomed to the Anglo -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- way of thinking [several inaudible words] or something like that.  So, it's like that -- 
L:  Well, that is cool man shit.  I would -- I would have loved to, like, you know, lived somewhere like that.  'Cause, ah, I live in New York and [several inaudible words] like -- 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, what part?
L:  Um, I -- I'm from Brooklyn.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  But, I'm living in Manhattan right now.  You know --  
R:  Mm.
L:  -- me and my wife just got married recently.  So, that's another bad habit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How're you going to say that?  [LAUGH] Ah, but it -- it can have its, ah, good points, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah, it could.
R:  I'm sure it has good points but then sometimes it's being satisfied with one person all the time it's -- it can get to you after a while.
L:  Definitely.  And then, you know, she doesn't let me drink.  So, sometimes I have to, like, you know, if I'm in the mood for a beer -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- I'll, you know, go out and sneak one.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  But, it's cool, you know?  She's understandable of that at least.
R:  That's good.  Sometimes, ah, women can not be that understanding.  It's, like, they have this -- this idea of what you should be doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's about it.  It seems like, "No".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and if we -- we was to give them the same advice they'd freak out, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They don't want to -- they wouldn't want to hear it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Things like, " [several inaudible words].  No, it's just our way or no way at all" kind of --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- thing.  Their way or no way -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, "I don't think so.  [LAUGH] There's more than you in the world" --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- thankfully!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I am but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- one person, but that's cool.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how is it?  It's -- I -- I hear that the rent out there's pretty expensive.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely -- 
R:  Oh, that sucks.
L:  -- it's, like -- we pay rent now and we pay, like, fourteen sixty, and we live in a studio.
R:  Damn.
L:  So -- 
R:  I can't -- can't complain too much about my seven fifty then, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] That -- 
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- was a share.  I would love to --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- find an apartment for seven fifty right now.  And they have them out here, you know, like in Brooklyn or Queens or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it's kind of hard, you know?  A lot of people are taking them in.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And so -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] like, you guys get a lot of a -- a lot of um, what is that, transplants from overseas and stuff, all right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, baby [several inaudible words] it's crowded huh? 
L:  Hm, very.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  I mean, it's [several inaudible words].  Whatever.
R:  Yeah, they did -- I guess they need somewhere to go to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At least for a little while.  [LAUGH] Just like, out here is -- you get a lot of, um, like, college students that come and they stay until they get their little degrees and then they go back to their country and all --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- that stuff.  And not as much -- 
L:  Most of all as people tend to stay here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, there's a lot to do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, there is -- 
R:  Yeah, it's just -- 
L:  New York city's a big place.
R:  Yeah, a city that never sleeps [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Mhm.  And actually, ah, Bloomberg's[?] trying to, you know, shut down the clubs at two o'clock now.
R:  You're kidding me?
L:  Yes.  It's like -- you know, it's not going to happen because right now they just past a law that you can't smoke cigarettes in a bar and you can't smoke cigarettes in a club or anything like that.
R:  Well, see, they have that out here too.  But, they have the designated areas where you can go and smoke.  So, it's like a lot of, you know -- inside the club you can't smoke but they always have the little patios and junk where people can go out and smoke.
L:  Yeah.  Out here we don't have any of this.  If we did, people wouldn't complain, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  But, um, even people that don't smoke, you know, they complain about it.
R:  Mm.  That's if that it should it be there?
L:  Yeah, 'cause, you know, it's something else to be -- you know, some people don't smoke until, you know, when they're drinking at the bar they tend to have a cigarette or two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, s- some of them don't inhale, you know, just -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just for the effect, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Of course.  Yeah, I understand that.  Right.  I guess that -- if you --
