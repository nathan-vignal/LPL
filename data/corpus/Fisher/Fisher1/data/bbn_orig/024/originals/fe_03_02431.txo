L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi, ah, this is Frank.  I guess, ah -- 
L:  This is Emile.
R:  Hi, Emile.  Ah, [MN] I'm on the west coast, ah -- 
L:  Where abouts?
R:  I'm in San Francisco, the bay area.
L:  Ooh, I'm in, ah, New York city.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I used to live there anyway.  So, ah, I'm -- 
L:  I'm on upper --
R:  -- oh -- 
L:  -- west side staying with a friend.  I just got in today.
R:  Oh, you just got into the city there, huh?
L:  Yeah, I mean I live here.  But, I was out of town for a bit.  So, we're supposed to figure out what -- or we supposed to -- 
R:  About, ah, um, I don't know, the topic I thought of one is, ah, smoking.  What do you think of that or do you have another choice?
L:  Wait, are we supposed to talk about it or, like, vote?
R:  Ah, they said, "Choose a topic".  I think there was four selections.
L:  Which is worse?  Gossip, smoke, alcohol, caffeine or exercising --
R:  You're correct -- 
L:  -- and not exercising.
R:  You're correct.  Those are the four topics they said we're supposed to talk about.  Ah, one of those four, whichever one you want to do, it's fine with me.  I could do 'em all or whatever.  What's good for you?  How do you feel -- 
L:  You mean, we're supposed to pick one and talk about it?
R:  Correct.
L:  Yeah, I would pick -- what did you say?  I personally --
R:  I'd say smoke -- 
L:  -- I'd pick alcohol and caffeine.
R:  Ah, drinking alcohol, ah, ah, using caffeine you mean?
L:  Excessive alcohol and excessive caffeine would be my -- 
R:  Your choice.
L:  -- answer.
R:  Ah, [MN] and I would have said smoking.  But, ah, that's --
L:  But, um, they're all -- 
R:  -- fine though.
L:  -- they're all pretty close.  I mean, I don't think gossiping is -- 
R:  You know what's good about right now?  [MN] Since, ah, you're in New York right now a major topics going to be in New York right now is the no smoking policy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's going into effect, I think, July first or is it June first, I'm not sure.
L:  Um, no, it already has gone into effect.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I -- I, you know, I thought there was a -- a law going into effect right now.  But, [MN] [MN] excuse me?  [MN] In California we've already passed -- well, in San Francisco they already passed that law where you cannot smoke in bars or restaurants.  And I think that's what you're going to right now in New York.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't really well accepted.  But, I mean, out of those -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- four -- 
R:  -- do you want to talk about this one because this is much more controversial right now?  It's, ah, you know -- 
L:  I don't really understand.  I don't -- I mean, we're supposed to say which is the worst?
R:  No, we're supposed to just choose one of the four topics and just talk -- discuss about it whatever you want to discuss about it that, you know --
L:  We could do -- 
R:  -- you think -- 
L:  -- smoking if you want.
R:  Yeah, because I was thinking, oh, that's much more, ah, you know, kind.  And if it's effective as -- you know, effective in New York city right now.  It's going through here in California, San Francisco Bay area, because, you know, a lot of the bars and restaurants, ah, have already implemented that programme.  So, you're going through it right now.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I know the -- I mean, personally I don't smoke and I don't think it's healthy.  I think it's an addiction.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I agree.  I don't smoke at all myself.  But -- 
L:  I mean -- 
R:  -- you know, I guess --
L:  -- I think smoking -- 
R:  -- the main thing is that -- 
L:  -- pot is a lot safer [NOISE] -- 
R:  Smoking what?
L:  -- you know?
R:  Smoking what?
L:  I think smoking pot is safer -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and less toxic than, [NOISE] you know [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah.  I think -- 
L:  -- tobacco [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- yeah, that's, ah, yeah, that's a herb --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- that I used to do that.  But, I --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I -- I stopped from --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- about five, six years now.  So -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- ah, as for smoking -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know, itself -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- do you think it's still right for people to smoke in New York or, like -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- in California, or not to smoke in certain areas -- 
L:  Well, I think that -- I don't think it should be a law because [NOISE] -- I don't know.  I guess I just have -- even though I don't smoke, I've always associated bars with smoking.
R:  [several inaudible words] that's second hand smoke.  And that's the most important.
L:  Yeah, I guess I never really was concerned about it.  It seems really extreme to outlaw smoking.  I mean, I think it's -- I don't think it's really constitutional.  I mean, it's not healthy.  Second hand smoke is --  
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- not good.  But, I -- I don't think it's constitutional.
R:  Well, you know, the thing is that -- you know, fine.  A person could smoke if they wanted to which I believe -- 'cause I've done some studies where, you know, w- there was a lot of cases here in San Francisco against the major tobacco --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- companies, you know, because now people --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- have been suing them because of, you know, ah, them developing cancer or deaths.  But, the thing was it -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- it was an addiction.  Now, the thing is that I was feeling was that, yeah sure, everybody has their own choice, you know, freedom of choice to do whatever they want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, if a person smokes in a combined area, like a restaurant --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- or a bar, doesn't the person who --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- doesn't want to smoke or doesn't -- or is allergic to smoke have that freedom of -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- choice of having --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- clean air.  Not be- ah, being imposed on second --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- second hand smoke?
L:  Right.  I mean, [NOISE] -- 
R:  See, right now that's -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I think there's a lot of things in New York is going on right now.  A lot of --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- people will probably grumble 'cause they -- 
L:  Yeah, they just put the smoking [NOISE] [several inaudible words] and it [NOISE] -- it's -- it's unconstitutional [NOISE].  It is [NOISE] -- it's so -- some -- smoking is so main stream and it is -- it is laced with some kind of addictive --
R:  Yeah, but, you know -- 
L:  -- thing.
R:  -- if you don't smoke and you don't want to smell it, don't you have the right to say, "Hey, look, I don't care what you do.  But, you know, you're really polluting the air that I'm breathing right now".
L:  Yeah.  I guess I'm just kind of brain washed 'cause I associate, you know, smoking with being cool or whatever.
R:  Yeah, but that --
L:  You know, the prestige is sexy -- 
R:  -- that's just -- is that -- yeah, I'm exactly -- 
L:  But, um -- 
R:  You -- you aren't below -- you're less than twenty five years old or less than thirty years old? 
L:  I'm twenty four.  But, um -- 
R:  See, I'm a little bit older than that.  So -- 
L:  [NOISE] Ah -- 
R:  You know, the thing is that it's, ah -- smoking --
L:  Sorry?
R:  -- smoking, ah -- you know, the media -- the smoking media, the lobbyists -- 
L:  That's what I was going to tell you, the media [NOISE] brain washes us.
R:  Exactly.  That's what's been happening ever since with the joke Camel cool thing, you know, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, they're advertising in --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] ah, schools and, you know, and television shows or movies before they --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- have the young people smoke and think that they're cool and everything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, basically, you know, I guess the r- --
L:  It's -- it's like it's a brain wash.  It's conditioning.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what the media wants.  That's what the smoking p- ah, companies -- tobacco, were saying, even though they're saying, "But, hey no, we were not".  But, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- everything that they've been using to -- to, ah, to show smoking had involved with, you know, the cartoon figures or dating figures or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, something that's -- you know, that you should do with -- like you said it's [several inaudible words] crowd. 
L:  And you know, like, something anything is not healthy for your lungs.  But, you know, there're -- there are more healthy things you can smoke, like, um, ginseng, like ginseng.
R:  That -- 
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  -- which one?  [LAUGH] 
L:  You can smoke ginseng.  Like a sweet cigarette -- 
R:  Oh -- oh -- oh -- oh -- oh -- oh -- oh. 
L:  -- it's not addicting.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't hurt you as much as --  
R:  Yeah, I could see, like, a bowl of cigarettes [several inaudible words] like that, clove -- 
L:  -- tobacco would -- 
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  -- but, it's -- it's just really ingrained in -- 
R:  I thought clove -- 
L:  -- our culture to smoke.
R:  -- clove is much -- did you know that clove cigarettes is worse?
L:  Huh?
R:  Did you know that clove cigarettes is worse?
L:  That's what I've heard.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah, it is.  I think even develop cancer and sores inside you that's even worse.  People don't understand it.  They think that that is not.  That is [LAUGH] -- or, you know, when people chew tobacco -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get cancer in your mouth. 
L:  Really?  Ew -- 
R:  You know, that cold sores the cancer.  People don't understand it but they think, ah, it's okay.
L:  It's, um -- 
R:  But, ah -- 
L:  You know, I -- I heard that cloves the worst.  But, I know, I'm surprised 'cause it's like an herb.  It's like a, you know, like a spice -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's really sweet tasting if you've ever had one.  Like, they're really good.  They're really sweet.
R:  Ah, [MN] I -- I -- I used to but I don't do it anymore.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's my, you know, concern about the --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- health.  But, you know what's been happening --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- in New York is that, ah -- do you go to bars a lot or you go to the night clubs over there or restaurants?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, when you go there and you see some people smoking right next to you, what do you -- do you feel uncomfortable about that?
L:  No, I don't feel violated 'cause it -- it's just always -- it's always been that and that's how I grew up my whole life, like -- 
R:  So, you -- you used to sm- -- 
L:  -- being around smoke.
R:  -- around smokers.
L:  Yeah.  But, listen, ah, you know, I was out a- the -- the -- the week that they put the cigarette ban in -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and people were -- most -- some people were still smoking.
R:  Yeah, I know, ah -- 
L:  I mean, in California do you find that?
R:  Well, the funny thing is my -- my, ah, niece is a reporter for the Daily News and she did a story on smoking.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And she was -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- yeah, she went to the [inaudible] bars areas in New York city -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- to see what was happening.  And yeah.  A lot of people still let people smoke.  The only thing they -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] ah, in her article was that, ah, you know, they may not give you an ashtray but they're not going to stop you from smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You see, that's -- that's what happened about a year ago in California, San Francisco area -- 
L:  And I'm sure it was a year ago.
R:  It's a little more over a year.  In the whole of California they had a ban -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the funny thing is it's been reinforced now so you go to restaurants and bars, nobody smokes at the beginning, initially.  Yeah, you know, you have those people that say, "Hey.  I'm rebelling.  I'm going to do --"
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  "-- what I want to do.  It's my own right to do whatever I want.  I don't care about other people".
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they don't want to smell, um, they -- they don't have to smoke.  But, they don't understand that there's that smell --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you -- you could be allergic to it.  And they don't care -- take that into consideration.  They say, "Hey.  I have the right".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, what's -- you know, at the initial time what happened was that it was a very relaxed situation until you had the smoking cops coming around and they were fining the bar owners.
L:  The owners?
R:  And it -- yeah, because that's -- they're that -- they're -- they're -- they're supposed to tell people, the patrons, not to smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're going to smoke they have to go outside, you know?  And they're not supposed supply ashtrays on a bar and if somebody does light up a cigarette they're supposed to stop 'em and say, "There's a law.  You can't do that".  So, that's basically [inaudible] -- 
L:  There were a lot of signs that I saw in New York that said, you know, due to the new law there's no smoking allowed.  Please -- 

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do not give us any trouble, we're only complying with the law.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's new.  Because like you said, it just began.  You know, it's not -- it -- so, it's just new.  It took a -- you know, a little while before everything in San Francisco and the California and Los Angeles to really take an effect.  So, you don't go -- you go to restaurants and bars and nobody really is smoking anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They w-
