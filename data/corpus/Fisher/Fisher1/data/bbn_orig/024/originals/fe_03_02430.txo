L:  Yeah, I just had no idea.
R:  -- [NOISE] this is kind of fun.  Okay.  Um, topic.  Let's see.  Habits.  Okay, which one do you think's worse?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Ah, my goodness.  They, um, some -- some of them -- all sound pretty bad, um -- 
R:  [NOISE] They all sound pretty bad but a lot of us do 'em.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I can't think of, like, one that I d- that I don't do sometimes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  No.  I -- I -- I haven't really had anything to drink in a while.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] So, but, you know [NOISE] -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] I've got too many kids.  If I started drinking, I'm not going to stop.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, wow.  How -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- many kids do you have?
R:  [NOISE] Four.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Wow.  I'm one of, um -- I mean, I have three siblings as, ah -- so, I grew up in a family of four -- 
R:  [NOISE] Ah.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- originally.
R:  [NOISE] And so you all -- all turned out okay?  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  I -- I guess so.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [NOISE] I'm starting to wonder about my bunch.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] The oldest two are fine.  The little two, no.  [LAUGH] My son's the biggest [inaudible] of them all.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  That was nice. 
R:  [NOISE] How old are you?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  I'm twenty one.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.  So, all my siblings are younger than me actually.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm -- I'm the oldest.  I'm twenty eight though.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.  How much -- 
R:  [NOISE] I re- [NOISE] --
L:  -- how many, ah, younger siblings do you have?
R:  [NOISE] I have two.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, right.
R:  [NOISE] So, they're -- they're twenty five and twenty one.  Like, my -- my brother's twenty one.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh.  Right -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, he's a -- he's a big stinker.  You [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- [NOISE] want to talk about bad habits [NOISE], the only one of those he doesn't do is the alc- is the smoking.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] -- 
L:  I've been trying to, ah, to quit smoking.  I used to -- I -- I used to smoke, like, a pack a day.  It was -- really is a horrible habit and it was -- maybe I can balance [several inaudible words] --  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- that's the worst.  But --
R:  [NOISE] Well, I wouldn't know if it's the worst 'cause I do it.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, it's the one thing my children [NOISE] aren't going to take from me.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I quit drinking, you know.  My [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] Dr Pepper's [NOISE] are free rein here, you know.  They have a tendency to walk off with my kids.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Got to have that.  Go for the caffeine.
R:  [NOISE] So, you know, it's like don't touch.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] O- oh no.  I can -- I can drink [NOISE] Dr Pepper's and coffee like crazy, you know?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I get all the exercise I need from my nineteen month old son who doesn't know how to be still.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, that's -- 
R:  [NOISE] --
L:  -- oh, that's -- oh, my goodness.  That's such a wonderful age [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [NOISE] No, he's not.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  No? [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] My girls were a breeze.  This boy is -- my brother nicknamed him the beast at birth.  I didn't understand that until now. [NOISE] --
L:  It's probably boys.
R:  [NOISE] yeah.  It's got to be.  You know [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I -- I am finally realising why guys turn stupid as they get older.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] They fall on their heads too often as toddlers.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words], yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] They are.  He -- he's dangerous.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Y- [LAUGH] So, they're -- but they're -- they're a lot of fun though.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You have -- you have to admit, though, they're a whole lot of fun.  Just don't push it.  Don't rush it.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I tell you right now, don't rush it.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] By the time I was twenty one I had two kids.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] So, you know, that was the choice I made then, you know, and here I am thinking, you know, okay, what did I get myself into?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] But, they'll be out of the house, you know, and I'll still be young enough to enjoy myself.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, that is -- that does seem to be, like, one of the advantages of -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, then I can get into all those bad habits.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] We'll get back to drinking excessively.  Okay, there we go.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  'Cause grandma[?] will be going out drinking -- 
R:  [NOISE] I used to do that, you know?  Even -- even after my two oldest were born, you know?  I -- I still went out and I had fun and this [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] that.  You know, I think I'm just getting old.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] None of it appeals [NOISE] --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- [NOISE] to me [LAUGH] anymore.  I haven't been out on the town in God knows how long.  It's been at least -- well, he's nineteen months, and since I got pregnant with him.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, you know, every once in a while I'll go catch a movie with my oldest.  [NOISE] -- 
L: Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah, and I'm always, like, "Oh, okay.  We'll do that".  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, my oldest is ten now.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's -- that's -- that's old enough then, yeah, to go out and do stuff -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- together, I guess --  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she's fun.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's nice.
R:  [NOISE] You know, as long as we can keep her from being [NOISE] [inaudible] and opinionated.  [NOISE] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Oh, she's the biggest -- biggest gossip you'll ever meet in your life.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] At ten years old, she [NOISE] talks about everybody.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] And if my son does not stop slamming this thing, [NOISE] I'm going to go sit on him.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I can hear him [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're having a good old time over there.  They're messing with my bench.  Lifting the seat up to it and then [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- slamming it down [NOISE].  That's his big thing, is noise.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] I [NOISE] think he's got sister locked in their at the moment.  Oh [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Now, the funny thing is you're going to -- you going to -- you might start hearing, like, bird noises here.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  The weirdest -- it's the strangest thing.  They -- they -- every night they -- they start, um, chirping a little bit earlier.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  It's, ah -- it's, ah -- and they're -- they're getting close to eleven now.  They're -- they're, like, "Wake up, it's eleven". 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no, that's when you [NOISE] --
L:  [inaudible] on and on.
R:  -- [NOISE] say, "No, go to sleep, it's eleven".  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's a very, ve- it's very strange, though.  I don't think I've ever, um, lived in a place that I had birds chirping quite so early -- 
R:  [NOISE] Actually we had -- about one or two am we have this one bird that's come and sit down on the street [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] in front and just makes the God +awful racket.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] It's like, "Honey.  It's bed time".  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, my God.  It's so hard to go to sleep too with, um, [inaudible] this morning -- 
R:  [NOISE] It is.  It's not a sound you hear all the time.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, you're not used to it, used to it.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's just an occasional thing.  You're going, "Ha".  You can't sleep with that noise.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] That'll drive you to drinking.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's -- that's right, or smoking at least [inaudible] -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.  You can find me [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] that's -- that's -- that's what I do when he wakes me up.  It's, [NOISE] ah -- you'll find me sitting on my front porch yelling at him and smoking my cigarette.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] It's like, "Listen here".  So, now he's just [NOISE] -- 
L:  Do you have a porce?  I love porches.  I've always wanted to have a porch.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  You live [NOISE] --
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- [NOISE] in New York.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Right, yeah.  No porches, unfortunately -- 
R:  [NOISE] No porch.  No, I live in a little house [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [NOISE] two bedrooms with a yard and everything.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Nice.
R:  [NOISE] So, [NOISE] you know, I've always wanted to visit New York.  But, I don't think I could get through all the concrete.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's, um, it's a built up city.  It's very -- there's buildings everywhere in the city.  I don't live in the -- in the city.  I live kind of outside of it.  But, it's still -- it's still kind of --
R:  [NOISE] Ah [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- built up.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] --  
L:  I live really close to a highway and -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, do you?  [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I live in a little town.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah?
R:  [NOISE] It's [NOISE] -- 
L:  Is it -- the only place I can think of in Texas is like, um, Houston or -- I guess [inaudible].
R:  [NOISE] My mom lives in Houston.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Don't ever go there.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Really?  Why not?
R:  [NOISE] Biggest bunch of jerks.  And let me tell ya, they're all nuts. [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, no!
R:  [NOISE] None of them know how to drive.  You know, that -- you know, you hear things about New Yorkers?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Nobody knows how to drive here.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no.  Oh, no.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] Houston [NOISE] has you beat.  There are so many people in such a compacted space.  [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] It takes [NOISE] -- oh, it took us [NOISE] an hour and a half to go twenty three miles.  [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] I was so mad.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [NOISE] It was like, "Listen here". [NOISE] -- 
L:  That sounds -- that sounds as bad as the -- the driving here is sometimes -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- you're just sitting -- if you get it at the wrong time you'll just sit on the highway for -- you could stay there for an hour or something -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- just waiting to move, it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] No.  I've been to Houston [NOISE] --
L:  -- really depressing.
R:  -- [NOISE] twice now [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and -- and I -- you know, my mom lives down there [NOISE] so [NOISE] -- 
L:  Did she go and move --
R:  -- [NOISE] it's kind of [MN] [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- recently or something or -- 
R:  [NOISE] Huh?  [NOISE] --
L:  Did she move recently then or something?
R:  [NOISE] This last year.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] I make her come up here now.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.  It's probably good --
R:  [NOISE]  She has to.  I just -- no.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- for her to get out of the city.
R:  [NOISE] The first time we were down there we were in a car wreck.  So, you know it's -- it's bad experience all around.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Wow, that's -- 
R:  [NOISE] You know, that goes in the bad habits 'cause he'd -- he'd been drinking at eight AM. [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  [NOISE] So, yeah.  It's an old guy, you know, and he was drunk and he was stupid and he'd pulled out in front of us and we t-boned him.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] And it's like, "Oh" [NOISE] that -- that -- no, I -- I -- I don't go to Houston unless I have to.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] You know, the second time I went it was because I had to go testify against the guy that caused the wreck.  So [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's a -- yeah, that -- that seems like reason enough not to go there.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it just there's -- there's so many people and it's just -- oh, it's -- it's nasty.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, [NOISE] I lived in Austin.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Austin's okay, you know.  I was born in Austin, then I [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] spent a year and a half there twenty five years later.  [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] So, it was -- it w- it's -- it's a big place.  But, you don't have to get right into Austin to do anything.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, they had plenty [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] on the outskirts.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's good.  That's good for parking and that's good for -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  You know [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- everything.
R:  [NOISE] I live about two hours north of the Dallas, Fort Worth[?] area.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] And, you know, we've got -- Wichita Falls has roughly a hundred thousand people.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh, that s- that's sounds [several inaudible words] is that -- is that, like, near a river or a -- 
R:  [NOISE] We've got the Red River.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Okay.  Nice.
R:  [NOISE] And we've got the Wichita Falls.  They -- they're man made falls and then it goes through a park and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [NOISE] it's real pretty.  And it's -- it's a very nice place to be, you know?  It's not too big where there's too many people, you know, but it has everything you need.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Sounds nice.
R:  [NOISE] It's got the mall and everything.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, it's just [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] it's just a [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] very pleasant place to be.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  That's good, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, ah, one of these days I'll get to New York.  So [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, you should -- you should come out and see us sometime.  It's -- 
R:  [NOISE] --
L:  -- it's, ah, buildings are immense and large and, um -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah? [NOISE] --
L:  And, um, if you -- if you -- if you take public transportation instead of, um, instead of trying to drive it's actually -- it's, um, difficult to figure out at first when --
