L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is April Hack[?].  I live in Los Angeles, California and I'm twenty seven years old.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay, my name is Mario and I live in, uh, Marina Del Ray.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  I actually went to school in Marina Del Ray.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- graduated from Antioch University.
L:  Oh, wow.  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've only been here about, uh, oh, four months, five months, but I like it.  It's very nice.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's gorgeous over there.
L:  Yeah, I dig it.
R:  I miss the Sa- -- my Saturdays.  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay, so we're --
L:  So --
R:  -- supposed to talk about reality television?
L:  So, speaking of reality. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so --
L:  Um --
R:  -- do you watch reality shows?
L:  You know what?  I really [MN] -- I think I did for a little, small time period and that was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, Joe Millionaire --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's about the only one I really, you know, caught.  I -- I did watch Survivor for a while, but I couldn't handle it.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I did that for a little bit.  Now I don't even bother and, um, I don't even bother with --
R:  Well, I have to admit, I am pretty bad, um --
L:  Are ya?
R:  -- I didn't own a television.  I'm twenty seven, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I didn't really watch a lot of television when I was younger, and all throughout my high school and college years, I didn't own a television, um --
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, I've only, like, had -- and I still have never bought a television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I've had one for the last two years, and I've been watching it, like, maniacally.  So --
L:  So, you have cable?
R:  -- um, I think, um, I don't have cable, no.
L:  No?  Oh, boy.
R:  So, I have -- yeah --
L:  If you, you know --
R:  -- I have regular, just --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't even know what it's called, broadca- -- I guess, antenna.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, broadcast, u- um, television.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And it's because I got into these recent relationship for, like, the last two years with somebody who's into film and television --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so we watch a lot of television together.  So, I also saw Joe Millionaire.  I've watched Survivor since the beginning.  I saw, um, Big Brother, I think that one is?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where they all live in a house together.
L:  Yeah, I caught a little bit of it.
R:  I saw, um, I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.
L:  Oh, I couldn't handle that.  I watched it --
R:  Yeah, it was --
L:  -- maybe once or twice.
R:  I -- I -- it was --
L:  I know the -- I know the actress, um, that girl that used to be in 90210.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Is that her?  That g- -- I forget her name. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Oh, Gabrielle Carteris?
L:  Gabrielle, yeah.  Well, I spent -- I had the -- a Thanksgiving dinner at her house once --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- with a friend of mine, uh, some friends there.
R:  Um, yeah, I've -- I --
L:  So, that's why I watch it, really [LAUGH] -- otherwise I wouldn't have.
R:  Really?  And I -- I don't know, does the Bachelor count as a reality show?
L:  I'm sure it does.
R:  Yeah, okay.  And I'm currently watching that one, 'cause everyone that I work with is watching that one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know, everybody talks about it, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- constantly.  And, um, I don't -- I guess the lure with watching -- I don't know, what's the -- what's the lure of the reality show?
L:  You know what?  It -- it is -- I think this is going to be just like a -- a phase, or a fad, I mean, and, uh, you know, people will get tired of it real soon, 'cause it's been just so much different than whatever has been on TV, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Some of these sitcoms are pretty bad, you know, and just looking for something and even --
R:  Different.
L:  -- you know, if -- if you're not into the drama shows, which I'm not either --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, like that one, uh, what's that one with the President?  Um --
R:  Oh, right, um, like the --
L:  The --
R:  -- Ov- Oval Office or, like --
L:  Oval Office or whatever.
R:  Something like that?
L:  Yeah, the -- yeah, I don't get into that either, so --
R:  Me neither.  Yeah, I don't --
L:  I just get into David Letterman. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- yeah, I don't stay up that late, so --
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't watch any of that stuff either and he -- I -- I think I used to -- I think when I used to watch TV every once in a while at, like, friends' houses, I would watch, like, Letterman and he slowly, like, started getting less funny over the years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I -- that's what I've heard anyway, so, um --
L:  Uh, you just -- you gotta grow with them, you know?
R:  Well, yeah, exactly.  And --
L:  And, uh --
R:  And, um, I think that the interest in reality shows for me was just that it was also -- yeah, it was something different, I never had heard of it, and I think there was also a psychological, like, idea that you could put yourself in the shoes of the person that was on the show and kind of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- psychologically it would -- it would, um -- a lot of the part of television that I know myself and my boyfriend are into is, like, the fantasy and the escape of television --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the idea that you could put yourself in the shoes of the people that are in it and kind of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- get away for a while.  I mean, I guess --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that's the whole psychological background of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- idea of the reality shows.
L:  It could be.  You know what?  So, come to think of it, the -- the -- I do get hooked on sometimes is the ones where they gotta do [NOISE] -- that eat, like, eat bugs and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we watched that, Fear Factor.
L:  Fear Factor, Fear Factor.
R:  We love Fear Factor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We love it, I mean, actually --
L:  It gets too gory sometimes.
R:  -- I'm starting to hate it.
L:  I gotta the change the channel after -- after three people eat bugs or -- or cow blood or I don't know what.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, I mean --
L:  That's enough.
R:  -- I really -- I really like it, but there's -- I don't know, because I've actually had to, like, live in other countries and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and live in circumstances where I've actually had to, like, do that for a cer- -- like actually live in real survival circumstances.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Sometimes I don't like shows like that, because it's, like, why would you put yourself through that trauma --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just for, like, the chance to win a negligible amount of money that you could just go work and get the money for?
L:  Right.
R:  For me, I just -- it doesn't --
L:  Well, you know what?  The celebrities do it for -- for charity.
R:  Well, right.
L:  Usually, or they say they do.
R:  Right.  I gu- -- I guess I can kinda understand that, but the whole celebrity one, they did -- their stunts were ridiculous, like -- and when I -- when I watch those shows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right, basically, I don't even really watch those shows.  Like, my boyfriend will sit  there and actually pay attention to them and -- and, like, get into them.  I don't know how he --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- can do it without losing his brain --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- matter, but, like, I actually sit there and I'll, like, do -- like, send my bills and, like, clean my apartment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, like, play with my cat.  Like, I -- I do multi-tasking whenever I watch those shows.  So, my brain's kind of, like, elsewhere.
L:  Yeah, I guess that's the -- you know, I work in my -- in my house, so I have a home office and I got the little TV there and, um, or the big TV if I'm working in the living room and, um, yeah, I'll just have something on like that, it'll catch my eye.  But usually not reality shows. [LAUGH]
R:  But aren't you hoping, like, it ends at this point?
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  But there's no good T- -- I mean, and now it just seems like --
L:  We need another -- we need another Seinfeld.
R:  Oh, my gosh, you're so correct.  I've -- I mean, that is, like, my favorite show.  And unfortunately --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never seem -- 'cause I also just didn't have television and I never seemed to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get it, my problem is that I never got in -- into -- on anything at the right time, like  --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- I never enjoyed Seinfeld, like, when it was popular.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you know how when it was in syndication and it still is?
L:  Right.
R:  That's when I got into it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and then I was -- then I was, like, bummed, 'cause I was, like, "Oh, my gosh, I have to chase after --"
L:  Well, at least it's, like, new -- new to you, so that's --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- but I've seen every episode now at least five times.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it still makes me laugh.
L:  Yeah, George --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kills me.
R:  Oh, George. [LAUGH] I am George in so many ways. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And now I find it sad, because there's actually been a couple of shows that, like, aren't too bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but because they don't seem to make, like, a billion dollars right away, they just take them off after six shows.  It's, like, they get their --
L:  Yeah, well, you know, S- Seinfeld was, like, on for, like, for the first two years without any attention, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  It was just barely making it, then all of a sudden, boom.
R:  Right.  Well, like me, people like me didn't even know it was on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know, I didn't even get it.
L:  You were living your own reality.
R:  Well, yeah, I -- I was -- well, I was working two jobs and I was in college, so for me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was, yeah, doing other stuff.  But, yeah, you know, I guess it -- I guess it comes down to, like, the dumbing down of the American public and I just wonder if, like, they're going to under- -- I guess I'm wondering if it's going to change.  I'm hoping it's going to change.
L:  Well, you know what?  They -- they do have to be -- continue to be wilder and wilder for people to keep watching, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And then, um, 'til it gets out of control.
R:  Well, like, you notice, like, they have those ones like, um, um, Married -- did you see Married by America?
L:  Y- yeah, I c- -- [MN] barely caught a little bit of one.
R:  I didn't see that at all, and then they had that, like, um, Temptation Island one.
L:  Yeah.  I wanted to see that, but I never did.
R:  They have all of those shows where they basically they try to break up, like, relationships --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- committed relationships.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I just -- it -- because I'm in a committed relationship, I just don't really value those ones. [LAUGH] It's, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- just like, "Why are we trying to purposely break up committed relationships at this point?"  Uh, that part --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't understand, but I mean, I guess, it's --
L:  But those people love it.
R:  Yeah, people do love it.  I mean, I'm just afraid that we're getting to the point where it's going to be, like, Running Man time and we're going to have people just, like, tearing each other apart for, like, small c- -- like, premiums.
L:  Yeah, remember that?
R:  What?
L:  Remember that, uh, that -- what's that -- that movie?
R:  Yeah.
L:  With, uh, what was it, Arnold Schwarzenegger?
R:  Yeah, it's a book --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by Stephen King, actually.
L:  Okay, yeah, yeah.
R:  And, um, I'm terrified, like, because it's something --
L:  You mean they wrote a -- they wrote a book on that movie? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just kidding. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny. [LAUGH] Um, yeah, they did. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, eight years before and, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've just -- that was a book that just changed my life.  I think I was, like, eight years old when I read that book.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, and it freaked me out big time.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it was pretty freaky.
R:  And, um, I've seen, like, our society just take the shape of that book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm wondering, like, "Yeah, when is it going to be that we're, like, you know, paying, you know, eight year olds to do, you know, just tear each other apart for, like, you know, an X Box?"
L:  Might as well get some lions and throw 'em into the, uh, Colosseum with the [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- bunch of people. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, and then, you know, like on Survivor, I don't know, just each successive series gets more boring and more, like, tragic as the next one.
L:  Really?  I don't even follow that.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't really -- like, I used to look -- the first one, I would, like, make sure, like, every Thursday I would either tape it or watch it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, I would look forward to it.  Which is weird --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I never looked forward or cared about anything on TV.
L:  Uh, I still like to watch, uh, Friends.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's about the only thing I really make a point to watch.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The -- yeah, when -- I went -- and then when I found out about Seinfeld I was, like, "Seinfeld! Oh my God, Seinfeld's on".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was me, you know?
L:  That was you, huh?
R:  Yeah.  But then I liked really the first, um, [MN] the first edition of Survivor, but now it's, like, "Ah, Survivor's on.  Do you wanna --"
