R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hello, my name is John Webber.
R:  Mine's R- Richard Hanson.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  I'm -- I'm from, ah, Seattle.
L:  Okay, I'm from, ah, the Anaheim area, Anaheim, California.
R:  Oh, cool.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm just glad to connect to someone 'cause I waited for about ten minutes.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I'm, ah, I'm trying to, ah, I didn't catch the topic.  I [inaudible] my speakerphone and then somebody came in the room and I didn't hear exactly what -- I kn- -- ah, what was worse, or is that what the topic was?
R:  Yeah, what was worse, um, [SIGH], alcohol, [MN] um, smoking, things like that.  [MN]  Um, I guess, bad habits and addictions and stuff.  [MN] 
L:  Ah. Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh --
R:  And, ah -- oh, I'm sorry.  I was just gonna say I thought -- I think anything that, where something starts controlling you and not you controlling it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, there's a difference between, like, social drinking and the -- and drinking too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know if one is worth than the other, you know, but anything that we get out of -- that makes us out of -- get out of control I don't think would be a good thing.
L:  [MN]  That's for sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For sure.  The -- the foc- -- the focus is, it's the faculties I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, how many faculties are --
R:  [MN] 
L:  [MN] you know, it's -- it's very fascinating, ah, in the past, ah, I know during World Ward two that the pilots, ah, they used to drink quite a bit and I thought --
R:  Yes
L:  -- quite interesting for something where you have to be in so much control --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- why would they be led to drink?  To be out of control to be under[?] control, that was the scenario.  So the quest- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, what would be worse, well, the question is, ah, w- -- who is the one looking at the worst?  They're saying we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah -- that makes me -- made me wonder.  Well, look at that lady who lived to be a hundred and --
R:  Seven.
L:  -- seven, is it --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or a hundred and -- Jean or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  She smoked.
R:  I know.
L:  But the day -- but the day she stopped --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] she stopped -- is that worse?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Good point.  I -- yeah, I have people in my family that, you know, have had bad habits and they lived a very long time.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and, like, my parents were social drinkers but I have friends who have quite a problem and they lose control and they get inappropriate and they, you know, um, [MN] have a real problem with drinking but it's just because, I think some people have addictive personalities too.
L:  Mm.  
R:  You know, not making them bad people.  It's just, I think, some people can't, like my mom could not quit smoking.  She was addicted to nicotine --
L:  Ahah.
R:  You know, and so she just could not not smoke.
L:  Maybe, maybe, according to what we hear, is that whatever drugs[?] in -- into the tobacco so maybe it wasn't the tobacco itself.
R:  Good point.  [MN] 
L:  Okay, n- -- smoking is, ah, part of it.  [MN]  Ah, nicotine was just, ah, nicotine, ah, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the ball players that -- that chewed nicotine, you know, that's really bad because, ah, most of the cases they get cancer of the mouth, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  It has it's -- it has it's, um, what do you call it?  Ah, I mean, you have cirrhosis of the liver.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how can you -- how can you compare one to the other?  Um --
R:  Right, good point.
L:  It -- it just, you know, it -- to me -- to me it's -- a person chooses to be their lifestyle --
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, whether it's corre- -- right or not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, I've really been influenced lately by a man by the name of Michael Savage.  I don't know if you know him?
R:  No.
L:  He's on, ah, talk radio, Savage Nation.  He wrote The Savage Nation, you know, the best seller in New York, ah ...
R:  Okay, yes.
L:  And, he said, oh, you wanna get a -- you wanna get a caffeine high?  It's high-  -- higher than the nicotine, you know, there's a certain plant and he named it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because he's [inaudible] plants.
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  Um, th- -- and -- and he was also a epi- epide- -- ah, ah, what is studied, you know, diseases.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, he's been up and up.  I mean, what's worse, SARS or, ah, or AIDS?  I mean, come on now ...  [LAUGH]  You know.
R:  Good point.
L:  Where are you?  I mean, it's like where are you on the map?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- well, I think anything that [MN] -- as far as taking control of you, like, I have a friend who, ah, is addicted to espresso and, you know, spends a lot of money and goes to Starbucks or whatever every day just to get a buzz and, you know, that becomes a problem.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  People --
L:  [MN]  So, I think whatever someone does that maybe is taking them out of control --
R:  Sure.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I -- somebody thinks that maybe going to school is, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not going out of control, but there are professional students that lose it.
L:  Yes.
R:  I have a friend who is one, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And can function very, very well in school but cannot function out of school.  That's it.  I -- that's a very good point.  And I totally agree with you.
L:  And -- and how does that affect him?
R:  That they can't function in the real world.
L:  But, I mean, is it deadly?
R:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Well, [SIGH], not to them, no.  Because I think they are happy, you know, 'cause they've kind of -- of [MN] worked their whole life around school and always getting one degree or another and that's all they do and if they're happy then, I guess, you know, more power to them.  
L:  Ah, well, one other question is, what is this in relations to?  I mean, does it affect other people?  [MN] I mean, obviously we -- we figure the thing with SARS --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It affects other people.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, I mean, you can't qua- -- I mean, you know, what are we going to do?  Quarantine all the smokers?  That's what's going on with the laws in this country.  We're quarantining all the smokers.  Then we're quarantining all the drinkers.  Then we're quarantining e- -- I mean what is going on here? 
R:  Good point.  That's a very good point.  Because --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- ah, ah, I think as -- as long as, ah, I don't know, um, like, I have a -- a neighbor who is a very serious alcoholic and her life's going to, you know -- gonna have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  She has cirrhosis of the liver --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I would say she has a major problem, [MN] sadly, 'cause she cannot not drink --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I don't even invite her over any more because she's always inappropriate.  And that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think would be a problem when, you know, when it starts affecting your life --
L:  S- --
R:  In her case, people don't want her around.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And so, it, you know, has become a -- an illness.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that is.  That -- that is another social disease.
R:  Yes.
L:  But I think you -- you're absolutely right.  I think that there is something there that, how, how can one, ah, communicate with someone who has this problem --
R:  Yes.
L:  Firstly, in a one to one, but however a- -- and it saddens me to say there is no, um, second step to that.  
R:  Right.
L:  It -- there is only -- there is only, oh, you put them in these groups --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to [inaudible] them but y- -- no one in the family or friends is in that group --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- to, ah, to point out the situation to them to give them a kind of a handle to get back into society.  Instead they have their own handles, ah, ah, ah, drinkers anonymous and all these groups and how can they get back in the real world, I mean,  [inaudible] interesting.
R:  Well, in my neighbor's case she can't because she is so far gone.
L:  Mm.
R:  And what's sad is that the few times she is sober she's a very delightful person --
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- but most times I can't even invite her in because she is so inappropriate and I feel bad for her because she does have cirrhosis and she has a lot of personal problems and a lot of daily problems because of her alcoholism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And i- -- it's very sad but I, you know, I can't have anything to do with her really [MN] because her life is out of control.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, I'm not a drinker myself but, you know, I have other things.  My [MN] -- my thing is late night eating so I think, you know, everybody has --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- something that -- that is a problem.
L:  Sure.
R:  And as long as I don't weigh eight hundred pounds, and I feel I -- I think people have to monitor themselves too, you know.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] influenced by this word I think in our generation, moderation.
R:  Yes.
L:  And we haven't really understood the word balance.  Ah, a friend of mine, ah, acquaintance, ah, who is a res- -- a major researcher, her name is Ann A.N.N. de --
R:  Okay.
L:  D.E. Wees W.E.E.S. --
R:  Okay.
L:  Al A.L.N. dot -- and then you go to dot com -- she's with the Arnold Schwarzenegger Institute --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, she's a fascinating woman, she did a
