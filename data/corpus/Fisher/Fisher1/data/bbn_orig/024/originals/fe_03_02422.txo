L:  Hey, my name is Treney[?] 
R:  Hi.  My name is Bonnie.
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, good, and so shall we start talking?
R:  Right.  I don't know.  This is my first time ever doing this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, [inaudible], and that's a [several inaudible words] for me also.
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay.  So, they said the topic is personal habits?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you think is the [MN] ah, is the worst one?  G-
R:  I missed the last two but I think, um, it's a toss between gossip and excessive caffeine.
L:  Okay.  I think overeat -- overeating is the bad thing.
R:  I thought gossip.  Gossip was the first or second.
L:  Yeah, something like that, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you think, ah, gossip is a really bad personal habit?
R:  I think so, yeah.
L:  Why?
R:  Um, just it can get out of hand and your ch- children could pick up on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I don't know.  Just from what I see on line and in real life it -- it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- not good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, that's true.  Actually I really think overeating is bad because, ah, what happens in overeating is people tend to be leaning towards personal gratification immediately -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because once a week you get the gratification of the [inaudible].
R:  Right.
L:  But, the long term effects of it are usually bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, people fall for the immediate gratification rather than for the long term thing.  That's my opinion.
R:  That's more a health issue than a personal habit, don't you think so?  Maybe some people can't help themselves.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's true.
R:  So, it might not be a habit.  It might just be a health condition or it might be something they were -- they genetically -- you know, they're not responsible for.
L:  Ah, and it's possible.  But, what happens is people usually tend to eat when they watch television.
R:  Yes. 
L:  And they -- 
R:  -- That's why I get up when a commercial comes on.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- okay.  And people when they watch television, what happens they don't, ah, actually -- they [inaudible] the amount of food they eat.  They -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they t- take a big chips packet and start -- start eating then they think, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, that's what I think [LAUGH] is the thing.  So, [LAUGH] you -- you need to [several inaudible words] for something, yeah.
R:  Okay.  But, what were the other options?  I didn't hear them or did you get what they all were?
L:  I listened to about three of them.  One was gossip -- 
R:  They didn't have smoking did they?
L:  Yes. They -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- mentioned smoking.
R:  They did have smoking.  Okay -- 
L:  They mentioned smoking.
R:  I'm an ex-smoker, so I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Ah, they mentioned -- 
R:  But, that's more health related than I think a habit that you -- you know what I mean?  A- but a habit, I think, is somebody who will like, um, like, um, g- ah, twirls their hair or picks their teeth or -- or snaps their fingers.  You know, that's like a habit, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Or -- 
L:  But, what happens -- even smoking -- it depends on how we want to classify it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Something what people do is when they -- it becomes more like a habit for them.
R:  Right, [several inaudible words].
L:  For example, some of my colleagues can't, um, quit smoking even for a night.  So, what they do is every hour -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just go down stairs and they have a smoke.  So, it has become more like a personal habit rather than for the pleasure of it -- 
R:  Right, yeah, I quit smoking, like, six or seven years ago.  But, um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I still have mints every day.  I -- you know, I -- it's like a habit.  When I used --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- to smoke, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I didn't want bad breath --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I would p- I would have Tic Tacs all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's -- that's still with me.  I still have the Tic Tacs.
L:  Okay.  That's -- 
R:  It's, ah, yeah.  So, it's like a --
L:  That's [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- habit that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kept with me from the smoking.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- 
R:  To make sure that my breath is always okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that is always good, yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Where you -- you can have a habit which always is a pleasurable experience, yeah.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It depends on the habit, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know what the other options were though.  I can't remember.  There --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- was about eight of them.
L:  Right.  I remember gossip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I remember drinking.
R:  Drinking, okay, yeah, right.
L:  And I remember overeating.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, I remember -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the [inaudible].
R:  What?
L:  They also mentioned some [inaudible], something else.  I d- don't know -- 
R:  Oh, I didn't -- yeah.
L:  So, those are the things that they mentioned.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.  But, I don't know what the p- what's the purpose of this study.  They might want to see how people talk to each other.
R:  I think, yeah -- I think the whole thing is about speech isn't it, or not?
L:  Yeah, maybe it's speech, yeah.  It's -- 
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- [inaudible] a meeting and they talk.  What are the things they will talk, and how do they talk?  How the conversation -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- goes.
R:  That could be.  Yeah, I don't know.  So, this is your first one too?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my first too 'cause, ah, they're like very, um -- what do I say, um, exactly on time because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I forgot what times I signed up for and I had to go on line to see what times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, they yesterday at, like, exactly -- whatever time it was, like, say five o'clock -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at five o'clock they called.  And the day before, exactly at four o'clock.
L:  Ah -- 
R:  But, my -- my power went out and my clocks were off by two minutes -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I was still on the computer because I have dial up and, like, as soon as I turn off the computer I had the message and I was like, "Oh, I missed them by thirty seconds" you know?
L:  Oh, okay.  So, I think that same happened with me also yesterday.  They -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have apparently called and I was not at my home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there was an automated message I think but -- 
R:  Yeah, press one or press two.  So, I tried pressing two just to see what would happen [LAUGH] but nothing happened.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, right.  That could be it.
L:  Okay.  So, ah, what -- ah, so your -- your opinion gossip is a really bad personal habit?  A -- 
R:  I think just from my experience, um, because I go on line a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, like, go to these communities --  
L:  Yahoo?
R:  -- and it just -- yeah, different communities and boards, like, MSN and Yahoo g- groups -- 
L:  Um, Yahoo -- 
R:  -- groups.
L:  -- and, uh-huh.
R:  Yahoo groups --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and MSN groups.
L:  Okay, I got it.
R:  And then writing communities and -- and just -- just in the last three years that I've been there it's just gotten worse in the last couple of days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, women just gossip back and forth and men gossip and it's just -- it gets so out of hand that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people are very upset about it.
L:  Okay.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you are talking more about online gossip, right?
R:  Mm?
L:  You're talking about online gossip?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, but, I think it applies for the general gossip also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so that's, ah -- 
R:  General gossip.
L:  What my -- my point is overeating is something because drinking and other things, um, see -- 
R:  Right.
L:  W- w- what the problem with -- w- w- with everything is it affects all age groups.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And even ch- from children to, ah, elderly people, senior citizens it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] So -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I thought that might be a worse per- personal habit.  But -- 
R:  Yes, that's true, that's true.  Right.
L:  So -- 
R:  I guess I was thinking more health.  So, what do I know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause that's like a personal -- personal.  You're talking about other people all the time you know, and it's a habit that probably people can't break.  Who knows?
L:  Yeah, maybe.  I don't -- 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  Mm, I -- 
R:  A- A- I'm -- I'm probably more influenced by just what's been going on the last couple of days that I've been reading.
L:  Ah, that's true actually.  I was also reading something on -- that's why I was talking to you about immediate gratification, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it's a -- it's -- it's philosophy called a pag[?], P.A.G. pag --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's called this problem with instant gratification.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, people tend to -- you know, getting all with habits in which there is immediately gratification.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Even though it might have a bigger negative impact in the future.
R:  Right.  I'm surprised they didn't say anything about exercise though, you know?  Because, I mean, people can over exercise too, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [inaudible] you know, you've got these men that take the shots and the steroids and stuff like that and you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- go overboard.  Yeah, it is -- 
L:  So, as I said, it's like what we saw, experienced in the last couple of days will have a [several inaudible words] definitely.
R:  Oh, yeah, it will impact you and influence you, yeah, 'cause it's -- you see people in commercials, you know those --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- a- the way that they, you know, show you those people eating the food or whatever.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And then you go out subconsciously and it's like, "Oh, I want one of those.  I want one of these".
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's -- isn't it the [inaudible]?  Not yet, right?
R:  I have -- they said that there was going to be a beep or something indicating when the ten minutes was up.
L:  Okay.
R:  A- th- the other one that I missed, they didn't say yesterday what it was but --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- Monday they said the topic was food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Because that's kind of funny that you were talking about overeating and the topic Monday was food.
L:  Mhm.  I -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- think it's, ah -- I think this is a [several inaudible words].  Maybe they're doing some study.  I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I might -- I think it should be very interesting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Did you sign up for their other stuff that they do where you go on line on Thursdays and you do a -- something every Thursday?
L:  They do?  I -- I don't know what.  Th- that's good, yeah -- 
R:  I don't know.  I signed --
L:  -- do they do something?
R:  I signed -- I don't know, I -- I was looking all over the place trying to find more and that's when I found, um, a link, um, they use -- 
L:  Is it in a -- it's in a --
R:  You sign up every Thursday and you get, like, three dollars for the survey or something.  So -- 
L:  Okay, that's, um, that's something to think.  So, that was an information for me.
R:  Yeah, I don't know -- 
L:  Yeah, thanks, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure where I found it though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  But, it had something to do with the same place that is doing this right here, you know?
L:  No, no, I -- I can always find it because I -- I usually play on the internet forever -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for about fifteen hours a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think I'll be able -- I'll be able to find it out.
R:  Right.  Did you sign up for every day to do this or just a couple of days?
L:  Ah, I signed for the previous this week but on Monday and Tuesday, actually, I came home really late.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that maybe tomorrow and Friday and [several inaudible words].
R:  Uh-huh.  Did you sign up for more than one time a day or no?
L:  No, only once.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  I wasn't sure what people do with it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I heard sometimes it's difficult because you -- see, if it is a casual conversation you can continue.
R:  Right.
L:  But, if it is constrained by a topic and you are asked to talk for ten minutes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then it becomes kind of -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- difficult to talk.  Yes.
R:  Right.  And I run errands when my kids -- when they're in school and plus I only have a dial up connection.  So, I -- 
L:  So, if you -- if you have this, well and then -- 
R:  Well, if I'm on the computer then I can't be on the phone at the same time.
L:  Okay.  So, I -- lucky -- luckily I have a decent connection.  So -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  I'm confused by DSL and it's a lot more money.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Ah, well, you have a very good deal now.  You have Verizon deal now, which is thirty four dollars a month.
R:  No, I'm not living in a Verizon area.  I have a -- yeah.  I've tried.  I called them up, but they said, "No".
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  So, that's about -- you use AOL?
R:  Huh?
L:  You use AOL?
R:  AOL, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  No, never been there.  I've heard bad things about it.
L:  Oh, AOL is bad, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't like it.  I use, um, Yahoo.
L:  Oh, Yahoo.  Yahoo, that's good.
R:  Ah, they've got a lot of junk email though.  A lot of junk.
L:  You get a lot of junk.
R:  A lot of junk, yes.
L:  Oh.  That is -- 
R:  Just like you get telemarketers that call you up, you know, and ask you to buy a cell phone?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I get that on the computer all the time.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  All the time.
L:  Well, maybe, ah, what you can do is there is a button called a [inaudible] 
R:  O-
