R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Yes, my name is Max. 
L:  Max? 
R:  Yes. 
L:  Hi my name is Mike. 
R:  Hello. 
L:  So Max and Mike, two Ms. 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] M and M.
L:  Yep, so I -- M and Ms, let's see -- I think eating candy is worse.
R:  Um, what were the choices again? 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, there are about ten choices, and I didn't follow them all.  I think there was over eating, uh, voting republican, uh, too much caffeine, uh, smoking -- I'm not sure what else. 
R:  Um, was there one gossiping? 
L:  Yeah gossiping -- 
R:  Yeah I would think that's probably the worst. 
L:  Yeah that's pretty bad, because you know -- you can't destroy somebody else's reputation if you're smoking. 
R:  Yeah exactly, and I don't think the other ones are really that bad -- I mean they are bad but like -- like this one I would say is probably much worser than the rest of them.  Cause the other ones are more like worser for your body than this one is more individually. 
L:  Yeah, you know the only thing wrong with that is that if we both agree we've gotta fill up eight more minutes. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  [LAUGH] So let's think of something worse than gossiping. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Let's see -- without doing physical harm to anybody I guess. 
R:  Yeah that sounds okay. 
L:  You know my, um, teenage daughter is taking a religion class and, uh, for their assignment they were supposed to not engage in -- in gossip or idle chitchat for a day. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was like impossible for her -- for her to do. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  You know every time she'd say something, we'd go, "Oh, isn't that gossip? Or isn't that idle chitchat?"
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And, uh, she got so frustrated by the end of the day that I think she and her friends kind of like gave up on it -- it was like -- it was too hard to do. 
R:  No point.  [LAUGH] Yeah especially in high school -- like my brothers and I [inaudible] and it's really hard because like everyone does it, so it's like -- like one person can't just decide not to do it cause there's always someone instigating it or something. 
L:  Yeah, if you didn't gossip you'd have to work. 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know -- so it's something else to do other that. 
R:  Yep. 
L:  So let's see gossip we think is worse -- let's see what do we -- have we had over eating, uh, --
R:  I have to say -- 
L:  -- over drinking, taking drugs.  Is that it? 
R:  Not exercising. 
L:  Not exercising.  Well I -- I missed exercising tonight so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I guess I'll live through it. 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, uh, yeah they -- I guess I could do active harm. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Or probably worse than like not exercising where you know it's just like you're not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know you're are not making yourself better, but you're not necessarily making yourself worse. 
R:  Yeah there -- the difference is so significant really. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, but other than that also that I'm sure drugs and smoking are bad for your body and lungs. 
L:  Yep.  And too much caffeine, I don't know -- I did a thirteen hour day today and I don't think without caffeine I would of made it through. 
R:  So caffeine isn't necessarily too bad. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Although if you get too much of it you start -- I -- you know  -- I start getting the shakes after a while and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and you know -- that's not too good. 
R:  Yeah that's true you [inaudible] but I heard it gives you like, um, brown teeth -- is that true?  I don't think it is but. 
L:  Well yeah coffee and tea you can get teeth stains, but mostly on like the inside of your teeth. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, you know they don't like really turn brown they're just not as white as they might be. 
R:  Oh, -- Hm.
L:  But, you know at fifty three I'm just lucky I've got teeth -- I'm not too worried about what color they are.  Most of them are gold anyways so --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah that's okay -- that's cool. 
L:  So.
R:  Are there any other choices we're forgetting? 
L:  Uh, I'm trying to remember what kind of choices there were -- I think that's about it -- seem -- I think they purposely gave us a long list so we could spend two or three minutes just trying to figure out what, uh, --
R:  They were. 
L:  What they were.
R:  Yeah, then like come up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with it ones that are -- 
L:  How many calls you been on? 
R:  This is actually my first. 
L:  Yeah this is my third, although they've called a bunch more times but I told them they could call between seven and eleven o'clock --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they always call just right a minute or two before eleven PM and sometimes I'm just in bed asleep. 
R:  Oh, did they just call you right now? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, cause I don't know -- I called their number and then they just connected me. 
L:  Huh.
R:  Sounds pretty cool I guess. 
L:  Yeah but, uh, so I left them a message to change you know -- so I wouldn't be called after ten but they don't seem to of read their email yet. 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  But, um, [inaudible] I've been up since five -- I'm just --
R:  Oh, damn, a long day -- 
L:  I was just -- I was just brushing my teeth, heading into bed. 
R:  [LAUGH] And they just called you out of no where. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Damn.  Um, d- -- can you do more than three calls? 
L:  I don't know the -- the material said that you'd be called three times so -- I don't know whether you do more or not -- so if it's three then I'll sign off.
R: Uh-huh.
L:  But still haven't quite figured out what this study is really about. 
R:  What -- what were some of the other questions they asked before?
L:  Well let's see, one of them was how many uh, you know whether you have a lot of close friends and acquaintances or just a few -- you know whether you make friends easily. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was the last one I did.  The first one was two or three weeks ago and I'm trying to remember what w- -- what that one was, but I can't remember what that topic was.  So I don't think -- I don't think the study has anything to do with what topic it is.  They may actually be, um, you know they ask about what type of phone you're on so may be it's like whether -- whether it's a lot harder for people to talk or like one person or -- or both people are on cell phones or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that might be it. 
R:  Well I'm on a regular phone I guess. 
L:  Yeah I'm on -- and I'm on a portable, although most of the time I'm on a regular phone. 
R:  Oh.
L:  But the other night I was with some woman from Washington who was on a cell phone, and she was fading in and out at -- at --
R:  Reception? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  How would that go if you got like disconnected or something?
L:  Well you know you can get disconnected it's just like you know -- I'd hear like the first part of the sentence and then wouldn't hear the rest of it. 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know but, um, so maybe we'll find out and maybe we won't know what it's really about. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So where -- where are you from? 
R:  I am from, um, Los Angeles actually. 
L:  Okay and how many of those bad habits do you have? 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, more than I need.  [LAUGH] I don't know probably a few.  Three to four.  
L:  Three to four.
R:  Yeah -- where are you from? 
L:  Chicago
R:  Oh, Chicago -- cool.  Are you a sports fan? 
L:  Uh, well not this time of the year.  Cause, uh, --
R:  Only Football? 
L:  You know the -- the Hawks are out of the -- they didn't make it into the play off.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And hockey the Bulls didn't make it into the play off, and you know -- Baseball you know the Cubs and the White Sox didn't start off good and then.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And then fade out -- so there is nothing really going on.  How about yourself? 
R:  Well I am a -- I am a huge Clipper fan -- that's my team but I'm always a Lakers fan, I always got to cheer for them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially if they keep winning. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Coby's just too great. 
L:  Well I always l- -- I always like [inaudible] when he was in Chicago.
R:  Yeah, he was pretty -- he was doing it for the Clippers. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  I hope they sign him to like a long contract. 
L:  Yeah cause he always seemed like the kind of guy who you know -- he could play for fifteen years and he'd still be pulling down rebounds and he seems like a nice guy. 
R:  Yeah he's solid build.  [PAUSE] Hm, but athletics we don't really have a Football team and the Baseball teams I guess -- they're good like the Angels World Series.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And the Ducks have been on fire lately.
L:  That's right.
R:  Playing right now but it's zero zero. 
L:  So do they have a second round yet? 
R:  Yeah they're playing Dallas second round. 
L:  Oh, it still seems like an odd name for a Hockey team. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  The Ducks.
R:  The Mighty Ducks.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's sort of like a TV movie name.  But [LAUGH] their uniforms are pretty nice. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But it's also a Disney company -- like the Angels and Ducks, so I guess that's why they picked those names really. 
L:   Yeah.  [inaudible] Let's see what other sports teams they could buy their name after Disney characters. 
R:  Mickey Mouse.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [PAUSE] So let's see maybe we should gossip about people -- that would make sense, wouldn't it? 
R:  We should. 
L:  Yeah I'm trying to think if I know any good gossip about anybody. 
R:  Hmm.
L:  Nothing about Coby and his new bride, or anything like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Shaq's been the player lately. 
L:  Oh, that's right, Shaq got married didn't he? 
R:  Oh, yeah -- he did.  He had a kid recently too. 
L:  Yeah.  Well you know when you're that big I guess you work fast. 
R:  Yeah you have to.
