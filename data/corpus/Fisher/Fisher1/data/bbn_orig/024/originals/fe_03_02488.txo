R:  Hi.
L:  [MN] Hi --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this is Dana.
R:  This is Peter.
L:  Hi, Peter.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Pretty good, thanks.  So, we're going to talk about reality TV?
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
L:  I have to say, I don't really follow any one show.  I don't know that I've ever seen Survivor.  I have seen maybe couple parts of a episode of, like, Joe Millionaire.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I've seen some episodes of The Bachelor and, uh, The Bachelorette.
R:  Big Brother, what about Big Brother?
L:  I haven't seen that.
R:  No.  I watched the -- I probably watched the first season of all the reality stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I haven't watched much since.
L:  Yes, I have [inaudible] where I've seen some of it, I haven't seen all of it. [NOISE] I haven't -- and I'm not sure what's considered [MN] [LIPSMACK] a reality show, um --
R:  Well, American Idol, that can be still a reality, I suppose.  Because --
L:  Yeah, I've seen a little bit of that, but nothing that I follow.
R:  Yeah, I watch -- I watch a little bit of that.  Survivor, I watched the Australian one and the -- whatever the first one was, and I thought that was fun, but people are eating 'em up, but there's a lot of stupid reality at the moment --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- that's not going over very well.
L:  Yes.  I did see that, uh, I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.  I watched several episodes --
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  -- of that one.  Yes, I did.
R:  Did you like that?
L:  Ah, if it was on again, I don't know that I would watch it again, um, you know, even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- though I'm sure they'd have different celebrities in a different setting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably like they do for Survivor, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's different.  But it's, like, "All right, I've seen it" [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It -- it --
R:  Yeah, I didn't like that.  I co- -- well, I couldn't stand the celebrities.
L:  Well, most of them were not people I even knew --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- I mean, had heard of.
R:  -- they were -- I mean that Rivers -- Rivers -- Joan Rivers' daughter bugged the hell out of me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I couldn't stand her, so I was, like, you know, and then a couple of other people.  So, I -- I watched one, I think, and then I thought, "Hm".  But these other ones with this, you know, Married by America and ...
L:  I haven't seen that.
R:  Yeah, that -- that was, I mean, I watched a little bit of it, 'cause it was so stupid I had to watch it. [MN]
L:  Sure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I had to check out the Joe Millionaire, because I had seen commercials or something on a -- I don't know what about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And thought I had to check it out, ah, just -- just --
R:  Oh, they got -- they got a lot of press, they did, for that show.
L:  That's probably why.
R:  Because that was --
L:  But I didn't care for that.  I didn't like the people, per se.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And then it kinda -- and it was just, you know, gold diggers versus silly guy and then, you know --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- the ending was -- the ending was so -- I mean, I had to watch the ending 'cause of --
L:  I didn't see the ending, 'cause --
R:  It was so -- nobody cared.
L:  Right.
R:  When he said he wasn't a millionaire, no one gave two hoots.
L:  Right.
R:  They were just trying to get on TV so they could, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- go and play boy or --
L:  Oh, yuck.
R:  -- be a cheerleader or something like that.  That's what they were [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yuck.
R:  That's what the girls were doing.
L:  Well, and then, from of the episodes of The Bachelor that I saw, I thought the women on Joe Millionaire were not the same kind of women [NOISE] 'cause, like, the w- -- t- the little bit of The Bachelor I saw --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the ones that I had seen were professional women.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, one was a marketing person, one was this, that or the other thing.  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's the difference between ABC and Fox, I think.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think it's got to do -- yeah, ABC is pretty good and Fox is trash.  I mean, if you -- any of the trashy reality will be on Fox, I think, I mean, like, that --
L:  Oh, well, that's probably why I don't see too much of that. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's why Married -- Married by America was on Fox and, uh --
L:  Now, what was that?   Was that where they actually, like, pick the person to get married?
R:  Well, the -- they -- they had a girl that was married -- getting married, and they had to pick guys, and America voted down the guys and then they finally got to, like, three guys and, actually, she didn't meet him until after the ring was on the finger.  It was --
L:  No, see, that's just wrong. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's what's wrong with the marriage world nowadays, you know?
L:  Right, I would not even care to watch something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't even check it out.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I checked it, 'cause it was so stupid.  Maybe there was nothing else on, I don't know.  But, I mean, I thought, "This is -- this is stupid".  I --
L:  You know, it is really silly, because if you happen to be -e changing channels and you come across something like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you stop for a minute.
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  You know, and you go, "What's this?"
R:  Yeah.  People -- people like reality.
L:  And I think the draw -- right.  It's -- I think the draw is, if these are r- regular people and it's unscripted, you know, who knows, um, you know, maybe it's more real reality, but I think after you watch it for a while you realize, "Okay, um, okay, maybe it's not scripted".  I don't know that these are exactly regular people, and -- 'cause would a regular person really go on there, like you were saying, the kind of women you thought -- why they went on Joe Millionaire?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, [NOISE] you know, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they probably film a whole lot [NOISE] but then they choose what they put on the show.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's edited.  I mean, you know, one hour could be a week, like Survivor, you know?  Survivor's, like, a couple of days and then they throw a -- you know, who knows what happened, and they'll make you look however they want you to look.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and that's TV, though.  I mean, you -- but, you know, you better be ready for that if you're giving yourself to the television.
L:  Right, I saw The Bachelor, Aaron, talk about one kiss that had been televised and he said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they made that scene, because they filmed it from three different camera angles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they made it seem three times as long and three times as much and three times as whatever as what it really was.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And I do get -- start getting uncomfortable with those shows, when they start kissing and stuff.
R:  Yeah, but that's --
L:  C- --
R:  -- that -- that's ratings.
L:  'Cause it goes from him or her, if it's The Bachelorette or whatever, I didn't see too much of that, but they go from kissing one person onto a date with another person that they're kissing and you're just going, "Okay, what --"
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- what's happening here?"  So I think --"
R:  But you gotta be --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a special kind of person to want to go on a show like that, I think.  I mean, I [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  Yeah, I don't think you're a regular person.
R:  Yeah, I don't think -- I mean --
L:  I don't think the average Joe on the street would go.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you -- you know, and then these ones that, you know, they -- they've met the guy or what -- the girl or whatever it was, I watched something, and they're all bummed out, 'cause after, like, one day they were in love with this person and then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they got kicked off, and it was, like, "Oh, my God" and they're crying and stuff like this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I was, like, "Wow.  You know, you guys gotta go get a life".
L:  Yes.
R:  But, you know, I mean, people like that real life thing, there's something about -- [NOISE]  something about, you know, they think they -- there's something happening new or -- or fresh or -- you know, I don't know.  It's that dream, I suppose, being rich, too.  Because there's always money involved.
L:  So, really, in a way they're not reality shows, they're fantasy sh- -- fantasy shows.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's, y- you know, but to people, I mean, they're stepping out of -- stepping out of their life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and putting themselves in that position and they kinda dream, you know, like you say, you know, it's like a reality, but, uh, but not real.  You know, I mean, it's reality, but not real.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause it --
L:  Like if you go to a chateau and you're supposed to be vying for the affections of this millionaire guy --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, is that really real?
R:  And it --
L:  I guess you do see their real -- assuming the people are genuine, you see their real responses to things, like you were saying --
R:  Well, you --
L:  -- all the tears when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you got cut from the show, that you were in love with him.
R:  Yeah, I know, that thing.  And that was -- well, that's ratings.  I mean, she's crying and stuff, I mean, the ratings people love that stuff.  It's, like, here's a woman that's lost it, you know?  But the -- you know, I think you have to be kind of -- I mean, I don't know what kind of person you have to be to, you know, I don't know where the ad in the newspaper is where it says, you know, "Call up if you're a good looking girl to go and -- go and date somebody in France", you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know where these people are looking or where they're getting found.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, I think it's --
L:  That's true.  I don't know either.
R:  But -- 
L:  I think once a show is there, like Survivor, people would probably figure out, "Oh, I really want to go on Survivor.  I can figure out how to --"
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's cool.  And, like, Fear Factor.  Fear Factor, the same thing, if you can see yourself eating some of that junk --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or putting up with a little bit of that stuff, you know, you have a chance of winning fifty grand.
L:  Yeah, I've seen that.  I'm sorry, I couldn't eat the junk.  I can't even watch them eat the junk.  So --
R:  No?  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I could, I mean, I could -- I could eat a certain some of the stuff, you know, I mean, if it's the blender one where it's all pureed and put into a martini glass, that was okay.  I could do something like that.
L:  I didn't see -- I don't see it that often.  I have seen that one.  Now, is a show like Trading Spaces considered a reality show?
R:  Trading Spaces?
L:  That's the decorating, you know, where the neighbors swap homes and do up each other's --
R:  Oh, I suppose that c- -- oh, I know that one, yeah.  That could be, I suppose.  I mean, it's --
L:  Now, see, I love that show. [LAUGH]
R:  That's kind of reality, 'cause, I mean, the neighbors doing their -- the only thing, I -- I mean, I -- I've watched a couple of those and it's just not -- not real enough.  I mean, it's -- I don't know, I mean, it's -- they just don't seem that candid about it, you know, when they actually come and see it, some of those ones.  I don't know which one I've seen, but --
L:  Oh, yes.  I've seen some.  I've seen some people swear --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and cry and have to say, "I have to leave the room".
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then what they do?  What do they get to do to that room?  'Cause that's their room, right?
L:  It's their room.
R:  Their house.
L:  So they can do whatever they want to change it back, if they want to repaint, if they want to whatever.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's on them, though.
R:  Well, that would be fun to go on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See, I'd -- I'd like to go on that.  But I'd make sure that whoever's redoing it, i- -- you know, has my tastes or something.
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you pick -- do you pick who -- who redoes it?
L:  I don't think so.  See, I would do it if I could pick, 'cause I know the person that I would want to have my room done by.
R:  Yeah, 'cause then, you know, that's hopefully in the same sort of realm of what you want and you -- you nearly get what you want but with their flair.
L:  Right.  And I've seen the ones that seem to listen to the homeowners, or the people that just go with their own idea and just do it, regardless of what the rest of the house looks like, what the people have said they want or don't want. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  'Cause I watched one and this woman was a little freaked out and, I mean, the house -- it didn't go with the house at all, it's like all this black and browns and the rest of her house was all fresh and happening, and here's this dark weird thing, but yeah.
L:  And that's the thing about Trading Spaces, it's the drama of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if the people don't like it and whatever.  But otherwise it's just decorating.
R:  Well, that -- that's probably reality.
L:  It's just decorating otherwise.  And there's other decorating ones like that, similar vein, but I can't say that I've seen them.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, what else is -- oh -- oh, is -- well, I suppose
