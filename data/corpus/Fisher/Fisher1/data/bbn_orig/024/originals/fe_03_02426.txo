R:  Hi, my name's Amanda.
L:  Hi, I'm Dave.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in southern California.
R:  Oh, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia, oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this -- 
R:  I've just moved here -- 
L:  -- is this the first time you've, ah, been called by this thing?
R:  No, actually.  I had one last night.
L:  Oh, I did too.
R:  So, it was first -- 
L:  That was my first one, so --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] So -- 
L:  Ah, okay, um -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] personal habits, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Drinking -- what was this that she was saying about doing something excessively.  Did she say cussing?
L:  Um, I don't remember -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- it.  They go through it so quick.  It'd be so nice if they repeated it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it was, like, overeating, drinking, smoking, not exercising, and there was another one.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what the other one was -- 
L:  Which is the worst?
R:  I -- you know, I have this big thing against smoking, you know -- 
L:  Oh, you know [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- a real big, like [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I just -- I -- I just can't stand smoking -- smokers.  I -- I mean, well, I mean not on a personal basis.  But, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, but the whole -- 
L:  I mean, I know people who are smoke- who I like -- who smoke who I like very much.  But, I mean, just sort of as a thing, smoking bugs me more than anything -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  For [several inaudible words] this type of this.
R:  It's just like, first of all, why would you want to suck on something like that, you know, that burns your chest [LAUGH]?  It makes you look so ridiculous and then, you know, it kills the people around you more than it does you and I -- it's really inconsiderate to -- to me, I think.
L:  Which -- 
R:  Like, I mean, I guess it, ah, it annoys me when people are talking belligerent.  But, you don't see that so much anymore, at least I don't and all of that stuff.  You know, and being overweight -- when you're sitting on the bus you get squashed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, that's not going to kill me.  [LAUGH] So, but, it -- 
L:  Well, you can always stand, you know, if you really -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you really can't stand it but there's [several inaudible words].  Yeah, I mean, I -- I would never say anything that -- I mean, of course, someone who wanted to smoke in my house I would say something.  But, I mean -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, those people in the street or whatever, I would never say anything to them.  But, I mean, I will deliberately, like, speed up to pass people or slow down to let them get ahead of me so that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can avoid their smoke.  But, I wouldn't -- but, I don't think I'm obvious about it.  I hope not.  I mean, I don't want to be rude, really, I guess.  But -- but, I do really go out of my way to try to avoid it.
R:  See I actually -- I think the smoking thing is rude anyway so --
L:  Well, yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I have said things to people, especially like if I'm sitting at the bus stop, I was there first and, you know, they come and sit down with a cigarette or they light up a cigarette after they've sat down and I'll be like, you know, I mean, I have asthma.  I'm allergic to many of the things in the smoke anyway.  So, I have a serious problem with it.  So, I usually [several inaudible words] like, "You know, I really have a problem with cigarettes health wise.  Can you please not smoke here.  Can you go over there."  And I've found that, for the most part when you're civilized about it, people are willing to obey.  But, this was also in Utah.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Utah?
R:  -- I'm orig- I'm originally from Ut- well, actually, I'm originally from Georgia but, like, my mom and I are in Utah now.  I'm just going to school here.  I'm studying.  Um, so, yeah -- 
L:  You go to school in New York, I mean, in Philadelphia -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pennsylvania, or whatever it was?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  So -- but -- 
L:  Why are you in -- although we're not supposed to be talking [several inaudible words] I'd -- 
R:  It -- yeah.
L:  -- why are you in Utah?
R:  Like, she -- we moved out there because she finished grad school.  She want- --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so, jobs -- economy out there's [NOISE] great and she got an offer.  So, you know, that's where we ended up.  But, it -- we've been there for thirteen years.  It was supposed to be a short stint until she could find something else.  But, [LAUGH] thirteen years later, here we are.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I've -- I went to college in Utah.
R:  Oh, you did?  Where'd you go?
L:  BYU.
R:  Ah, foo[?].
L:  Hm.  Yes, well --  
R:  Ah, foo.
L:  Um, I no longer am associated with that group.  But, um -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um -- 
R:  That's a whole [several inaudible words] story I have.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said that's a whole another story I -- 
L:  Yes, it is and, um, I'm perfectly willing to talk about that.  But, um, I'm not sure how -- 
R:  I -- I think we're -- 
L:  I know they're recording these things.  I don't know what -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really don't know what they're studying.  Um -- 
R:  I'm -- [NOISE] I've got their information somewhere and they want us -- it's something about people and their interaction and use of language, if I'm not mistaken --
L:  Yes.  But, I'm -- 
R:  -- because it's part of the -- 
L:  -- you know, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't seem to be zapping us if we move away from the topic a little bit -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, ah, yeah -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, um -- 
R:  I mean, I'm sure they have to know that people are going to steer a little, so -- 
L:  Sure.  Yeah, sure. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm wondering if there might be something else that they're studying, you know, like how topics move and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from one thing to another or something.  But, who knows, [inaudible] -- but, of course, if they don't want us to know that because if -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- we know that --
R:  We -- 
R:  -- then we may consciously -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] the whole study.
L:  -- or unconsciously skew the thing.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway, yeah.  Well, I -- I don't know.  Um, Utah, huh?  Well --  
R:  Yes -- 
L:  -- I -- 
R:  -- it's interesting, though.  You would think in Utah you don't get so many smokers, which I found, like, coming out here, like, everybody smokes.  But, it seems to be much more pervasive in Utah, to me.  I don't know, maybe it's because it's like such a clean place anyway and then somebody comes and disrupts your little environment and you're, like, "Wait a minute".  Like, meanwhile being in Phili, it's like everywhere you turn there's cigarette smoke.  So -- 
L:  Well, you know, it's interesting because I recently read a -- something somewhere, um, about -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how the percentage of people smoking are going down, um, and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was, ah, of course, like, it seems to me it was like in the middle twenties of people who smoked -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and, you know, then they had other things about, you know, men and women and regional things.  But, ah, I know, yeah, I mean, I've lived in California more or less my whole life except for when I was in Utah and, um, ah, when I went back to, um, Washington DC a couple of years ago, just on a little trip to, you know, see all the Washington DC things, um, it was just so shocking to go some place where, you know, they wanted to know whether you wanted to be in the smoking or the non-smoking section where -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause in California they just don't allow it.  I mean --  
R:  The same thing as in Utah.
L:  -- they don't allow smoking -- they don't allow smoking in restaurants.  They don't allow smoking in bars -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they don't allow smoking in anything, you know -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- I mean, and, um -- 
R:  -- I found really interesting because, like, even down in Georgia the restaurants are pretty much all smoke free.  Like, there are some -- it's not a state law, like, they don't have a clean air act like they do out in Utah.  But, now, here it's kind of like, do you want smoking or non-smoking, and the smoking table's right next to the non-smoking table.  And you're, like, "Is there a point".  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  [inaudible], you know, I went -- we ate in a -- some place in -- in, ah, Virg- er, um, Alexandria, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the salad bar was in the smoking section and it was, like, oh gross, you know?
R:  Of course, now my salad tastes like cigarettes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, I -- it was -- it was, you know, it's -- but, it's been -- it's very o- odd going some place else, um, because California is so strict, um -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- about this -- 
R:  -- I think you guys are the only ones with the bar thing.  Like, you're supposed to be able to smoke in a bar, I think, but, it's nice to know that I can go to California and go to a bar if I wanted to and, like, not have to worry about suffocating death.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Ah.
R:  But, that -- that is really interesting.  It's -- it was a definite thing for me that I had to get used to coming out here.  Especially when I came to the school, like, things are smoke free pretty much on campus, except for being outside obviously.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, when I finally started, like, going out and eating out I was, like, "What do you mean, like, smoking and non smoking?  Like, you can't smoke.  It's a building".  [LAUGH] And then I realised, no, yes you can.
L:  Well, there is a small town.  I -- I'm not sure how much I am supposed to tell you.  I -- I live -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Ventura County which is just north of Los Angeles and the -- and one --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of the smaller towns in the county actually doesn't allow smoking outside.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um, I mean, like -- well, I mean, I'm not sure exactly how strict it is.  But, I mean, like, walking up down the street in the business section, you can't smoke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the street.  It is illegal.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  I'm assuming they let you smoke in your own backyard or whatever --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I don't -- I -- I don't know the detail.  But, they don't allow smoking on the street.
R:  I mean, I really think --
L:  And -- 
R:  -- it should be [inaudible] because it's --
L:  So, you should move there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a serious health hazard.  Yeah, right?  [LAUGH] But, it's a serious health hazard, I think -- 
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- for other people.
L:  It is. 
R:  And it's like if you can't drink and drive, which obviously makes sense, like, why is it okay to, like, smoke and endanger everyone around you?  You know, it's a -- especially, I think even over time that, you know, you -- if you live in a city or somewhere where there's a lot of smoking going on, even if you don't smoke yourself, you're going to get enough and it's going to affect you in some way.
L:  I think so.  And someone like yourself -- it sounds like you're already susceptible to, um, you know, like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm assuming like respiratory problems and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and whatnot.  Um, it would be, um, even worse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, I just -- I just can't stand smoking.
R:  It's -- it's -- everything about is just awful to me, I think.  So -- 
L:  Um, okay.
R:  I mean, they're all -- all the things that they listed were pretty bad vices, I think.  But, you know, like, if someone chooses to be [several inaudible words] that generally doesn't have too much affect on my life whereas if they're smoking -- I mean, drinking alcohol the way they put it was kind of vague.  I'm, like, well, like, I drink every now and then, like, not generally that often but, you know, I still don't drive, um, and if, you know, me and my friends were all to the point, you know, if we ever -- anybody who had one drink was not allowed to drive.  And if one person had to drive everyone home, you know, and we left the cars [several inaudible words], you know, something like that, then that's what happens.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  Well, you know, there's -- there's drinking and drinking, and there's overeating and there's overeating.  But, smoking is always -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- disgusting.
R:  [inaudible], exactly, like -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there's no --
