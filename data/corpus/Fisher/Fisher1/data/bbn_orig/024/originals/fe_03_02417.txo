R:  Hello, ah, my name is Peaches.
L:  Peaches?
R:  Yes.
L:  My name is Elizabeth.
R:  Nice to meet you, yes.
L:  It's nice to meet you.
R:  Yes.  Um, would you like to begin on me?
L:  Ah, go right ahead.
R:  Um, I think drinking is.  I really do.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I think drinking is bad.  I do because first of all I don't drink, you know, and that's because I --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  That's because I see what it do to people, you know, around me -- 
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- not that I do, but that type of people.
L:  Yes, I agree.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  You know, but if the intoxication, the amount of alcohol that they consume -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's the smell and their --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- behaviour.
L:  And that particularly.
R:  And I'm not putting everybody in one -- in one clump, you see, in one group.  I'm not putting everybody in one group.  But, basically I see alcoholism.  You know -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on a daily basis.  And they're hum- 
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  -- yeah -- and they're human too, you know, and you start to care a- care about these people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then you start to question them.  You say, "Well, why are you drinking to the point where you have sclerosis of the liver, you know, and other -- other -- other diseases that come from it?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- if -- if -- if -- and they -- they skim the bit[?] they -- they're malnutritioned.  They urinate on themselves, they vomit in public.  I see these things on a daily basis.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, uh-huh.  I live across the street from a liquor store.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yes, and they p- they --
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] catch you to.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Wait I'll check it out.  And they pan handle.  They do.  And these are good people one time you could tell -- you could see --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- that they lost all of their -- their -- their will to live.  Most of them are men, and most of them -- the majority of them was in, um, let's say the military forces or something.  You know?
L:  [NOISE] Not many of them [NOISE] are not in that particular group because they are functioning. 
R:  Exac- not the ones that I know.  But, you -- okay, let me hear your experience and tell me which -- which, um, topic you don't like the most.
L:  Oh, which -- which one I don't like the most?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] it's very hard to pick among all those.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, but, I -- there are many alcoholics that are functioning -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they have jobs.
R:  Yes.
L:  They go to work but when -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they leave work they -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drink.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they drink on weekend and they drink every evening.
R:  Yes.
L:  Those are f- they're functioning alcoholics.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I think, [NOISE] and I don't have any scientific data -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- it's -- it's [inaudible] that I think that that is a -- is a disease.  It's a -- it's a need.  A physical need for it.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  It's deep, you know?  And my, um -- was you finished?
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  Um, what about smoking.  Let me hear your thoughts on smoking.
L:  I hate it.
R:  And who are we -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I hate it.  [LAUGH] I just -- it's disgusting.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And, ah, alcoholism doesn't necessarily affect every body.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  But, that -- that you -- well, [several inaudible words] an alcoholic is around.  But, smoking affects everybody that's around it.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  It makes everybody sick.
R:  Yes.
L:  You don't have to smoke to be -- to have the results of smoking.
R:  Exactly.  Second hand smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're older.  They carries on the clothes.  The stained teeth.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  The -- the, um, the vitamin and iron -- the vitamin deficiency that comes from it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The cravings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It -- and you're absolutely right.  And you may not believe it but I smoke.  And I don't enjoy it but I have a need to fulfil my nicotine -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- addiction, and it is an --
L:  I agree -- 
R:  -- addiction.
L:  -- it -- it is an addiction.
R:  It is definitely an addiction.  And I try to -- and what I do, I try to minimize the amount that I smoke which is very little.  Very little.  And I do not like it.  I don't -- I don't like smoking -- 
L:  You don't?  Well, let me ask you a question then.
R:  Mhm.  Mm -- 
L:  If you don't like it, what are the steps you've taken to try and not do it?
R:  Um, you know, I never tried not to smoke.  And -- and I need to and maybe I will.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You see, so -- hello?
L:  I'm -- I'm here.
R:  Mhm, so y- so today's topic will make me aware of my dislike for it.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  You understand?  This is very good --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for me, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, that's wonderful.
R:  Yes.  So, now I'm conscious of the fact and I always knew it.  You understand?  But, this --
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- is an awakening for me and I'm able to be --
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  -- honest with it.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Yes.  And I don't even -- I smoke in my house cigarettes but I don't like for anyone to come in my home and smoke because I don't want to smell it.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And if they smoke more than me, like if they don't take two puffs and put it out -- I don't want them smoking.
L:  No.  I don't allow it in my home or my car.
R:  Yes, that's very good.  That's very good.
L:  Even if -- my youngest son smokes and when he comes to visit he -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- does not smoke in my house.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  He has to go outside to do it.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And he does that when I'm at his house.  He goes outside to smoke.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, I can't stay at his house.  I can't sleep there.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  Because he -- because he's home and that his -- his environment and he's allowed to --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- smoke.
L:  That's right.
R:  So -- so the best thing for you to do is to just stay -- you know, stay where's a smoke environment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm glad that they did pass the non-public smoking.  I love it.  I've never smoked outside of my home.  Never -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  Never.
L:  Wow.
R:  I thought that doing it was a personal addiction.  Something that I wasn't -- I wasn't proud of doing.  When I buy cigarettes people will say, "You smoke?" Hm, you understand?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's not something -- and people don't realise it but it's not something to glorify.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  It never has been for me.  It never has been for me.  No.  No, I don't like it.  That's something about me that I do not enjoy.  And that's a personal experience that I'm sharing with you.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Well -- well, I'm glad that this is a -- a wakeup call -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for you.
R:  Yes.  And what was the other topic.  They said, "Smoking, drinking".
L:  Um -- 
R:  Cursing.  Cursing.
L:  I find that very offensive.
R:  So do I.  Yes.
L:  And as offensive as I find it, it [several inaudible words] I find a word coming out of my mouth -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that I'm [inaudible], just --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- from [several inaudible words].
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And it's simply because everybody around you -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uses those words.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it's not that you have a need to use that word.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, you hear it so much that it -- it has become common place.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And it's -- it's offensive to me.  And when -- when a word comes out of my mouth that -- that I find offensive -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like somebody slaps me in the face.
R:  Yes.
L:  Like, "Where did that come from?"
R:  Mm, mhm, mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you find it out of character for you?
L:  Yes.
R:  You find -- 
L:  At one time in my life it was not.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  At this time in my life it's -- it's very offensive.
R:  Me?  I'm a share my experience.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm African --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in America, you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- see?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my surroundings is urban.  And I use it for expression not a lot.  And I use it for a weapon.  It's a verbal weapon for me.  It's a -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yes.  I can cut someone up.  You should hear me.  You would go --
L:  Oh, I could to.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- a- a- I go off. You know what I mean?  I -- 
L:  At one time in my life -- 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I could cut you up and you would not --
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
L:  -- even know it.  Not until you got away from me you'd realise, "Oh, my".  [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes.  Yes.  And -- and -- 
L:  I don't do that anymore.
R:  Exactly.  I'm toning down because I'm watching my behaviour more.
L:  Good.
R:  But, it's a -- it's a -- it's a weapon that I know I have and that I have perfected.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know how you may know karate and you'd be like, "Yow, I know that".  But, it -- you know, not to harm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nobody but to defend my- myself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When I throw 'em, believe me I go off.  I'm very careful who I do it in front of and never in public.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, you see.  So, it -- it has to be expression.  Like, Asti[?] -- Asti, you know, and that's my favorite.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, Asti.  What you mean?  Asti.  I don't know be allowed to curse that's why -- you see, I didn't do it.  You see --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what I'm saying here?  But, I can do that if -- you know.  And -- and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know it's a -- it's a normality to me.  I don't get off- I don't get too offensive about it.  But, it's offensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, when you hear people cursing and it's normal for them, like -- or -- and they close setting[?] you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, in my -- in my -- in my group of people it's -- it's -- it's not commonplace.  Ye- yes it is.  It is.  It is.  But, not too much.
L:  Well, see, it's not commonplace with my group -- 
R:  Yes.  You see the difference?
L:  -- at all.
R:  Yes.  Exactly.
L:  Okay.  What was our other topic?
R:  Cursing, drinking, ah, swearing.  I think a liar.  Did they say a liar?  I wonder can we ask them or can we just -- 
L:  [LAUGH] No, [several inaudible words] remember.
R:  I mean, but maybe we could just continue to talk about things that we notice a- you know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Did they say stealing?  They may have said -- said stealing.  We don't -- 
L:  They may have.
R:  [LAUGH] Because it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- seem [several inaudible words] the group, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It does go with the group [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Am I right?  Okay, I'm a begin[?] I've never s-
