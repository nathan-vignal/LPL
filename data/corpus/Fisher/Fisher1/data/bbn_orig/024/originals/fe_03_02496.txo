L:  Dawn.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, my -- my name is Barry.
L:  Hi, Barry.
R:  Uh, what do you think about reality TV?
L:  Well, you know what?  We always say that we're not going to watch it, my husband and I, but we always wind up watching it. [LAUGH] It's l- -- uh, it's -- I've felt like it's probably 'cause, um, you -- you always wanna see what -- what people will do when they're just, you know, in their own element.
R:  Well, it gets people to do things they wouldn't normally do for money and for, uh, popularity, like some of the people obviously are hoping, uh, after they were off the show to turn it into some kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- career.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, just, like on, um, uh, we watch, uh, American Idol, um, and there's a lot of the -- the people that were in last year's American Idol that, you know, didn't make it and are currently doing sitcoms now.  And, uh, and stuff li- -- and -- and have albums that are fixing to come out, you know?  So, I mean, they can do a lot with -- with their popularity --
R:  Well --
L:  -- afterwards.
R:  -- it -- it -- it kind of -- the bottom line can be, of these shows, is that people will do anything for money.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  And --
R:  And, uh, it doesn't matter, you know, how degrading it is or, uh, whatever, uh, I'm not sure it sends a good message to -- to, uh, younger people.
L:  Well, it doesn't send a good message to younger people, but, um, if you're doing it for the right reasons and you're not going to, uh, jeopardize your, um, your beliefs and your personality, then, uh, then it -- it's a good idea.
R:  Well, I think pe- pe- people -- I -- I think go on the show, I'm -- I'm not saying everybody, but at least some people go on the show with certain beliefs that they're not going to go beyond a certain point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then they get into the show --
L:  And they do.
R:  -- and -- and they're -- they get pu- -- shoved or pushed or peer pressure or, uh, they start thinking, you know, "Maybe I can win all this" and, uh, their beliefs certainly are put to the test.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, uh, a- and -- but i- if you are a true person of -- of God then -- then, uh, you would stand tall and stand true to your beliefs.  Now, if you're someone that just likes to put on a front and to, uh, to say that, you know, that you're a good person, then you're not going to hold true to your beliefs, and it's going to come out --
R:  Well, I -- I --
L:  -- because if you're true --
R:  -- think that happens a lot on those shows.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It will, your true nature always comes out, no matter what.
R:  Because part of it is back biting, you know, uh, you -- you're going to be voted off and you're trying to be friends with everybody so you're not the person voted off the show and, uh, all of a sudden, uh, y- you know, as I said, uh, you -- you're conspiring to get rid of other people that you may even like in -- to some degree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or pretend to like.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  Well, and, you know, a lot of two facing going on, and it's one thing that I've really -- I've really, you know, like Survivor, I watch Survivor and I don't know why, I just do.  It's some -- it just intrigues me for some reason.  I guess it's mainly to see how many, you know, nasty people we really do have in this world, you know?  And, uh, you know, like the Rob character that's on there.  He just -- he befriended a lot of people and then turns around and just, you know, totally smacks them on, uh, in the face and says, "Yeah, well, you shouldn't have trusted me" and, you know, that -- that shouldn't be the way the -- the world is.  You should be able to trust people and, um, but of course, why would you go on a reality show that, uh, is basically about not trusting if you were trustworthy, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it reminds me something like Jerry Springer, that these people go on the show and, uh, if everything is okay in your life at all, uh, and you're invited on the show by your girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever, you know something's coming.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  I mean, you have to be just an absolute dumbbell to not know they're going to say they're sleeping with your mother or your brother or your sister or God knows what.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, uh, you know you're being set up, and yet these people --
L:  Still go on.
R:  -- seem to have these expressions, like, "Oh, I don't believe this".
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  Like it's coming from nowhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, these shows are -- are, from the networks' point of view, are -- are very popular because they can put them on at relatively very low cost, they don't have to be paying, like, the Friends people, hundreds of thousands of dollars each -- each one of them for -- for one, uh, episode.  Uh, the people come on, even if they win fifty thousand dollars, it's peanuts compared to what they would pay actual -- actual actors and actresses, or people to write, uh, screenplays or, uh --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- comedy shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And from their point of view, it's very popular, at a very -- relatively very low cost.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I still think this is going to, at some point, uh, remember the show, the, you know, the millionaire type shows that were on where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people would answer questions?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- they started off just a little bit and then it was on, like, three or four or five times a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think these shows eventually are going to peter out.
L:  Yeah, I -- and --
R:  But I could be wrong.
L:  Well, I -- I believe they will too, for the simple fact that, um, you -- you're gonna -- you're gonna r- reach -- y- -- right now, you're reaching the people that are willing to -- to degrade themselves and, uh, and --
R:  Well, that's a lot of people for money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And -- but then you're gonna -- then you're gonna get those people that are just, you know, they're -- they're not gonna be willing to do that.  They're not going to, uh, put themselves on the level just for entertainment.  And that's exactly what it is.  They get millions and millions of dollars just in -- just in showing the show for entertainment.  And what is it, just to give away one million dollars, when you're getting five, six, seven million dollars in the ratings?  And, um --
R:  A lot more than that.
L:  Yeah.  And so, you know, one of these days, people are gonna say, "Well, you know, kinda tired, it's the same thing over and over again", you know, "Why do I continue to watch this?" and w- -- just like with the -- with the, uh, a, uh, sitcom series, it doesn't last that long.  There's -- there -- there comes a time when it's run its course and it's time to say goodbye to it, and it will run its course, it's just a matter of time, working its way out. [COUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I'm not a fan of it, I have to say, uh, I don't denigrate anybody that wants to watch it, you know, everybody has what they like to watch.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I'm not a particular fan of it, uh, but, uh, that's just me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Well, [MN] --
R:  Maybe if I was younger and I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- had a great, beautiful body and everything and all this money was waved ac- -- you know, in front of me, and this was my one moment or ch- chance to get fame or get noticed, uh, maybe my, uh, attitude would be a lot different.
L:  Well, not only that, I mean, there's the, like, a -- a ... um, the Bachelor show.  I don't understand how you can sit there and go thr- -- you know, do that kind of stuff.
R:  Well, you're making out with, uh, thirty or forty different women.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, they're all --
L:  Making out with their partners and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and their partners' partners.
R:  And they're all sitting around thinking it's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, and it -- it's disgusting.
R:  "And I just wish he'd make out with me".
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's very disgusting and I don't -- and then -- and then you're going to sit there and say, "Well, this is the person I want to marry"?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've only known 'em for a month.
R:  And -- and at the end of the show you've known this -- this person for all of a week or whatever they've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- known 'em, and boy, that -- that -- that's a great, uh, uh, basis to start a marriage.
L:  Exactly.  And especially when you just got finished, uh, smooching all over some other girl. [LAUGH] So, you really haven't even known 'em for that long.
R:  A- and the -- you know, the engagement rings start flying and -- and two or three weeks later you find out they broke up.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, it's just --
R:  And, uh, I -- I just don't see it, but as I said, maybe I'm just an old fuddy duddy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah --
L:  No, because, I mean, I wouldn't do anything like that either, you know, people -- pe- -- uh, m- marriage is -- is a sacred bond and it should be kept that way.  You should not go into it lightly and, um, so you have people go on a show like that and say, "Okay, I'll -- I'll marry whoever, ah, you know, turns me on the best".  It's pretty degrading to the people around, uh, that have been married and put a lot of work into their marriage and believe it to be a bond between two people.
R:  Well --
L:  And then you see this -- this man or this woman going around, um --
R:  This -- this reminds me, to -- to some degree, as I said, of Jerry Springer show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It may be a little bit elevated.  I mean, at least the people going on are -- are not completely crazy or nuts, like they would be on Springer, but to me it's the same idea going on, that people will do anything --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ah, for their fame or whatever and, uh, ah, I just think it just -- you know, uh, goes to the lowest common denominator, but apparently, especially among young people, it's a very popular -- and, uh, I don't -- I don't blame the -- the, uh, networks for putting it on, as I said.  To them it's a --
L:  It's ratings.
R:  -- i- -- very inexpensive to put on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- extremely popular, they don't have to, uh, write a lot about it and, uh, uh, it's very cost effective, and they're -- they're looking for some way to compete, uh, with, uh, HBO and Showtime --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and, uh, other, uh, uh, networks like that and, uh, trying to, uh, come up with something that's going to get the attention of young people and, uh, you know, uh, I'm sure that they would love to put nudity on, if they could get away with it, and bad language and, uh, every -- everything down the line.
L:  Well, the -- and wh- -- and when they do that --
