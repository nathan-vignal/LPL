L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.  My name is Marina and I'm from LA.
R:  You're from where?
L:  LA.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm Sherry and I'm from Seattle.
L:  Okay.  So, um, what are we gonna talk about again? 
R:  The reality shows on television --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- like, Do You Want to Marry a Millon- Millionaire or Survivor.
L:  Okay.  [MN] Okay, so --
R:  Do you watch -- do you watch them or any of 'em?
L:  [MN] N- -- actually I don't because I don't have cable 'cause I'm hardly home --
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, so, um, I hear more about them than I actually, you know, than I actually see them, so, um --
R:  Do you ever see the ads for them?
L:  Do I have what?
R:  On TV?  'Cause there's -- there's many of those shows that are on regular TV channels.
L:  Yeah, I have seen them before but, I don't know, I don't really have time to watch TV, so ...  I mean, I watch them because they're pretty entertaining --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, I wouldn't actually plan, you know, to -- to  -- to plan a time to, um, to watch them or something like that, no.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm surprised that people do watch them as much as they do.  I've watched the Do You Want to Marry a Millionaire thing --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, ah, [MN] and I only watched the survival type one -- I'll be ten -- so, but, I -- I can't understand why people watch the Fear Factor ones.  They seem really, I don't know, just pretty disgusting to [inaudible].
L:  Oh, I -- I've seen Fear Factor, yeah, yeah, you're right.
R:  Now, do you like -- do you like it?  I mean --
L:  Ah, actually, you know, I do.
R:  Why?  
L:  I do.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know.  I mean, they're just entertaining.  That -- that's all it is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think that there's really -- that these people are really in danger or anything.  So, [MN] it's just pure --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- entertainment to me.
R:  I don't think they're in danger but I think it's so disgusting.  I mean, like, eating bugs or eating stomach --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lining or the one I saw the ad for was burying somebody in the ground as if it was a grave.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ooh.
R:  And when I saw that it just totally --
L:  That's kind of nasty anyway.
R:  I don't know.  I think people are desensitized or -- or something or they need [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- maybe they're just so far away from their own feelings and --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- the natural part of life that they just go to things where they just -- I don't know.  I mean, I don't -- I don't really get that.
L:  [MN]  I've seen the, um, what is it, ah Meet the -- Meet My Parents or something?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you know this one?
R:  I didn't see that one but I saw the ads for it.
L:  Yeah, it's like, um, um --
R:  Oh, I did too.  I saw it once.
L:  Oh, so you know what it's about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I thought that was pretty funny though.  I mean, I personally, I don't know, I don't believe that they're really real. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I know people like here that have parci- participated in, like, Blind Date, or Meet the Parents or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a lot of times these people are, like, actors or wannabe actors and they get paid, like, a little bit for it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, they do it and they kinda like cheat [MN] so I don't really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- believe that it's actually re- reality TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know, I just think it's funny.
R:  Yeah, well, I've watched, I've gotten sucked into the -- the Bachelor one and the Bachelorette.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And I'm watching the one now on [MN] the Bachelor one but actually this is the last one I'll watch because i- it's not very interesting and, to me, it seems really ridiculous that you could expect to meet someone and know if they're the right person to marry and that, but ...
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree totally on this one.  I mean --
R:  And I think they are real.  I mean, I think those people who do go there, maybe they're thinking it's a bluff but I think they're -- once they get there they do kind of, you know, hope that the guy's going to choose them and [MN] --
L:  You think so?
R:  Yeah.  I really think s- -- I mean, fr- -- I think, from what I've h- -- I've seen them on, like, the past people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] the Bachelorette people I've seen 'em on Oprah and stuff and I think it's -- it's sincere that these women do start really believing in, "Yeah, I wanna marry this guy" or whatever.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Maybe, yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- you're right.
R:  I don't see how they can do even that though.  I mean, I couldn't do it even just to be filmed on a date [LAUGH] would -- I'd just be uncomfortable.
L:  Yeah, totally, yeah, yeah, me too.
R:  But it's funny --
L:  So --
R:  -- because so many of my friends, I had mentioned that I was watching, say, the Bachelorette and then it's like, "Oh, yeah, my husband and I are watching that too".  It's, like, I just -- just --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- channel surfing one night and I stumbled across it and I just couldn't believe it was happening.  You know, I mean --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but, you're kidding, these people are dating and they're gonna show these dates and then they're gonna go meet their parents and so I mean I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I did get sucked into it and I -- I was really embarrassed to admit that I did watch it but I did --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but now that I'm watching this latest Bachelor [MN] which I chose to watch mainly because I had been to the winery and [LIPSMACK] I know the wine maker who was at Andrew Firestone's parents' winery so, and I've stayed at the property, so I was just curious to see scenes from the property and that but --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- it's pretty boring.  I mean, the women -- it's -- are pretty -- it's -- it's not interesting and that but I think they're a big hit, on the other hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I could more easily watch those than the Fear Factor ones and the -- [MN] they're, to me, those are disgusting.
L:  Yeah, they're more -- more -- yeah, that's true.  I mean, they're more interesting to me too.  Like, um, all these dating shows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think they're more interesting than, yeah, like Survivor or something like that.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I don't know, maybe to me because I think that they're not real --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think they're so funny but if --
R:  They're just funny.
L:  Yeah, but if they are, like, if it was real, I -- I would feel it's weird too.  Like, who would look for a partner, you know, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on a TV show in front of the whole, you know -- no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I would never, like, want to be filmed on a real date, you know, but if I felt it was just, you know, because I got paid for it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then there'd be a whole different story.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, but the Fear ones you find that they are entertaining for some --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- reason.  [MN] I wonder.
L:  Um, kind of, I mean, yeah, kind of.  I have to admit, kind of.
R:  I know, I mean, I'm forty seven but I have a group of students who work for me who are in their twenties and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get a kick out of 'em and they find 'em entertaining but to me it's not entertaining.  It's so disgusting.  I just don't ... It seems like it --
L:  And then it's also [MN], you know what it is, it's easier, sometimes when I watch TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because if I want to watch, like, a movie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] or something like this, if I, like, kind of, like, [inaudible], like, start watching it after it's been -- been on for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, half an hour or so [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kind of hard for me to get into it plus I really have to watch closely --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, um, you know, to be able to follow the movie.  [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  While, if there's a TV sh- -- if there's like a reality show I can, you know, start it when it's like, you know, after it's been on for, like, half an hour and then I can, I don't know, do something else at the same time because it doesn't require that much attention.
R:  Oh, that's [inaudible], yeah.
L:  That's another reason why I sometimes watch, um, stuff like that because it's, yeah, 'cause it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kind of like you can do it, you don't really have to pay close attention in order to be --
R:  Oh, that's very --
L:  Have you ever thought about this?
R:  That's a good point.  Maybe th- -- maybe that's why people -- I think people are used to just, um, you know, not thinking a long time about something.  I think we're hit with so much by the media that, you know, before, I don't know, you could [MN] learn about or see something that would have an impact on you for a long time and now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just forget.  I mean, you see some horrific thing and then there is something else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you're bombarded with.  So, y- y- -- just nothing, you don't keep an emotional response that lasts very long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] There, a long time ago, I mean, maybe twenty years ago or so, they made that one video, the -- I think it was called We Can Heal the World or something and a group of movie stars got together and they all sang this song together and I think it was part of a fund raising or ah, you know --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- make people aware of, [MN] I can't even remember what the topic was now, but, y- you know, making the world a better place and that thing had an impact for a long time and you saw it.  It was played for a long time, but now I don't think you could do a video like that any more 'cause it's, like, you see something once that might impact you for five minutes and then you just know that there's going to be something else and [MN] --
L:  Kind of, yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plus, I don't know, it's, like, for me, TV is, kind of, just to relax.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, you know, sometimes I want to cook at the same time or I want to, I don't know, fold the laundry at the same time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I cannot, you know, devote my whole attention to whatever's on TV 'cause, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's other stuff that, you know, I just want to do at the same time.  So, if I'm watching, like, news or if I'm watching, you know, like a talk show or something I can do everything at once.  I- if I'm watching a movie or if I'm watching, I don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- something that, you know, I can't really do it.  [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  So, sometimes --
R:  So, it really is a reflection of our lives today.
L:  Maybe, yeah.
R:  And it, I mean, it seems like that's a very good point that that's why those people can watch those shows is they don't take that long and [MN] -- and you can kind of be entertained but yet, you know, you don't have to follow a plot, like you say, so ...
L:  No, yeah.  Maybe that's -- I mean, that's what it is for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Hard to know, like, what it's making our children think though.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, 'cause I think TV does impact you.  When I was in College I didn't watch TV.  I didn't have a TV.  And I remember coming home for the summer and watching TV and I watched The Streets of San Francisco and I was home alone and I was totally scared.
L:  Really?
R:  It was just -- it was a detective show and I had seen that all through high school and I loved it.
L:  I know The Streets of San Francisco.
R:  Yeah, and -- but then if you don't watch TV and you see that stuff you realize it does really impact you.  So, to see a bunch of people humiliating themselves or eating worms or, you know, being --
