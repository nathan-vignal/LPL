YOU ALMOST HAVE TO LAUGH  (fe_03_01007-A-0011)
TO GET THROUGH IT BUT I SAID YOU KNOW IT NO AMOUNT OF DUCT TAPE WOULD SEAL MY HOUSE  (fe_03_01007-A-0012)

UM NO BUT BY THE END OF THE MONTH THEY BOTH WILL BE  (fe_03_01007-A-0018)
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S A CONSTANT ON MY MIND THING AND AH  (fe_03_01007-A-0019)
YOU KNOW THE TERRORISM FACTS ARE JUST SO MIND BOGGLING AND SCARY  (fe_03_01007-A-0020)
THAT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD BE CALM KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ATTACKING RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01007-A-0021)
I DO THINK IT'S POSSIBLE I MEAN THEY DID IT  (fe_03_01007-A-0022)
WITH NO AGGRAVATION YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01007-A-0023)
YEAH I DEFINITELY THINK THAT'S HELPING  (fe_03_01007-A-0024)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01007-A-0027)
YEAH I THINK THAT'S MY BIGGEST FEAR  (fe_03_01007-A-0028)
YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S MORE SCARY BUT THERE'S MORE PEOPLE AT RISK I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT ARE ALSO IN THE MILITARY SO I KNOW ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE  (fe_03_01007-A-0029)
THAT ARE INVOLVED AND YOU KNOW THE BAG THE BIG THING WITH ME IS FEAR IN NUMBERS THE MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GOING  (fe_03_01007-A-0030)
THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO KNOW SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T COME BACK  (fe_03_01007-A-0031)
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT FEAR THAT I'M AFRAID OF AND I'M AFRAID THAT  (fe_03_01007-A-0032)
I AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA HIT RURAL AREAS I THINK IF THEY DO ATTACK I THINK THEY ARE GONNA HIT MORE OF THE BIG CITIES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HURT PEOPLE  (fe_03_01007-A-0033)
MORE PEOPLE BUT I DO LIVE CLOSE TO A BIG CITY WHICH MAKES IT MORE FOR MORE FEARFUL FOR ME UM AND I DO FEAR FOR THE FAMILY FACTOR I DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO ANY OF MY FAMILY  (fe_03_01007-A-0034)
SO  (fe_03_01007-A-0035)
IF THEY DID START TO ATTACK OR WE DID START TO HAVE SOMETHING GO ON HERE IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO GET IN CONTACT AND TO BE CLOSE TO MY FAMILY  (fe_03_01007-A-0036)
AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING  (fe_03_01007-A-0037)
OH YEAH ANXIETY ALL THE TIME I THINK  (fe_03_01007-A-0038)
OH  (fe_03_01007-A-0039)
I AGREE A HUNDRED PER CENT  (fe_03_01007-A-0040)
A FEAR  (fe_03_01007-A-0041)
NO WE WERE UNTOUCHABLE IN OUR MINDS THEY WOULD OF NEVER WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO JUST ATTACK US  (fe_03_01007-A-0042)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT THAT WAY WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO ATTACK US FOR YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GAIN  (fe_03_01007-A-0043)

IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE AND NOT TO USE THE LANGUAGE BUT YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DO AND YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DON'T THAT'S THE WAY I KINDA LOOK AT THE WHOLE FACTOR WITH THIS I DON'T THINK I WE COULD DO ANYTHING  (fe_03_01007-A-0047)
TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT JUST LIKE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01007-A-0048)
RIGHT THE GUY'S NEVER COMPLIED  (fe_03_01007-A-0049)
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO CHANGE HE'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE BUT DO WE FEEL THAT MY BIGGEST THING WITH ALL OF THIS IS THE WAR  (fe_03_01007-A-0050)
I'M ALL FOR FINDING THE TERRORISTS  (fe_03_01007-A-0051)
BUT WHY WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THERE AND MESS WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN  (fe_03_01007-A-0052)
WHO I UNDERSTAND THAT HE YOU KNOW GIVES MONEY TO TERRORISTS BUT HE DIDN'T DO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER  (fe_03_01007-A-0053)
LET'S FIND THE TERRORISTS AND KILL THEM THEN WORRY ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE  (fe_03_01007-A-0054)
OH ME TOO  (fe_03_01007-A-0055)
I'M DEFINITELY AFRAID TO GO  (fe_03_01007-A-0056)
THE FEAR THAT WE'RE GOING IN ALONE NOW I UNDERSTAND AND GEORGE BUSH WOULD SAY  (fe_03_01007-A-0057)
YOU KNOW BUT WE'LL WIN REGARDLESS IT'S NOT THE FACTOR OF WINNING I AGREE WITH HIM I DO THINK THAT WE'LL WIN REGARDLESS  (fe_03_01007-A-0058)
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE WINNING IT'S HOW MUCH LIFE DO WE HAVE TO GIVE UP TO WIN  (fe_03_01007-A-0059)
MHM  (fe_03_01007-A-0060)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01007-A-0061)
BUT IT DRASTICALLY CHANGED ALL OF THEM  (fe_03_01007-A-0062)
NO  (fe_03_01007-A-0063)
YEAH LET'S GET THEM NOW  (fe_03_01007-A-0065)
WHILE THEY'RE WEAK  (fe_03_01007-A-0066)
WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER SUBJECT I CAN'T YOU KNOW I  (fe_03_01007-A-0067)
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST BLOW UP THE PLANET I MEAN IF YOU'RE GOING TO START A NUCLEAR WAR YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST FORGET IT 'CAUSE MY THOUGHT ON THE NUCLEAR PART OF IT IS  (fe_03_01007-A-0069)
IF THEY USE ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS THEY'RE GONNA KILL EVERYBODY  (fe_03_01007-A-0070)
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THE WHOLE PLANET 'CAUSE IF THEY HIT US WE'RE GONNA HIT THEM  (fe_03_01007-A-0071)
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONNA BE DESTROYED  (fe_03_01007-A-0072)
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY NUCLEAR HAS TO BE BROUGHT INTO IT AT ALL  (fe_03_01007-A-0073)
I THINK IT'S A VERY SCARY FACTOR I THINK TERRORISM IN ITSELF IS  (fe_03_01007-A-0074)
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED TO BELIEVE  (fe_03_01007-A-0075)
IN A GOD THAT WANTS YOU TO KILL OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_01007-A-0076)
AND I ALMOST AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND HIDEOUS BUT I ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR THE MEN THAT KILLED THEMSELVES  (fe_03_01007-A-0077)
BECAUSE THEY KILLED THEMSELVES BELIEVING THAT THAT'S WHAT THEIR GOD WANTED THEM TO DO AND NOW  (fe_03_01007-A-0078)
THEY'RE BURNING IN HELL  (fe_03_01007-A-0079)
FOR SOMETHING THEY THOUGHT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO  (fe_03_01007-A-0080)
IT'S A SHAME I MEAN IF YOU START TO REALLY LOOK INTO TERRORISM  (fe_03_01007-A-0081)
IT'S A SHAME THERE'S  (fe_03_01007-A-0082)
OH YEAH I MEAN THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING ON  (fe_03_01007-A-0083)
OH YEAH LOOK AT JERUSALEM  (fe_03_01007-A-0084)

OH IN ISRAEL IT'S JUST  (fe_03_01007-A-0088)
OH  (fe_03_01007-A-0089)
ALWAYS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE THING  (fe_03_01007-A-0090)
YEAH ARE THEY GONNA SURVIVE THE BUS RIDE  (fe_03_01007-A-0091)
IT IS INSANE AND THE FACT THAT THESE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING IS INSANITY TO ME HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU EVER JUSTIFY  (fe_03_01007-A-0092)
KILLING PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW I MEAN I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU SHOULD KILL PEOPLE YOU DO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN EVEN IF YOU HATE SOMEBODY IT'S NOT RIGHT TO JUST KILL IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE TO KILL PEOPLE SO FOR THESE PEOPLE TO HAVE BEEN SO  (fe_03_01007-A-0093)

OUR WAL-MART RAN OUT OF DUCT TAPE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO SCARED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ATTACKED  (fe_03_01007-B-0008)

UM BUT I THINK THAT UM IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN AND NOT TO SAY THAT I WOULD RATHER BE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT I LIVE OUT IN A RURAL AREA AND IF IT HAPPENS IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN  (fe_03_01007-B-0021)
NEW YORK CITY OR WASHINGTON D._C. OR LOS ANGELES OR ONE OF THE  (fe_03_01007-B-0022)
POPULATION CAPITALS WHERE THEY CAN  (fe_03_01007-B-0023)
KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY CAN KILL OUT IN RURAL AREAS I'M REALLY NOT THAT  (fe_03_01007-B-0024)
THAT WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF OR MY OWN HOME I'M LIKE I SAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY FAMILY BEING MY EXTENDED FAMILY MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS NOT BEING NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OUT IF ANYBODY WAS HURT OR  (fe_03_01007-B-0025)
UM I DEFINITE- WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT'S IN THE MILITARY AT THIS TIME THANK GOODNESS BUT UM OH MY GOODNESS  (fe_03_01007-B-0026)
YEAH AND THAT IN ITSELF CAUSES ITS OWN KIND OF PANIC  (fe_03_01007-B-0028)
AND I THINK THAT THE THE TERRORISTS DID WHEN THEY WHEN THEY HIT THE WORD TRADE CENTERS THEY ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN THEY COULD OF EVER DREAMED OF NOT JUST KNOCKING DOWN THE TOWERS AND KILLING THREE THOUSAND AMERICANS BUT THEY  (fe_03_01007-B-0029)
THEY THREW A WHOLE COUNTRY INTO INTO A  (fe_03_01007-B-0030)
A FEAR OF THIS CAN HAPPEN TO US BUT BECAUSE BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THIS COULD OF HAPPENED TO US  (fe_03_01007-B-0031)
WELL BECAUSE WE GIVE  (fe_03_01007-B-0032)
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AWAY EVERY YEAR  (fe_03_01007-B-0033)
THINKING THAT WE'RE DOING GOOD AND NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT WE'RE ARROGANT AND WE DON'T GIVE OUR MONEY TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE  (fe_03_01007-B-0034)
WELL HEAVEN FORBID IT'S OUR MONEY CAN'T WE GIVE IT TO WHO WE WANT TO GIVE IT TO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01007-B-0035)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01007-B-0036)
BUT I DO STILL FEEL LIKE THAT DIPLOMACY NEEDS TO BE GIVEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER CHANCE  (fe_03_01007-B-0037)
I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T GO IN AND GET RID OF THIS MAN BECAUSE  (fe_03_01007-B-0038)

BUT AH  (fe_03_01007-B-0040)

LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS IN  (fe_03_01007-B-0057)
