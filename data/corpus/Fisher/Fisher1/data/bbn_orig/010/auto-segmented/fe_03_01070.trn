THE THEORETICAL PAPERWORK ON THE WEB THEY WERE INQUIRING AND ASKING FOR A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WHICH I DON'T GIVE TO ANYBODY  (fe_03_01070-B-0073)
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THEY WOULD WANT IT AND THEN I CLOSED THE PROGRAM OUT  (fe_03_01070-B-0074)
YET THEY STILL GOT ME  (fe_03_01070-B-0075)
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING  (fe_03_01070-B-0076)
I I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WANTED A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THEN UPON NOT RECEIVING IT STILL WENT AHEAD  (fe_03_01070-B-0077)
THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK IT WAS A LITTLE FISHY  (fe_03_01070-B-0078)
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE LEGITIMATE  (fe_03_01070-B-0079)
[LAUGHTER] I'M VERY CURIOUS WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE STUDYING IT'S CERTAINLY NOT ANYTHING ABOUT COMEDY  (fe_03_01070-B-0080)
