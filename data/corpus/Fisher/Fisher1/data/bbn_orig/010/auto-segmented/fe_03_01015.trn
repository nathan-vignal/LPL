RESOLUTION TO TO DISARM THESE THINGS TO GET RID OF THEM  (fe_03_01015-B-0018)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_01015-B-0019)
WELL WHEN THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS MADE IT WAS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA  (fe_03_01015-B-0020)
AND THEY AGREED TO YOU KNOW DO AWAY WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF WEAPONS UNITED STATES DESTROYED THEIRS BUT RUSSIA NEVER DESTROYED THEIRS  (fe_03_01015-B-0021)
SO NOW THAT LEAVES THE UNITED STATES IN AN UNTRUSTING FORM  (fe_03_01015-B-0022)
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH IRAQ WITH THIS SITUATION  (fe_03_01015-B-0023)
IS THAT HE SAYS HE IS  (fe_03_01015-B-0024)
BUT WE KNOW FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATION THAT THE STUFF EXISTS WE KNOW FROM TALKING WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE THE STUFF EXISTS WHICH MEANS HE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES THAT WERE SET UP BY THE UNITED NATIONS  (fe_03_01015-B-0025)
AND I THINK THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD DOESN'T REALIZE THAT WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH IS TRYING TO DO IS TO GET THIS GUY  (fe_03_01015-B-0026)
TO  (fe_03_01015-B-0027)
WHAT CAN I SAY CONFORM TO TO THE RULES THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS LIVING BY  (fe_03_01015-B-0028)
WELL IT'S UNFORTUNATE  (fe_03_01015-B-0029)
IT'S BASICALLY BECAUSE HE IS DEFYING AND NOT GIVING THEM UP THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01015-B-0030)
NO  (fe_03_01015-B-0031)
WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IS PROBABLY DESTROY HIM  (fe_03_01015-B-0032)
SEE I SEE I AGREE THAT IRAQ HAS HAS BEEN MISMANAGED FOR MANY MANY YEARS  (fe_03_01015-B-0033)

BECAUSE HE IS BEING SO DEFIANT YOU KNOW JUST KINDA LIKE A  (fe_03_01015-B-0035)

SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GET IN THERE AND STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT BECAUSE HE WON'T LISTEN HE WON'T DO WHAT HIS WHAT WHAT THE WORLD IS TELLING HIM  (fe_03_01015-B-0038)
ON ONE HAND HE AGREES TO DO IT AND THEN HE TURNS AROUND AND DOESN'T  (fe_03_01015-B-0039)
HE'S ACCUMULATING MORE  (fe_03_01015-B-0040)
YES THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL HE IS DOING IS IS HE IS MAKING MORE  (fe_03_01015-B-0041)
WELL SEE THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO GET HIM OUTTA THERE  (fe_03_01015-B-0042)
YOU GET HIM OUTA THERE AND AND THE WEAPONS WILL PROBABLY DISAPPEAR  (fe_03_01015-B-0043)
IT'S IT'S HIS ILL LEADERSHIP THAT IS REALLY CAUSING THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_01015-B-0044)
WELL AH EVERYONE ELSE A- AS FAR AS I KNOW IS IS ABIDING BY WHAT THE THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SET UP FOR THE THE GUIDELINES FOR THESE PARTICULAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_01015-B-0045)

OR THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE SET UP  (fe_03_01015-B-0053)
NOBODY NOBODY WANTS THEM TO HAVE THE WEAPON I MEAN OBV- OBVIOUSLY THEY FEEL THEY NEED THE WEAPON  (fe_03_01015-B-0054)
BUT I THINK I THINK THEY'RE STILL PART OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME THAT WOULD THAT WOULD JUST AS SOON  (fe_03_01015-B-0055)

BUT OVER THERE THEY THINK IT'S IT'S  (fe_03_01015-B-0067)
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT TO GO PUT A BOMB ON A BUS AND BLOW IT UP AND AND KILL FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE  (fe_03_01015-B-0068)
