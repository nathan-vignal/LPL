OUR HOMELAND AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT A THREAT BUT STILL INVADING PEOPLES HOMES WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING THE WHOLE SITUATION I DON'T THINK THAT WAS RIGHT  (fe_03_01017-A-0038)
MM THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01017-A-0039)
BEFORE YOU GO OUT  (fe_03_01017-A-0040)
WITH THE WHOLE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY AND OTHER STUFF AND YOU'RE INVESTING MONEY IN WAR AND SENDING PEOPLE TO DIE  (fe_03_01017-A-0041)
