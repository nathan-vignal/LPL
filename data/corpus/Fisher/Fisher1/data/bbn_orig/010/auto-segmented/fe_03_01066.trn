HUMOROUS IN THE WAY THEY DO THINGS AND OF COURSE THEY LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF THINGS THAT I DID AND I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01066-A-0053)
IT'S DIFFERENT TO THEM AND  (fe_03_01066-A-0054)
EXACTLY I DO THINK THOUGH NOW AH WITH THE WAR ON TERROR AND EVERYTHING IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE TO BE MAKING FUN OF THE PRESIDENT I REALLY DON'T LIKE WHEN THEY DO THAT  (fe_03_01066-A-0055)
