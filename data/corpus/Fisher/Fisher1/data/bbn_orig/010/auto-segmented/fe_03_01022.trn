HELLO MY NAME IS JACK LOY  (fe_03_01022-B-0001)
JENNY IS IT  (fe_03_01022-B-0002)
HI JENNY  (fe_03_01022-B-0003)
JUST FINE I  (fe_03_01022-B-0004)
UNDERSTAND THE TOPIC THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS TERRORISM  (fe_03_01022-B-0005)
AND SPECIFICALLY HOW WE THINK PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND OR REACT WHETHER THEY'D BE PANICKY OR WHETHER THEY WOULD REMAIN CALM  (fe_03_01022-B-0006)
WELL I I'M SURE IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION AND THE SEVERITY OF AH WHATEVER THE TERRORISM WOULD BE  (fe_03_01022-B-0007)
IT'S I GUESS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT EXACTLY HOW SOMEBODY WOULD REACT OR RESPOND AH I'M A RATHER  (fe_03_01022-B-0009)
CONSERVATIVE CALM TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL  (fe_03_01022-B-0010)
I THINK I WOULD REMAIN AH CALM TO A CERTAIN EXTEND AND HOPE I COULD AH ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING BY BEING CALM  (fe_03_01022-B-0011)
AH ON THE OTHER HAND  (fe_03_01022-B-0012)
MY GUESS IS MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE CALM I  (fe_03_01022-B-0013)
I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0014)
AH NEWS CASTS ABOUT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SITUATION AND OBVIOUSLY MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T CALM  (fe_03_01022-B-0015)
AND I I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY CALM EITHER HAD I BEEN IN THAT SITUATION  (fe_03_01022-B-0016)
SURE SURE  (fe_03_01022-B-0017)
I BELIEVE THAT AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0018)
AH AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE ABSOLUTE SITUATION IF YOU WERE IN A  (fe_03_01022-B-0019)
AIRPLANE OR SOMETHING AND THERE WERE TERRORISTS ABOARD  (fe_03_01022-B-0020)
YOU YOU PROBABLY WOULD REACT DIFFERENTLY THAN AH IF YOU WERE IN ON THE STREETS OR IN A MALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'M SURE THAT AH AH YOU WOULD REACT DIFFERENTLY I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD REACT  (fe_03_01022-B-0021)
I THINK IF I WERE IN A MALL OR IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT I WOULD I WOULD AH CERTAINLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AH IF YOU'RE IN AN AIRPLANE I THINK YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE WHAT YOUR CHANCES ARE OR  (fe_03_01022-B-0022)
PERHAPS OVERTAKING SOMEBODY OR  (fe_03_01022-B-0023)
OR WHO'S INVOLVED AND WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO  (fe_03_01022-B-0024)
SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THE SITUATION DICTATES HOW YOU WOULD REACT OR RESPOND TO ANY SITUATION  (fe_03_01022-B-0025)
I I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT VERY MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE CALM ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01022-B-0026)
I WAS JUST IN A SITUATION WITHIN THE LAST MONTH OR SO  (fe_03_01022-B-0028)
WHERE AH I WAS IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND AND AH ONE ONE PERSON PHYSICALLY ATTACKED THE OTHER PERSON OVER A RELATIVELY MINOR AH A MINOR INCIDENT  (fe_03_01022-B-0029)
AND I WAS I WAS VERY CLOSE BY AND ACTUALLY WAS AH INVOLVED IN BREAKING UP THE FIGHT  (fe_03_01022-B-0030)
BUT THERE WERE PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE AROUND JU- THAT JUST SAT THERE AND LOOKED AT THE SITUATION WITHOUT TAKING ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER  (fe_03_01022-B-0031)
AND THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME THAT AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0032)
THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT TERRORISM OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO IT BUT THERE WERE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WHO MADE NO ATTEMPT TO GET INVOLVED AND AND DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01022-B-0033)
I WAS BOTH DISAPPOINTED AND AND SURPRISED THAT THAT WAS THEIR ER WAY OF NOT DEALING WITH THE SITUATION  (fe_03_01022-B-0034)
REALLY  (fe_03_01022-B-0035)
HUH HUH  (fe_03_01022-B-0036)
AGAIN NOT DIRECTLY AH TO THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM BUT IT IT'S REALLY AH SURPRISES ME ALSO THAT  (fe_03_01022-B-0037)
ER SEVERAL PEOPLE CAN SEE THE SAME SITUATION AND AND  (fe_03_01022-B-0038)
REPORT TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE PEOPLE WEREN'T EVEN IN THE SAME AREA EYE WITNESS REPORTS WILL SAY WELL THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WELL NO THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED SO THAT A- AGAIN IN A TERRORIST SITUATION I'M SURE PEOPLE THAT WOULD GET EXCITED AND AND IF Y-  (fe_03_01022-B-0039)
YOU TRIED TO  (fe_03_01022-B-0040)
REPEAT OR REPORT ON WHAT HAPPENED YOU'D GET TOTALLY DIFFERENT AH EYE WITNESS VIEWPOINTS  (fe_03_01022-B-0041)
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT GOES THROUGH MY MIND IS IN IN UM  (fe_03_01022-B-0042)
THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD ANY AH NEED TO THINK VERY MUCH ABOUT TERRORISM OR  (fe_03_01022-B-0043)
OR PROTECT AGAINST IT OR PLAN FOR IT IN THE EVENTUALITY THAT IT DID HAPPEN  (fe_03_01022-B-0044)
AND AH OBVIOUSLY OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE HAVE HAD TO ER LIVE WITH THIS AND ENDURE IT IT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME  (fe_03_01022-B-0045)
AH JUST RECENTLY WHEN PEOPLE CAME OUT AND SAID WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROTECT YOURSELF IN THE EVENT OF A TERRORIST ATTACK  (fe_03_01022-B-0046)
AND MY MY RESPONSE WAS I DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT I WOULD DO OR HOW I WOULD DO IT  (fe_03_01022-B-0047)
NO YOU DON'T AND CAN YOU REALLY PROTECT YOURSELF  (fe_03_01022-B-0048)
AH I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE  (fe_03_01022-B-0049)
AH I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE VERY HIGH ON A ON A TARGET LIST  (fe_03_01022-B-0050)
BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT I WOULD OR SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST SOMETHING THAT AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0051)
THAT WOULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_01022-B-0052)
SO THOSE THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THOUGHTS THAT THAN RUN THROUGH MY MIND AND AH I GUESS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA RESPOND UNTIL  (fe_03_01022-B-0053)
THE SITUATION ACTUALLY OCCURS YOU KNOW WE CAN SAY THAT YEAH WE'D REMAIN CALM BUT BUT AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0054)
HOW DO YOU REALLY KNOW HOW YOU WOULD RESPOND OR REACT  (fe_03_01022-B-0055)
AH I'M I'M CALM IN OTHER KINDS OF SITUATIONS AND AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO BE VERY EXCITABLE AH ER I'M NOT EXCITABLE TO THAT DEGREE AT ALL SO  (fe_03_01022-B-0056)
I THINK FROM MY PAST EXPERIENCE OF KNOWING MYSELF I'D PROBABLY BE REASONABLY CALM  (fe_03_01022-B-0057)
I THINK I WOULD TRY TO DO SOMETHING AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0058)
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD JUST SIT BACK AND LET SOMETHING TAKE PLACE  (fe_03_01022-B-0059)
WITHOUT MAKING AN ATTEMPT TO DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_01022-B-0060)
WELL I THINK I THINK THE OTHER THING IS YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CAN YOU DO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AND THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN A SPLIT SECOND ER GOING BACK TO THAT SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A  (fe_03_01022-B-0061)
THERE WAS A SOMEWHAT LITTLE SKIRMISH THAT TURNED INTO A FIGHT IT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS MADE IN A MATTER OF A SECOND OR TWO  (fe_03_01022-B-0062)
AND ER SOMETIMES YOUR EMOTIONS TAKE OVER AND YOU DO JUST DO WHAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO DO  (fe_03_01022-B-0063)
AND AND AGAIN IT JUST DEPENDS ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S PERSONALITIES SOME PEOPLE JUST BACK AWAY FROM THE SITUATION THEY DON'T WANNA GET INVOLVED THEY DON'T WANNA GET HURT THEY DON'T WANNA  (fe_03_01022-B-0065)
DO ANYTHING BUT CERTAINLY AH ER  (fe_03_01022-B-0066)
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A VERY LOGICAL THING TO DO EITHER YOU YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING YOU TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION AT HAND WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE  (fe_03_01022-B-0067)
OH GOLLY I HOPE NOT AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0068)
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED AND AH DO SOMETHING ON A PREVENTATIVE BASIS AND I'M SURE THAT THEY HAVE DONE MANY OF THOSE THINGS ALREADY  (fe_03_01022-B-0069)
YOU YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THOSE OUT THERE THOSE TERRORISTS WHO  (fe_03_01022-B-0071)
DON'T LIKE OUR WAY OF LIFE AND DON'T LIKE OUR FREEDOMS AND AH ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DISRUPT IT AND AND HURT US AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0072)
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF HATE AMERICANS AROUND AND  (fe_03_01022-B-0073)
AND AH YOU KNOW I DON'T WE'RE FULLY CAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING WHY THEY HATE US TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY DO  (fe_03_01022-B-0074)
BUT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY OBVIOUS THAT THEY DO  (fe_03_01022-B-0075)
AND THAT THAT'S SAD  (fe_03_01022-B-0076)
BUT I THINK IT'S A FACT OF LIFE ER  (fe_03_01022-B-0077)
WE HAVE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T EITHER UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE OR ARE ENVIOUS OF OR JEALOUS OF I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SOME OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS  (fe_03_01022-B-0078)
BUT WE AH  (fe_03_01022-B-0079)
WE HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01022-B-0080)
SO FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND BE PROTECTED BY OUR  (fe_03_01022-B-0081)
ER BY OUR FREEDOMS AND AND ER BY OUR DEMOCRACIES AND OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD JUST DON'T GET IT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SO  (fe_03_01022-B-0082)
I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT  (fe_03_01022-B-0083)
AH TERRORISTS FROM  (fe_03_01022-B-0084)
FROM DOING THINGS THAT DO IN FACT DISRUPT OUR OUR WAY OF LIVE AND OUR FREEDOMS  (fe_03_01022-B-0085)
AND I THINK WE ARE TO A GREAT EX- EXTENT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN  (fe_03_01022-B-0086)
THE THING YOU HOPE THAT WE DON'T GET SO BLASE THAT AH WE WE DON'T HEED THE WARNINGS OF OF GOVERNMENT YOU ALREADY HEAR WELL WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE THEY GONNA DO WELL  (fe_03_01022-B-0087)
YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO OR  (fe_03_01022-B-0088)
WE'VE GOT THOUSANDS  (fe_03_01022-B-0089)
WELL WE'VE GOT SO MANY YOU KNOW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TARGETS THAT AH AS SOON AS YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN ER  (fe_03_01022-B-0090)
ER THEY MIGHT DO SOMETHING AND THESE THESE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE WILLING TO JUST LAY IN THE WEEDS FOREVER UNTIL  (fe_03_01022-B-0091)
UNTIL THEY SPOT A SOFT SPOT OR A WEAK SPOT AND AND THEN GO AFTER IT AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR FREEDOMS HAVE PROTECTED THESE PEOPLE TO A GREAT EXTENT BY LETTING THEM COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND AND AH YOU  (fe_03_01022-B-0092)
KNOW THE THINGS THAT HAVE MADE US SO GOOD AND SO STRONG ARE ALSO THINGS THAT  (fe_03_01022-B-0093)
