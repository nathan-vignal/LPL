R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Lisa.
R:  Hi, Lisa.  My name is Bonnie.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm fine.  Oh, you have a southern accent.
L:  Oh, yes I do. [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you?
L:  North Carolina.
R:  Uh-huh.  How's the weather?
L:  Beautiful.  It's --
R:  Good.
L:  -- been in the seventies for the past couple of days.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Santa Monica, California.
L:  Oh.  I bet it's nice there, too.
R:  It's beautiful.  I love the weather --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I don't like the traffic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't like the traffic.
L:  Yeah, we have the same problem here.
R:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about what's acceptable and what is not acceptable?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, for me, um, unacceptable is anything that I wouldn't repeat or am embarrassed hearing in front of, ah, the opposite sex.  How about you?
L:  I would certainly agree with that.  I think that, um ... [LIPSMACK] most things that can, um, be offensive, I know that can be broad, but, um, offensive to certain races or ethnicities or certain stereotypes of people is certainly unacceptable also.
R:  I agree.  Do you think that -- that comedians need to use off color humor in order to be funny?  I don't.
L:  I don't think that they need to but I think that they think that they need to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I agree with you on that one.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um, I think that, um, often times people look for shock value, um, in order to be humorous when I don't think that's necessary at all.
R:  No.  For me, personally, I -- there are very few things, or people, that can make me laugh out loud.  Ah, I do a lot of my laughing just very quietly, I'll smile.  I might think something's funny.  But I think very little that comedians do, um, or that movies think are funny, or TV shows think are funny, move me in any way.  Very rarely, very rarely.  I -- I don't know if I'm a stick in the mud or if I just have a very different kind of sense of humor.  What about you?
L:  Um, there are things that -- that, um, do make me laugh out loud.  I'm not a, um, really out -- outgoing person so, um, I do do a lot of laughter inside, but I do laugh out loud and I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, I just lost it.  Um ... I think that I do, um, too, like a dry sense of humor, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I do find that very funny, um --
R:  Yep.  I can appreciate that more than -- than slapstick.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, yeah, the people that I -- ah, I have worked with several people that have, ah, very dry senses of humor and, um, they tend to be the funniest to me, um, of most of the people that I encounter.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I w- -- I would agree with you.  I don't know very many but the few that I do, yes, I agree with you completely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely.  One thing I resent in, ah, like TV shows or laugh tracks, I -- really, really it angers me that someone thinks I'm so stupid that they need to run a laugh track in order to encourage my laughter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All it does is anger me.
L:  Is that --
R:  I --
L:  -- that's something I haven't thought of but, um, I will probably pay more attention to that now that you've mentioned it.
R:  Oh, it's incredibly annoying to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And most of the things that they run the laugh track with, I would never even smile at.  They're just plain stupid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think that there's a lot of comedy that's not only off color but just really stupid.  I don't have much tolerance of that.
L:  Yeah, I think that, um, comedy has certainly seemed to have taken that route.
R:  Yeah.  Did you ever used to like, er, Bill Cosby as a comedian?  As a stand up comedian?
L:  Um, I did.  I haven't seen a whole lot of him but I have seen some things that I did like.
R:  He was funny.  He made me laugh out loud.
L:  Yeah.
R:  George Carlen[?], on the other hand is -- uses a lot of bad words.  I don't think that -- I mean some of the stuff he says is funny but I think he could tone it down some.
L:  I -- I certainly do too.  I cannot listen to him when he is on a -- on a rant, um, with a lot of vulgar words. [LAUGH] I -- I cannot, um, tolerate that.
R:  One thing I find incredibly offensive is when I'm channel surfing and I go by some of the stations.  A lot of the black comedians are really not just off color, they're down and out raunchy.  I mean, they're really nasty.  I have no idea who these people are, but, um, they're -- they're dressed in strange ways and their language is appalling and I find -- I don't spend any time there, but as I'm cruising by I might listen to, you know, fifteen or twenty seconds of it.  I've never heard anything funny yet.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't do a lot of TV watching anymore, um, so I -- I -- but the shows that I do catch, um ... er, some have ... I don't know, some of them I think are better than others as far as, um, humor, but, ah, I have noticed, um, certainly that humor has gone the way more of the offensive --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- um, and vulgar that I don't care to hear at all.
R:  No.  I don't care to hear it either.  I -- I -- if there's nothing funny about it.  Once in a while -- once in a while, not very often, there might be a little cute joke that comes across the internet that's a little on the risque side, but it's not dirty.  It's -- it's kinda -- it's cute.  That I don't mind so much but even there, I'm a little bit put off, but I think it's the least of all the of the, er, evils that are out there.  People --
L:  Yeah.  I think with, um, when you're talking about things in -- in print, um, you can kinda at times put your own, um, spin or your own ... [LIPSMACK], I'm not -- oh, I'm not sure exactly what I'm trying to say but, um, you know, you're putting your own, um ... like influxes in certain sentences and things --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- that, um, that can help the way that you interpret it, so I do think that that is, um ... gonna be less offensive --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- than if you hear somebody speaking it in a tone that perhaps you wouldn't have considered.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  There's -- there's a little sentence that goes around on the internet a lot.  I believe it was, um, it -- it's not -- it's a joke, but it's not like a joke and it was something to the effect of a professor in -- in some class asked his class to punctuate the following sentence.
L:  Mm, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You've read that one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's -- now see to me, that's -- it's cute.  It's cute, but I liked old time humor.  Some -- I can't remember his name, it was a short guy with glasses and ... about thirty years ago.  I'm dating myself now, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, and he did really funny stuff.  Even -- even listen to his album more than once and still laugh at some of the stuff on it.  I think the funniest things in the world are things that -- that bring attention to what we do and how silly some of what we do is.
L:  Yeah.  When we laugh at ourselves --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of laughing at, perhaps, people who are different than us.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree with that.  Well, I think we've come to an agreement on that.
L:  Yeah, I would say so.
R:  Absolutely.  I wonder how long they want us to talk?
L:  I don't know.  I was not paying attention to the time when we started talking.
R:  I don't think it's ten minutes yet.
L:  Yeah, I don't think so and I've never -- this is the first call I've done so I don't know if they, like, notify us when the time is up, do you?
R:  I suspect they would.  Um, this is the first call I've done as well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wasn't even sure it was legitimate because when I was looking at the -- the -- the theo- the theoretical paperwork on the web they were inquiring and asking for a social security number, which I don't give to anybody, and I can't imagine why they would want it and then I closed the program out, yet they still got me, which I thought was interesting.
L:  Huh.  That is interesting.
R:  I -- I don't know why they wanted a social security number and then, upon not receiving it, still went ahead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what made me think it was a little fishy, but it seems to be legitimate.
L:  Well, I -- I sure hope it is or else we're both in trouble, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm very curious what it is that they're studying.  It's certainly not anything about comedy.
L:  No, because there is a gazillion different topics on there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  It's something about the way we speak to one other.
L:  I guess so and considering we're from different parts of the country, maybe we're good candidates for that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well as long as I've got you on the phone, let me ask you a question?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is there an island off of South Carolina that's primarily wildlife oriented, but some people live there?
L:  Um ...
