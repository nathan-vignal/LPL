L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Hi, I'm Louise Lamperty.
L:  Hi, Louise.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you doing [NOISE]?
R:  Good, thank you.
L:  Good.
R:  So, do you think you would do perjury for a family member or a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- friend?
L:  You know, I probably would --
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, must be a real close friend [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I mean for family too, because I mean, I'm just not [NOISE] in general, um, happy with the whole judicial system --
R:  Oh.  Well, yeah, but if you get caught, you -- you won't be of any help for your friends, so I don't know --
L:  But, see, that's -- that would be the thing, I'd have to not get caught --
R:  Yeah, that's it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I don't think I would do it for a friend, maybe if I'm sure that ah not only not get caught, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that is -- that it's not his fault, that it's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he didn't do nothing --
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Maybe I would do it for a really close friend or my son --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- one of my children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but -- otherwise, I don't know, I would be too afraid to get caught and it wouldn't be any help for him and I would be in trouble too --
L:  Yeah.  But, I mean, that's your son.  I mean, you know, he's just a kid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd rather send your kids to jail than to try and help them stay out?
R:  Yeah, that's it.  That's what I say -- for my kid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would do it, but --
L:  But not for a friend?
R:  Mm -- no, not for a friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I don't think I'd do it for a friend either, I think it would more have to be family.
R:  Yeah.  Mm because I don't know, it's -- if you get caught you -- you didn't help him and, ah, you are in trouble yourself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, after that, ah, it's -- it's still with you all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  That's true, oh.
R:  [LAUGH] Ten minutes is a long time, [MN] [LAUGH].
L:  It is, huh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] For a subject like this it's really a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where do you live?
R:  I live n- -- near Montreal.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  You live in the States?
L:  I'm in Georgia.
R:  Oh, wow.  Oh, you -- lucky you.  It's sunny out there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And here it's, ah, it's in celsius degree, but its around minus, ah, twenty in Fahrenheit.
L:  Where, up there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  [LAUGH] It's cold.
L:  That's cold.
R:  Yeah.  Cold.  So, maybe we have to stay on the subject.  So, well, maybe I would do a perjury --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to go south [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and be warmer [LAUGH] but, um, I don't know, to stay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on -- on the subject, um --
L:  Would it -- would it, um, depend on what they were, um, getting, ah, convicted for, or what they were charged with?
R:  No.
L:  No, it wouldn't make a difference to you?
R:  Ah.  Well, [MN] yeah, I think it would make a difference --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's something, if it's something really bad, even if it's my kid --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and ah if he's, ah, making a trouble in, ah, society --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, ah, like, ah, ah, a rape or --
L:  Oh [NOISE].
R:  -- something like this, child abuse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I wouldn't do a perjury, even for my kid because it's -- it's too bad, you know, and, ah, and, ah he's -- he's going to do it again and, ah, I'm not -- no, I'm not helping the -- anybody with making a perjury and, ah, if he's doing it again I will feel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, ah, bad --
L:  Mm.  True.
R:  -- no, no, it'd have to be something really, ah, small --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, yeah because if it's bad it's too bad [MN].
L:  Yeah.
R:  He did the mistake, he has to pay for it.  Even if it's my kid --
L:  But say, why, I mean, everybody makes mistakes, even the government makes mistakes, but they don't pay for it.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  So, what makes them better than us?
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  I know, but, ah, I -- me, what I think, I think that you have to do your best yourself and, ah, don't think that, ah, oh, they don't do their best, so why should I do my best if --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everybody thinks like this, ah, it will get worse and worse and worse, so you have to do your best, whatever the neighbor is doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hm.  So, if everybody thinks like this, well, everything will be a lot easier for everybody.  So, if he did something bad, really, really bad, I -- I wouldn't do a perjury, even for my kid [SIGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And I think they know it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] They know it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.  Well, you know, the -- I don't know, the -- the, if they know it, they act good and, ah, they don't put themselves in a situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like this, so if they know you're going to lie for them and, ah, they use this so they put themselves in situation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but if they know that, ah, you won't lie for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they, you know, this -- they have more chance of staying straight, I think --
L:  Right.
R:  What do you think [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You'd still do perjury for your kids, even if it's really bad?
L:  For my kids, yeah, yeah I would.
R:  Even if it's really bad?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I don't know, if he did, ah, child abuse and you do perjury and, ah, he's getting out because of it and, ah, he still do child abuse after that ... if it -- and, ah, the child is abused is your grandson, mm.
L:  Yeah, but I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You've got to try and get them help, I mean, you know, I mean, just care --
R:  Yeah, well, sure [inaudible].
L:  -- you know, [inaudible] I mean, everybody has their issues and, you know, not everybody's mentally straight, so it's like whatever they do, it's because they need help and nobody is reaching out to help them --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so yeah, I would -- I would do perjury for, you know, my child or whatever and then, ah, you know, get them some psychiatric help or, you know, whatever, send them to a psychologist or, you know, something like that, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean -- 
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- people do things for a reason, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, sure, they -- they -- they -- for something like this, for sure he need help, but, ah, there's thing that -- things like this child abuse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like sexual abuse, ah, many times --
L:  You know, there's murder -- there's robberies, I mean, there's, you know, it's everything, but --
R:  Mm but what -- what -- I -- I stick on the sexual child abuse when, ah, when this happened, there -- I don't -- there's no help for them because it's --
L:  Yeah.  There is --
R:  [several inaudible words] Oh --
L:  Yeah there is.
R:  -- I think it's an obsession and I'm not sure there's help for them.  They're so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- obsessed with it and I don't know.
L:  There's help for them.  There's help.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  There's always, you know, a specialist out there, ah, a psychologist, that can, you know, help them through, you know, their problem, you know, like [several inaudible words] going through the sexual, um, the child pornography abuse thing right now and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, that means he just needs some help, he needs to talk some -- to somebody.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  I mean, nobody --
R:  Well --
L:  -- is perfect and --
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no --
L:  -- you know, the government wants to act like, you know, everybody has to abide by all these rules just so the world can, um, flow correctly which is not true because everybody's personality isn't the same, everybody will [inaudible] the same --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, everybody has different morals.  Just because the government says you shouldn't do this doesn't mean that that person doesn't think that it's okay for them because everybody has to survive, you know, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you've got people out there robbing because they can't get a job --
R:  Oh, sure --
L:  -- because, you know, you know, they can't provide for their families, so they don't have no choice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but to rob somebody.
R:  Well, like, if my son is robbing because, ah, he needs food, ah, to feed his family, sure I will do perjury for him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, things like this, oh yeah, for sure.  I would rob myself just to -- if my family, my children are hungry --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I have no money --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for sure, I go in the store and an- -- I rob some, ah, some meat --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that is for sure -- maybe not a T bone, but ground beef --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- oh yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's cute.  Yeah.
R:  Well.
L:  Yeah, it -- it would definitely depend on, ah, the scenario --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It'd have a lot to do and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, if it's a friend or a family member --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah --
L:  Yeah.
