R:  Hi, my name is Jonna Sho.
L:  Hi, this is Michelle Bertner.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, do you want to start off, or do you want me to?
L:  Um, why don't you go ahead [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Um, I just wanted to say, okay, it's will you commit perjury for a -- um, no I would not because, um, I just c- -- I'm not a person who lies and, um, my problem is I'm too honest, so I definitely could not commit perjury.
L:  And I, you know, I wouldn't do it either, I don't think I could live with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- lying, even if it was for a friend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, and I think, too, like I have small children and I would not want to put myself in a situation where --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I could get in trouble and possibly to go jail or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever and put them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in jeopardy also, um, that's just not a subject that I'm [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at not really not familiar with.
R:  Yeah, um, I would -- um, yeah, well, I mean, I just feel the same way, um, I just -- I mean, I don't have children, I am single, but just my own being, I just could not under oath because I would -- I would just automatically just tell the truth, I would just, you know, I'm just not one to lie, um, I can't see how anyone really could commit perjury because sooner or later I think they usually find out --
L:  Yeah, I would think so, too, sooner or later, I mean, you're always going to be worried about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- being found out down the line somewhere if you agree to do it, you would be constantly watching --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to make sure that you weren't going to be in trouble, it g- -- you would never really be free from it, I don't think.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think I could live with [LAUGH] --
R:  No.
L: -- always watching out and seeing, or possibly, you know, getting caught in more lies just to --
R:  Well, I know some --
L:  -- keep up the original lie.
R:  [LAUGH] I know like, um, if you ever watch like those Judge Judys or whatever, sometimes people will -- will commit perjury and the Judge just blows it off, I don't know if it's because it's on TV or what, but, um, I don't know, I -- there's no way I could --
L:  Well, and maybe they look at the -- the seriousness of the case --
R:  Right.
L: -- if it's just some person, they use it as a personal court [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.  The People's Court --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] isn't it something like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- white water or [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something big to where it's public figure --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- but, um, gosh --
R:  I don't know.  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- morally I definitely couldn't, plus I just, I don't know, internally I wouldn't -- I -- I don't know, I pr- -- you would probably be able to tell I'm committing perjury, I would probably start blushing and I would fidgety and they would probably be able to [LAUGH] I'm telling a lie, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I wouldn't even attempt it.  Um [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- I know that on like those, um, like you were talking about the, um, the larger -- you know, the more important cases like they'll have on Court TV or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- occasionally they will show someone who I think for a family member, I think I've seen cases on TV well they wi- -- they will do that and I think sooner or later they usually get caught, it's like some slip up or something [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't know you would manage to keep everything of your story straight if you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you just kind of made -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I mean I don't know if people go into those knowing, rehearsing exactly what they're going to say so that they're able to get through it, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or if it just kind of happens --
R:  Well, that's a good idea.
L:  -- for the moment.
R:  Yeah, like if someone told you, like if you had a pact --
L:  -- what to say --
R:  -- and they --
L:  -- like if they were wanting you to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and said, here's what you say, this is what happened, actually they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they, um, had a similar thing on -- just on a TV show the other night --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where, um, ah, well, it wasn't exactly perjury but [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- whe- -- where someone had to lie about somebody's re- -- medical record --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and in that you could lose your licence and you could get yourself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- into trouble.  And I imagine the same type of thing with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- court --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where pretty soon it gets too involved and -- and you can't maintain it for very long --
R:  Right.  That is so true --
L:  -- [MN] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that I'll probabl- -- I will have to worry about going to Court for perjury [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, they probably have -- I don't know what the penalty is for that, what do they make --
L:  And you know, I have no idea, either.
R:  I don't know if they make you go --
L:  I tell you [inaudible] now, did, like with Clinton did -- was there perjury in that one, I thought there was --
R:  I think there was --
L:  -- with the white water, that they were trying to convince certain key people to testify differently or to not testify at all [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I think there was, yeah.
L:  And I could see not testifying at all if you thought you would be put in the position --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- where you'd have to lie or -- or where someone wanted you to --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I forgot about that --
L:  -- but I'm not sure what happened to those people, I'm not very good at politics [LAUGH].
R:  I'm not either, I think Wate- -- wasn't Watergate, there was, um --
L:  I think that, or was, yeah, water -- Watergate?
R:  Watergate.
L:  -- and that then Clinton's was White Water --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's the real estate [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but -- I'll t- --
R:  Yeah.  And I don't know if, if um, when Clinton was involved with, ah, um, what's her face, if there was any -- I don't know, he had to -- he kind of went through that loophole thing, that oral [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH]
R:  -- Monica Lewinski --
L:  That's right.  But, but, you know, but the thing is he said, "sexual relations" on that and that is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sexual relations.
R:  I know.
L:  Even if he doesn't classify it as sex --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it is sexual relations.  So is kissing, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, so, I forgot about that.
R:  I thought -- that's what I thought you were t- --
L:  And he ended up getting nailed because ah everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- came back, all the evidence came back --
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess he --
L:  To where he had to take it back and say, "Yes, I did".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess sooner or later --
R:  Yeah, we would get caught --
L:  You need to -- you need to watch [LAUGH] because it can ruin your reputation and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you might have to go to jail or who knows what.
L:  Oh, it's funny.
R:  Um --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, let's see, what else about perjury [LAUGH]?
R:  Um, I don't know, I'm trying to think.
L:  Do you think they could have given us an easier topic, huh.
R:  I know, I mean, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, you're lying under oath, I guess, that's what it is, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hmm --
L:  Boy.
R:  I'm sure peo- -- I'm sure, like, you know, um, you know, people in gangs, maybe gang members or under -- they maybe plan out that they may lie about things and --
L:  Oh, I'm sure they probably do.  That's probably part of their --
R:  Thing.
L:  -- their loyalty [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But, gosh, it take --
R:  I wonder if once people are in prison, um, I don't know, I wo- -- I wonder if there's, well, they not under oath, but I wonder if they're -- sometimes they come out and like say they were lying or something [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, they say, "Yeah, I did commit that crime" or something --
L:  But then they have the people who say, who admitted to it to begin with, yet never did.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is a weird kind of perjury thing --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- to say you did do a murder or you did do something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you never really did.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why people would want to do that, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but they get their crazy people that [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where do you live?
L:  I am in Olympia, in Washington State.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in, um, Tampa, Florida.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They really matched up two ends of the [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.
L:  -- US didn't they?
R:  Um, but, um, let's see.  What else about perjury?  Do you --
L:  It's funny [LAUGH].
R:  Do you know anything else about it?
L:  I'm trying to think of what other circumstances you could [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do that besides if it's just ina courtroom or if it could be on documents also considered --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that or not.
R:  I don't know.  I guess it could be.
L:  Because I'm not sure.  I wish I had a dictionary [LAUGH] to just see --
R:  I do have one, but I don't think it's going to be too, um --
L:  To descriptive, huh?
R:  No, it's just like a little pocket dictionary, um --
L:  Well, do you think we could take up the rest of the time if we, ah --
R:  Yeah, I'll look it up --
L:  -- read the words really slowly --
R: L, M, N, O [LAUGH] perjury.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's why I started to look at my dictionary, because I thought, no --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Perjury.  Q R S, um, so I have a question for you, what would you, um, like if you were, um, the judge and how would you view someone who committed perjury, I mean --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, boy, I think that would be a hard job, because what if it was, I mean, not something dire --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but yet the same law applies to everybody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you'd want to make exceptions in some cases in case it was just something someone was embarrassed about.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  That's true.
L:  You know, how -- I don't know how you, um, judge on some of those --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things, I think that'd be a hard job to say, do we do the same thing for everybody, no matter what the degree or do we hold certain people more accountable [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or -- or do we just look at the situation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and how badly it affects the entire case --
R:  Yeah because it could be just something embarrassing, right, or something like really --
L:  Yeah.  Well, like, even with like Clinton's thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- obviously he was embarrassed.  This was a personal life thing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he lied under oath [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, you know, it's [SIGH] it's hard to know how to punish for that --
R:  Yeah.  I would, I don't know that's t- --
L:  -- because it is something kind of in his personal life, I mean a- -- at the time obviously he was in office so he should have been [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- keeping himself in control, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, ah ...
R:  Now it is P.U.R. isn't it?  Perjury, is that how you spell it, P.U.R. or is it -- I looked at -- is it, yeah, it would be --
L:  Gosh.  I -- I think so.
R:  Yeah.  And I can't even -- P.U.R. hmm, I don't even see it in this dictionary
