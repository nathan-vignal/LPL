R:  Hi, this is Jane Wright.
L:  Hi, this is Karen Williams.
R:  Hi, Karen.
L:  Hi.  This is the first time I've done this, so I'm not sure exactly how to do it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I guess we just talk about how -- how terrorism affects people.
R:  That's right --
L:  So --
R:  -- and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, just so you know, this is my first time too, so, we're -- 
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  We'll be virgins together.
L:  Okay.  Well, I kinda think that's a no brainer.  I think terrorism scares every- everybody, to terrorism.
R:  That's right, and I think they wanted us to talk about how we would react when, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if a terrorist attack happens, and I think I would probably be pretty freaked out.  So ... 
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's a [several inaudible words] I was on a trip, a bus trip, and as far as we knew, because we didn't [MN] [PAUSE]
R:  Are you there?
L:  I'm here.  Are you there? 
R:  Yeah, I'm here.  It's just --
L:  Okay.
R:  We're kind of --
L:  So ...
R:  -- breaking up, so ... 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um.
L:  I'm on -- I'm on a cell phone.  That -- that'd be why.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, yeah.  I was on a bus trip and -- and, you know, when we heard about the towers being bombed I panicked because I was away from home, I was away from my children, and I think that's how most parents would react.  You know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- a terrorist attack is -- is where my [several inaudible words].
R:  Where -- where were you when you were on this bus trip?  [PAUSE]
L:  ... I was away from any help, um, but it was far enough where -- because I wasn't in control -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I didn't have a vehicle that I was driving, um, that was an especially panicked feeling.
R:  Oh, yes.  I know.  Well, I was -- it was a very, um, panicky -- I felt panic -- even though I was in my home and I was safe, I just thought, "Oh, God" you know, "What's -- what's coming next?"
L:  Right --
R:  And --
L:  -- right.
R:  -- so -- but, I was -- I was [LAUGH] very glad -- I live in Ohio and I was very glad that we were far away from it.  But -- and it was a very scary thing and now it's -- it's scary to know that that, you know -- that, um, Osama, he's -- he's out there somewhere and we still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- haven't been able to f- to find him or capture him and -- and -- 
L:  Now there's splinter groups that go along with him.
R:  Yeah, and -- I don't know -- did you see the news the other night where they were, um -- [SIGH] they were, like, interviewing, um, different people on the street and -- over there and they said that, you know, "If Osama came to my house I would hide him" and -- 
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  -- and it's -- it's no wonder we can't find him if all these people are still willing to -- to hide him and ... [MN] 
L:  And, you know, I was just saying to my children I don't think that we can really blame the majority of people f- for feeling that way because in countries like that they're only allowed to hear what the government wants them to hear --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and know what the government wants them to know.  And so as far as they're concerned America is the bad place that they portray it to be.
R:  Right.
L:  And they never hear about the good in America.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I can understand why the people feel that way, but [MN] you would think that with their relatives or friends that have come over here to be educated -- now that's what really, really bothers me, is -- is that we educate these terrorists and then they go back home and do that.
R:  I know.  Isn't -- I mean, that is so scary and, I mean, just like when this first all happened and they were saying that, um, the -- the gentleman that had an airline flight training school and he trained them and, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we give them this -- this education and then they go -- they go back to their country and they use all this training against us.
L:  And that's just --
R:  It's like --
L:  -- it's just crazy, yeah.
R:  You know, and then -- then they wonder why, you know -- [MN] I don't know, these liberal groups, I guess, you know, like, "Why are we so down about" -- you know, "Why don't we want to tighten restrictions and" -- it's like --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's because we don't -- we don't want these people coming over here and us giving them this free education or this free information and then them leaving -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and using it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- against us.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you just wonder what we have to do to make ourselves safe.
L:  Yeah, I think with a terrorist attack, one of the -- the scariest things is not knowing what's coming next.  I know when the towers were hit I was thinking, "Is this the beginning?  Is this the beginning?  Are they going to be hitting targets all across the US?  Um, are they going to be hitting major cities next or, you know, move from the east coast right across the country to the west coast?  Is it a very planned attack or what?" 
R:  Right.
L:  Which -- which that, ah -- that was the -- being -- being, like I said, away from my family, that's why it was such a panic feeling for me and -- and, "What if it's just the beginning right now?" 
R:  Right, right.
L:  So ...
R:  And, you know, [LAUGH] it's -- you know, God bless the people that gave their lives in that airplane that went down, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, I -- didn't they say that that one was targeted for the White House? 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Can you --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- imagine if they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were successful? 
L:  And managed to take out the President and Vice President and all the leaders --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the country.
R:  I mean, and it -- [MN] you know, who knows, they probably might -- may or may not have been able to get, you know, the President and Vice President out in time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, because it just -- [PAUSE] it was just, you know -- 
L:  It would have been utter chaos.
R:  Yeah, and it was just such a surprise.  [PAUSE] I mean --
L:  And even so, even -- [MN] all we had on the bus were people with cell phones, and I know I kept trying and trying and trying to use mine, but the air time was just so filled up with everybody calling everybody across the United States that -- that the cell phones weren't working.
R:  Right.
L:  And, yeah.
R:  So, now where --
L:  So ...
R:  -- where is your family at that you were tr- -- 
L:  Oh, we live in Michigan.
R:  Michigan, oh, okay.
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it was -- that was a very, ah -- a very scary day.  I swear, I have never been so glued to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my television set.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I was that way for the whole week.
L:  Yeah, yeah, trying to find out more information.
R:  Yeah.  And, oh, my God, I just -- you know, all the --
L:  It was --
R:  -- devastation that happened and -- and -- 
L:  It was definitely a wake up call for America.
R:  Yep.
L:  We were pretty compla- complacent about going through our lives and nobody's going to touch us and -- and we can be touched, and we can be touched pretty hard.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  And, you know, it's just like -- it's like you said; it's -- it was a big wake up call because, you know, here we just feel so safe and we feel like we're in this little cocoon --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then all of a sudden something like that happens and it just -- [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bursts your bubble.
L:  Makes [MN] -- yeah, it makes us think twice about countries like Israel where it's a dail- it's a daily way of life for them.
R:  Yes.
L:  They don't know where a terrorist attack is going to come from.
R:  [SIGH] It just -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I just can't imagine, I guess, living with that [PAUSE] day to day.  I mean, we are to some degree -- you know, we're thinking, okay, you know, especially with us -- you know, the -- the war looming over our heads with Saddam.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, [MN] you know, I -- you know, I worry about it and -- but I guess I'm not -- I don't live in fear every day, like --
L:  Yeah, but is that because you really don't think it could happen again because it was such an isolated event? 
R:  No.  I guess -- I guess it's because [MN] -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I feel safe that our country can protect us.  I mean, yeah, you know, we have these -- these terrorist attacks.  But, as far as the war, I guess -- because it hasn't -- hasn't happened yet, I'm not living in fear of it.  I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I dread it and the repercussions and the fact that, you know, there's going to be men and women out there, you know, losing their lives and -- because it's inevitable in a war that, you know, you're going to have a certain amount of casualties and -- but I guess I'm not [SIGH] -- I'm not fearful of war yet because it's not here.  But, [MN] there again, I guess it goes back to I feel like I'm in this little cocoon.  You know, I'm safe.  I feel safe and protected in my little home in -- 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- in -- in Ohio, you know.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Like ther- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ohio. 
L:  Who's going to --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- attack Ohio, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't think there's anything in Ohio that anybody would, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We do have Wright Pat, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where they do -- 
L:  Ahah, ahah.
R:  -- do -- do send a lot of, um, recruits out of.  But, I don't know, I'm -- maybe I'm --
L:  That may be further down on the list of -- of hits.
R:  Maybe I'm too naive about the whole situation, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm -- I -- I -- I don't like the fact that, um, [MN] you know, we've got the threat of war looming --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over our heads, but ... I --
L:  And I guess I don't understand the people that are protesting it.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.
L:  Saddam is sheltering, actively sheltering in a plot -- [PAUSE]
R:  I'm sorry, you're breaking up again.
L:  Um, can you hear me? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I was saying, you know, I -- it's -- they -- they know that Saddam has been sheltering the terrorists and that he openly applauds what the terrorists are doing and have done.  And what do they think Saddam's going to do in the future?  Change his mind?  The people that are sh- that are -- that are saying, "No war, no war" what are we supposed to do?  Wait until he does --
R:  Right.
L:  -- attack us, until he personally attacks us with his country? 
R:  I know.  I -- I just don't understand it.  I mean, certainly, if we all had our choice, we would not [PAUSE] want to go to war and we would not --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, we're not -- it's not like we started it, like, you know, "Oh, we're just going -- we just want to have a war with Saddam just because we want to have a war".
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN] You know, I mean -- [MN] I -- I guess I -- I just don't -- I just don't understand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why they're protesting, and I mean it's not as if this is something that we really want to do.  And it's -- it's -- it's a big decision for the -- you know, for our President to have to do this, because he knows that his --
L:  Necessary evil, yeah.
R:  -- sending, you know, America's sons and daughters off to -- hi, sweetheart.  My son just got up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from his nap, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, [LAUGH] I -- you know, I think that [PAUSE] th- they should be more supportive -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of our -- of our President.
