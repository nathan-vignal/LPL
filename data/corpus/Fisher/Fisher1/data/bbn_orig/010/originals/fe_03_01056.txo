R:  Hi, my name is Jennifer Slater.
L:  Hi, Jennifer.  I'm Mindy Hicks.  How are you?
R:  I'm great, how are you, Mindy?
L:  I'm good.  So, how you draw the line at humor, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's an interesting one, huh?
R:  I -- I -- well, ah, terrorism probably would have been easier, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I would have to say you draw the line at humor whenever just in general conversation with people who you are just friendly with whenever it contains anything of a sexual nature.
L:  Mhm, that's true.
R:  Or, ah, anything regarding race or religion.
L:  Right.  Ye- I think it depends on who you're with at the time.
R:  Exactly.  How well you know them, but just your --
L:  But in --
R:  -- common, every day neighbor ...
L:  Right.  You want to stay away from sex, religion and any kind of, ah, discriminatory -- [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't want to tell bad lawyer jokes at the attorney's office, right?
R:  Exactly, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or have somebody who -- who has that ethnicity or that religion back in their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uncle's brother's cousin's wife, you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and be offending somebody without really realizing it.  It would be a horrible --
L:  That's true.
R:   -- it would be a horrible thing to have to realize.
L:  That's a fine line any more too, I mean --
R:  It is and I also think whenever you're talking about politics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's another one where everybody has such different views that [MN] you make jokes about politicians, well that might be somebody else's favorite -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  -- so then you're kinda stuck again.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  I don't know, that's -- okay, this is getting really difficult now.
R:  I know it is.
L:  How -- how do you use humor in your workday life?
R:  Um, I'm a stay home mom, so I don't work.
L:  Oh, that is your humor.  You do work.  [LAUGH]
R:  That is my humor.  Yes, I've four children and they are my humor.  Um --
L:  So, you're --
R:  -- but I have -- I have been around people, adults, in front of my children, who have made inappropriate jokes or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- slurs, or something like that and where you just start thinking, "Oh, my gosh.  I'm to have to explain that".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, "I'm going to have to explain all that" or come up with an excuse to leave --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- real quick.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, your humor really is limited to knock knock jokes and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  It sounds like me most of the time.  My kids are, er, at that age where they think they can make up jokes and you just sort of have to laugh and say, "Oh, yeah.  That was real funny" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, ah, I tend to fall on humor when I'm trying to lessen the tension, so --
R:  Yes, or if you don't know a whole lot about a certain thing that you're talking about.  I notice that people fall on humor a lot to back them up.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- to me, that's like the safest way to get around an awkward situation or --
R:  Very true.
L:  -- you know, if I'm -- if I'm nervous or, you know, whatever, I just --
R:  Right.  Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
L:  Ah, that's --
R:  Humor, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and people think I don't [LAUGH] -- people think I don't take things seriously when I start joking like that, but, you know --
R:  It's a nervous outlet.
L:  -- it is, it is.
R:  Yeah, I agree with that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I never tell off color jokes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Me neither.
L:  First of all once I hear a joke, I never remember it.
R:  I never ever remember jokes.  Never.  I try to, or some of them I think, "Oh, my gosh.  I'm going to remember that" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you do have your net of friends that you can tell jokes that, you know, between adults, that you wouldn't tell to maybe a neighbor, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to your girlfriend you can tell, you know and get a giggle out of it but --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- that's just the different situations, different jokes and remarks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are okay.  I think pretty much all my friends fall into this ca- [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  Not being appropriate, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not very nice.
L:  Well, we all have -- we all have our moments when we tell inappropriate jokes and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, given -- given the audience, you know, sometimes you can get away with that, but I've never, um, well I should say not since I've, you know, grown and been married and had kids, I've never, um, pushed the line.  I've always been --
R:  Yeah.  I was just going to ask you if you've ever been in a group of people and made a remark, [inaudible] remark, and then come to find out later that that actually probably should have directly, ah [inaudible] in that group?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sure I've done it.  I can't think of a specific situation but I'm almost positive I've done it.  I've been in groups where, um, somebody else has made a comment and you're thinking, "Oh, my goodness, that is the person standing next to me and she does not know that" -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and you just want to die because there's no recovery for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, there isn't.  You just have to bite your tongue and hope that it goes okay.
R:  Will it away[?]. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH]
R:  That, like for instance, I have a good example of this that my best friend from Colorado called me and she works at the computer lab at her -- oh, and you're just going to die when you hear this -- she works at the computer 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lab at her college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, she said that her and a couple of her co-workers, three of her male co-workers were just sitting in -- at their computers and they were bored and they were talking and somehow they came upon the subject of not having any arms and legs.
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Well, the -- one guy said, "Cut off my arms and legs but don't take my last appendage and I'll be just fine" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so [inaudible] looked at him and said, "Like, you could really get married without any arms and legs to where you would need that appendage" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the guy said, "If I was already married, you know --"
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- and then had my arms and legs cut off" and she said, "No" [several inaudible words] laughing for about twenty minutes and she says, "I bet we could put it in the computer, 'Women who would marry men with no arms and legs'" and they all giggled.  Well, come to find out the manager walked over to them and sat right on the other side of the computer -- I mean -- what are the odds --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was some poor man with no arms and legs.  And she --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yes, can you believe -- I mean, what are the odds?
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And she absolutely said she has never in her life felt more horrible.  She said she could have killed somebody and she probably would not have felt as horrible.  And she --
L:  Oh, it makes you feel lower than a snake when you do something like that.
R:  That's wh- and I said, "Oh, my gosh, did you say anything to him?" and she says, "What could I say?  The [inaudible] is joking?"  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good thing to be joking about, that would sound even worse, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they all just basically -- and the manager was clear across the room and he could hear --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the conversation and this poor guy [inaudible].
L:  Oh.
R:  And I said, "Well, my gosh, did you know him?" and she said, "Yeah, he comes in all the time."  I [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, if you know somebody like that, then doggone it.
L:  Then why would you say anything about it?  Oh, my God.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I guess that would be a perfect example of what they're talking about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  That was extremely inappropriate.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hopefully they learned their lesson, right?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I just couldn't believe it when she told me.  I said, "Oh, I know where this story's going".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Yeah, so I felt so bad.
L:  Oh, well.
R:  I just thought that was awful.  So, that's --
L:  But, you know.
R:  -- probably going to be on the top of this study's list, it will be that exact example.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Things not to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And she's going to be so pleased that I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you didn't mention any names, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, I didn't.  [LAUGH] So, that was -- that was my example there.
L:  That's funny.
R:  I didn't think about that, yeah.
L:  I mean, it's funny, but it's not ha ha funny.  It's just -- oh my goodness.
R:  Exactly, and I mean, what are the odds?  I have met one person in my life and not even met him, seen one person in my life that didn't have any arms and legs.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you know --
L:  I don't think I've even ever seen anybody like that --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and I've work with -- and I've worked with disabled people.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, so in their defense, they were not doing it maliciously.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they weren't being mean, they were bored and they were -- thought they were being humorous when [inaudible] --
L:  Mhm.  Well, hopefully that person has learned to cope with that over --
R:  Oh.  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  -- their lifetime and hopefully they were able to laugh back, you know.
R:  Oh.  Well, hopefully he's married was what I thought instantly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, if he's not, he's thinking, "Okay, well now I don't stand a chance", you know, if that's what people think.
L:  Yeah.  That would be real depressing, wouldn't it?
R:  Yeah, sure would.  [LAUGH]
L:  You would feel hopeless at that point.  Oh.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how many minutes are we up to?
L:  I have no idea because I didn't look at the clock when we started.
R:  Oh, we are there.  We did nine minutes.  We are so good.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Well, it was wonderful talking to you.
L:  Okay, well --
R:  What state are you from?
L:  I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from California.
L:  Are you really?
R:  Talking --
L:  -- I always end up talking to California people for some reason.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yeah, not -- not just in this, but it's like every time I'm on the phone with somebody, you know, for business or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's always, "Oh, where are you calling from?" "California", you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's like, "Oh, my gosh"
R:  What part of Pennsylvania are you from -- I mean are you living in?
L:  I live in Harrisburg which is --
R:  Oh, my goodness --
L:  south central Pennsylvania.
R:  -- my -- are you close to Uvula[?]?
L:  Uvula?
R:  Uvula.  It's just a little town outside of Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, no.  That's way over on western PA.
R:  Oh, okay.
