R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Marsha.
L:  Hi, my name's Angela. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, um, so we're supposed to talk about what's appropriate comedy and inappropriate?
L:  Yeah, where we draw the line at.
R:  Okay --
L:  Um --
R:  -- um, where -- where do you think that the line should be drawn --
L:  I think --
R:  -- and what do you say?
L:  -- I think that if it's like in a s- sexual thing, [LAUGH] I think it -- that's where I draw the line at, ah, to be in comedy -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right, I --
L:  -- because to me it -- that -- that's just that they've gone a little bit too far. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I -- I agree on that, um, I think that if -- if you wouldn't want your mom to sit and watch it with you, I think that that -- that's what makes it inappropriate.  That if you were uncomfortable with a parent sitting there then --
L:  Yes, very true --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because if you don't want them being them uncomfortable, you know, oh, God, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, so, yeah.  I think that's definitely one thing.  Um, another thing that I find, um, sort of inappropriate is racial comedy because it -- it's okay for, say, an -- an African American person to make fun of a white person, but --
L:  But then we can't do it to them and --
R:  -- you know, if a white person -- Right, right, that's --
L:  I understand.
R:  -- terribly --
L:  I understand.
R:  Yeah, that's bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's very bad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I think a lot of, um, comedy that's, ah, geared towards children today, is actually very inappropriate.  Um, I've watched a lot of cartoons that, um, the kids are like, you know, smarting off to the parents and that's funny and, you know, that's --
L:  Because they learn it from the cartoon.
R:  Right.
L:  I've seen that.
R:  It's not, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  That wouldn't happen in my household and --
L:  Oh no, that's not gonna happen in mine. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know --
L:  I'm gonna like, "What did you just say?", no.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Er, "Where did you learn that?  Okay, you're not watching that one anymore". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly, exactly.  Yeah, I think, yeah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's definitely a problem.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How long are we supposed to talk?  Oh, eight minutes, um ...
R:  Eight minutes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's a lot, hard subject.
R:  It -- it is hard to talk on for [LAUGH] eight minutes.
L:  For eight minutes, I mean you could talk about that, like, in no time, but, um ...
R:  Okay, um, we can talk about who -- who do you find, like, in comedians today, who do you find that, you know, you don't really enjoy listening to?
L:  Um --
R:  Is there anybody in particular?
L:  I don't remember his name.  Ah, what was that guy's name?  Who do you and then maybe I -- I it might pop my -- my --
R:  Um, I -- I actually watched a DVD of Robin Williams --
L:  Really, you do not like Robin Williams?
R:  -- he, on this DVD, it is unrated because --
L:  Really?
R:  -- because of the material and it was really just disgusting, like I -- I watched it and I was like, you know, "Can we turn this off?" because it was totally sexual and just some of the words used were just like totally vulgar and I'm like, "This is not funny to me".
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  That surprised me because I -- I haven't seen that.  Yeah, it's, um, a -- a show he did on Broadway I believe and oh, yeah, I didn't enjoy that too much.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't either.
R:  Hm.
L:  Okay, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the one I'm thinking about is a black guy.  I don't remember his name though.
R:  Chris Rock or -- [inaudible]?
L:  Yeah.  Chris Rock.  Yeah.
R:  Chris Rock. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, ah, he just goes off sometimes and I just wanna go in there and like, straight on like, "Don't be saying that.  That's not funny", but --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Some, um, it just depends, like especially on the age levels of the viewers --
L:  Yeah.  I mean because they -- they're gonna -- I don't think they stop to think, "Hey, kids are gonna to be watching this and hey, they're gonna be going out and saying and repeating this to their friends and then its going to be getting around" and I --
R:  Right, and -- and that's funny.  It's funny to use those words but when you actually use them, when the kids are saying them, it's, you know, it's gonna be a whole different story.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's not like they're gonna want their kids saying it, I mean --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- that -- that --that's just -- it just contradicts what [LAUGH] they're doing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, ah, ah ...
R:  Yeah, but, yeah, I definitely think it all goes back to the -- if -- if you would enjoy watching something with your mom, then I think that that would make it appropriate.
L:  Yeah, because if the parents would enjoy it, you know you're going to because they're --
R:  Right if you'd be --
L:  -- basically strict on everything, so --
R:  -- if you'd be -- right, if you'd be embarrassed while, you know, like "Oh, can we turn this now?" I think --
L:  Oh, like, "I can't believe I just watched that with my mom.  I can't believe they said that in front of my mom" yeah, believe me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've been there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been there watching stuff and -- and then a comedian just say something and I'm looking at my mom like, "Okay, is she laughing?" or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- i- i- i- or i- i- is she getting mad?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah.
L:  And I don't agree too much when they bring in religion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the comedian stuff.  I don't -- I -- I think --
R:  No, I -- I agree with you on that.
L:  -- I think they need to stay away from it because that is on any religion, like, I mean, it just -- it's -- it's -- it's a bad thing, I think.
R:  Right, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a very sensitive subject to make l- --
L:  Very sensitive.  I mean --
R:  -- and to make light of somebody's religion.  I mean that -- your spirituality is very [MN] personal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to m- to make fun of somebody's personal belief, I think is, you know, kind of crossing the line, but, you know, it -- it all depends.  I think that the people that enjoy comedy like that are people that aren't spiritual and don't --
L:  Very 
R:  -- have a particular --
L:  -- I -- I -- I -- I-- I agree with you on that one, I think there is a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there is --
R:  Because it's -- it's not important to them, so --
L:  -- it's not important to -- it's funny to them and I think that's -- that's basically like for everything.  For anything that they -- they make a joke out of, I mean, if -- if it's not important to you about other people's feelings then you're gonna talk about that person and you're gonna put him down and -- and make a joke of him or whatever, I mean --
R:  That's very true.  That's interesting. [SIGH] Hm.  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree on the religion. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I think -- I think generally, that we could say that it's anything that is important to you, like personally, is what, you know, you don't find funny, like I -- I think that personal integrity is very important to me, so when people make sexual comments and stuff, you know, make light of that, it -- it offends me.
L:  Yeah, it does me too, because I've, like --
R:  So --
L:  -- because I've had it happen to me before, you know, they'll be a bunch of people on and they'll all be laughing and then they'll look at me like, "You don't think that's funny?" and I'm like, "No, I did not -- I thought that was, you know, disgusting" that was --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- that -- that was rude for me to have and then they were like, "Oh, you know, you need to lighten up" [MN] and I'm like, "No, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you need to respect me for my views". [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- yeah, that's very true.  Yeah, um, I think -- I think a lot of the time that comedians get caught up in what's popular.  Like, you know, it's very popular to advertise sex right now, so that's what funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's funny to make jokes about that, so --
L:  Or funny to make, er -- or -- or -- or about somebody's weight, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the color of their hair or, you know, or the way --
R:  But that --
L:  -- they act, or --
R:  I've seen that a lot lately is the -- the, um, fat jokes sort of, is, um, a lot of the larger comedians will make fun of themselves and I'm watching like, "Do you not have any self respect?" you know, "You must not like yourself very much if you can sit and make a joke about what you look like".
L:  Well then, some people would argue that, um, on that fact that, er, that they are comfortable with themselves and that's why they can do that.
R:  Right.  I -- I can understand that, but, you know, a lot of the time I think it's that people -- larger people will expect people to make a judgment about them, so to make light of it, they make a joke about it, which I'm -- I'm -- I'm sure that many people who are, you know, plus size or larger, I'm sure that many of them are comfortable but at the same time I just don't really see, like, comfort in their eyes when they talk about their weight.  I see sort of like an excuse to, you know, get around the subject and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that they won't be made fun of.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Hm, okay, did that sound right?
L:  Yeah, that -- that's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I think it's been ten minutes.
L:  Do you think?  I don't know. [LAUGH] I figured maybe they'd come on and say, you -- you know, "Time's up"
R:  Yeah, "Your time is up now, you may stop talking".
L:  I didn't even start timing it; I was like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I -- it -- they called on my cell phone and so I'm like, "Okay, ten minutes I think I can pay for that". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah.
R:  Hm, let's see.  It's five ten, do you know about what time they called?
L:  No, I just got off internet and it -- it -- my phone rang and I was like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] "Okay, I'll take it".
L:  "Okay, yeah, I'll take it, okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Well, let see.  We could talk about one more subject then we'll call it -- we'll see if -- you know, it interrupts or anything.
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  Okay, um, maybe we should talk about what is appropriate since we've talked about, like, what isn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- I just personally like anything that's light hearted, like, I don't like anything that's too, like derogatory towards anyone, you know.
L:  Yeah, I understand.
R:  Like, I think it's funny when, you know, people act stupid or, you know, do funny things but it's not funny to me when, its like, "Oh, look -- look at that person over there, aren't they funny?"
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- that to me I don't think it's funny at all.  I mean, ah, and people do it all the time, and then -- then -- then a lot of people laugh with tho- that person just so that, you know, they, you know, are with their friends, but I don't --
R:  Its because it's not them in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in that --
