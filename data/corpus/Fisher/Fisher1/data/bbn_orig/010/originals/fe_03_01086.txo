L:  [NOISE] Hi --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- I'm Patty.
R:  Hi.  I'm [inaudible].
L:  I'm sorry, what?
R:  Mahogany.
L:  Mahogany.  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, so, um, have you participated in one of these calls before?
L:  No, this is my first one [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so -- mine to, so that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, um, our topic is perjury, that's fun.
L:  Yeah.  Perjury for -- for a close friend or a family member.  Geeze.  I don't know if I could do that or not.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I think -- I don't think I could think of a single person that has not [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  There -- yeah, actually, um, if it's for a good enough reason, yeah, there's people that would lie for, yeah -- I w- -- I would lie for my family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or a close friend if it was necessary, if they had a --
L:  Well, it depends on how --
R:  -- really good reason --
L:  -- close of a friend they are.  I guess, you know, if it would be a family member, like my mom and dad or something, yeah, I probably could do it then, but, boy, a close friend, that -- that's a hard call [LAUGH] have to be a real --
R:  Well, yeah --
L: -- close friend.
R:  Well, I say that because most of my friends are, um, they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've been my friends maybe twelve or so years --
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  [LAUGH] So, they're pretty close [LAUGH] they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- basically family at this point, so --
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I could see that, then, if they're, you know, I just moved, so I don't have, you know --
R:  Oh, that sucks.
L:  -- the one real close friend I had moved to South Carolina and I'm in Pennsylvania, so it's like --
R:  Youch.
L:  -- I don't have one that I've had for twelve years, if you know what I mean, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but a family member, yeah, I -- I could see where I could do it for a family member --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] I'm trying to find out if they want us to talk about -- I could tell an example of when I committed perjury [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Ah -- w- -- actually, recently [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  Well, you could tell me [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Well, um, one of my friends is applying for a job --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they needed a reference for some -- whatever reason so they called me and I pretended to be a company or whatever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or a representative from some company that she used to work for and she is a great worker and is absolutely outstanding --
L:  Well ...
R:  But, [LAUGH] --
L:  I could do that, I mean, yeah, I -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I could do that.  I mean, when I think of perjury, I think of actually being in a courtroom and having to swear to tell the whole --
R:  Oh, my God, okay [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  You know, it's swear to tell the truth --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then it's like, okay [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Now, thinking about it that way, no I'm not [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If I had to lie to a company or whatever, yeah, that's fine.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  But if -- 
L:  -- a little bit different.
R:  -- I had to actually get on the stand, um, no, I'm not, I don't care who it is [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not lying and so --
L:  Well, see, I don't know, though, it could be your parents or --
R:  Uh-uh.  I'm sorry, I'm not --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going to get on a stand and lie because my parents, I know them -- they're really funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they'll feel bad about me having lied for them, so they'll tell someone and then I'll get in trouble.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- would be a hard situation.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That would be a hard situation.
R:  So, no, there's no way I would lie for them because they'd give it up [LAUGH].  They'd rather just go ahead and get in trouble.
L:  Right.
R:  Than to corrupt their daughter.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that, you know, I -- that's what I said, I mean, doing things like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- helping somebody on an application or -- or saying you're somebody that you're not, that -- that's a little bit easier than actually going to a courtroom or something and being --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the stand, I mean, that --
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's, um, a little hard, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I said, I -- I wouldn't even do it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for the family, but, yeah, if somebody wants to call me about, you know, a job or anything like that, I'm pretty easy to just go ahead and lie because occasionally it's, oh, you scratch my back I'll scratch yours situation.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but sometimes that I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine can get you in more trouble [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] True, true.  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Like, yeah, now that I think about it, if there's anything dealing with the government, I'm not gonna, mm mm because, like if a friend was trying to get security clearance or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they asked me to lie, I'd be like, mm, you're on your own, buddy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, see, that -- that's -- that's kind of what I think about it, I mean, I have a son that's in the Marine Corps and I know he has security clearance of like, it's really hard to do, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like that, like you say, with the government or, you know ... that's entirely a different story [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly [LAUGH] yeah, I'm not -- mm mm, not interested in that, I'm not trying to get hauled in because I lied for somebody, not to mention, you know, would it -- what does it say about you if you're trying to get security clearance and one of the people that you put down as a reference or whatever --
L:  Is lying for you.
R:  -- is trying to lie for you.
L:  Yeah.  That -- you don't think about it that way, but yeah, you're exactly right. [PAUSE]
R:  Huh.  Okay.  So, are there any more directions we could take this call?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Anything?  Well, I think we're supposed to keep talking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I'm sure if they're taping this they're probably having a lot of fun at this point.
L:  Probably.  I don't know what else to say about it.  I mean, I think we've pretty much covered it, that, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I wonder in -- how come they don't give any actual guidelines about that particular questions, because you could take it in so many different ways, now that you think about it.
L:  Yeah.  You're exactly right.  Maybe that's why they want you to keep talking about it [NOISE].
R:  Probably, to see exactly how many different directions people will go with it [NOISE].  Let's see.  Is there anything else I can think of about perjury?  Hm.  I don't know.  I don't think you should lie to the government, don't think you should lie in church --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, we didn't even hit the church thing, but you're right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's just like how -- how do you want to say it blasphemous or something if you're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in church and lying, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Huh.  Actually speaking of all that stuff, that -- perjury seems to become pretty widespread [LAUGH] actually.
L:  Yeah.  It could be, if you think about it.
R:  Because, ah, you know, you've got the whole thing going on with the Catholic Church and just with, um, the possibility going on with this war that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- may be happening, that people are -- some people are saying that Colin Howell lied about the information he had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the government -- the military is restricting their people from talking to anybody that's not in the military, like, ah, I have people that I used to date [LAUGH] that are in the military and they've actually been restricted in what they're allowed to email about --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I -- I like I said, my son's in the Marine Corps, so, yes --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I can totally believe that.  That's and some things that it's like people see all this stuff on TV and say, "Well, now, how can you really conduct a war, don't you think Osama Bin Laden and all them are on TV watching what's going on?" --
R:  That's what I would think personally.
L:  Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're only letting things on TV that they want them to see, you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, it's like, yeah some of -- sometimes they only tell people in the -- in the service, in the military limited as to what, well, okay, we'll tell you this so even if you do have a security breach or you happen to tell somebody, it's not going to hurt anything, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Me neither.  I don't know.
L:  It's a totally different world out there [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You could really go off on a lot of different sprees on perjury.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  I don't know.  I'm just -- see, there's lying on job applications yourself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh [LAUGH] but then --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that doesn't include fam- -- friends and family, I don't think.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's true [NOISE] it is a form of perjury, but because you're even signing it saying that it's all [NOISE] true --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the best of your knowledge [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  At the bottom they have that little statement --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, I was actually, um, like doing a job search right now and I was just reading an article about, ah, people that are applying to NDA School --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that have been lying on their applications --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they actually just kick a bun- -- like they just kicked a bunch of applications at this one school, I cannot remember the name, my kids finished reading the article, but -- they lied on their apps and of course they did an extensive -- extensive search and found that some people because they didn't want to see undesirable --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as applying, they, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they would expand what dates they were working and say they had been on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work since March because they laid off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they'd say they had been there until November --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, you know, the stuff that's pretty easily verifiable and I think they just thought that people weren't going to check --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  A lot of people do that.
R:  Yeah.  That's really strange to me [NOISE].
L:  Well, I -- I, yeah, well, you know, I graduated from college and they told us, you know [LAUGH] it's funny 'cause the, um, person that was going over -- the teacher that was going over
