R:  So, we just -- we just start -- just start discussing terrorism and how we feel about it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, me -- well I just, ah, I have two young children, so I'm pretty concerned about terrorism --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as, you know, um, people coming from, er -- from other countries and, er, coming here under, er, false pretense, you know.  They say they're getting an education, or they're --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- moving their families here, but then they're also planning to do training and -- and learning how to use things, to -- to turn against, ah, the country that -- that's helping them get an education.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah, I -- I do have a lot of concerns about terrorism and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- going to war with Iraq and possibly opening ourselves up to more --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more, ah, terrorism like you see in Israel on a da- daily basis --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's something I don't want my -- my children to have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to consider normal.
L:  Yeah.  So, I been lived in United States for ah, almost four years.
R:  Great, great.
L:  Yeah, but it is very short.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I try to, ah, catch up with the news --
R:  Right.
L:  -- over that, ah, terrorist and war things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, ah, actually, I don't know what to do.
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe I would follow just my husband, my family --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, are you a student, or --  [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE]  Oh, Colorado?  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Oh, it's beautiful there, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, is, all the time.  In Washington the situation might be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different from Colorado, you know, there is, er, Seattle, right?
R:  [NOISE]  Right, right.  Seattle, I think, has been a target before, a supposive target of terrorism
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I heard that.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I'm about --
L:  Sometimes I got a email from, ah, Japanese Consulate --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you know that -- for the terrorism warning or something --
R:  Right.
L:   -- you know, stay calm, you know --
R:  Stay calm  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm a pretty -- [NOISE] pretty calm person, but I just ah, I just hate op- opening ourselves us to just out and out war --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're dealing with people that are willing to die for their [NOISE] to kill as many people as possible, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- along with themselves, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- it's really kind of a scary prospect, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the -- the war on terrorism might -- I do support it, um, but [NOISE] concerns that it's going to be a long term war.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You see what's going on in the Middle East and -- [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just different -- different races have been fighting each other for years and it's --  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's so sad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and so many people have died it, it's just horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I'd hate to get on -- us -- us involved in that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, you know, coming here and, ah, [NOISE] having build- -- having planes fly into buildings and --
L:  Right.
R:   -- just, ah, -- just -- was just a terrible intrusion --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean we can't just sit and be idle about it.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's how I feel.  I mean -- so you were here during September eleventh, right.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that was pretty scary.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  So, by the way, do you hear the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- beeping sound? Yeah, that sound?
R:  Do I hear what?  [NOISE]
L:  Do you hear some beeping sound?
R:  I just hear static on my end.  I have a cordless phone, so that --  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and my son's playing with one of his -- his talking toys, so --  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- I don't know if that's it or not. [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, so do you support the war on terrorism, or --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- are you just annoyed about it?  [NOISE]
L:  Ah -- ah -- ah -- I beg your pardon?
R:  [NOISE]  Do you -- how do you feel about the war on terrorism?  How do you feel about the United States fighting back, or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going to war, how do you feel about it?
L:  Ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I think, according to the information which I get --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think, ah, the United States should wait.
R:  [NOISE]  Should wait?  Yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  You think -- you -- so you agree with the, um, with the inspectors that it's gonna to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- five or six months before we actually know how much he's disarmed and he's started --
L:  Right
R:  -- yeah --[NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  -- I agree with that too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really do, but I just don't --
L:  Though, it seems to me -- it seem- -- you know, I'm not a United Sta- -- er, not a citizen of the United States --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well you're entitled -- you're entitled to an opinion --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- regardless, so --
L:  Um, you know, er --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, u- -- so, they -- United States want to, ah, go into the war, no matter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what the resolution, er, the United Nation have --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think it is very dangerous.
R:  [NOISE]  No, [LAUGH]  Yeah, I -- I think that Bush is gonna -- he's gonna go to war regardless of what, um --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  See, my concern is going against the United Nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if you actually -- well, I don't know if you can actually do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it seems like he's -- he's --
L:  Yeah, if --
R:  -- he's um bent on doing that.
L:  -- if-- if, ah, Bush make a decision --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Iraq no matter what the resolution is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it would be very dangerous for the world peace.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe, the United States is very strong --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so, ah, no country can win the United States, actually, but later -- later, for example, ah, some, ah, let's see, Japan --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:   -- attacked somewhere Asian countries --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and that's against the, ah, United Nations --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, intention --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  -- but, for example, ah, Japan could say that, "United States did the same thing and they -- they were not punished at all, and, why, you know, only Japan needs to be punished", you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I think it's very important to, ah, keep the balance --
R:  Keep the balance.
L:  -- and then hear the, ah, voice from different nations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's very important to follow the, ah, the United Nations.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I think I -- that's, um, I think it's important to do that too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]-- it's just more of a protection thing.  You don't want to go out and start wars on your own --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not have other countries backing you up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I totally -- I totally agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I think of a couple [NOISE] of years ago, when I wasn't a parent, I may have thought differently, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I understand the war against terrorism, but I don't understand going to war against the -- the, um --[NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, um the permission or the, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the support of the United Nations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's funny, because all the smallest countries are the ones that are supporting --
L:  Right.
R:  -- supporting us.  You've got these tiny countries like, er, I thing, Guana, and ah --[NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what the other countries are Mexico --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just a few of them that support the US, but everybody else is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- that has, you know, have said that they don't wanna -- they don't wanna proceed until later.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They wanna wait and see what he's actually gonna do.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, well the thing is that everybody wants to get rid of Saddam Hussain, but you just have to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just really should wait and see what happens.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know --I don't know what's gonna happen.  [NOISE].  Yeah --
L:  I hope there is no war, you know?
R:  You hope there's no war?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's very scary.
R:  It is very scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, my husband says all the time that he's, you know, he like, "What about the citizens of Iraq and, you know, the innocent people that are --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- going to school, raising families, what about those people?  Those people's lives are gonna change".
L:  Right.
R:  And, I'm thinking, "Well, yeah". That's, ah, that's my concern.  That's wh- -- that's the reason I don't -- I don't, um, support going to war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at this time, but, you know, I think we should fight terrorism, but going to war against that country --[NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, more people -- more innocent people are going to get hurt than --[NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the people that, you know, the people that we wanna hurt are- aren't going to get hurt probably.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'll get hurt after the war.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  After they're booted out.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah.  War's never a good thing,  [NOISE] but sometimes it's a -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- something that's necessary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's interesting getting a perspective from some --
