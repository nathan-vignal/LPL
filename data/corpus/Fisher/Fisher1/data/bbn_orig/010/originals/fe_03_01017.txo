L:  Hi, my name is Patrick.
R:  My name's Lisa.
L:  Um, would you like to go first or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I think most people would panic, don't you?
L:  Yes, I think so, 'cause it's most unlikely that anyone would stay calm during something they don't know what they're actually sure about.
R:  That's true.  You think you would be calm, but I -- I don't know.
L:  Mm.
R:  It would be hard to say.
L:  Depending on the situation --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and gravity.
R:  That's true.  If it -- if it was a terrorist attack in your area you would panic, I'm sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But if, you know, like nine eleven, I didn't panic panic.  [LAUGH]  I was concerned, but it wasn't nowhere near me.
L:  Well, it's in my city, so --
R:  Oh no.
L:  -- pretty much everyone felt that around here, so --
R:  So, how did you deal --
L:   -- then you kinda understand where those people are coming from.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  I mean, how did you react?
L:  Um, well, everyone felt the -- a loss in some forms but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- after a while you tend to not exactly be on guard, but more aware of the situation around you.
R:  Yeah.  So, it was -- you were -- it was in your city.  Were you very close to it, or ...?
L:  Um, a few miles outside.
R:  Few miles.  I think I would have panicked about it, even a few miles.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I probably would've been ...
L:  Um.
R:  No, I don't know how I would've reacted.  I know I just kinda froze when it come on TV, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was just in shock.  I couldn't believe it.
L:  Well, at the beginning you tend to be in shock, but then the -- the whole reality of the situation hits you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you tend to make do with what you have.
R:  Right.  I'm sure.  I just -- we're so remote in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, where I'm at, that our, you know, I guess I feel too relaxed sometimes because I'm in such a little biddy spot.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's like, you know, I don't think they can find me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's not exactly like a situation that would land on any doorstep, but --
R:  Oh no, I don't -- I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  That was just --
L:  No, I'm just saying like it's very unlikely that it would happen anywhere else.
R:  That's true.  You know, I know my children get concerned.  You know, they're like, "Well, can we go to this city?"  I'm like, "Well, you know, it's ..."  There's always that chance.  I said anything can happen to you --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you just have to go on living each day and not worry, you know, it's always going to be in the back of your mind.  But you can't --
L:  Yeah, but you can't live your life in fear --
R:  That's right, you can't start --
L:  -- or else you'll never move on.
R:  That's right, you -- you just can't stop living.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You sound just like my son's friend.  [LAUGH]  Your voice is identical.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hm.  Ah ...
R:  How long are we supposed to discuss this topic?  [LAUGH]
L:  I think about ten minutes.
R:  About ten minutes.
L:  How long have we on the clock?
R:  I don't know -- I did- I didn't even look at the clock when I called, did you?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Well, still the whole, um, nine eleven situation now with, um, Bush going to war with Iraq, other events might be in the future, but we never know.
R:  Yeah, that -- that concerns me more than worrying about an actual attack.  I wasn't so worried until he started wanting to go fight.
L:  Mm.
R:  Now -- now you're wondering, you know, cause I heard something on the news about -- I forgot what country it was, was starting to build their nuclear warheads because they think we're not watching them.  We're too concerned about Saddam Hussain and Bin Laden.
L:  I think it was North Korea.
R:  Yeah.  I'm like, you know, they might just slip in the back door, maybe.
L:  That's true, but I agree and I disagree with the whole situation.  I believe in some parts such like defending our homeland and making sure that they're not a threat, but still, invading peoples homes without first discussing the whole situation, I don't think that was right.
R:  I -- I -- I totally agree with that.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause, you know, un- until they do something, I mean, maybe I'm just, you know, in a little hick town, and not really keeping up with the news, but what has Hussain done to us?
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, and -- and take care of your own people before you --
L:  Before you go out --
R:  Right, because --
L:  With the whole financial situation of the country and other stuff and you're investing money in war and sending people to die.
R:  Yeah, and that, you know, it -- it's really hard because they go bomb them and then they'll go and feed them, and they get people right here starving where they could've fed the people in America that starving, without bombing anybody.
L:  Mhm, definitely.  A lot of people say he's after the oil, but -- 'cause of high, um, gas prices and other stuff like that.
R:  I think he's after him because daddy didn't get him, so he's got to.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's what I think exactly what's going on.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  But then you have to think that sometimes the government doesn't exactly tell you everything that they're hearing, so that the situation might be actually worse than the American public thinks.
R:  Well, that's true too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's, you know, I had wondered that because they're always about this right of information and the government is hiding this and that.  Well, if everybody in America knew everything the government was doing --
L:  We'd all be hiding under our beds.
R:  Yeah, and not only that, how, you know, they're getting all these people for being spies, well you don't think the other country can find out because people'll be talking about it and putting it on the internet and, you know, there're some things we're better off not knowing.
L:  That's true.
R:  Because, you know, you know word of mouth is the biggest form of advertisement.  So, I know people would tell, you know, they type  their friend in this other country and say, "Guess what we're doing?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, I know the government has to keep stuff secret from us.
L:  Of course, it's to ensure that, um, safety and also keep everyone calm.
R:  And, I think you know, and I -- I hate to say it, and -- but I think that the government brought on the terrorist act.  I mean, almost helped with it because we let so many people into this country without checking anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, we trained these guys to fly the planes.  That's what just --
L:  [LAUGH]  That's amazing
R:  -- that is what really annoys me -- that just -- I get all worked up when I think about that, you know.  If you all had better screening and you didn't let just everybody come over here.
L:  Talk about setting yourself up for disaster.
R:  Exactly, you asked for it.  I mean those people in the building didn't ask for it and I feel very sorry for everybody that was affected, but you know, if the government had to give each of them two or three million, their families and friends and [LAUGH] they might think twice.
L:  True.
R:  You know, they get to come over here and work tax free and a lot of the times we feed them.  You know, we've got people starving here, but we're bringing in all these people from other countries.  We're setting them up in welfare and food stamps and training them to fly our planes [LAUGH] and you know you wonder if there's any that has slipped into the military.
L:  I think they've got the [inaudible] like up in Canada and Mex- down in Mexico, they're not exactly that selective about letting people through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  In --
L:  -- you never know who gets in -- the right background information might slip by and that's how they got in, or they might use, like, false papers.
R:  Yeah, there's so many illegal people here, but if -- they make it to easy to come in and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, because -- and you got so -- they get so much better for [inaudible] than the people that live  -- that were born here and are working their butts off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I doubt very seriously I could have got trained to fly one of those planes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I wouldn't've had the money.  But I mean here's -- their whole families is over here and, you know, I went to Florida once, and it was -- I was a bit like -- we were in Miami and it felt like we were in a different country.
L:  Yeah, it's almost tropical over there.
R:  Yeah, not only that, but we [LAUGH] got off the wrong exit and, you know, I have nothing against -- I'm not prejudiced, but every corner had a funeral home in Mexican, you know, Spanish, and it was like we were in Mexico.  And I looked at my husband and I said there's a funeral home on every corner, we need to get outta here.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  We're in the wrong place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that, you know, I was just looking through their paper and just about every job said you had to be able to speak English and Spanish.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  I know.
L:  Like in certain parts of the country where you  have to know how to speak Spanish, like in California certain parts, you go very, very south --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you have to know how to speak Spanish and other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even the signs there also in double language.
R:  And, you know, that's not [inaudible] either.  English is the language where they should speak English, we shouldn't have to learn Spanish.
L:  That's true.
R:  And, you know, that's like the -- a- any of the other countries.  They come over here and they're talking and nobody can understand what they're saying.  They could be saying they're going to blow up something --[LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and nobody would understand them.  You know, unless you were one of the few that, you know, have ta- -- taken their language, but there are not that may people in America I think that know.
L:  Best to think of the foundation of this country was based on people leaving other countries because of persecution or other problems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if you look at the whole system, it's based on protecting those that can't find any other work or anything like that, other -- you know their countries.
L:  [MN]
