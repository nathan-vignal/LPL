L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Alisha.
L:  Hi, I'm Micky.  [COUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, what's the topic?  It's, um, how you tell between unacceptable comedy and comedy?
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  What do you think?
L:  [NOISE] What's acceptable comedy and what's not acceptable comedy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would be -- [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- let's see, just jokes in general.  I think anything off color or sexual is not comedy -- [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  -- when you have children present.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, definitely.  [NOISE] Definitely.
L:  You know, especially teenage children or under sixteen.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Very influential children.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, um, I feel the same as -- also with, um, like when -- when, ah, bad current events have happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like the space shuttle or terrorism or nine eleven -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, when you make comedy about that, which -- [NOISE]
L:  Which -- [NOISE]
R:  -- which I have heard some of that.
L:  Yeah, because you shouldn't make light of that. [NOISE]
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Even, you know, even people that are kidnapped or disappear -- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, they made comedy of that. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And like on the, um, TV Land Awards last night they made, um -- [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a comedy little skit out of Michael Jackson's stuff that's been going on -- [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE].  Oh, really.
L:  -- that to me, is not comedy. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  No, you mean, like the stuff with the kids? [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh no. [NOISE].
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  You know, when there's children involved, that's not considered comedy. [NOISE]
R:  No.  I don't think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um, who -- who do you -- what kind of comedians do you like?
L:  Um, you know, ones that are clean. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Jerry Seinfield is -- [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- border line for me.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I can't think of any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right now.  I know Paul Rodrigius[?] years ago was 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was pretty good but then I think he kind of went over the line as well.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I like, um, George Lopez.  He's on, um -- [NOISE] he has his own show on Wednesday nights.
L:  Oh, I don't think I've seen that one. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, him and Damon Wayans.  Both of them have a show.  Um, they kind of -- well we like to watch, um, Whose Line is it Anyway?
L:  Yes.  That is a good comedy show --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and that's actually a good family show.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  The same thing with, ah, [NOISE] the -- My Wife and Kids is Damon Wayans' show --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- and, um, they, ah, they -- they're -- he's a comedian and an actor and he has his own show now and it -- it's a good family show too.  It's really funny.
L:  Right, right. [NOISE]
R:  That's like -- that's like, um -- um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- Bill Cosby.
L:  Yeah.  Bill Cosby is excellent.
R:  I think his -- his humor is great because he -- he has some adult humor in there, but it doesn't cross the line.
L:  [NOISE] Right, but it also sometimes goes over the kids' heads --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- as well. [inaudible]
R:  That's like My Wife or, um, [NOISE] Whose Line is it Anyway.
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  I think that does the same --
L:  Yes -- [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- because my son will be laughing.  He has no idea what it is, but he'll be laughing because we're laughing.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, or even sometimes they put comedy, adult comedy, into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Disney movies.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, like in, ah, Toy Story Two.
L:  Yeah, with a little bit --
R:  [NOISE]  That was the, ah, the latest one.  I've seen some of that.
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Even in Toy Story where he -- where Mr. Potato Head took his lips off and stuck him on his behind.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or when he got scared and he lost everything from behind. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That was good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I, um, I think that's good now that they are putting them [NOISE] into Disney movies because, ah, it's, um, it's giving the adults some fun too when they're watching the movie.
L:  Right, right, but it's still in, you know, pretty good taste -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, without -- without having to show the vulgarity of it all. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, because I've gotten, um --
L:  [NOISE] That's the part that I don't like.
R:  -- I've gotten some emails.  Sometime we send a lot of jokes, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just for morale at work and, um, they're real strict about what you send, but sometimes you get some stuff that --
L:  That's real trashy.  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you just can't believe is actually some- -- I guess it's just someone else's taste on what they think is comedy.
L:  Right, right, right. [NOISE]
R:  I think where you draw the line is definitely opinion of each person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, yeah sometimes it goes way, way over. [LAUGH]
L:  Right and then you have that option for that [NOISE] so called comedian email to just hit the delete button --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and go on. [LAUGH]
R:  And I think people -- people have -- at least people that I'm friends with have been really good about, um, kinda describing it ahead of time, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "If you were offended by off taste humor, um --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- don't open it".
L:  [NOISE]  Don't read this.  Yeah.
R:  Which -- that's another thing where I think the line should be drawn.  Don't send it to someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even whether they're your friend or whether you know what type of humor they have, don't send it to them, um, without any kind of a warning.
L:  Correct. [NOISE]
R:  I don't think that's very nice.
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  And even -- even some of the, um, cards now that are out, um, I love going to certain stores to get real fun, fun cards --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, they even have certain sections that are a little off humor, or I mean off, um, color --
L:  Off color.
R:  -- um, and I guess even I sent my mom to a store not too long ago and there was a brand of cards, they're called Apple cards and she wanted to get one that was a little off color for my uncle and they don't sell them there any more --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- because -- and they weren't dirty, dirty, they were just a little off color and they said they had too many complaints.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And especially because the name was Apple cards, people probably just didn't even think, so --
L:  [NOISE] Well they probably th- they may have associated it with Apple C- Corporation. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yep.  Or something for teachers, you know.  You don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.
R:  But that's another thing whereas -- and the same with the ty- the type of humor I think that -- that when there's kids around that -- that shouldn't be like right in front of where they can be able to get at.
L:  Right. [NOISE] Exactly.  The -- the, um, wha- exploitation of body parts or --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- exactly, you know.  That -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that to me is not considered humor.
R:  No, and especially when it's just in a regular card aisles --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you know and you go to pick it up yourself and, you know, my son's nine and I have him standing there with me looking at cards as well --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and he picks up one and I'm like, "Okay, how am I going to explain that one to him?" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because of course, at certain times I'm thinking certain things are funny, but definitely would not want --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my son to see it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, then he gets a hold of it and I have no idea how to explain it to him.
L:  Right, and then that puts us in a weird position.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.  You know you don't think about comedy being involved in so much, you know, so many different aspects of your life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even the radio.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  The radio stations, you know, they're just --
R:  Yeah, see that's another one.  That's --
L:  -- some of them are just out there on some other planet that I'm not even on.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we have one --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I'm in Ohio and we have one that's um, that's very, very popular.  It's one of the most popular ones around and, um, but their morning show --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- which is, you know, my son lis- my husband likes them.  He likes the songs, it's pop music and he listens to it when he's taking the kids to school --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and I'll be going to work and he'll say, "Oh, did you hear that this morning?" and I'm like, "You had that on when the kids where in the car?" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it gets, I mean, it gets f- I mean, even like when they're not trying to be mean, they had -- they made up a song about when the Buckeyes won the whole, um, college thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they were -- they were thrilled with our coach and they were signing a song about him and they were saying things in there I couldn't believe they were saying.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah and it just blew me away there, so --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah and sometimes they have, um, contests that they think are just so wonderful --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, who c- who can, um, [MN] [NOISE] --
R:  Pull off the weirdest, sickest stunt. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Or pull off the most dirt on someone --
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]  Or when they have the people call in and -- and, um, ah, talk about things that they've done --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that are really bad, or even people that are calling in to admit, you know, want to get something off their chest and the DJs are -- are making fun of that --
L:  Are making fun.  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.  And they're -- and they're trying to get the weirdest thing for someone to call in and they don't realize that it's supposed to be, um --
L:  Yeah that's personal --
R:  -- funny.
L:  -- for someone else --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- but they're --
R:  Well, I think it's the same thing on, um, talk shows on -- on the TV.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Like Springer and stuff like that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I'll -- I'll turn it on and, you know, the audience is thinking that this -- this --
L:  -- this is [inaudible] --
R:  -- couple's life is funny and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they might be going on not knowing what they're going on for.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  They might be going on because they're getting paid to go on and make light of their life.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's -- that's a little too much --
L:  Yes, and --
R:  -- being on just regular daytime -- because it used to be Morrie Povich[?].  His was pretty decent in the beginning and he's -- his is turning into almost like Springer.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I -- no I haven't watched him.
R:  I was home a couple of days while my kids were sick and I turned it on and he has people on there going on and trying to find, you know, they have five different kids with five different fathers and trying to find --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- the paternity test and make -- and making fun of it and laughing about it and the audience is getting into it and everything and I'm sitting there like --
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] --
R:  "These poor people" and calling them on there and the -- the -- the hosts know all about it.  Calling them on to the show and telling them it's something completely different --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and it's totally for the amusement of other people.
L:  Right, you know [NOISE] that is --
R:  That's -- that's why I don't think it's very humorous.
L:  That's sick humor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like, I really enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos --
L:  Right.
R:  -- watching that with my kids and even as an adult --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it's usually things people have done accidentally --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but it's not, you know, intentionally hurting anybody, or --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  It's just something that you happen to be able to catch --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on video while you were filming an actual event --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or the one that's on Animal Planet with the animals --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's just as good.
L:  -- you know, with the cats that are jumping up and down --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- ah, doing whatever they're doing, that -- that is fun, family humor --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- comedy, whatever. [COUGH]
R:  Right and even if you don't have a family, it doesn't have to be, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, some people enjoy off color humor and don't get into the family humor but I -- I think that it -- it te- --
