R:  Hello? [NOISE]
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name's Kathy. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Lori.
R:  Hi, Lori.  This is my first call.
L:  Yeah, it's mine too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so I don't know quite how we're supposed to do this.  So, they said we're supposed to talk about how we draw the line between bad taste comedy and -- and, ah, comedy that's funny?
L:  Acceptable, yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm afraid I draw it very far to the bad taste area. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, well, I'm not sure either.  Um, I guess I would draw the line, um, you know, when it comes to, I guess the appoint- -- to the point of being offensive.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I guess, you know, either to myself or, um, you know, anybody -- even anybody that I know, I guess, you know, that I wouldn't think it was funny any longer.
R:  Yeah.  I guess to me it depends on if I'm -- if there's a person around that's going to get offended --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because there's some jokes that are really very, very tasteless and I would never say them around anybody else but my husband and I might say them to each other and laugh and just kind of be like, "Okay, don't tell anybody I said that" --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, and laugh about it and we have some pretty -- some very tasteless -- tasteless things we think are funny but I would not, um, anything that was, ah, that was, um, [MN] you know, tasteless and was also going to maybe hurt somebody's feelings and at the same time there was someone around who could potentially hear it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I guess it -- it definitely depends on, um, you know, the situation and -- and where you're at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that is -- that is true.
R:  Yeah, because if it's, I mean, like if it's just us and there's nobody around but us, then and we make a joke at someone else's expense or whatever, I mean, there's nobody -- in my opinion there's nobody to be offended by it so I don't really count it as -- as being -- some of it -- some of the same jokes that would be in poor taste if, um, like someone said them at work --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or if someone said them at, ah, you know, in a mixed group or -- or with strangers or whatever, are jokes that I might actually have thought were funny if it was just us just kinda [NOISE] laughing at home, so ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, I guess that's where I would draw the line but like I said, I'm kind of -- I'm kind of tasteless.  We like -- like, I don't know, we like Monty Python stuff and we like, er, [MN] ah, what else do we like?  What else do we like?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, comedy is --
R:  The pressure of performing.
L:  -- is not a big thing with [LAUGH] -- with me.
R:  Yeah, it is with us really.  I mean we -- we -- we seek out humor but it just -- I think it's -- it's, this, um, on the spot -- on the spot kind of, ah, performance anxiety trying to think of -- trying to think of things.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, there's a comedian, I don't know if you've heard of him, named Carlos Moncia[?]?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, and a lot of people think that he's just awful and we think he's hilarious -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, we've gone to go see him a couple of times and -- and, ah, and we'll go see him intentionally and he's -- and he is, ah, really kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] he's really kind of -- a lot of his stuff is kinda tasteless and -- and, ah, you might think even, ah, you know, inappropriate if anybody in the audience was not Hispanic and I -- I'm not, but my husband is but I can see the humor in it anyway --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, it's like I take it in the -- the -- the venue that it's intended to be, like if you watch, um, like I guess[?] if you watch some of the black comic- comics on, ah, like the black networks and, ah, the jokes that they're making are really at the expense of -- of white people and I'll still laugh because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, the joke is funny but I'm not, ah, you know, I'm offended, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then there's other things that are, you know, that are offensive.  You know, if someone makes a -- a joke about somebody that's a, ah, a r- ethnic or racial group or whatever that's in my family or my friends or whatever, and they make it and you think that perhaps they believe it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know that's --
L:  Well that's true, because I used to work in a -- a male dominant, um --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- career field and, you know, so obviously I heard, you know, a lot of jokes that were, um, you know, I guess maybe derogatory towards females --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I wasn't really offended by it because, you know, I figured, you know, I chose to be in that career field and, you know, I wasn't gonna expect everybody around me, you know, to conform, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just to make me more comfortable or, you know, make me happy and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was my choice kind of a thing so, um, you know, if it was directed at me, yes, maybe I would have found it offensive but you know --
R:  Yeah, see I'm kinda different on that because if I was in a group of women and they were telling women jokes, dumb blonde jokes or whatever, I would probably be more likely to think it was funny than if I was in a group of men that were doing it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, even if it was my work and -- and, ah, and there's -- so there's -- there's jokes that -- that people can make that from, depends on who it comes from, like for instance, I just went back to work in December after having a baby and I'm pumping milk at --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at -- at work, and my boss who I don't like, who doesn't like me, made a comment one day about they left the, ah, coffee creamer out and it had spoilt and she was like, "Well, you know, if we need to get milk we know where to get it.  We can just go get some from Kathy" and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- depending on who said that, I might have either think -- thought it was just kind of dumb but innocuous or I might have thought it was, you know, slightly funny --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but coming from my boss who I know doesn't like me very much and who I know was very unhappy with me even having a baby, she told me I wasn't, ah, sufficiently dedicated to my job, um, [LIPSMACK] that I knew coming from her that it was not meant very lighthearted at all and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it -- I didn't -- I didn't feel like a joke to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know it made me mad, but you know, the same, ah, the same joke from somebody else might, you know, I just might have just taken it like, "Oh, yeah.  Ha ha", you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But then of course there's lots of, ah, -- there's lots of humor that, ah -- that we, um, you know, look at and listen to like I said, that's kind of -- that's kind of tacky and, ah, I'm not sure we'd want to share it outside of, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- outside of our house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we're trying to decide with our daughter, you know, we don't -- we- -- definitely there's some jokes that we've told each other since she's been born that's been like, you know, as soon as she starts to get old enough to -- to --
L:  Comprehend.
R:  -- have some clue --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is going to be a lot faster than we think it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, we -- we're going to have to stop doing that because we don't want her to, um, to pick it up and think it's funny when she's too little to -- to make that distinction of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so -- so, anyway, this is a -- an interesting little project. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is all right. [LAUGH] You know, it's hard to talk on one topic [NOISE] for a continuous ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.  The thing that I read said we're supposed to talk about it for sure for eight of our ten minutes so that's good.  So, we at least get a two minute, ah, interjecting other comments kind of a thing in there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  So, how did you find out about it?
L:  Um, o- on, ah, is it Money and Shopping?
R:  Oh.
L:  Through the internet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I found out about it because I'm on an online forum and one of the -- one of my friends on the forum posted a link and said, "Ooh, this is what we had talked about.  Linguistic differences about how [inaudible] from all over the world about, you know, how do you pronounce this, how do you pronounce that other times" and so she posted it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and so, I came on it and, ah, and yeah, so that's another thing is -- is that we get -- we get real, um -- we get -- we get real silly on that -- on that online forum sometimes and we make jokes and -- and, ah, we try not to make any jokes that -- that would be, you know, derogatory to any group so we generally don't, but we might get real silly that if somebody just happened to come across us and read, you know, se- a sequence of posts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, there might be someone thinking, "What is the matter with these people?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, that's not funny.  You know, we have a couple of threads where we pick on groups not, um, like ethnic groups but like, oh we've got a thread about, um, about brides that are just over the top.  You know, bridezilla type --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and we'll say, you know, horrible things about somebody who's bridezilling this, or we've got another thread about baby names that -- and we'll -- you know people will post names from their -- their, er, newspaper, you know, and, er, talk and we'll say, "Oh, my God", you know, "How can they name a kid that?", and we'll make up -- make jokes with the -- with the names --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but if someone we knew were to ever say, "This is what I'm naming my baby", I mean, we would never go, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- make the same kind of joke so, I guess with -- with drawing the line I guess it has to be, ah, it's so -- so circumstantial and -- [NOISE]
L:  It is.
R:  -- case by case that but, you know, you never can tell, you know, and then sometimes its just, um, it depends on my mood too, because sometimes things just strike me as much for funny depending on what mood I'm in, or much less funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, "Ooh, that's offensive".
L:  Yeah, if you're in a bad mood, not much at all is funny.
R:  Right.  "It's all offensive.  Don't make jokes at me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "How dare you.  How dare you criticize bridezillas, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- they might -- they have feelings too".
L:  "Don't even talk [LAUGH] right now".
R:  Yeah, so, but, ah, but anyway ...
L:  Well, some topics are definitely gonna be easier than others and this one was a bit tough for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was kinda tough.  I -- one of my friends that -- that, um, logged on yesterday her topic was terrorism and she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very, um, on the liberal side and the person that she was talking to was very on the -- the right wing Republican side --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she said it was very interesting because she had to sit there talking to a complete stranger, like we're doing, and be very calm and not let the fact that the things that this person was saying really pu- push her buttons and ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have a rational conversation for ten minutes with a stranger on a topic that was very, um, controversial so, at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least -- at least our first one started out kind of less, ah ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- less controversial.
L:  Ah, yeah --
R:  So, are they sup- do they supposed to like buzz us or something at ten minutes or --
L:  No, I don't -- I'm sure it will prob- it will probably let us know ...
R:  That's good.
L:  -- when the end of the ten minutes is over.
R:  Because I have no idea.  I didn't look at the clock when the phone rang so --
L:  I didn't either.  I was downstairs getting ready to set up a car track with my boys. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, where do you live?
L:  I'm in Colorado Springs.
R:  Oh, okay.  My sister in law lives nearby there.
L:  Oh, does she?
R:  Yeah.  We're in Austin.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, so, it's kinda -- I guess they're trying to see about how our -- our different pronunciations and linguistical ... linguistic type stuff, this is a linguistics study so, they're trying real -- not to make sure that I didn't, ah, talk in a way different than I normally would -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, mess up their -- mess up their report, because I started picking up other accents or something, I don't know.
L:  Well, it's -- it's weird because I lived in Oklahoma for ten years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, and people always asked me, you know, where I'm from.
R:  Y- --
