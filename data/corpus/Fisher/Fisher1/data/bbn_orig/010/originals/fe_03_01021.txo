L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Freda.
L:  Mine's Alma and I live in Middletown, New Jersey.
R:  I live in Spokan[?], Washington.
L:  Oh, we've certainly go different perspectives.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes, we're a whole continent apart.
L:  [LAUGH]  Ah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, our topic today is terrorism.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, you're a little bit closer to, ah, some major catastrophes than I am.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, we have to think about it and deal with it here.  Ah, we see it everywhere, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, with the -- the repercussions of terrorism.
L:  Right.
R:  We, um, our courthouse has barricades around it so you can't drive close to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Security at the airport is unbelievable, even though it has let up a little bit, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lately, but it's -- it's, um, pretty bad.
L:  Well, our town alone lost thirty eight people in the -- in the World Trade Center.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yes --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- we were probably most hard hit of any of the towns.  We're right across the bay from New York, so we have many -- many commuters from this area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I -- I -- I gather the topic was, "Would people remain calm in --in the event of a terrorist attack?"
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  That is the topic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --[LAUGH]
L:  I -- we- I -- I think to some extent, many people -- many people did.  They tried to help other people escape -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they, you know, they seemed to -- to keep their wits about them [LAUGH] as much as anyone given a, you know --
R:  In a si- --
L:  -- totally horrendous situation.
R:  From this area, I have seen the complete extremes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, Spokan is a city um, if you count, you know, the -- the surrounding areas, you know the little --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- it's a city of -- oh, about a million, just maybe a little over --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and we have, ah, Fairchild Airforce base here, which is the fifth largest base in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the United States.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that is concern, even though they have deployed just about everybody from Fairchild.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we have um, Macquire --[LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  --and, ah, Earl[?] Naval Weapons station and yes, we have our share of military establishment also, so ...[LAUGH]
R:  As far as what -- I don't feel threatened by terrorism --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I talk -- I've talked to some people who have, um, protected their houses.  I -- I've talked to some people who have set up one safe room --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in their house so in case there is a terroristic, you know, um, attack, that um --
L:  Mhm.  Have you brought your duct tape?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they have -- in fact I know one couple who have one room completely set up and complete so they could live in it for weeks.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And -- and it's secure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything -- they -- they are thinking it would be safe, you know, for any kind of, um airborne --
L:  Yeah.  Have -- have you taken any precautions?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have not.  My only thought has been if -- if something happens up at Fairchild --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the Airforce base, which is fifteen miles from my house --
L:  Yeah, uhuh.
R:  -- my f- -- my family all live up by the Canadian border in Idaho, which is a hundred miles away --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- so if we had trouble with our water or anything, I would go up there.  That's the only plan I have in my head.
L:  Uhuh.
R:  Um, I -- I -- from watching what I see in the stores --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think some people have -- went overboard for fear of terrorism.
L:  Well, I think people went through it, ah, when it turned two thousand, also.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  This is --
L:  -- so, they knew the drill.  [LAUGH]  You know, you get your water and your can opener and your --and your soup.
R:  Mhm.  I didn't do anything about that either -- I didn't -- and--
L:  Is that because -- I don't -- are you really fatalistic about it, or you just feel that you could deal with it if it -- if it happened?
R:  I would deal with it.  I'm -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm a person that can pretty well handle anything at the time.  I might fall apart afterwards but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- during the time, I can handle just about anything and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I would be one of the people that would be calm and rational.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I would -- obviously because of our proximity to New York here, we w- -- we were pretty shaken by what happened, ah, on September eleventh.  We happened to be in Pennsylvania at one of the state parks out in the woods and didn't realize what had happened until nearly noon, when we came out and the park offices and everything were closed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, then when we came back here, I looked out across the bay there was just, you know, smoke where the buildings had been and of course my husband and grandchildren [inaudible] has been up to the top of the World Trade Center and I -- I -- I think it kind of did affect, or made us feel much more vulnerable.
R:  I --I think that's what they planned on, the terrorists.
L:  Right.
R:  Because we have always been pretty secure, you know.
L:  Yes, absolutely.
R:  We have been secure.  We, you know we've got --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good armed forces, we've good security systems, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everywhere from the top of the line all the way down to the little towns and whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they've protected us well, and -- and we here, other than of course back in, you know, before when they were all the states and stuff, we've never been invaded.
L:  Right.
R:  We--we have never been invaded.  We have -- we have never -- we've had the locals who have done horrible things like the Federal Building --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but we've never had to live in fear before.
L:  Yeah, and we can't -- we kinda can't get away from it because it's like every -- every town here has at least one memorial, a memorial garden, so it's like everywhere you go you're -- you're reminded of it, and then of course, you know, for months and months after the attacks, there were obituaries in our local paper for the Trade Center victims --
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
L:   -- so, that, ah -- I -- I -- I think that I feel -- I don't know if I'd be [LAUGH], I'll probably be less calm if something happened now that I would have been before that.
R:  Because --
L:  But if --but if --
R:  -- because now we can know what can happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we never thought of it before.
L:  Right, but about the only precautions we're taking is I -- I did put together a -- a small emergency kit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with, um, you know, the usual flashlight and some -- some -- some money for phone calls [LAUGH] and some clean underwear --
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh yeah.  The necessaries, yes.
L:  -- but, I figure well that's also useful in the event of a, you know, a hurricane or whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's the --
L:  The most peculiar thing we've been through is when we had lived in Pennsylvania before we moved here, and we had a four point six earthquake.  We were about a mile from the epicenter, so that kind of shook us also.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really.  Ooh.
L:  It's just, ah, when the unexpected happens like that -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  We -- where we are here, we're kind of immune to those kind of things, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we've had minor earthquakes, like two point six I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like three years ago, we had one, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but where we are, we don't have hurricanes, we don't have tornadoes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, we don't have extreme weather --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I've lived here in Spokan for fourteen years, and the weather has never got -- I think one time it got eleven below, but the rest of the time it's been above zero --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so we don't have the extreme cold, we don't have the extreme heat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, -- there is flooding, but not that it affects any place close to where I live.
L:  Right.
R:  I live within the city limits --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so, um, I'm -- I guess I take things pretty much for granted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and when I went down to the courthouse, oh, two weeks ago, I felt a little funny about my purse had to go through, you know --
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the scanner, then I had to go through and -- and there was something that must have -- two pens laying together or something in my purse and --
L:  Ooh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so they pulled my purse and asked me to step aside --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I was like, "It's just a courthouse", you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Well, before -- before we had moved here I had worked for a judge in -- in a courthouse in Pennsylvania and you -- you do get death threats.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you do get bomb threats, and somehow there I was much more able to take it in stride.  It was just kind of, you know, part of the job --  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a way, and I -- I -- I didn't ever really let it get to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although once I remember a court administrator walking in and saying, "We --we have bomb threat, would you look around the office", and I'm thinking, "I could look in the file cabinet under E for explosive or B for bomb or what".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  But that somehow I, ah, I guess now I just feel more vulnerable than I did then.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think the one --
L:  But, I will have clean underwear.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  [LAUGH]  The one thing that bothers me is the people we are dealing with now, have no respect for human life.
L:  Yes.
R:  That bothers me.  Um, if we go back to the Trade Center and those people piloting those planes, that took over the planes, knew they were going to die --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and --
