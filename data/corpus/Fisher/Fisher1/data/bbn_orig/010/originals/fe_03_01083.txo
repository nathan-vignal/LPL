R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Trisha.
L:  My name is Kelly.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Ah, um, and what was the topic again I couldn't h- --
L:  The topic is perjury.  Would you ever, um, perjure yourself for a friend?
R:  Um, I don't think I would just out of fear of getting caught [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I myself, I wouldn't do it, um, not just for fear of getting caught, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I also just ethically I just don't -- I don't think it's right --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, that's a -- a good reason, too, but, um, I'm, ah, I am one of those people who [NOISE], um, follows -- follows the rules, I guess, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't like taking chances and, um, being a -- a family person, I would never put my family at danger for somebody else, so --
L:  No, I wouldn't either, I -- I totally agree with you.  I, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I can't think of any circumstances that, um, that would call for perjuring yourself --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L: -- e- even if it was a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, close friend or family member, um, like you said, putting -- putting your family or anyone else at -- at risk, I -- I don't think it's worth it.
R:  No, I don't either.  Um, and, let's see, I also was brought up in a -- in a very moral family --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and a- have a strong religious background and, um, you -- you just, you know, you have rules that you follow and I just -- I don't enjoy breaking 'em and if I feel guilty about something then, ah, or I don't like feeling guilty about something, it just makes my -- my insides feel all uptight and [LAUGH]  --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I just can't handle that feeling --
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  So.
L:  -- I think it comes down to, um, if you're going to perjure yourself, I think it's the type of person, like, you're talking about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how -- how you were brought up.  I mean, I think, you know, if you're a basically an honest person, you know the difference between w- -- right and wrong --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that that's -- it's not even going to come into play, that's not something that you would even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put yourself in that sort of situation, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, a lot, I g- -- I think has to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with your own upbringing and values --
R:  Right.
L:  -- y- -- you know, as -- as growing up, I too myself, you know, my parents put a lot of, um, good values and always instilled in me, you know, to always be honest and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know treat people with respect and I -- I just -- I guess I -- I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just could never do that.  So --
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's -- that's how I feel, too.  Um, and I just -- I've been in situations I guess where my like family members and stuff have tried, ah, I guess not really, I don't know, they've just tried lying to get out of situations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it always comes back on 'em --
L:  It -- it does.
R:  -- and, um, so I just -- I don't see the point [LAUGH] in it [LAUGH].
L:  No.
R:  It's --
L:  I -- I think even if, um, you know, at the time if someone doesn't find out I think eventually in the end, um, s- -- you know someone --
R:  Some -- somebody will.
L:  -- someone will -- someone will know, you know --
R:  Yeah.  And I also have a way of, um, when I have, ah, lied about something like to my parents or whatever, I end up, ah, spilling my guts [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, so putting myself in that position, like I said, now, where I'm a mom and have kids and a husband, um, there's just not -- it doesn't make any sense to me --
L:  No.
R:  -- so --
L:  It -- it doesn't make any sense to me.  I guess maybe some people that, um, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the flip side maybe people that would do it, um, I -- I guess under certain circumstances, you know, maybe people in fearful situations, I'm -- I'm just trying to think of when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe someone would put themselves --
R:  Would do that --
L:  -- at -- at risk and, ah, you know, maybe they -- some sort of case that they were fearful for their life, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, maybe in that sort of circumstance, maybe somebody, you know, um, I'm trying to think and maybe that would be a circumstance, I'm not saying that I agree with it, but that could be a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- reason where -- where someone could, you know, perjure themselves, um, to lie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah, that would be about the only --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- circumstance I would have, too, is if you were, like you said, in fear of maybe your life, or --
L:  Yeah, or --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- someone else close to you, I guess, maybe thinking that, you know, um, I- -- if you didn't agree upon, um, doing as you were told that even if it wasn't for you, maybe there were threats that were going to be put upon your family or friends --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um a- -- and maybe under that, maybe you would feel that you had no -- no other choice, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but to do -- make that decision.
R:  Right.  That's true.  Um, so what do you do for a living?
L:  I'm a manager.
R:  A manager?  Okay.  I'm just a -- a cook at a chevron, I cook fried chicken and stuff [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, but you sound as like, ah, you might have some knowledge or background or something in -- on the subject, I thought maybe you were in the law field or --
L:  No, actually -- my dad actually has, um, his background is in law --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, um, I- -- that's --
R:  Has he ever had anybody, um, I g- -- is he a lawyer or not?
L:  N- -- he used to, um, he used to be FBI --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he, um, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- his background is in law, he has his law degree and, um, so I was -- I guess a lot of my background comes from him, you know, him always -- my dad's a very honest person, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, um, he always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- instilled in me growing up, so --
R:  Right.  Well, that's good.  My, ah, step dad was the one who -- who gave [LAUGH] gave me my morals and turned my mom around, so to speak, I guess and, ah, 'cause when she was single, you know, it's just -- you're raising three kids and you're trying to find somebody to help you do that, so a lot --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of her nights were spent out and about and, ah, so when he came along and they got married, then he just, um, s- -- well I already -- already been a churchgoer and what not, but he reinforced that because my mom wasn't a churchgoer and, ah, made the -- the Bible an avid part of our lives, more so and then with my mom being right there along with me, you know, it -- it was something more that I was interested in doing because I had the support of two parents now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rather than just my two sisters, so, um, that's where -- where I get a lot of my stuff from is from my step dad and I just -- I'm really thankful that he came along [LAUGH] --
L:  I- -- it's --
R:  -- and there's no --
L:  It's funny the impact your -- your family, they have such a huge impact on -- on all your values and your -- your --
R:  Right.
L: -- your thoughts --
R:  Yeah, that's tru- -- that's true.  I -- I can't believe it [LAUGH] personally, but, um, I am glad that he got -- got us all straightened out so to speak and, um, ah -- I can now pass that on to my children and hopefully do just as good a job as he did, but, um, that -- I --  I just -- that's where I -- I get my morals from, I guess [LAUGH] and I don't know why other than the circumstance you mentioned, why people would -- would do something like that --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- like I said, I can't think of, you know, you try and look on the flipside, but I just, you know, I -- I just can't think of any reason because, you know, even you think about with, um, Clinton, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regardless of, you know, what anyone thought of him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, even if you had thought he was a great president, um, just with him lying, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it makes you lose total respect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for -- for someone, you know, regardless of what you think of someone, um, y- -- you just -- once someone lies, it's just like, how can, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you lose respect, you can't trust them --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  That's actually, ah, a good example, right there.  I hadn't even thought of him and that -- I mean, he's like the -- the prime example --
L:  Right --
R:  -- I would say [LAUGH] --
L:  -- you -- you know --
R:  -- of this so --
L:  Someone, especially someone in, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- such power, you know, it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, someone that's supposed to hold a- -- such high esteem and then does that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's, ah, that's kind of taking advantage of your power, I suppose [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I don't -- I -- I don't think he should have -- I don't know, I think he should have been thrown out, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or --
L:  I --
R:  -- resigned or something.  I don't think he should have got to finish his term, so --
L:  Well, I- --it's like the whole thing is, you know, um, it wouldn't been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- such a bad circumstances if he just would have been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- honest about it.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  You know and that's the whole thing, it's like, if you do something, own up to it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, I think that was -- that made it even worse --
R:  Yeah.  That's ah, that definitely didn't help his -- his position, in my eyes anyway [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  No --
R:  He --
L:  You and all other Americans [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  And then, I'm wondering, w- um,
