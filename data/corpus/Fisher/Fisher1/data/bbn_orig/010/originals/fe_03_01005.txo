L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Jana.
R:  My name's Beth.
L:  Hi, Beth.
R:  Hi.  You wanna go ahead?  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- okay, sure.  Um, I guess -- how do I think the people in the nation would --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- react if there was an attack?  Um, you know, since we've already been through that I think they would act somewhat like they did.  It with shock, and sadness, and -- and then anger.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  And, um, I suppose my reaction would be, ah, much the same. [NOISE] I tend to be much more calm than most people, because I have three kids that I need to be calm for, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What would your reaction be?
R:  Ah, well, you know, it kinda depends.  If -- if I was in the area, you know, where the attack took place I'd probably would be more, you know, terrorized --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or more scared, or -- you know, more whatever.  But you know, if it's -- if it's kinda like, you know, this last one, you know, being in New York, well New York is all the way on the other side of the country from where I live --
L:  Yeah, I'm in the center of the country --
R:  -- 'cause I live in New Mexico.
L:  -- so I felt the same way.
R:  I mean, you know, I -- I -- when I heard about it I was on my way to bowling, you know, when they said that the pla- airplane two -- you know, flew into the World Trade Center, and you know, I th- -- at first I thought, well, you know, it's not a terrorist attack, you know, but after everything else happened, you know, it was obvious that it was.
L:  Right.
R:  But I live in a town where there is a refinery... 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we have had people outside the refinery taking pictures of the refinery, and the FBI was called in and, you know, it's -- you know, it could happen here.  You know?
L:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
R:  I mean, it could happen almost anywhere, yeah, but, you know, you know, with the refinery here, and in New Mexico we have Sandia Labs and Los Alamos, and you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of things that could cause a terrorist attack in New Mexico.  And I think if it were happened here, you know, I would be more terrorized than if it happened somewhere else.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I'm in Colorado near NORAD, near where --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- they Hayman fire was, so that was our first thought as well.  It was, you know, what if they hit NORAD?  What are we gonna do?  What are we gonna do?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yeah, it is frightening, and I think we need to be more prepared... than what most people are, and I'm certainly not saying I'm prepared by any means. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not.  I mean, you know, they were talking about putting plastic on your windows and everything like that, and, you know, I mean, I'm not prepared at all, I mean, you know, I don't have water, I don't -- I mean, I have a bunch of canned goods, but, I mean, I don't have water put up and --
L:  No, I don't have any of that either.
R:  I don't, you know -- I mean... but I guess, you know, I guess I'm just not scared of it.  I mean, you know, I -- if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen.  I -- I really don't -- you know, I think our country's doing what they can to prevent it, and you know, be watchful for us, but, you know, um... [SIGH] things can happen even when the country's trying their best not to let it happen.
L:  Right.  And I think people are fearing that should we go to war there will be more terrorist acts here.
R:  Well I think there will be.  I think --
L:  And I'm -- I'm, I'm almost sure there will be.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And um, that's just kind of the way of human nature, you know, of retaliate the best way you personally can.  So I -- 
R:  But like -- 
L:  -- think it will happen.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  Like on the news yesterday I heard that in New Mexico they were trying to pass a law that in the State of New Mexico you didn't have to have a birth certificate or anything showing where you were born and -- to get a driver's licence in the State of New Mexico.
L:  Really?
R:  And they were saying, you know, that's just asking for trouble from terrorists.
L:  Oh absolutely it is.
R:  And you know, it was -- it was kind of like, you know, why... [LAUGH] why are you all talking about this when, you know, we're supposed to be, you know, trying to prevent terrorism and not -- trying not to cause it, [LAUGH] and that --
L:  Or to leave the door open, for sure.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that's basically what it is.  I mean, you know, just leaving the door open, wide open for, you know, somebody to come in and, you know, get a driver's licence in New Mexico and not know where they're from or what, you know, they're doing or -- and -- you know, do whatever.  I mean...
L:  Right.  Well, yeah, and I see that a lot in travel.  My husband travels a ton, and in fact he was on his way to Newark Airport that morning.
R:  Mmm.
L:  And he says there's not really that big of a difference -- as far as he can tell -- other than when he goes through security he always has to take off his belt and his shoes, which that makes sense after some of the other attempts.
R:  Mhm, really.
L:  But you know, those are pretty little.  You know, I know in, in other countries, because we've travelled in other countries, you don't leave a bag sitting anywhere, you don't -- you know, you're arrested if there's a bag sitting and you come back to it, and that kind of thing.  There's just, ah -- I think we need to be a little more vigilant about it if we are in fact afraid that it's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm gonna be taking a plane ride in June, my first plane ride in [LAUGH] years and years and years and years and years.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] and so, you know, it's kinda, you know, nerve- well, I'm going to be flying from Phoenix to Gatlinburg -- well, Knoxville, Tennessee.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which, you know, I mean... to me that's gonna be kinda nerve wracking, because I mean, you don't know what's gonna happen, you don't ever know for sure whether there's somebody on that airplane that's gonna cause trouble, or, you know, whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I thought maybe I'll ride the bus. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I can't do that.
L:  Well, my husband being the traveller that he is, my son is supposed to go to a camping -- camping trip up in Oregon next month, and I'm thinking I need to fly with him, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  My husband keeps saying, well, you know, it's safer now than it was last time we all flew, which was a month after the attacks.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, he said, you -- he'll be fine, don't worry about it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he's twelve.  I'm not gonna be fine. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's, it's probably gonna happen.  I don't see any other way really we can do anything with Iraq other than have a war with them.  I mean, you know, it's -- I think we got to do something with them.
L:  Oh, I agree.  
R:  I mean...
L:  I agree.  I think we've waited around long enough, he obviously wants nothing to do -- he being Hussein -- to do with helping out the situation and realizing that, you know, if I get rid of these and play nice everyone else is gonna play nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's not gonna --
L:  You know.  People like that don't work it out in this world.
R:  No, it's not gonna happen, I mean you know, he's gonna -- he's gonna keep, you know... doing what he's doing, and they probably do have, you know, things that could really cause trouble in the world, I mean, you know, with anthrax or whatever.  I mean, you know...
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Plus bombs, and you know.
L:  Whatever he's got --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in his arsenal. 
R:  And we'll never know what he's got.
L:  No.  I don't think so.  I think he's hidden a lot of it, and terrorized his own people --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- into thinking that they have to hide it.  So...
R:  Yeah, that's probably where it is, all, you know, that's what I heard, you know, that it was in the poor people's neighborhoods and, you know, where we don't think that it would be in. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So.  But I agree, you know, I don't -- and it's not just, you know, people in Iraq either.  I mean, you know, there's terrorists from all over.  Plus there's terrorists in our own country.  There --
L:  Oh yeah, we have our own terrorists to worry about as well.
R:  Yeah, that are from the United States, and, you know, they're -- you never know when they're gonna do something.
L:  Well and it's interesting how a small situation can create such a terrorist type atmosphere.  We had a situation here where a couple of boys stole a car and killed the couple that owned the car, and ended up camping out in my neighborhood after they did this.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And even af- -- nobody even knew they were in the neighborhood until after they'd been arrested and taken away, but you would have thought in my little town neighborhood that these people just [LAUGH] had terrorized the entire neighborhood and they hadn't even really spoken to anyone.  It was by, you know, someone running past them smelling a fire that they were caught.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ah, it did terrorize people, and, and their reactions were panic, get the kids out of here, don't -- you know.
R:  Mhm.  That's what I was saying, you know, if it's close to home people, you know, react differently and, you know, show more panic
