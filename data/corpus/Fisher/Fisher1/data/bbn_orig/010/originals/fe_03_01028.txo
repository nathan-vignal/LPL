L:  Ah, my name is Carlos Minyous[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
L:  Hi, Dawn.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, how do you feel about that?
L:  Ah, I think people would react, ah, [LAUGH] I'd get scared, myself.  That's how I feel, um, with a -- if a, you know, if a terrorist attack did happen here.  That's, ah -- I mean how do you feel?
R:  Um, I don't think -- I think -- I think most people would, um, -- I think most people would panic.  I think it's, um -- I -- I don't think anything can prepare you for, um, no matter how prepared you think you are, I think, you know, most people would find themselves, ah, definitely in a state of panic. [LAUGH]
L:  I agree.  I mean, especially, um, you know, [COUGH] prime example was when we had, um, nine eleven attacks.  Obviously, um, we had never experienced anything li- anything like that and, er, this [inaudible] knowing who -- who, er, would have thought that they would use, um, planes as suicide t- you know, weapons to knock out whole buildings.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well, I mean, I -- I think the biggest thing was especially because it was, you know, on our land.  [LAUGH]  You know, that -- that-- I think that came as more of a shock that, um, I -- I -- I don't think a lot of, you know, Americans, are prepared for the idea that we can be attacked here, on our land.  You know, it's a little bit easier for people to be a little bit more relaxed and, um, sure it's upsetting to see it when it happens, you know, overseas or somewhere else, but when it happens here, you know, in the homeland, I think it's like -- it's definitely a shock, and I don't -- I don't think, you know, if it were to happen again, I -- I -- I don't -- there's no amount of preparedness, you know, we're not a nation that's normally -- yeah, it's not -- it's not a -- just not something that happens here.
L:  Yeah, I mean, you did bring up a good point about [LAUGH] that's true, um, it happening in our own -- in the homeland cause, um, you know, I never expected anything like that to ever happen here where we live at, from ah, another country.  So, you know, that kinda -- kinda woke me up somewhat seeing, um, we're -- we're just as vulnerable as any other country now- er, nowadays.  You know, things have changed from, er, years ago and, er, [COUGH] obviously seeing the things that've been created like the homeland security that we have now and the new, er, federal office that was created especially for that, er, so -- and ah, especially since that -- you know, I work for the Department of Defence, so it just -- I don't know, it -- it -- it kinda scares me.
R:  Well, I don't know, I -- I'll tell you I've -- I spent ten years in military.  My husband's currently serving and I -- I just, you know, I -- I mean I saw and did a lot of things and I -- you know, I know my husband has to a greater extent than I have, but it's just -- I -- I don't know, I think terrorism is something totally different.  It's not like, er, it -- it's just a "Take you off guard" type -- type thing.  It's not i- -- it's just not something anybody can prepare for.
L:  I agree with you there 'cause, um, with terrorists the rules have changed because, um, you don't know who you're dealing with or, er, these people don't care about, um, their life or anybody else.  I -- I mean that's how -- the way I feel.  So, you know, how do you deal with these people because, um, when somebody dies [COUGH] here, you know, it --it's a big, um, you know, we're dev- devastated, but for them, you know, if one of them dies it seems like to me it's no big deal and, ah, so how do you, ah, deal with that?  [COUGH]  That's what -- you know, something that [COUGH] I'm trying to, ah, figure out and just listen to different, ah, what the different military, um, echelon says, and other people, the President, um, what exactly what we're going to be doing about this.
R:  Well, I think you had a good point there, just a second ago, that, you know -- you know, how do you deal with someone that just doesn't, you know, just doesn't care [LAUGH] period.
L:  They had no value for their life --
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  -- or anybody else's life.
L:  -- they, you know, what -- what do they care if we go to war, if we, you know, bomb the hell out of them because, you know, they -- they're, um, you know, that -- that's, you know, it's what they're used to.  I -- I think it almost like an effect of, you know, um, it's kinda, ah, I don't know, to me it's kinda like, um, taunting.  You know, it's, you know, it's like a child, "You -- you can't hurt me", you know, "But I can hurt you", and that's -- I think that's a -- that's a sad, sad issue -- that's --
L:  [LAUGH]  That's true.
R:  -- that's a sick person.
L:  That's true.  Um, the way terrorists -- the terrorists work, it is very difficult to get back at them.  I don't know how you get back at them, um, I don't know if anybody has -- has even answered that question, "How do you get back at a terrorist?" and um, I'm sure there has to be someway you get back at them but, um, myself I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know.  I think we're on the right track now.  I think that, um, I think, er, you know, personally I -- I was never a big fan of Bush, but you know, I think he's taken the right stand now and it's going to be terribly disappointing to me if he turns around and doesn't follow through with his word.  I think I'm gonna be a little upset because, you know, he had a good point when he spoke the other night about terrorism.  You know, Saddam Hussein may not have been directly linked to what happened on September eleventh however he is a terrorist.  He -- he, you know, it just because it didn't directly, you know, -- it has affected us in different ways, but not -- not the way nine eleven did, and no, he wasn't directly responsible, but he had a part in it because of -- of the part that he takes in the world today, you know, and I think we need to take care of that.
L:  Ah, that is true.  The only think I'm kinda disappointed with Bush myself, is it seems like, ah, he's changed his direction, you know, of going after, ah, Bin Laden and all of a sudden he's, ah, foc- focusing a lot more attention on trying to get Saddam, um, Saddam Hussein out of -- out of power.
R:  Well, I think --
L:  I understand him doing that, but, you know, I think we should have taken care of Bin Laden at first and just, um, get rid of him, but it seems like since, er, he got discouraged because, ah, we couldn't find him, or locate him and we were having, er, a hard time getting any, ah, getting close to him.  He was just e- evading us with seems like, ah, with no problem.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, I don't think that's necessarily, I think that, um, I think that they are working on that, but I think that a bigger problem arose with Iraq when Iraq directly -- when Saddam Hussein directly defied, you know, [NOISE] ah, you  know, what he was asked to do and that I -- I don't think, you know, he is the one person that I definitely do not think needs to have, you know, nuclear weapons or [LAUGH] any kind of weapons, you know, of mass destruction.  I mean, the man's a loon.
L:  I agree with you there but --
R:  And, I -- I don't think he gives a damn and, you know, as much -- I mean, as for what Bin Laden did, you know, I -- I don't think --  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean I don't think that's a dead issue in the water, I just think that a -- a bigger priority right now is getting rid of, you know, Hussein's been sitting back and building up you know, and if they don't -- if they don't handle it now, he's gonna build up more and then what happens?  You know --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Bin -- Bin Laden is a -- is a little person and yeah, he has a big effect in what he -- you know in what he did, but I think we've taken out most of, you know, his -- his-- his -- his little force there has been diminished, I think, you know, to a point where finding him is a matter of, you know, days.  I really don't think it's gonna be much longer than that.
L:  Yeah, I hope you're right, and another that has me concerned somewhat is, um, the situation in, ah, North Korea.  All of a sudden these people decide that, um, go ahead and start up their nuclear program again and, um, a couple of times they've already fired missiles into, um, the Sea of Japan and it -- to me, it seems like we're not doing very much about that.  We're just letting it go by and -- and, ah, you know, I heard s- somewhere where we're thinking of pulling our troops out of, um, the DMC zone over there and saying -- because they said that the South Koreans have enough soldiers there to take care of it, but [COUGH] that's another concern that I have with North Korea.  All of a sudden, you know, they see -- [MN] they've taken then where --
R:  Well, in all honestly, I think North Korea's being smart because, I mean, I -- well -- I -- I mean [LAUGH] trust me, I'm not by far condoning what they're doing, but I mean, imagine they're watching our newscasters broadcast the fact that we're sending all these troops to Iraq and, you know, ah, the number of our forces and what we have there, you know, North Korea decides -- you know what, this would be a really a good time to kinda rattle our bones a little bit, you know, and they're right, you know, but what I think everybody underestimates is, as much as our military has been cut back, we still are -- we still are the main force of the world, and if it takes us being in two places at one time, you know, I'm pretty sure we can do it.
L:  Oh yeah.  No, I agree with you one hundred percent there, we are, um, number one world power in -- in the world, ah, but I -- I'm just thinking, you know, we -- we have, um, likes of Bin Laden, Iraq, North Korea now, you know, who might be next to start saying, "Hey, you know, they're letting their guard down now and hell, we're going to start --"
R:  Well, see that's exactly why though I think that we need to be tougher and I think -- I think Bush needs to stand by what he saying, because if he backs off now, if he says, "Okay, we'll give them --"
