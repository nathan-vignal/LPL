R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Laurie. 
L:  Hi, I'm Angela. 
R:  Hi, Angela. 
L:  I've never done this before so bear with me. 
R:  Same on this end. 
L:  Oh, okay wonderful. [LAUGH] Um, gosh, I know I'd panic, but I'm in the mid west so I probably would be one of the last. 
R:  Um, I'm in the south and that's kind of being down near Florida around water and stuff it's -- it's -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  It's a fear. 
L:  Oh, I bet. 
R:  It's a fear, um, especially having military bases around.  I know I would panic. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I -- 
L:  I do live right by army reserves but because I'm in the mid west, I believe that we would be the last for chemical or even suicide bombers.  We don't really have any landmarks or anything that would be a major target, but I panicked with nine eleven and that was hundreds of miles away. 
R:  True. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it's a -- terrorism is a very -- a very scary topic.  Um, I'm prior military.  I spent seven years with the military. 
L:  Oh my.
R:  And terrorism is one of the things that they teach you to be on the lookout for, especially whenever you are stationed in other countries.
L:  Did you ever run across anything, anywhere you were -- 
R:  Me myself, no, [LAUGH] thank goodness, I never did. 
L:  Yeah, luck of the draw. 
R:  Um, they teach you to -- to really be aware because how they will -- how terrorists will make you a target and for lack of better words, butter you up to get information. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure. 
R:  So whenever you look at -- and whenever I look at terrorism here in the United States, I have a different viewpoint than what you have because of the things that I was taught in the military. 
L:  Right, yeah, I'm sure. 
R:  To me, some place is not going to be obvious, it's going to be one of the main places that they hit. 
L:  So I'm one of the [LAUGH] -- I need to worry a little more after all. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, please don't take things that way, I hope that's not what -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's just my line of thinking.
L:  Did they teach you how to deal with people like us who -- who are just shocked and devastated when we do end up with a suicide bomber and -- and you guys are sent for the aftermath?
R:  Um, suicide bombers at that point in time, whenever I was in the military, was not one of the things that we really worried about.  We were worried more about espionage.  Um, I got out of the military shortly after Desert Storm occurred. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  So this is, you know -- this type of suicide bombing thing is something that I'm not familiar with. 
L:  And don't fairly want to be. [LAUGH]
R:  No, because if you read about other countries and the way that they treat their own people, it's a very scary thing. 
L:  And it -- it seems to me that it almost seems like old hat to them when there's a bus bombed. 
R:  Right.  I mean, we're talking about people who line people up in their own streets and shoot 'em just for having a different of opinion. 
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and yet they still have such a devotion to their own country that they're going to volunteer to go to someone [NOISE] else's country and strap on a bomb knowing they're not coming back.
L:  Now, that I definitely don't understand.  You know, I ki- kind of understand the people still rooting for their own country even after their head man does things such as line people up on the streets and -- and what not because they're stuck there. 
R:  True. 
L:  You know, they have to eat and they -- and water, and from what I understand those are things that are used as bargaining tools but, yeah, the suicide bombers and other terrorist attacks, I -- I can't -- I can't understand that at all.
R:  And -- and I don't know, I mean, I guess in order for me to understand that, I would have to actually live there and I'm still grateful I don't. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  To be able to understand because it seems like there's a lot of mind control.
L:  Pardon me, sorry?
R:  A lot of mind control involved in that type of situation.
L:  There -- there -- there must be or knowledge -- ah, I don't -- I mean, about the other countries and how to get out. 
R:  And it would have to be something that's instilled in these people from toddler age. 
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  I mean, because they have such a devotion to it that they have to believe, you know, and I talk to -- to other people and stuff and they want to blame it on a certain type of religion.  Well, I disagree with the religion portion of it because here in the United States we have all denominations, all beliefs and all backgrounds from religion. 
L:  And no suicide bombers.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, you have your nut cases every now and then. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  I mean, look at, you know --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Um, what was the one guy, Jones, who convinced everybody to take the poison and put themselves to sleep?
L:  Right, right.
R:  And David Koresh. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  In Texas. I mean -- 
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- you have these episodes like in Columbine every now and then but nothing where anyone has been willing to go to another country and sacrifice themselves in order to com- commit mass murder. 
L:  I have never heard of an American citizen committing a terrorist attack.  I -- if anyone from our country, whether they were born in another country and brought to this country or were born in this country period, I've never heard of an American citizen committing a terrorist act. 
R:  I haven't either, and as much as other incidents where Americans go and get into trouble in other countries is broadcast, I think that would be one of the main things that would have definitely hit the news waves. 
L:  You -- you have to wonder the mentality of the people and the morals that -- that they're taught.  I -- I couldn't imagine any thing, any religion, any -- even my president, I couldn't imagine President Bush or any other president in the United States office to convince me or my family to ever commit a terrorist attack. 
R:  Uh-uh.  
L:  And it's scary to think of the power that they have over their citizens and what they teach 'em is morally right and morally wrong.  They must be taught that it's okay.  I -- I can't imagine that, you know, they realize that we have families and feelings and that they're not -- they're not hurting our military by hurting our citizens.  [PAUSE] [LAUGH]  
R:  It's not one of those topics that you can make sense out of --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's for sure. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- 
R:  Um, how to handle it.  That's an even harder topic especially whenever, you know, you're looking at completely innocent people. 
L:  Well, I have to say I do -- I -- I worry.  I can't say that I don't worry that we won't get a terrorist attack.  Just because I'm in the mid west I know that doesn't mean that we -- we won't get a suicide bomber or something to that effect, but, you know, I have to wonder to what extent should I be one of the people getting duct tape and plastic or is that a myth that the news people just tell you to be quiet or -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I haven't done anything that far. 
L:  I have -- I've done nothing, I can honestly say I haven't. 
R:  I -- I -- I don't think the next one will be, if there is another terrorist attack, I don't think that it will be anything that they've done before and that's what makes it so scary. 
L:  Yeah. I -- I -- 
R:  Is because they're not going to be so obvious. 
L:  I truly believe the next one is going to be some sort of chemical or -- and I don't -- I'm very young, I'm only twenty four.  I've never been alive during a huge war.  I was alive during the past wars that you were probably in service, but I wasn't alive for World War One or World War Two and it's eye opening.  I think a lot of a -- the American citizens don't know now to vote for presidents.  I can honestly say that I had no idea.  Before all this happened, I didn't pay any attention to politics.  Never thought about terrorism before nine eleven in my life and now, it's scary. 
R:  Well, I had thought about it but it was always one of those things that was related strictly to military and being elsewhere, never here at home. 
L:  Right.  
R:  And nine eleven brought that to a new -- a new awareness which [PAUSE] considering that my last duty station before I got out in ninety one was up in the area where those events actually took place because I was stationed in Aberdeen. 
L:  Oh my --
