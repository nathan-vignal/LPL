R:  Hi.  Who am I speaking to?
L:  Hi, this is -- my name is Gina.
R:  Gina.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I'm Gladdy[?]
L:  Hi Gladdy.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm from Dayton, Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What city are you from?
R:  Ah, I'm in the Phoenix area.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Arizona.
L:  Oh, that -- this is my first call.
R:  Same here.  
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Mine too.
L:  Oh good, I'm glad it's a woman.  
R:  We can learn this together.  Yeah, I feel the same way.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you think you would panic in a terrorist attack?
L:  I think everybody would panic. 
R:  I -- 
L:  Because I know the last time when we had -- when everybody was buying duct tape and everything for their house.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  I did not personally do that.  I feel pretty safe but I think if they knew it was coming, I think everybody would panic.
R:  If they had an idea where it was going to -- 
L:  Hit.
R:   -- be, you know, it wouldn't be quite so bad, but I didn't personally buy the duct tape either.  I'm thinking what good is that going to do me? 
L:  Exact- like, once I kept listening to it on the news and it's saying it really wouldn't help you in the long run, I'm not one of the persons that panicked before but I think if they said, you know, chemical warfare has started, I think I would panic.
R:  I think I would too because that's something you can't see.  [COUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [COUGH] excuse me.
L:  Oh, that's okay.
R:  I'm recovering from -- or trying to recover from a cold.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, and it's like, you never get colds in Arizona, right?  Wrong.
L:  Right.  That's why everybody goes out there for allergies, right?
R:  Right.  But they've brought so many of the things from back east that we now have all kinds of allergies out here.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Um.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  I forgot those -- second part of that question.
R:  Um, so did I.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  The basic part was do you think most people would panic? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's about the only part of the thing I heard. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, I think -- I mean, I think most of the people will.  I -- see, we live near a -- Wright Patt.  Have you ever heard of Wright Patt Air Force base? [NOISE]
R:  No, I haven't but -- 
L:  We live near there so it's -- I'm on the phone -- go ahead, fix what you need. [NOISE] So we live near a, um, very major air force base where the Wright brothers, you know -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- came up with their flights and stuff.  
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  So we live really near there, so a lot of people here like, um, like the [inaudible] is very near Wright Patt so a lot of people panic.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's an ordinary air force base, wondering if since we're a major air force base, whether we would get hit or not.
R:  Right, I can understand that.  Um, I live close to one that used to be a major air base but they've closed it down now and so it's not so much of a, you know, a detriment I guess you'd call it.
L:  Right.  
R:  It's still, you know, they might not realize that it's a closed down base because there's a lot of activity that goes on there.
L:  That's true.
R:  And that, you know, that's something to think about, plus I'm south of a small airport by about a mile.
L:  Oh, wow, yeah.  Yeah, we're a little further from an airport but I know it has stopped with all this -- um, with the airplanes and stuff like that and I -- I do not feel safe in a plane.  I don't fly.
R:  You know, that's the thing that --
L:  Since all this has gone on 'cause I heard they can put their chemicals in the planes too now.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  So that's made me --
R:  You know, that's something that will --
L:  -- a little -- a little paranoid.
R:  Yeah, I can -- I can guess it would.  I hadn't heard that myself.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I'm still flying.
L:  Oh, you are?  
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  That's good for you.  'Cause, um, I've got -- last time I flew is when I -- my son was born and this is about seven years ago and we actually went to Las Vegas so that's kind of near you.
R:  Uh-uh, right.  Yes, it's about a six hour drive from me, if I drive.
L:  Oh, that would be great.  I wish I lived that close.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, ah, I don't really go to Vegas that often.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  We go to places I prefer to go.
L:  Right.  I mean, that's like I liked it for just the weekend.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  But not like that -- I -- they said Las Vegas was the next one, so --
R:  Um --  
L:  That they were thinking would -- that would have a bioterrorism. 
R:  Well, why would they -- well, I guess maybe because --
L:  Because they think it's a sin city and they're supposed to be --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And these people are supposed to be so religious.
R:  Right.  
L:  Um.
R:  Well --
L:  That's just hearsay, I don't know.
R:  I haven't heard that either because, you know, I guess I kind of tune out some of this stuff because I figure I can't do anything about it anyway.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So there's no sense worrying about it.
L:  Right.  And that's -- I have to two small children and I watch, um-- I watch on the news where, um, they have, um -- where people dug out, you know, like hideaway places and stuff.
R:  Uh-uh.  
L:  And, um, I have got a little anxiety to that point and I'm like, no, what am I doing?  You know, if it's my turn it's my turn, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry.  And, um, so but I -- in the fifties I think they did that.
R:  Yeah, I can remember 'cause I'm back from that era.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I can remember the bomb shelters and everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but my folks never went into that.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, thank God it didn't come to that.
R:  Right.  And I guess they figured the basement was going to have to do and, you know, we never had the problem and we were twenty five miles from an air force base so, I mean, we had that.  In fact, I had moved away from there in -- I was in a city and I couldn't figure out what was -- there was something about the city I kept missing.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I couldn't think what it was and I finally realised that it was the flying of the airplanes, you know, because we'd hear the jets --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And stuff.
L:  We have heard a lot of airplanes flying low right now too.
R:  Right.  Yeah, they --
L:  'Cause we're near the air force base but they were doing a lot of training in our area.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  For war. 
R:  Yes, see the --
L:  That made me nervous.
R:  Yes, that would.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Um, out here, um, well, before they shut down Williams, um, they were doing some of the -- checking some -- testing some of the planes, [NOISE] and one of the planes that I saw before it was ever unveiled was the stealth fighter.  They were flying it.  One morning I was going to work and I saw that -- that stealth fighter.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Stealth plane.  It was kind of neat and I go, "Boy, I haven't seen that one, that's different" and then about -- shortly after, about a week later they showed it on TV.
L:  Oh, wow, that's interesting. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And I was really sorry to see that base close 'cause, you know, it had a lot of, um, um -- employment for the east valley.
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  So -- 
L:  I've heard a lot of people, um, go to Arizona for their [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, we've been wanting to go out west for a long time but my husband won't fly so it would be a driving situation.
R:  Yeah, and that can ta- 
L:  And that's a long haul from Ohio.
R:  Yeah.  Well, in fact, some good friends of mine are from Ohio.
L:  Oh, really, what part?
R:  Um, I'm trying to think.  It seems to me --
L:  Colombo? 
R:  And I'm thinking it's around Dayton.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, um, a little town just outside of Dayton and I can't think of the name of it.
L:  Is it Zenia, Beaver Creek?
R:  No, it starts with a C, I believe.
L:  Canton?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, Cincinnati? 
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's a smaller town than that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But anyway -- 
L:  Oh well.
R:  What time did our call start?
L:  I don't [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't.
L:  Are you getting bored with me?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm not getting bored, I just -- 
L:  I'm just kidding.
R:  No, trying to -- I'm trying to stay on the topic and I keep thinking, you know, I want to go on to something else.
L:  I know.  No, actually they said they were [inaudible] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Like, they would tell us when the ten minutes are up.
R:  All right.  I guess I didn't hear that, I wasn't paying that close of attention.
L:  You know, it's so funny.  I told 'em I couldn't do it because I usually have to be work at five.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And they said -- and the lady called me at home today to make sure I wanted to do it.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah, from two to five and then I just happened to answer the phone and, I mean, I just got registered today.
R:  Oh really? 
L:  Isn't that strange?
R:  Yeah, I got registered, oh, a couple of days ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, well, in fact, I think it was yesterday, maybe the day before they called me on my cell phone.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  And --
L:  They wanted to know if I had a cell phone, I said "No".
R:  Well, in fact I'm talking to you on my cell phone now and I was surprised that this phone rang.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because, um, it was kind of out of service.  I lost my other one.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I know where I lost it, ah, and they're doing a lot of construction and I had to go up there to get the mail and I had to, you know, sneak under a barricade to get to my mailbox and I know --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- when I bent over, that's when I lost the phone.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But of course, they don't -- when I went up there, nobody knew anything.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So I had to cancel it right away because I think there might be a couple of calls to Mexico on it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so, anyway, um, I had a message on my voice mail that they could reach me on my temporary cell phone.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she called me on that the other day and that's why when this one rang, I thought, "Who's calling"?
L:  I know.  Actually, my son answered it and he said, "It's from some university".  I said, "Okay".  He's only five.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  He's like, "It's somebody at the university".  I'm like, "Oh" and then I get on the phone and I heard the recording but it's not bad.  I don't think it's, um --
