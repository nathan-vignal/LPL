R:  Hello, my name is Forest.
L:  Hi, my name is Ellen.
R:  Hi.  Where -- where are you?
L:  I'm in Maryland.
R:  Oh, I'm in Florida [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Well, you -- you've got the, ah, the better weather than we've had up here [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes, definitely.
L:  -- than all this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We've had all that snow this winter, finally today it's, um --
R:  Nice for a change?
L:  Nice.  About sixty eight degrees.  So, we're all like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- everybody's outside [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  Um --
R:  Have you given any thought to ah what kind of business you would open?
L:  Oh, my goodness, well, I really -- I -- I've always been in the IT and the -- the technology area, so I would love to open my own, um, consulting business, um, i.e. to -- to help more small medium sized basically women of ah women [inaudible] with their --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- technology problems, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH] that's interesting.  Um, you don't work for yourself now, then?
L:  No, ah, I'm unfortunately an unemployed IT worker [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's not good!
L:  No, no, um, I have an accounting background and I -- I'm qualified to do income taxes and general accounting and bookkeeping work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that's what I've been doing, ah, actually part time just to --
R:  -- as a side business.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  You do what you have to, yeah --
R:  I know.
L:  And what about you?
R:  Um, I -- I enjoy computers, but I think if I had my choice and money was no opti- -- option I would have to do something with animals, I love animals, like as many as a hundred at one time --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] Right now I have twenty cats and ah three dogs, a pig and eight chickens [LAUGH].
L:  Wow!  That's int- -- um, I'm an animal lover, too, I -- I just -- but I just have two cats [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and -- no, animals are wonderful, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah --
R:  I --
L:  It's a nice thing -- it's a nice thing to ah to look at, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hope you have a loot of room [LAUGH]!
R:  Well, we've only got a little over an acre, around an acre and a quarter, but it -- it's big enough --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for what we have [LAUGH].
L:  That works.  That works [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- menagerie [LAUGH].
R:  What -- what I really would like to do would be have a -- a cattery and raise probably siamese because they're one of my favorite kind.
L:  Ah.  Okay.
R:  Like -- you know, my aunt has her own business and she raises Somalias --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's a -- a -- are you familiar with them?
L:  Oh, sure, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's ah pretty big into cats.  She has probably a hundred cats at her house at any given time [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my god [inaudible] --
R:  -- but, yeah, I w- -- I would really like to do that.  Parting with the kittens would be very hard because the longer I have kittens around me there -- the more attached --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I get to them and I want them to go to the best house, you know --
L:  Of course --
R:  -- best home --
L:  -- yes, yes, I can -- I can see your contract right now.
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I will take them back [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- if you don't take care of them.  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  Well, look, if --
R:  So ...
L:  -- if, ah, you know maybe one day it'll happen.  Um --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- I -- I guess if I have my dream -- my dream -- my truly dream thing it would be to work with horses --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because I'm a horse nut.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I --
R:  [several inaudible words] people in our neighborhood have horses.
L:  A lot of money and, ah, a lot of time, but, ah, if I could, ah I -- if I didn't have to worry about anything else, then, ah [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, if that -- if that was your job that you were going to and you had to get up and muck the stalls you c- -- and you were making money on it you could always have somebody come in --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and do that part --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for you [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I was raising birds and that's why I gave my birds up because I spent forty minutes every day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the morning and forty minutes every day, you know, evening --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- cleaning cages and watering and feeding, it's just -- I got to the point where it wasn't enjoyable, but it --
L:  No, I -- I -- I can imagine, that's a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it became more of a chore --
R:  It wasn't a money maker [LAUGH]
L:  -- than anything else.
R:  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Goodness.  But, now, look, you've got -- you've got quite a -- a [inaudible] any type -- particular breed of cats you have now or just anything?
R:  No, right now I have anything, I have a lot of drop offs and strays and -- and that's another thing I had also given a good deal of consideration, maybe opening some sort of, um, what do you call it, like a --
L:  Rescue.
R:  -- place where they keep throwaways?  Rescue, yeah, a rescue center, there you go [LAUGH] because I pretty much have it already, the three dogs we have, ah, were all dropoffs --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and out of my twenty cats, I have two that were actually my own --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the rest were found in the woods or dumped off on the side of the street --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and just --
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  I'm a --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I'm a soft heart [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's another thing.
R:  Probably not a good one to go into business for myself because I can see me giving -- giving my profits away [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exac- -- or the cats would, ah, you know, be spoiling it with t- -- with toys and, ah, extra --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- additions to the house, I mean, I've seen, ah, at least when I read [inaudible] I've seen people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who have converted their homes and basically --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- one big cattery --
R:  -- you put up the shelves and [LAUGH] they have their own chairs [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, okay --
R:  Yeah.  We serve them.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  Yes, I have a magnet on my ah my refrigerator which says this house is owned by the, ah, the -- the felines of the family --
R:  Uh-huh.  True.
L:  -- and -- and sometimes I do think it's very true.
R:  It is true.
L:  So -- but with the economy the way it is, the, ah, the dream business I think unfortunately will have to wait ah [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  For a while with ah --
R:  That's why this is an interesting topic because if they hadn't said it's money was no object then -- then you took the -- a lot more realistic --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and then I probably would do something with computers because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know I could get the financing for that a lot easier and I could set it up --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and it -- it would be a lot smoother --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a lot more profitable --
L:  Yes, the [several inaudible words]
R:  If I was doing my dream job [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, if would definitely be cats.
L:  I -- it works, yeah, no, I love, ah, I'm a big fan of russian blues and, um --
R:  Mm.  They're pretty.
L:  -- british shorthairs, all the blue cats, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I had a russian blue for about six or seven years and unfortunately she passed due to kidney failure --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, but, ah, she was a sweetheart and one day I will have another one, ah, again in the house but it's, you know, six seven hundred dollars a pop for a kitten [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  A little expensive [LAUGH].
L:  Ah.  God, it's incredible, but, you know.  They're still sweet.  But now I have my two, ah, my two domestics and one is, ah, named foxy and she's a dilute tortoise, so she's a domestic medium hair and then I have panther who's my all back, ah, black boy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, they -- they keep me company and wait for me in the window and [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're my children, so, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] So, would you raise any particular breed of horse if -- if you were to do that for your business?
L:  Well, um, I really -- I -- I love, um, the belgian cross, there's actually two that I love.  The Belgian dr- -- ah, cross, which is like a -- a smaller version of a draft -- draft horse --
R:  Oh, really?  Mm.
L:  They're beautiful.  And actually I rode, um, rode one in my [inaudible] her name was, ah, bagel [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So, they're not as big -- they're not as big as a Clydesdale or like --
L:  No, no.
R:  [inaudible] a Clydesdale?
L:  But, they're -- they're big.  It's like riding a couch [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'd probably feel safe on one of those [LAUGH].
L:  You do.  You -- you -- you know, sometimes when you're nervous riding you kind of shift from side to side with, you know, a horse like that you just kind of stay put [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It's, ah, like -- like riding a sherman tank, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're real sweet and then I love, um, Appaloosas, which are, ah --
R:  Oh, I like them, too.  Yeah.
L:  Beautiful, beautiful, ah --
R:  Yes, they are.
L:  -- ah, horses.  So, you know, one of the two and, ah, ah -- just to -- just to be able to go out and, you know, go in my backyard or -- go ride [LAUGH] --
R:  Right [MN].
L:  -- somewhere.  I -- I live in a -- in a townhouse community so, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- space is not, ah, not all that big right, ah, right here.  But, you know, someday when -- when I've made my first million [LAUGH] --
R:  True [LAUGH].
L:  -- I'll, ah, I'll invest in the, ah, in the hor- -- horse world and, ah, live a dream a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you -- what do you for -- for, ah, survive I -- I should say?
R:  To survive, I'm working right now, I'm working part time, it's -- it's actually full time weekends, but it's -- feels part time because I'm off all week, I'm working with disabled adults --
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  -- at the -- yeah, I'm a live in ah caretaker.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, I give you credit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a --
R:  Oh, it's -- its' fun.  It is.
L:  It's a challenging job.
R:  It -- it can be.  It can be.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But very rewarding.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, sure.  How -- how long have you been doing that?
R:  I've, ah, only been doing it, um, actually doing the inhouse work for a- -- a little over a year now.  Before that I was the office manager --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I just got burned out in office work [LAUGH]
L:  Well [inaudible].
R:  So, but I -- I enjoy this a lot more.
L:  I'm sure.  I'm sure it's probably the -- the interaction it's better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  So you would have to be -- pleased to get out from being in an office all the time [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is a -- which is not fun.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of like getting paid for playing house [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I understand that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can.  That's, ah, oh, god, I'm actually driving the beltway, here, um, I -- I --
R:  Are you?  Ooh.
L:  I -- I sing with a, ah, a Sweet Adelines[?] chorus --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, similar to barbershop and I'm heading right now to a, ah, I -- a choreography rehearsal [LAUGH].
R:  Oh dear [LAUGH] that can be dangerous on the phone --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- while you're driving [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well, luckily I do a hands-free, ah --
R:  Oh, do you?  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  So, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know down here in Florida I -- I believe they passed the law saying that you can get arrested [LAUGH]
