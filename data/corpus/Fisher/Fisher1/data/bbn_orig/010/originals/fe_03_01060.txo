L:  Hi, I'm Lee.
R:  Hi, I'm Jeanie.
L:  Hi -- I'm sorry, what was it?
R:  Jeanie.
L:  Jeanie?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi, Jeanie.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, um, I -- I --
R:  I don't know where to start, um, go ahead.
L:  Well, where do I draw the line?  Um, first of all, if -- if humor, um, is offensive, like hurting someone's feelings, um, I definitely draw the line there, you know, if it's attacking someone.  We -- we, um, do kid each other in our home, but if it gets [SIGH] too bad, then [LAUGH] -- then, you know, we draw the line, "Hey, that's, you know, that was a low blow", but a lot of times I -- i- it's fun, you know, because you, um, maybe bring out, ah -- er -- the, you know, my kids are always teasing me, I'm forty seven, so of course I'm ancient to my, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] You're not that ancient.
L:  -- to my -- to my kids in all their twenties and they're always reminding me --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm -- I'm ancient and, er, and that's okay.  I can laugh about that.  I'd rather -- it's good to laugh.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's better to laugh than --
L:  It is.
R:  -- than to feel sorry for yourself --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- in order to agree.  You know, don't agree, just --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- you know, it's -- and -- and I think -- I think humor right now has just really gotten a little bit weird to me, because it's -- it's -- it's a lot, I mean, different to when I was younger.  I'm like thirty six --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm thirty seven right now and -- and it me it's like kids find the weirdest things funnier now that I -- things that I -- I would think offensive now, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but of course then I think, well, maybe when I was that age, I thought the same thing, so --
L:  Mm
R:  I didn't -- didn't really think about it, but --
L:  Mm, I think -- I think that the media has a lot to do with that.  I mean, I look at, um, at- [SIGH] -- at some of those shows that kids watch --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and the humor on that is, um, awful.  You know, even, [SIGH] I don't know, my children were never allowed to watch MTV, but I -- I think that, you know, I've seen excerpts from it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- it's degrading --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- I mean, you know --
R:  Well, you can look at what -- what's on TV nowadays.  I mean, Joe Millionaire or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or marry -- America's marrying you off to somebody, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's like kinda lo- [NOISE] value of -- of [inaudible] so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's kinda -- it's -- to me, it's like it's putting off the wrong message of --
L:  It is and i- -- it's degrading to --
R:  To anybody.
L:  -- humanity.  It's degrading to humans --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- as individuals.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I agree.  I agree, I mean --
R:  I agree and I -- and sometimes I feel like I'm just old to, you know, I shouldn't laugh as much as I should or I shou- -- I should laugh more with what they're doing, but, ah, some things I just -- I take a little offence of it -- some things, you know, like if it's -- you know, I have a friend just jokingly the other day said, "Well, I broke into somebody's house --"a friend of ours house "-- because I needed a ladder, so I broke their window" and he was kidding, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I was -- I was thinking, being so gullible I believed him and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, you've broken -- you'd better call her before she gets home so she doesn't think someone's broke into her house" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- and he's, "I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I did not break her window".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was like -- I was like -- well, I was afraid -- I was about ready to have it out. --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I was like, "Oh, my God, how dare you?"  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  I mean -- because I know a- a- and -- and I live in an area where you do that too, you know, you go over to your neighbors house it's okay, you go into their garage and you might borrow something --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and -- and it's okay.  I live in an area where we can do that, but I would have taken that seriously also.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would've too, and my husbands like, "Jeanie, you're just so gullible" you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, "Only you would believe that".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I agree, I agree, and -- and -- but you look at, you know, some of the humor that comes on email and I've really been [inaudible] of like, where do I send, like, certain humor to some individuals on my email list --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and other humor to other individuals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and -- and there're definitely --
R:  Well-- 
L:  -- some that my -- I have a single girlfriend who has a lot of male bashing humor, so she's -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she's a little bit of right now, and [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, then do you send those blonde jokes to your blonde friends?  I don't know, so --
L:  Right, right.  Blonde jokes to your -- right, right, and you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too, um, I- you know, I'm -- I'm a real devout Christian and so, you know, do I send my, um, some of the jokes that, you know, maybe are, I don't know, about letting gas or something, yeah --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I send some of those to my Christian friends.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, because we all do that and --
R:  What --
L:  -- some of the jokes that come through --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, are -- well some of them I just delete them, but most of the time, because they're my friends, you know, they -- they have the same kind of values --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- the same that I do and ah --
R:  And that's hard to find, someone with -- with good values these days and it's kinda like at Christmas time, I had this huge list of Christmas cards people I do, but I had two different sets of Christmas cards.  Those that are more geared toward the holiday season --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and those that are totally religious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is basically the holiday season too, but -- but, yeah, I have my religious cards and I have my Santa and elves and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and it's like it's certain people get certain cards --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, you know I knew that -- that they may all end up with the true meaning but it -- it's just fun, you know, it's just the way their -- their whole characters are I guess.
L:  Right and do -- do we -- do we allow people to, I guess, when it comes to comedy --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- do we -- do we share the same comedy with everyone?  Do we --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't know.  My kids have told me from college -- they said, "Mom, you don't wanna see some of the email jokes that come through".
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They go, "You would be -- mom, we -- we just won't even tell you". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some of the jokes that come through from, you know, just like -- you know how email is.  It gets passed from one person to another --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- and on and on --
R:  -- definitely and then eventually, you know, they all comment on it and it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just -- gets a little weirder every ti- the mo- --
L:  It does.
R:  -- further it goes.
L:  It does.  I still think comedy is s-, you know, I -- I, um, drive a school bus and I -- I -- I watch some of the boys and, you know, they're -- they st- -- they st- -- they still sort of use some of the same things are funny.  Irritating girls --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- now, they think that is just the best thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, um, farting, I mean they just think --
R:  Oh, yeah or --
L:  -- that a good fart about is, er, the next best thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  And they -- and they take pride in it, they really do.
L:  [LAUGH] They do.
R:  They -- they, you know, I'm thinking, okay, were these guys taught this as children from their parents, you know, because my husband unfortunately still does that, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah they do.
R:  -- [inaudible], you know, and he goes -- and I have a two year old and a -- and an n- eight year old and when my two year old son does that too, he just has a big grin on his face, you know, like and dad of course is so proud, so --
L:  Of course.  "He's following in my footsteps",
R:  Um, and I -- of course if --if the grandparents were here, or not my parents of course because they're the same as me, they -- they would laugh, but, you know, if his parents were here, they would like, "Oh, I can't believe you're laughing at such a thing", you know --
L:  Really.
R:  -- you've got to say, "Excuse me" and it's like, "Oh".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But boys are boys --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I think, you know, the -- the humor and the comedy that they have --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- um, you know, they're still the -- the s- -- the same.  Um, will -- will they -- you know, people say, "Well, the old Tom and Jerry cartoon are violent" but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we still sit and laugh at that.  The kids still sit and laugh at that.  We don't need the other --
R:  Well, you know, they probably say that the old Three Stooges were very violent back then, too, yeah?
L:  Oh, I've heard that.  I've heard that, saying, you know, the Three Stooges are -- well, you know, I don't think the kids really took that seriously --
R:  No, no.
L:  um, and -- and yet, then they come out with cartoons that are supposed to be funny now, and they are very disrespectful to one another and to adults and --
R:  I -- oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I find that humor--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like you were saying, you know, offensive.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I find that very offensive and then when kids are disrespectful to one another, or to adults, to their teachers, well they are getting that from their cartoons, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, that -- it's okay to talk to an adult like that, it's -- it's funny --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know it's supposed to be funny.
R:  [NOISE] But yeah, they're getting that -- they're getting that impression that it is okay that -- that they're seeing it, they're seeing it from other -- from other -- from their peers, from the TV --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from the radio --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're -- they're, you know, even when you listen to a radio show in the morning, you know, they're bound to say something, you know --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- offensive at one time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, er, not in enough ta- --bad enough taste to keep it off the air --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but who's to say -- who's -- who's making that call that it is bad taste to keep it off the air?
L:  That's true --
R:  You know --
L:  -- some of it is awful.
R:  Oh, I know.  [NOISE]
L:  It's awful.  You're like, you know, you're listening and I -- I drove a high school bus --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a while and I had the radio on and -- and all of a sudden they would, you know, seem like okay music and okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I'm fine with that, and then they would have this talk in between the songs that was awful.  I'm thinking, "I don't need this at seven o'clock in the morning".
R:  [LAUGH] I know, it's just I just want to listen to some music. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it -- it's, and, um, so I don't know that you're ever really safe, you know, from -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no, no.
L:  -- from a sense of humor, as much as you try to be, but I --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but I think that, um, I think it's good to laugh, what is it -- it releases [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's fun to laugh.  I think laughing is just really part of life and you need that to forget some of the problems you've got, you know --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- it's just -- if you have it -- if you can la- laugh at yourself that's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's very important to laugh at yourself, I mean --
L:  I think so too.
R:  -- I mean, I'll do something stupid occasionally and my husband and children will laugh and I'll go -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- okay, yeah, okay, I get it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I think not taking yourself too seriously --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I think -- I think that that's, you know, my kids, ah, years ago, I, um, er, not that, I mean I do things all the time that my kids tell me about, but there's one incident, we were at fireworks and I -- there was a little hill there and I had real slippery sandals and I said to my son who was probably three or four, five, whatever, "Be careful down this hill because it -- it's-- it's very steep" so I held his hand --
R:  And then you fell, didn't you?  [LAUGH]
L:  --I slipped and fell and I pulled him with me, so, you know, my kids were like -- [LAUGH]
R:  And then you were like, "Well, what did I tell you?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My kids were dying and they have never, I mean, this is fifteen, twenty years ago and --
R:  Oh, and they still remember it, don't they
L:  -- they have never let --
