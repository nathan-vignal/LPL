R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R: Hi, my name's Kathleen.
L:  My name's Norma.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  Um --  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you -- where do you -- abouts do you live, in the east coast or the west coast?
L:  I live on the east coast.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And you?
R:  I live on the west coast.
L:  Oh, do --
R:  So, I -- yeah, I was just kinda curious because, um, you know, with the terrorist attacks when they happened, w- you know, we're pretty far away from everything --
L:  Yeah, w- we're not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and so I would imagine, I'm going to go and see if I can switch phones real quick, that it would be a l- a lot more stressful. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Um, yes I don't dare travel overseas to England or anything right now.  Um, I do plan on traveling to -- to Florida, but [LAUGH] hopefully before anything, um gets out +of hand.
R:  Yeah, I was -- we actually -- we would like to go to Washington DC, um, where we used to live a couple of years ago and my husband's never been there and I'm kinda scared to go because I feel like that's probably one of the first places, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that somebody would probably target.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I don't know.  It's just -- on the one hand I don't wanna give somebody the satisfaction, [LAUGH] you know, of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- crimping my style kind of thing or -- or, ah, you know I was so happy after nine eleven when people got out and -- and spent money and, you know, traveled and whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I just didn't want anybody to have -- I don't know, just that satisfaction of, you know, "We interrupted their lives", kind of thing, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's very -- it's, you know, weird.  It's a totally another thing to put myself on a plane [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and say, "Let's go", although I did go to New York over the holidays.
L:  Oh no. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well and we --
L:  I don't know if I'd dare go there.
R:  -- well, and you know what, it was, um, it was very, um, it was very interesting to go and we saw where the -- the, ah, World Trade Center was and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, it did just make you think, um, gosh -- I can't imagine.  You know what it made me think is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it made me think that I can't believe that the people who were just, you know, walking down the stairs and just thinking, "This is probably a drill" or you know, something, "There's a fire in the building"--
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- or something.  I'm sure they had no idea, you know, that, er, that the buildings weren't gonna be there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any time in the near future, as well as, um, I just -- I can't imagine -- I don't know, I just can't imagine being stuck in such a small little place, you know, in a stairwell.
L:  Do you believe that there will be a terrorist attack, you think?
R:  [SIGH]  You know, on the one hand I think to myself, "Well, you know, there can't be everybody watching everything that, you know, the people who wanna harm us --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- all the time" but on the other hand, I also think to myself, "You know ...", I'm not, you know, a person -- I mean, I don't watch the news like religiously every night and, you know, I don't like the look of stuff on the internet and, you know, I just basically kinda just, you know, live my life and when there's a big story, I -- I try to get the big points and, you know, move on, and I'm sure that there's more intelligence and more stuff that -- that average American does not even know about.
L:  That we don't know about, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I definitely don't read the news either, and sometimes when the news is on and they say something about all that's going on, I'm very surprised that it's gone so far --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm like, "Oh, man, I didn't know that Saddam was doing this or that", um --
R:  Right.
L:  I just fe- feel like it's more than what we think as citizens, and we don't know all of it, you know, --
R:  No, and I think a lot of people, they just don't, [MN] I don't know, I think people either have a -- a, um, really strong stance or, um, you know, or they don't. You know, they just --
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  -- they have a, you know, a very strong opinion, or it's just it -- they don't have an opinion at all.  I don't think there's people, there's a lot of people that go back and forth, and the people I think that have a really strong opinion are the people who, you know, they watch the news and they do all this, and -- then I think that a lot of people are like me, as I just -- I don't wanna -- I don't wanna hear every day, all the bad news.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I just -- I don't wanna be -- I remember the sense of panic that I had when -- when I watched the news that morning and -- and we got it at like six o'clock in the morning, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Right, so it was very --
L:  Oh, yeah, it was early for you guys.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was nine o'clock --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for you guys, and so it was six o'clock in the morning here and so it was very startling to wake up to that.
L:  Yeah --
R:  And --
L:  I didn't even know -- I didn't even think it was real.  I -- my --
R:  I --
L:  -- mother was on the phone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, "What are you talking about?"[LAUGH]
R:  I -- I actually woke up and, um, my -- because the phone had rang.  I was like, you know, it was six o'clock in the morning and I don't normally get up until about seven, and, um, I remember that sense of panic that I had after I realized, you know, gosh, this really did happen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I remember going to work and not feeling very -- like I even -- I worked in an office about the time when I was by myself a lot and so, my husband had the day off and I was like, "Do you wanna come over?"[LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I just didn't wanna be by myself.  So, I -- I really can't imagine if something were to happen anywhere near where I am --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but on the -- you know, I was actually -- right before I left work, I went to go look at the news and, um, -- on the -- on the web and I for some reason got kinda side tracked into [SIGH] I guess it was the biggest terrorist, not the biggest terrorist, but where a terrorist might strike --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and one of them is the Hoover Dam, which is -- I live in Arizona.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Right, and I felt, "Oh, my gosh", you know?
L:  Why the Hoover Dam?
R:  Because it's a -- well, because it's a landmark.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and because it, um, generates so much energy for the west coast, for the west, um --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- western port- western portion of the United States.
L:  Right.
R:  It generates for California, Nevada, you know, ah, Utah and for Arizona --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so much energy that it would just be near impossible to, you know, have a norm- normal day without having that dam, you know, flowing.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  And, me up here in Maine [LAUGH]
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I -- I don't think there's anything up here but who knows? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you never -- well, you know, [inaudible] you could get on the map[?] and you could do something, um, like there was something about where nuclear generators or something are --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I didn't rea- I knew there was a nuclear generator someplace in Arizona, but I didn't realize that it was in Phoenix.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which is, you know, just two hours away from where I'm at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I was like, "Oh, gosh", you know, if something really would -- that would very much affect us.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, it is... I was very surprised when I went to New York, um, you know, it had been over a year, but I was very surprised at how people had already gotten so back to normal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  Did you go by plane?
R:  Yeah, we did --
L:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, I -- I -- I was a little nervous and then I thought, you know, I'm not gonna -- I just can't live the rest of my life not going anywhere because I'm afraid that somebody might do something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know, we just -- we -- we went and, you know, we actually had a great time, but it was really solemn to go to the World Trade Center area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There were a lot of people there that were just really -- and it really -- it's almost like when you were there it's just not real --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm sure that if it were to happen again, it would be --
L:  Now, the security at the airports, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was unbelievable.
R:  The security was horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was -- at one point I was a little bit annoyed because I have a small child and I was like, "Okay, you're not gonna get that hi- that, er, stroller through that thing.  It's just not gonna go --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I mean and, "It's -- it's all metal and cloth, so just feel it all over, or whatever", you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um ...
L:  Well, every time they pinpointed my fiance.
R:  Oh.
L:  He's a big man and every time we went through the security thing they would take him to the side --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, er, because he's a man and because he's big, I guess --
R:  It seemed really random on all the flights that we were on.
L:  Yeah, it did.  It -- seemed like it was supposed to be random. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean it was -- I mean, there was some old ladies who got stopped.
L:  Right.
R:  There was, you know, some businessmen that got stopped.  I got stopped at one point --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was holding my child and, you know, I was like, "Okay, this is so not" -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- right.
R:  But, you know, my -- my husband did say something.  He was just like, "Okay now, you know, I mean what are you gonna, you know, hijack a plane, you know, with a baby?" you know, and I was like, "Oh, you know, they're just doing their job" but it is -- it's frustrating and -- and I think that's one thing that Americans forget is that they're very used to convenience --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- and so they don't wanna be inconvenienced and -- and --
L:  Right, but you gotta think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, anybody could hide something in their shoe, in, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah, in my -- I mean, if I'm willing to be a suicide bomber then who says I'm not willing to take my kid with me, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, you know, I could put anything on that baby and do whatever, I guess, if I wanted.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just sad to think that someone would actually do that, but I'm sure that there is someone out there --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- who would do that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, but I just -- I don't know.  On the one hand I would love to think that nothing is gonna happen, but I can't imagine that people who are willing to do what they've already done are just gonna just sit back and go, "Okay, never mind".
L:  Yeah, that's why I'm wondering, you know, if we attack Saddam or whatever, is it really gonna take care of the problem, I mean, as far as the other terrorists --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are they still gonna follow him or are -- or the other guy there, or are they gonna, you know, say, "Okay, I'm done with terrorists?  [LAUGH]  I'm done with being a bad guy" you know?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, [SIGH], I know and -- but the only thing that I -- when I was on that web site, um, today, what I -- they had this map and there were just seeing -- they were going [SIGH], like by -- they just had this thing and it was just called terrorist activity and they must've -- they must've highlighted, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifteen different countries between like Libya and Tunisia and, um, some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- middle eastern, you know, some in France, some in Italy, some --
