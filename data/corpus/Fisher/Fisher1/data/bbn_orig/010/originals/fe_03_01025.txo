L:  Hi, I'm Liz.
R:  Hi, I'm John.
L:  Hi, John.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good, thanks.  Um, terrorism, wow.  I think everybody would panic.  The minute it's bad weather, people go to the store and buy milk and bread for three days even if they don't eat it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  You wa- -- you watch, um, I -- I see it in the news all the time with, like, bad weather and whatnot, that they, you know, just totally freak out and do weird things, so, ah, I probably would agree with ya on that.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I'm curious to, ah -- I mean, not curious but if something were to happen like in a major place as compared to what would people do at home, I think at home, people would be calmer as compared to, like a sports stadium, or Disney or something like that.  People I think would panic more.
R:  Yeah, well if people are at home they're gonna to be more secure.  They're in their own, um, environment and they're probably lock down with their family members and whatnot, but, ah, obviously in the major cities it would just be a mad house.
L:  I -- I don't live in a major city and -- and when they whole thing about nine one one happened, um, I -- I was -- I was happy I didn't live in a major city.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had recently moved from a major city and I was like, "Hey, this is -- I'm glad I'm not there right now".
R:  Yeah.  I -- [COUGH], obviously that's gonna be one of the major targets and that.  I -- I work in the airline industry, so obviously I watched it pretty close and actually knew a lot of people that were down there, but ah, I don't know.  The topic was once again, bio-terrorism, would they freak out?  Um, I -- I, you know it's gonna depend on the -- the group that gets affected, you know, but -- major city, I think that that will be, ah, a little bit more, ah, panic that it would be a rural urban city.
L:  Look how many people went out and bought duct tape and plastic.
R:  Yeah, well.
L:  I mean, you know --
R:  People are gullible.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean -- [LAUGH], you know -- you know people just heard about stuff and -- and there was the -- the briefest hint of, "Have some duct tape and plastic" and, you know, people were buying out Wal-Mart, I mean -- I mean it is something scary and something to be concerned about.  It's funny that you work for the airline industry.  My husband is, ah, working on a project right now, making the next generation of bomb detectors with Invision.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  So, ah [LAUGH], so you'll feel safer.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope so.  Well, if -- if a bomb goes off in my plane, I won't know it, so, um --
L:  [LAUGH]  That's a sa- -- sad way to think of it, but yeah,--
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it is the truth.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It is, unfortunately, but, um, I don't know, I think we've learnt a lot of lessons.  Bio-terrorism?  Boy, you know, there's something really scary.  I mean, I'm one of those people who can't get a smallpox vaccine 'cause I'm allergic to how they make it and everything, and, um, I was just at dinner with a fireman and -- and I said to him, "Gee have you gotten it?" 'cause I was, you know, almost nervous to sit next to him because I didn't wanna get a reaction from him getting the vaccine.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I mean, imagine if something were to happen.  I mean, if y- -- if some people were thinking on that, l- you know, small of a -- you know what I mean, that small of a scale?  Sitting next to somebody who had a vaccine that could bother them.  What would happen if something happened in a -- in a wider place?
R:  Wha- -- yeah, just a, you know, bio-terror- -- terrorism by it's nature, is more scary than anything else.  Unless you study microbiology you wouldn't really know about most of them and, yeah, it's not anything you can see or smell or touch, so, it's kinda ambiguous and -- and everybody fears what they don't know.
L:  Exactly.  I mean -- I mean, you don't know.  You don't know if the water that, ah comes -- you're -- you're trusting a lot of people a lot of different times throughout your day.  You know, you're trusting that the guys at the Water Department are going the right thing and when you pour that glass of water, there's nothing wrong with it.
R:  [LAUGH]  You hope.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Um, I mean, you know, that -- I -- I live down here in Florida and -- and there was a lot of talk about, you know, the different terrorists with -- supposedly they trained and lived all down here and all of that, and -- and it was one of the things here in town people were worried about, was the water supply.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And, ah, -- and could somebody get into the water supply?  Could someone get into the power plant?  And -- and, um, it is pretty interesting how unsafe so many parts of our, ah,-- of our daily life i- is.
R:  That is part of the unknown, I think that's why a lot of people would do, you know, things that we would think would be strange in a normal circumstance in case there was an attack.  I really do think that, you know, that's kinda -- the major city people would probably, ah, freak out a little bit more than the rural -- rural people, just because, you know e- everything has, ah, escalated with, ah, population, ah, densities, it seems like.
L:  Do you live in a bigger city or a smaller city?
R:  I live in a med- medium suburb of Cleveland.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I live in a pretty -- pretty small town down here in Florida and, um, but I've lived in -- in major cities and, yeah, I definitely think that the different areas would react to things in a -- in different ways.
R:  Yeah, I -- I saw a riot.  I li- -- I used to live, ah, out in Seattle, and I was downtown when a riot broke out over I think the trade, er, deficit, or --
L:  Oh, the trade thing, yeah.
R:  -- yeah, whatever it was, yeah, and it just seemed [inaudible] to me, you know.  But, you know, you get a bunch of people crammed in like a bunch of rats, it seems like they feed off each others fears and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, [COUGH] and, ah, emotions and everything just esc- escalated, so I mean, that's my take on it.  I-- I just think the rural people will have a tendency just either it's gonna happen to them, they're gonna flee or they're gonna buckle down with their family and just hope for the best or --
L:  I -- I think people who live more rural will just hunker down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I really think they're a lot more sufficient and, ah, independently thinking, so to speak, than -- than people who are with a -- with a group who, you know, they say are a, you know, mob mentality.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Um, -- they -- you know, the other night the Celtics team was on.  My husband was watching the Celtics and I don't even know who they were playing against, but something smelt in the stadium and they closed -- and they stopped the game and they were trying to figure out was it like a -- a smoke bomb or pepper spray or -- I never ever heard what the -- what the resolution of it was, but it was interesting to see how a portion of the people were really freaking out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and another portion of the people weren't even getting out of their seats.
R:  Yeah, well it was like the people in the nightclub in, ah, what was it -- Chicago?  Pepper spray and they all freaked out.  Most --
L:  They all freaked out.
R:  -- people died.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and it was sad to see, but obviously there's, you know, there's awareness, there's fear and -- and -- and in the unknown whatever, you know, anything can set that off.
L:  Yeah -- yeah, but you know, it's really sad.  I -- I have -- I have a little kid and it's really, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- sad that when he says, "Well, what if something happens when I'm at school?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I never -- I mean, I didn't grow up in the Fifties in the Cold War or any of that, but it's really sad when your kids thinking about, "What if something happens when I'm in -- when I'm at school and I'm not at home and --" and, you know, he's just -- what can you say?  I mean, whoever thought that you'd discuss some of the conversations you'll be having with your kid?
R:  Well, fortunately my daughter's too young for that, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's only two.
L:  I have -- I have a first grader, so they know--
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just enough to be dangerous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't understand they whole grasp of all, but they hear so much about it from here, there and everywhere that they -- their imagination runs with it.
R:  Yeah, it's crazy.  I -- I didn't -- boy the responsibility.  [LAUGH] I -- I haven't even thought about talking it out with my daughter yet, that's just scary.
L:  Yeah, yeah , you know.
R:  I don't really know what my response would be.
L:  He -- he says, "What do I do if Osama Bin Laden comes to my school?"  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, kids -- kids hear those big things and they -- they bring it right home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, right -- right to where not -- not that, you know, he wasn't afraid of him coming to his house, just, "What will I do if he comes to my school?"
R:  Now, I wonder if that has to do with the Columbine fears, you know?
L:  I don't -- I don't think he understands any of that.  I think, um, I think, you know, they have tornado drills at school and they have hurricane drills at school and fire drills and this is another thing that you -- they're hearing a lot about, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, it think it's just in the same -- in the same vein for him.  You know what I'm saying, it's the same thing as a torna- I mean, I -- I didn't grow up where there were tornadoes.  I never had a tornado drill before.  I was, "What do you do in a tornado drill?" you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, I think it's just the same as if -- it's the same thinking in his mind.  It's just another thing to be aware of.  He doesn't seem to be scared about it, but -- but, ah, -- but, ah, who knows, you know, that just -- who'd ever think that's what the conversation you'd be having?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Boy, you know, times have changed in our awareness of, you know, of world affairs is now coming home, you know.  It's just crazy.
L:  What -- what we do affects a lot of the world and I don't think, I mean I don't think a lot of people realized that before nine one one, I really don't.  I think --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- I think people, you know, the majority of the American public just thought what happens here just affects us and yeah, there may be McDonald's over in all the different foreign countries, but that really doesn't mean anything.  They don't -- I don't think they understand how much our culture pervades other cultures and makes people do things that they want to do, whether good or bad.
R:  Well, pre -- yeah, premental [inaudible] whatever [inaudible] you can't think of any attack that's ever happened on mainland US soil --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I mean, in the last time that there was an attack, er -- [inaudible] circumstances in World War Two and most of us weren't even alive then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it's our generation on a wake-up call and of course, you know, [LAUGH], you set some bio-terrorism on there and everybody's gonna be more sensitive and afraid and I hope everybody does keep their -- their mind, ah, um, together if something does happen in a -- in a mass distribution.
R:  I mean, wh- we used to live -- to live in California.  When we moved there, I -- I remember all of a sudden being aware of where exits were, if there was an earthquake, so that's something that I wasn't used to.
R:  Right.
L:  I wasn't used to living someplace that I had to think, "What do you do if there's an earthquake?" you know?  "Where is there an exit?"  But I think n- -- I think now people -- everybody has that same kinda of -- "All right, what would I do if I have here and this happened?
R:  Do you --
L:  I don't think bio- terrorism has stopped me from going anywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Do you have a plan in case something does happen --
L:  Nah.
R:  Ah --
