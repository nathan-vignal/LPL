R:  Do I --
L:  Hi, do I -- this is -- 
R:  Do I speak first?  Oh, okay, sorry.
L:  No problem.  I'm Dana[?]
R:  Hi Dana, I'm Bill.  How are you doing?
L:  Doing good.
R:  Good.  Would I panic if there was a terrorist attack?  Was that the question?
L:  I think so.
R:  I certainly would.
L:  I think I would too. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, I think anybody that's sane would. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I know, I mean, I haven't -- I haven't experienced anything that catastrophic in my life.
R:  No.
L:  But, you know, I've had, you know, some times where I've, you know, needed to -- there's been a crisis and you need to take quick action and, you know, I've actually surprised myself by staying fairly level headed and trying to --
R:  That's good.
L:  Do- direct things as much as I possibly could.
R:  So let me ask the sixty four dollar question here.
L:  Okey dokey.
R:  Are we -- are we talking on terrorism from now for the next eight minutes?
L:  Gosh, I don't know.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess.
R:  I -- I -- well, do I -- do I ask who -- where am I talking to and let you know where you're at, or do we just continue talking about -- 
L:  We could -- this is my first phone call too, so -- 
R:  This is my first phone call too.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm in Dover, Delaware.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Tustin, California.
R:  Where?
L:  [LAUGH] about twenty minutes from Disneyland.
R:  Oh, you lucky thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What's the weather like out there?
L:  Um, right now it's about sixty eight degrees with a slight breeze.
R:  Well, I think you're going to lose --
L:  It's nice.
R:  -- El Nino which is probably in your favor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like sixty degrees and sunny right now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But if you were to talk yesterday, it was, like, thirty five.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's cold, so like you do -- you any surfing? 
L:  Me?  No.
R:  No.
L:  No.  
R:  Well -- 
L:  But what would do you in a terrorist attack?
R:  What would I do?  [LAUGH] Okay. [COUGH] Let me think.  If I'm looking out my kitchen window like I am right now at a big field and a elementary school way in the back, and if there was like parachuters coming -- [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  No, terrorist -- okay, I think -- I think I'd probably grab my family together, regroup.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, let me try to get ah -- let me talk adultish here.  I'd probably seal my windows like everybody says to with duct tape and plastic.
L:  Right.
R:  And say, "You know something, I know I should have went to the store and got all those canned goods and bottled water that I didn't get".
L:  [LAUGH] I hear that one.
R:  But I have got a hell of a lot of beer and alcohol here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, not that I'm an alcoholic.
L:  I'm not going to do your kids no good.
R:  I'm a social -- well, I -- I ousted my son two years ago.  He is at the University of Delaware.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  So he'll have to flit for himself up at the dormitory.  
L:  Ah.
R:  But, ah, I'm guilty of not preparing and I was a boy scout and I was in the army and I was in Vietnam and all that stuff but -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Shame on you, just getting -- [LAUGH]
R:  But I mean, I -- I -- I have not put anything aside for a rainy day should it happen.
L:  Yes, I -- I haven't either, but I know -- I know if it was me, you know, like if it was today, my daughter's at school, my husband's at work and I'm at home.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's me and the two cats.
R:  Well, you know -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I tell you what happened.  I -- my wife and I have a -- I used to teach.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't teach any longer and my wife and I formed a day care and preschool so --  
L:  Right on.
R:  Yeah, I've got my house and then I have like an addition put on it and we've got like twenty seven kids that are here and there but they're all going home now which is good.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  At five o'clock.
L:  That's right, it's five o'clock back here, it's only two o'clock here.
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, the funny thing about it is when nine one one came by, my wife volunteered to take a dozen of the guys to a park, and she went with -- with one of our coworkers and they went in, ah, in this big van and just as they were leaving I had the news on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I saw the, um -- the one jet liner go into One World Trade Centre and I just looked and I thought, you know, "What the heck is this"? and I heard a bunch of talking and all and it's the first time my wife never brought her cell phone with her.
L:  Oh.
R:  So here she is going to a park which is only like about two miles away.
L:  Right.  
R:  But she -- yeah, Dover Delaware is only an hour and a half from Washington DC, an hour and a half from Philadelphia and then we had the big air force base here.
L:  Right.
R:  And New York is only three hours from here, three and a half hours, so -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  So this happened and I sat down and I'm thinking, "Holy jeeze, what the hell is going on here"?
L:  Right. 
R:  So I'm looking -- and there's no way so, I -- you know, I could say that I panicked in a way because I didn't know how to get a hold of her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so -- so all the parents called and everything like that and everybody just sat tight and then we -- then I got to listen to the Pentagon and how something happened we heard a noise and so all this is happening and two hours later she's coming back from the park.
L:  Oh.
R:  And knows nothing about it.  I says, "Wow, you really missed some stuff here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And this -- this is what happened to me two years ago.  So -- 
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, my husband -- my -- I was in the shower getting ready to take my daughter to school.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And my husband comes running in, he's like "The world's blowing up", "What are you talking about"?  "They've attacked New York".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "And they've attacked the Pentagon" and -- 
R:  That's scary.
L:  And, you know, thises and thats and, you know, this is the first time -- 
R:  Right.
L:  That, you know, this was the biggest thing my daughter had ever seen and she was eight.
R:  Eight.
L:  At the time and it just, ah -- just -- 
R:  Overwhelmed you.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I had an interesting predicament in that, you know, here I am in California.  I'm three thousand miles removed.
R:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.
L:  And, you know, but, you know, just watching this gut wrenching video over and over and over again and I decided to take my daughter to school.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And --
R:  After you saw this?
L:  Huh?
R:  After this happened or -- 
L:  After it happened, yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Because it was about -- it was about seven o'clock my time.
R:  Okay, that's right.
L:  When my husband came in so we actually -- the only thing that we saw live was the towers falling.
R:  You -- yeah.
L:  But, I took, you know, I took my daughter to school and she was like kind of getting all panic stricken and stuff, and the principal had said, you know, the children -- because she goes to a private Christian school --
R:  Right, okay, good.
L:  You know, the principal had said that the absence wouldn't count against anybody if there are people wanting to --
R:  Right, right, right -- 
L:  Keep their children with them.  But if they wanted to keep, you know, if they wanted to keep their children at school, if they needed their children to be at school, then they could stay.
R:  Do you have like the -- any major installations over there, like bases, air force, army?
L:  Um, we had Tustin and Altoro but they're both closed.
R:  You've got Knott's Berry Farms, right? 
L:  Yeah, we're over -- 
R:  I mean, they'll come after the jelly for Christ's sake.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, we've got Knott's, we've got Disneyland, further north we've got Magic Mountain, um.
R:  Jeeze.
L:  So -- 
R:  I never been out -- all kidding aside, I, um, have never been out -- well, I've been to San Diego a couple of years ago.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I went by -- over Thanksgiving, what is that, Coronado Bay?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yeah, went over there and my -- my wife is one of these -- oh, what do you say, like not coupon girls, but, you know, collect mileage, miles, air miles on credit cards and all that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So we flew from here over to -- I don't know what the heck the name of it, Loews or something, Loews, I don't know what it is, some kind of resort but -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  Like, we were able to go there for four nights five days airfare included and all it did was cost us for the cab fare. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, wow.
R:  But that's -- yeah, but that's my only -- I think, yeah, that's my, um, only time out in California.
L:  Yeah, we've got -- yes, yes, San Diego has Camp Pendleton. 
R:  That's right.
L:  And that's about -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, Camp Pendleton is probably an hour and a half --
R:  That's marines, isn't it?
L:  -- from where I'm at.  Huh?
R:  Is that marines or army?
L:  Yes, marines.
R:  Marines.  Yeah, well, you know what -- you know what the -- you know, I don't know, you're going to think I'm crazy when I say this, but, like, after this happened, probably six months -- eight, within a year -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Less a year, less than a year -- 
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  There was a rumor or something going around that the people on the west coast, not just California but Oregon, Washington, and places like that, Nevada, said was treating this more of a east coast problem not a west coast problem.  Like, "You guys got it, we're okay so far, it's your problem".  But that was a rumor.  Did you hear anything like that?
L:  Um, no.
R:  It was -- like this was in a year.
L:  That would be -- that would be something that would, um -- 
R:  Like I said it was a rumor or something.
L:  Don't -- don't -- don't take this statement the wrong way, that is something that would -- that would come from the east coast.  It would be an east coast perspective.
R:  New Yorkers?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, I know that, you know, security was beefed up a lot down here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know --
R:  Well, my son every once in a while -- 
L:  We had annual passes -- we had annual passes at the time to Disneyland.
R:  Well --
L:  And -- 
R:  Really?
L:  And, you know, we couldn't -- anything -- even -- even cell phone cases.
R:  You couldn't use them?
L:  They were -- no, they were just looking in them.  
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, any kind of bag.  
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  They were checking all the diaper bags, all the backpacks, all the purses, you know, jackets and they had for a while -- they had the wand metal detectors.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that gotten a little more slack, um, recently.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but they -- other companies, bigger companies, um, are taking, you know, stronger -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- security measures, and I just had a temp job with --
