R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Lisa
L:  Hi, this is Sandra.
R:  Hi Sandra. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, um --
R:  Well [LAUGH]
L:  -- humor: good humor, humor in bad taste.
R:  Yeah, where do you draw the line?
L:  Um, oh, I guess when it becomes offensive --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I'm like --
R:   -- what do -- what do you call offensive?
L:  Well, I like all types of comedy for one, whether it's clean comedy or comedy that's, um, well, when I see Fog[?] or, you know, the, um, the Martin Lawrence type comedy Chris Rock --
R:  [inaudible] ah --
L:  -- you know, those little hard core comedy?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I like all types of that, but, um, what I find offensive is just when it gets -- just, I guess nasty, dirty, just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you just can't take it.  I guess it's like a personal preference between everyone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you just can't -- I don't -- I guess when it -- I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it.
R:  I know, when I -- well my -- I think vulgar to me is when, um, just they're talking about sex and just making jokes about that.
L:  I guess when it starts to make me uncomfortable, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and the lang- some language, like I don't like to hear the Lord's name taken in vain and some --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some -- most cuss words that's just too much for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I mean sometimes there is, you know, a little cussing [NOISE] but there was a --
R:  Yeah, I've never seen, um --
L:  Well I know for --
R:  -- Martin --
L:  -- instance, Martin Lawrence his latest thing that came out, um, a few months ago, was on a -- it came out at the movies, and I think this was like his second, ah, movie performance like this.  He had one out before called You So Crazy and that was okay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but this one it was just -- I don't know, I stopped watching it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean somebody had --
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  -- somebody had got like a bootleg copy of the tape and I just stopped watching it.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  It was -- it was just -- and I wasn't the only one.  I talked to a couple of my friends and they were like, "I couldn't watch it either, it was just too much cussing", and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean like if there was some cussing I understand that that's just the way that you talk, but it was just --
R:  Right, if it was really defining the character that they're playing --
L:  Right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was -- it was too much.  It was like -- it was stand up comedy.
R:  Oh, was it?
L:  Yeah it was like stand up --
R:  Oh, in a movie, trying to bring that int --
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, I see what you're saying, yeah.
L:  And it was just too much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and just the way that he was talking, I was just -- I don't wanna listen to this any more.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't really know if I was offended by it, I just didn't wanna hear that any more --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I guess maybe I was offended.
R:  Yeah, and that would be -- yeah.  That's better, you don't have to take offence, just, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I was thinking the other day, um I remember years ago when Saturday Night Live --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Live, was, um, they had um, Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy and all them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and which they still do it now, but I haven't, um, I don't -- haven't really watched it lately, but, ah, they, um, would do skits of the Presidents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you know, I really liked that.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I mean, they got the character down right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- down really good which I didn't really care to see them, you know, make fun of Clinton --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- bless his heart, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but I was thinking, you know, I'd like to see what they did with, um President Bush. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that would be good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  Yeah. [LAUGH]  And his, what did -- what do they call him?  His Bushes[?] and -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I watch Saturday Night Live when I can get -- whenever I remember that it's on.  [LAUGH]  But, um --
R:  Yeah.  What time does it come on now?
L:  I think it comes on the comedy channel, Comedy Central, um, is it at five or five thirty I think?  Unless they've changed it.
R:  Oh okay.  I didn't they had --
L:  It's been a while since I have seen it.
R:  -- Comedy Central had picked that up.  I still --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- I still thought it was on, I don't know, CBS or one of the other --
L:  Yeah, NBC I think it is --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but I think on Comedy Central it comes on, um, it comes on every day, I do know that.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm --
R:  Is that the reruns?
L:  -- and I guess it's mainly reruns. Mhm.
R:  It is the reruns?
L:  Not of the real old ones, but like recent reruns --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they'll play those.
R:  Oh, yeah, I bet those are good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I bet there's a big difference between those -- the reruns, and what they do now, do you think?  [inaudible]
L:  Well, I haven't really seen Saturday Night Live from back in a day --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because I don't -- I guess I just wasn't interested.  I didn't know how good the show actually was until recently, just this past year.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So, but, um, there's more stuff that I would like to see [inaudible] things that you can actually talk about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with somebody else without, you know, all the vulgarities in it.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's stuff that the whole family can sit down and watch and laugh.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And I guess as I get older, I don't want to hear a lot of the cussing and talk about sex and stuff --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- like that.  I mean you might laugh at it when you hear it but it does nothing that I just, you know, wanna keep hearing.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  That's not the type of comedy that I want that I wanna hear.  I wanna hear, you know, Bill Crosby type stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Just good wholesome --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- comedy.  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, don't know how many minutes it's been but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, actually it's been five minutes.
L:  Has it?
R:  I set my timer. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I said, "Gosh, ten minutes, can I talk that long?" [LAUGH]  But, um, lets see.  I don't -- have you ever seen Red Skelton?
L:  No --
R:  I've --
L:  -- I've seen the, um --
R:  That's my mom's favorite, I think.  He just does a lot of skits.
L:  Mhm.  I have seen the commercials on TV for Time Life for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- his, um, I guess like his different skits that you can buy on DVD or video --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I've never heard of him, so ...[LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  Well, he's pretty funny.  I mean, I wouldn't watch a whole bunch of him only because I think that would get old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's -- what's the word?  I don't know, maybe -- maybe you've seen him once, you know, that's enough, I don't think --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- maybe he's corny or something, but I remember when I was little, I would -- he -- he had me laughing.  [LAUGH]  And then there's the Jerry Lewis movies.
L:  Yeah, I haven't really seen him -- I've heard of Jerry Lewis, but I haven't really --
R:  Really?
L:  -- seen any of his stuff --
R:  I though everybody would've seen him.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or this Red Skelton.  [LAUGH]
R:  But they're -- I mean he's got a pretty good movie --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or some pretty good movies.
L:  Then all of their stuff is clean?
R:  Yes.  I think, um, well the only one that I can really remember --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with him in it is, um, he did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a spin off or whatever of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and were -- that was pretty good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He made quite a transformation.  He was a good one for that part being a goofy, bucktoothed professor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then when he took that potion --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, he was tall and handsome and suave and sophisticated.  [LAUGH]  He could do both parts well.
L:  Mhm.  Because I -- I watch a lot of, um, more I guess the comedians that I know of are most African American --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, but I don't know, a lot of those like I said, it's just real hard core [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you wanna hit it all the time.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I think the last one I can -- trying to think ...  Did you watch, um, Baps[?]
L:  Baps, yeah.
R:  I can't remember what it stood for.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That -- did that have Halle Berry in it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, [LAUGH] that was pretty funny.
L:  I should of say I seen it, but I didn't watch it.  [LAUGH]  I thought it was just --
R:  Oh, you didn't care --
L:  No, I --
R:  It didn't hold your attention?
L:  No, I --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was like, "What is this?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's nothing that I could really watch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, [MN] I don't know.  I like, um, like Everybody Loves Raymond --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and King, ah, what is that, ah, King of New York, King or Queen.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, like those, like that, and Decker[?] and -- I love stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just too funny.
R:  Yeah, I like those sitcoms too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, out of all of those, I believe Everybody Loves Raymond --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would be the most --
L:  You know, I just --
R:  -- not vulgar I guess.
L:  Yeah, like I say, i- it's stuff you can relate to --
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] as you get older, you relate more --  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'd rather watch that type of comedy or listen to that type of comedy, than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the other stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I like, um, did you see Shanghai Noon or Shanghai Nights with, um, Jackie Chan in it?
L:  No.
R:  Okay, that's, you know, martial arts movie --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's comedy too and those are the best movies.  I don't -- there is really -- I don't believe there was any language in there.  You know, foul language?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it was pretty decent.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Of course, there were people getting hurt in it, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's just amazing watching him fight.
L:  Yeah.  I like him and, ah, Chris Tucker in, um, Rush Hour and Rush Hour Two.  Have you seen that?
R:  N- no, now that is what I wanna watch.  
L:  That is really good, there's a lot of comedy in that.
R:  Yeah.  I wanna see that.  That's called Rush Hour --
