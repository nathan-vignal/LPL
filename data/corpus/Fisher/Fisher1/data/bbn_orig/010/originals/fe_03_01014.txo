R:  Hi
L:  Kim.  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm Angela.
L:  Kim.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  And you too and I missed the first part of it.  What was the question?
R:  Um, well the topic is Terrorism and, ah, do we think that most people would remain calm, um, in a terrorist attack, um, or panic and also what would -- what would you do?  What do you think hap- what do you think you would do in a terrorist attack?
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd say most would stay calm.
R:  You think so?
L:  And, and a fringe zone that would, you know, take advantage of the situation.
R:  Right.
L:  But I think most would stay calm and so as they were told.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I wou- .
L:  Because.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  We've seen so many a- , you know, attacks from different -- in different countries.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I -- I think it would depend on what kind of attack.  I would be most, um, worried about, you know, a, um, bio-terrorism --

L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of, you know, where you can't see it [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, you know, they wouldn't be able of course to tell us ahead of time, so I think -- I think in that situation people might panic, um, but, um, I don't know, I would hope most people would stay calm.

L:  Yeah, me too, but you just don't know.
R:  Mhm.  I guess in New York, um, it -- it seems that the response to that was very, um, at least, you know, from how the media presented it, was very, um, I -- I was impressed with the way they responded when that attack happened.

L:  Mhm.
R:  And of course there was no danger after -- no immediate danger after --
L:  Not sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not sure.  There was no [inaudible] and there was no really -- I mean it was sealed off so quickly there wasn't -- I'm just --

R:  Right.
L:  --maybe afraid for the, you know, the looting and the people taking advantage of the situation.

R:  Right.
L:  Ya.
R:  You think, um, how -- how likely do you feel that a terrorist attack is, in the next say, the next, you know, three months?

L:  I think not likely, but I just could be positive thinking. [LAUGH]  What do you think?
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, I don't know.  You know, at first, right after it happened, you know, the Twin Towers thing happened, I --

L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't know, you know, I felt that it probably would happen again really soon.  You know --

L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think everybody felt a lot more vulnerable, um --
L:  What part of the country do you live?
R:  Um, I'm in Virginia, in South West Virginia.
L:  Oh, in Southern California?
R:  Mhm, um --
L:  So, we're -- we're most worried about is the North Korea attacks from there.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's kinda crazy the way they've been acting. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we just watched -- so, I hadn't seen Pearl Harbor, the movie?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I guess, yeah, the --I guess in California, that's where you're --[LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kinda like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kinda like Hawaii, stuck out there where [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I haven't been keeping up lately with, um, like within the last week, the last few days, with the North Korea situation.  Um, is -- is it getting worse or ...?

L:  Not really, no.  Um, it -- it's [NOISE] been pretty much the same.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, how -- how much does it affect you for the, um, the different, like, ah, orange day or a yellow day or anything like that?

R:  Um, I haven't noticed that we have particular days.  Do you mean the national thing?  I remember when they upgraded the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is that what you're talking about?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.  I don-
L:  Do you notice the changes, anybody around you?
R:  No, I can't say that even.  I mean, I don't think we pay a whole lot of attention to that?  [LAUGH]  Um, I guess -- I mean I don't feel that -- we don't live in an area that is, you know, particularly would not be a target area.

L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I don't -- it -- as far as just the people that live right around here, we don't, I don't notice anybody, you know, acting different or that.

L:  [NOISE]  No, here either.  Though I think that as a country we've kind of come blase about it.

R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  You know, not as [NOISE]
R:  I'm sorry, what did you say?
L:  [NOISE]  Sorry, water just spilt, hold on.  [NOISE]  Okay, hold on.
R:  Did you just say your water just broke?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Still, hold on a second.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I'm -- I'm at work and I had somebody at my desk and I had water sitting, you know --

R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  And they came tried to give some papers to me to look at.  Anyway, um --
R:  What do you do?  What is your job?
L:  Um, I'm an office manager for a construction company.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we've noticed a slowdown here as in all kinds of people have stopped spending money at first.

R:  Mhm.
L:  Friv -- frivolous things like painting, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- home improvement and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think it is a direct affect of, you know, of the terrorist and the threat that's always hanging over us, like --

R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what's going to happen?  Stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah, um, the threat of war of course, is another um -- that's what-- that's what worries me really more than, you know, a particular terrorist attack here.

L:  Yep, me too.
R:  But, um, I don't know.  I don't -- I think a lot of people don't feel like there's anything, you know, they individually about can -- can do about it.

L:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what, you know, when they issue the yellow days and the red days and you know, the different designations for the terrorist threat, I don't see how that affects anybody.

R:  Right.  Well, what are we supposed to do exactly?  [LAUGH]  I think that unless you're in law enforcement or -- or, you know, if you worked at a hospital, there'll be certain things I guess you might, you know --

L:  Right.
R:  --turn up a notch or something, but as far as just, you know, just everyday people, I'm not sure -- they haven't really told us exactly what we're supposed to do on these days, you know.  [LAUGH].

L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, they did come out with a resource to be plastic sheeting or some-, you know [LAUGH] and a few -- some things like that and then the next day we heard that, no that wouldn't do any good anyway --

L:  Right.

R:  -- you know, like as far as the bio-terrorism thing.  By the time we knew about it it'd be too late, that --

L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, putting up plastic sheeting would just be keeping it in, rather than [LAUGH] you know, keeping it out.  So --

L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  --I don't think they've really told us.  I mean, when they make those alerts what it is, you know, that we can do or --

L:  Well, we here in California, you know, we always have the threat of a big earthquake.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we all have, or most people have emergency kits, where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, plastic sheeting, duct tape, blankets, canned food, canned -- you know, water and stuff like that.

R:  Mhm.
L:  In a big plastic dumpster in the garage.  A lot of people have that, so I think that's basically that's all that we can do as regular citizens.

R:  Right.
L:  You know, I don't think there's anything else that we can do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ah, mhm.  You know -- concerned in case you are cut off and we live in kind of a remote area so we would be cut off anyway.  We've got a weeny generator just to, you know, just to handle the basic necessities, but --

R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we haven't done anything past that.
R:  I -- do you watch the show 'Twenty Four'?
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  They just got a -- the last one there -- a terrorist got a nuclear bomb into the country and it was in LA and --

L:  Ooh [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what we're afraid of.  We're trying to take bets as to what, you know, if there was a bomb from North Korea --

R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where would it, you know, where would they aim in Southern California.
R:  Right.
L:  San Francisco or -- or LA?  And pretty much the vote is LA.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  We're all out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that -- that, I think, is a huge deterrent, because North Korea said that they would shoot a nuclear missile at us if we attacked Iraq.

R:  They said they would -- I'm sorry, say that again?
L:  Yeah.  That they would attack us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- send a nuclear missile to the United States if we attacked Iraq.
R:  Oh.  I --
L:  I think that should be a bigger threat than +Saddam Hussain anyway.
R:  Right.  I still -- you know, I never would have connected Iraq and North Korea.  [LAUGH]  I do -- I don't know.

L:  No, me neither.
R:  [LAUGH]  I guess, I mean I heard that -- that North Korea says well if we attack Iraq they're afraid they're going to be next, so --

L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess -- but um.
L:  I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  But -- yeah -- in the um, in 'Twenty Four' it looks like in the next episode they're -- they're, you know, in just the preview that looks like there's doing a lot of -- like rioting and everything in LA after the -- the --

L:  [MN]
R:  They -- the bomb actually went off in the desert, um, but --
L:  Ooh.
R:    anyway, it will be interesting to see how they -- they handle that, it's very, you know [LAUGH]

L:  And that show's supposed to be pretty realistic, right?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it is, um, it's a "on the edge of your seat" kinda show.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my sister is a big fan.  She says, "You need to watch it" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe some day I will.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, you might.  Maybe too late to catch it this season.  You might-- might see it next season.  We actually started with the, you know, last of their first -- the first one.  We -- hardly watch any TV, that's like the only show I actually watch.  [LAUGH]

L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  But we somehow got into -- kinda by chance tuned into
