L:  Hi, my name's Stacey.
R:  Hi, I'm Melissa.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  Do you want to start?
R:  Sure.  Okay, we st- we'll talk about comedy here. [LAUGH] Um, what kind of comedy do you find humorous?
L:  Well, actually the question I got was, "Where do you draw the line between bad taste?".
R:  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying -- I mean, is it, I mean, where do you draw the line?
L:  I don't know that there's a specific place.  I don't know that it's a hard and fast thing.  It's one of those things like, ah, whichever judge it was that was speaking about pornography that said, "I know it when I see it".
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I guess -- i- in fact I've had a lot of discussions about this, um, with my husband.  He's British and his take on comedy tends to be somewhat different than mine and I found that when we watch Absolutely Fabulous that some of the cruelty in it really bothered me but cruelty in other comedies doesn't bother me and I haven't been able to determine exactly what makes that difference for me, which makes this kind of a hard discussion because it's not like okay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rule one, rule two.
R:  Right.  I think cruelty and racial issues are a problem.
L:  Yeah, I could easily agree with that.
R:  Um, now offensively I don't think bad language could be considered to me, offensive.  I mean some people may but, you know, if you're letting your kids watch it, you know, then, yeah, that would be a problem but like they say, turn the channel. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Entirely different standards for children --
R:  Right --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- and I don't really think comedy is for children in that standard.
L:  Well, I think there's -- there's child appropriate comedy but it tends to not be nearly as amusing to adults.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, one of the things I find interesting is, I enjoy The Simpsons a- as I notice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all my comedy references are television.  Probably doesn't say really great things about me --
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, um, --a- and I c- it -- it amazes me when people let children watch The Simpons.  It just does not seem like a children's program to me at all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, because it is quite frequently crass.  I wouldn't want to be explaining to children a lot of the jokes on The Simpsons --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but I don't personally find it offensive for me --
R:  No.
L:  -- just not child appropriate.
R:  No.  Um, there are com- comedians out there that, you know, do the racial thing, the racial slur.  I don't believe that. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Excuse me. [LAUGH] I don't think that should be included, you know.  I think comedy can be funny without putting people down in a racial sense.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if you're bringing up a situation where you've been in, I believe that's okay but, you know what I'm saying, like a child heard[?] situation or something you've been through personally but directing different races or things like that.  Taking advantage of that to make people laugh, I don't, you know, I don't really get that a lot of times.
L:  Yeah, that is a very delicate line --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- one -- one I would stay far, far away from.
R:  Mhm.  What kind of comedians do you like?  I mean, who -- who are some of your ...?
L:  Um, I -- I actually love Robin Williams --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- although a lot of his work --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- leaves me flat, especially some of the later stuff but his earlier stuff, um, I think in high school we used to listen to, I think it was called Robin Williams at the Met, over and over and over --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which, looking back now, I think maybe that wasn't age appropriate for high school students --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but we thought it was a riot.
R:  Right.  Tha- that's what, um, -- we liked Eddie Murphy back then, you know, and of course he's not age appropriate for high school students either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He can get quite offensive, you know, especially for younger kids that don't understand what he's really talking about.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's part of it, is understanding the material, you know, before you can draw a line -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, I really like Robin Williams and, ah, I think the things he talks about -- he takes world problems and tries to make us laugh about it and feel good about it.  I don't think he tries to offend anyone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I've also seen Damon Wyans, I think he's really good.  And he can be offensive [LAUGH] but in a way he -- he makes it funny too, you know, but I don't know, um --
L:  They're not straight out comedy but I love Penn and Teller.
R:  Yeah, they're good.
L:  Cannot get enough Penn and Teller.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I watch a lot of the Comedy Channel.  Do you ha- get that?
L:  No, no I don't.
R:  They have some, um, really good comedians that can just bring it out, you know, like Robin Williams can and turn things around that -- then there's some that just, you know, talk about stuff that, [LAUGH] you know, just doesn't really need to be talked about to make people laugh but I -- I don't know.  There's -- there's really, like you said a fine line.  I think it depends on the personality of the person --
L:  Well, and -- and it entirely depends because I -- I can't for a moment deny that South Park is offensive --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I love it.
R:  I do too.
L:  Absolutely adore it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because it -- it's done -- it's done well.  I mean it's equal opportunity offensive.
R:  Right and it's everyday life.  Some of it's everyday life, you know what I'm saying.  Especially, you know, when you were in high school and it -- sometimes it brings back memories of things that you did.  Stupid stuff that you did but, you know, it's really -- I think it's hilarious.
L:  Anyone who can come up with underpants gnomes[?] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm on it.  I'm there.
R:  Exactly.  It's hilarious.  But, actually, what's another show, um, I'm trying to think.  Now, how do you like Saturday Night Live?
L:  You know, I used to watch it just loyally, um, but now I -- I have to say that I've -- I rarely catch it because, you know, it seems to go through phases.  It'll be really good and then really bad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I feel they're going through a -- a not so impressive phase right now, although it's been so long since I've watched it, they could be brilliant again and I wouldn't know.
R:  Yeah a lot of that I think has to do with cast, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, the cast and the writers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and right now I -- well I can't say right now very fairly, but the last time I watched it -- it -- there was just, you know, the sketches dragged on way too long, they were a little too predictable --
R:  And not very funny in the comedian sense.  They're just --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they've lost that edge.
R:  Yeah, you know, and sometimes less is more, you know, like they say, sometimes just the acting out can be more funny than -- than all the talking that they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially like Mad TV, I don't know if you've seen that either, but that is just -- ooh, sometimes that, to me, is not as classy as Saturday Night Live.  Not that Saturday Night Live is classy, but you know what I'm saying, it's not as -- I guess the writers aren't as in-depth with some of their stuff.  It's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they take whatever is in the topic and, you know, in the world and they make fun of that or they make fun of singers a lot of the times and -- and sometimes it's okay and sometimes it's just not funny, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not comedy.  But I think the old time comedians are the best, you know, like you said Robin Williams and people like that.
L:  Monty Python.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Never get tired of Monty Python.
R:  I think the older ones are better and I think they come across with their messages about, you know, there's a message there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, trying to make people feel good, try- -- that's really what comedy is about, you know, not trying to get one race mad at another race and, I mean, I -- I love black comedians don't get me wrong, I love them, but sometimes they can really toss it out there, [LAUGH] you know, and things like that but it's just -- I guess it's like I said the personality and the person that -- that really has to accept what's being said, and you know, and get the message and understand the comedy.  But I'm like you it's just -- Robin Williams is hilarious.
L:  Hard to go wrong with him.
R:  No.  I've se- -- have you seen him recently?
L:  No, I haven't actually.  I think, ah, probably the last -- I'm not sure what was the last thing I saw him in, because a lot of his movies run together these days because there's -- he's kinda -- he's got a shtick going at this point but, um --
R:  [MN].  He had a -- a HBO [inaudible] about comedy, um --
L:  I did wanna see that and I haven't.
R:  Tha- oh, I cried.  I was in tears laughing so hard.  I mean, I really was and it was just really good comedy and --
L:  I should make a point of renting that.
R:  -- it was just the old, you know, I mean it was just him and, you know, when he -- when he messes up or drops a bottle of water he turns that into a joke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he just can't go wrong. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he does -- he's someone that I think if you had to spend time with him in real life he'd probably drive you insane --
R:  But, you know, I've heard --
L:  -- but on stage, he's brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
R:  I've heard that about him, um someone was talking about how they were trying to do an interview with him and he just went completely off -- off the subject.  He did not answer personal questions, you know, he doesn't talk about his private life so he'll just --
L:  You know, fair enough.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  He just completely turns it around and goes somewhere else, you know, like he'll start screaming, "Oh, my God, there's Ninjas on the line" and, you know, out of this world stuff, [LAUGH] and you have to laugh because that's just, you know, the way he is but I really -- I really like his HBO special.  If you ever get a chance, you need to see that.
L:  Yeah, should make a --
R:  Especially if you like him.
L:  Yeah, I do.  I should make a point of seeing if it's on video.
R:  It was really good.  I don't know, it should be.  It should be on video, um but that was probably about a year ago when I'd seen it, maybe six months ago.
L:  Okay.  
R:  It was --
L:  Do you enjoy life comedy at all?
R:  I have actually only been to a comedy club once. [LAUGH] I just don't have the time to go and it -- to me it wasn't as -- the -- the person that I saw was not really that funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was like f- f- you know when they're out there and they're trying -- trying to get you to laugh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to me when they're trying too hard it's not funny.  When it's just in their blood to do it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's when it's hilarious.
L:  Yeah.  You know, most I -- I do have -- it's not quite the same thing, but I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler.  He has his moments --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I used to love it on Saturday Night Live when he would crack himself up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of the time I have no patience with comedians who --
