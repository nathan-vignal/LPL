L:  My name is Michelle [inaudible].
R:  Ah, my name is Ed Dunn.  We -- we -- we're okay there?
L:  Hey there?  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Now th- --
L:  Do you want me to go ahead and start talking?  [NOISE]
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Is this about the, er, war or something?  Is that what you're saying?
R:  It was on terrorism, right.  How you would react?  How other people would react?
L:  If -- if there was, er, terrorism?
R:  Right.  If you were faced with that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Well, I -- I think -- what I think here -- I don't think that they should go to war because it's going to be a lot of lives that are going to be lost at this time and, I mean, I think that we should just try to ... deal with the terroris- not deal with the terrorism, but try -- try to cease it as much as you can and try to, um, get as many weapons as we can from them.  I mean, because I don't think war should be the thing that we need to do because [NOISE] it's just right.  And then, like I said, lives are going to be lost and families are going to have to grieve.  Which everybody's grieving now because of the terrorism and I mean it's just -- it's not just Saddam Hussain and ... what's the -- I can't think of the other man's name.  [NOISE]
R:  Bin Laden?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Bin Laden.  I mean there's -- there's so many people that are -- that have weapons and that could destroy the United States or all the countries that I mean ... they should try to stop everything, not just one -- one place.  You know, it just seems like he -- first he's on to Bin Laden about the terrorism.  Now he's on Saddam Hussain about it.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I --
L:  And, I mean --  [NOISE]
R:  I was going to say that I kind of -- I kind of agree with President Bush though, that the -- the UN --
L:  For war?
R:  Pardon?
L:  You go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  Okay, I -- I agree with President Bush as -- as far as that the UN gave him an ultimatum to, you know, disarm himself and he has ignored it, and I -- I --
L:  Who, the UN?
R:  The -- no -- yes.
L:  What --
R:  Saddam, --
L:  He didn't ask -- 
R:  Saddam -- 
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- has -- has ignored the UN.  Saddam Hussain has -- has ignored the UN resolution to -- to disarm these things.  To get rid of them.
L:  Well, not totally.  He has disarmed some ways, but not -- [NOISE] well he hasn't done -- I guess I -- but what the thing is, okay we have weapons of mass destruction in the United States.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] So, what is the big deal with the UN having weapons of mass destruction?  I mean, the United States wants to be the only one with mass destruction?
R:  Well, when the original agreement was made, it was between United States and Russia, and they agreed to, you know, do away with certain types of weapons.  United States destroyed theirs, but Russia never destroyed theirs, so now, that leaves the United States in an untrusting form.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's exactly what's happening with Iraq with this situation, is that he says he is, but we know from -- satellite observation that the stuff exists.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We know from talking with his own people, the stuff exists, which means he is not following the rules that were set up by the United Nations, and I think that it's unfortunate that the rest of the world doesn't realize that what President Bush is trying to do is to get this guy to -- what can I say -- conform to -- to the rules that everyone else is living by.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, but if we go to war, then what?
R:  Well, it's unfortunate --
L:  I mean what i- i- -- I mean if -- is -- okay, well we go to war.  Is -- is all the weapons going to be destroyed?  [NOISE]  The weapons of mass destruction.  Or are they still going to be there?  We just going to war because he's not given them up?
R:  It's basically because he is defying and not giving them up, that's right.
L:  But I'm saying, when we go to war, if -- that's not going to make him give them up because we go to war.  [NOISE]
R:  No.
L:  If he's not --
R:  What it's going to do is probably destroy him.  See, I -- see I agree that Iraq has -- has been mismanaged for many, many years, and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I think that getting rid of him would straighten out a lot of problems in that area of the -- of the world, because he is being so defiant, you know, just kinda like a -- ah he -- he's setting an example which is a bad example.
L:  [NOISE] But what about the ones that's not against, er, that's not with him.  We -- I mean, everybody's against war.  Mo- well, most of the people are against war.  [NOISE]
R:  See, I can --
L:  And, I'm --
R:  -- I can agree, I'm against war, but somebody's got to get in there and straighten him out because he won't listen.  He won't do what his -- what -- what the world is telling him.
L:  [NOISE] But it's --
R:  On one hand he agrees to do it and then he turns around and doesn't.
L:  [NOISE] And then, and when he does it -- if -- and like he's accumulated more?
R:  He's accumulating more?
L:  [NOISE] More weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Yes, that's -- that's what they feel he is doing, is -- is -- he is making more.
L:  [NOISE] That's what I'm saying, so -- 
R:  Well, see, that's why they --
L:  W- --
R:  -- have to get him outta there.  You get him outa there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and the weapons will probably disappear.  It's -- it's his ill leadership that is really causing the problem.
L:  Okay, but we -- we get rid of him and then what about the other people that's got weapons of mass destruction? [NOISE]
R:  Well, ah, everyone else a- as far as I know, is -- is abiding by what the -- the United Nations has set up for the -- the guidelines for these particular weapons.
L:  Korea?
R:  Ah, Korea?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, North Korea has -- they haven't done anything yet that is, er, against the guideline.  You know, they're not supposed to have a nuclear bomb.  Well, they don't at this time.  Yes, they -- they're opening up a nuclear, um, -- ah, power plant again, but they don't have a bomb yet.  So, they haven't really broken any of the rules or the guidelines that were set up.
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  Nobody -- nobody wants them to have the weapon.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, obv- obviously they feel they need the weapon, but I think --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I think they're still part of the communist regime that would -- that would just as soon take over the South Vietn- -nam, as well -- er -- Korea, South Korea, North Korea, and make it all one.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But the south doesn't want to be part of the north.  You know, it's again -- again one -- one civilization is pressing it's will on another.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  At least that's what they wanna do.  You know, they wanna have control of everything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, it -- it sh- -- it shouldn't work that way, people should -- should have the freedom to choose.
L:  [NOISE] Well, yeah.  [MN]  You know, just seemed like they went -- well people shouldn't take life so lightly though, so...
R:  Well, over there they take life pretty lightly.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  They -- they seem to kill each other off pretty easily.  They -- they don't have a -- a whole lot of concern about life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that, I mean that's something that I don't really understand.  I mean, I'm an older person.  I value my life quite a bit.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  I value -- I value the people around me -- their lives quite a bit, but to -- to think that, you know, well, just because I don't like what this person stands for, I should put a bomb on my body and go blow him up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as well as myself, that, you know, that doesn't make any sense to me.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  But, over there they think it's -- it's perfectly all right to go put a bomb on a bus and blow it up and -- and kill forty, fifty people.  I -- I don't think that's the way things should be done.
L:  [NOISE] No, no, should never take a life.
R:  And getting rid of Saddam Hussain --
L:  And the people that live over there, they do have to live with fear 'cause they don't know where he gone.
R:  Oh -- right.
L:  [NOISE] Just storing him, or stop him -- giving him food or -- you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They -- like the [NOISE].  Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yes, I'm here.
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay.  I thought you'd hung up.
R:  [LAUGH]  No, no, no, I'm here.  Yeah, Bin Laden is -- is a lot of the money behind these different, er, things that go on over there and that's why they want to get him, because then they can stop the money flow.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  It will make it harder for a lot of these terrorist people to do what they've been doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it -- it only make sense that if you cut off the money flow, things are going to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going to come to a halt for at least for a while, but I mean, you know, he admittedly is behind a lot of the -- the terrorist acts that have happened in the past ten, fifteen years.  Well, that makes him just like a -- what the Nazi's were.
L:  Okay, we look.  What -- what I'm trying -- what -- what I'm try -- what I'm saying is is, how did it go from Saddam  -- not Saddam, but Bin Laden to -- to him?
R:  To -- from Laden to --
L:  How was -- I mean, 'cause they don't work for the same org- terrorist organization [NOISE].
R:  Well, they -- they claim they don't, but -- but there is -- there's gotta be some connection between them.
L:  Well, you think?
R:  I think so, yes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
R:  Because they're both defying things.  I mean, one guy's been hiding out for how long, eighteen, twenty-four months?
L:  Yeah.
R:  He won't come out in the public because he knows he's done wrong.  And then of course, you take -- er -- Hussain.  They -- they say right out, he's got a half a dozen doubles.  He doesn't come out in the public either.  Why?  Because he knows he's wrong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He knows he shouldn't be doing what he's doing.
L:  Yeah, but he got his whole country covering up, hiding him out.
R:  Well, he's got them -- he's got them so scared ...
