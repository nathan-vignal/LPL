L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello, my name is Jack Loy[?].
L:  Hiya, my name's Jenny Nelson.  [LAUGH]
R:  Jenny, is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi, Jenny.
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, how are you?
R:  Just fine.  I understand the topic that we're supposed to be talking about is terrorism --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and specifically how we think people would respond or react -- whether they'd be panicky, or whether they would remain calm.
L:  Mhm.  Um, so what do you think?  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I -- I'm sure it depends on the situation and the severity of, ah, whatever the terrorism would be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, it's -- I guess it's impossible to predict exactly how somebody would react or respond.  Ah, I'm a rather conservative, calm type of individual --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I would remain, ah, calm to a certain extend and hope I could, ah, accomplish something by being calm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, on the other hand, my guess is most people would not be calm.  I -- I've seen all kinds of, ah, ah, news casts about the World Trade Center situation, and obviously most of those people weren't calm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, I -- I suppose I wouldn't have been very calm either had I been in that situation.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think, um, if we have more terrorist attacks, people -- I -- I know, myself, I would remain calm, but, um, just -- I was at campus when the World Trade Center went down.  Everybody was [NOISE] just like freaking out, so --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, um, I don't know.  [NOISE]  I guess it -- usually what people believe is, you know, um, affects  [NOISE] how they will react in certain -- certain, um, circumstances, but, um, yeah, it's scary.
R:  I believe that, ah -- ah, again, depending on the absolute situation if you were in a airplane or something and there were terrorists aboard, you -- you probably would react differently --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- than, ah, if you were in -- on the streets or in a mall or something like that.  I'm sure that, ah -- ah, you would react differently.  I don't know exactly how you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would react, I think if I were in a mall or in a situation like that I would -- I would, ah, certainly try to do something about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, if you're in an airplane, I think you have to evaluate what your chances are or perhaps overtaking somebody, or -- or who's involved --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- and what they're gonna do
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  So, I, you know, I think the situation dictates how you would react or respond to any situation.  I -- I do not believe that very many people would be calm about it, ah --
L:  Yeah, me neither.  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just in a situation within the last month or so, where, ah, I was in a public place and -- and, ah, one -- one person physically attacked the other person over a relatively minor, ah, a minor incident --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I was -- I was very close by, and actually was, ah, involved in breaking up the fight.  But, there were probably twenty five people around ju- that just sat there and looked at the situation without taking any action whatsoever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that really surprised me, that, ah, that -- that's certainly not terrorism or anything even close to it, but there were an awful lot of people who -- who made no attempt to get involved --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and do anything about it.
L:  Yeah
R:  I was both disappointed and -- and surprised that that was their, er, way of not dealing with the situation.
L:  Yeah.  There was a, um, an incident kinda like that happened by me where a guy was shot while pumping gas --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and there was like three other people outside that saw the whole thing and everyone just went about their business and nobody went over to help him out or anything --
R:  Huh, huh.  Again, not directly, ah, to the issue of terrorism, but it -- it's really, ah, surprises me also that, er, several people can see the same situation and -- and report totally different things, like --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- people weren't even in the same area.  Eye witness reports will say, "Well, this is what happened", "Well, no, that's not what happened", so that, a- again, in a terrorist situation, I'm sure people that would get excited and -- and if y- -- you tried to repeat or report on what happened, you'd get totally different, ah --
L:  Yeah, that's correct.
R:  -- eye witness viewpoints.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think the other thing that goes through my mind, is in -- in, um the way that we've been brought up in this country, we haven't really had any, ah, need to think very much about terrorism or-- or protect against it, or plan for it in the eventuality that it did happen, and ah, obviously other people in other parts of the world have -- have had to, er, live with this and endure it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- it for some period of time.  Ah, just recently, when people came out and said, "Well, how are you going to protect yourself in the event of a terrorist attack?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my -- my response was, "I don't have the slightest idea what I would do, or how I would do it".
L:  Because you don't know exactly what's [NOISE] going to happen. 
R:  No, you don't and can you really protect yourself?  Ah, I live in an area where, ah, I can't believe that we would be very high on a -- on a target list --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I can't think of anything that I would or should be doing to protect myself against something that ah --
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  -- that would happen.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  So, those -- those are the kind of thoughts that -- than run through my mind and, ah, I guess that you never know how you're gonna respond until --
L:  [NOISE]  You're --
R:  -- the situation actually occurs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we can say that, "Yeah, we'd remain calm" but -- but, ah, how do you really know how you would respond or react?
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I'm -- I'm calm in other kinds of situations and -- and in situations where other people seem to be very excitable.  Ah, er, I'm not excitable to that degree at all, so I think from my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- past experience of knowing myself, I'd probably be reasonably calm.  I think I would try to do something, ah, and I'm not sure what, but I don't think I would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just sit back and --
L:  And watch.
R:   -- let something take place without making an attempt to do something.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  So, do you think --
R:  Well, I think -- I think the other thing is you have to evaluate.  You know, what -- what can you do, what should you do?  And, these things happen in a split second, er, going back to that situation where there was a -- there was a somewhat little skirmish that turned into a fight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was a decision that was made in a matter of a second or two, and er, sometimes your emotions take over and you do -- just do what you think you have to do.  Ah, and -- and again, it just depends on different people's personalities.  Some people just back away from the situation, they don't wanna get involved, they don't wanna get hurt, they don't wanna do anything, but certainly, ah, er, that doesn't seem to be a very logical thing to do either.  You -- you try to do something.  You try to take care of the situation at hand, whatever it might be.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Um, so, [NOISE] yeah, what do you think we're going to have many terrorist attacks with, ah --
R:  Oh, golly, I hope not.  Ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think that -- I think that our government is doing everything they can to try to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- identify those who might be involved and, ah, do something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a preventative basis --
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm sure that they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- done many of those things already.  Ah, you -- you have to believe that there are those out there, those terrorists who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't like our way of life and don't like our freedoms and, ah, are going to do everything possible to disrupt it and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- and hurt us.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Ah, there's all kinds of "Hate Americans" around and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, you know, I don't we're fully capable of comprehending why they hate us to the degree that they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but it's certainly obvious that they do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that -- that's sad, but I think it's a fact of life, er, we have things that they don't either understand or appreciate, or are envious of, or jealous of.  I don't know, maybe some or all of those things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we, ah, we have been so fortunate to live in this country and be protected by our, er, by our freedoms and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, er, by our democracies and other people around the world just don't get it, they don't understand that, so --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that -- that's just the way it is and I think we have to do everything we can to prevent, ah, terrorists from -- from doing things that do in fact disrupt our -- our way of live and our freedoms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I think we are to a great ex- extent as we possibly can.  The thing you hope that we don't get so blase that, ah, we -- we don't heed the warnings of -- of government.  You already hear, "Well, what specifically are they gonna do?"  Well, you know, we don't know specifically what they're gonna do, or  -- we've got thousands --
L:  Yeah, that's the scary part.  [NOISE]
R:  -- Well, we've got so many, you know, thousands and thousands of targets that --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, as soon as you let your guard down, er -- er, they might do something and these -- these people seem to be willing to just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lay in the weeds forever, until -- until they spot a soft spot or a weak spot and -- and then go after it and unfortunately our freedoms have protected these people to a great extent --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- by letting them come into our country and -- and ah, you know, the things that have made us so good and so strong are also things that --
