L:  Hi, I'm Maria Wakefield
R:  Hi, I'm Troy Cox.
L:  Hi, Troy, how are you?
R:  Well, fine, how about you?
L:  Pretty good.  So where do you draw the line on, um, acceptable and bad taste humor?
R:  Ah, it's just a matter of time.  I think anything's on, given enough time, you know, like a tragedy such as nine eleven.  Right now would still be tasteless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, still [LAUGH] -- well actually it's still, ah, I guess pretty tasteless to make Pearl Harbor jokes, so -- I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- guess there hasn't been enough time, but I -- just about anything else, I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not easily offended.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How about you?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think -- I think too -- I think when there's, like, serious things that, um, where many people are involved and many people have actually gotten hurt, I -- I just think it's in bad taste to -- to make fun of it because I -- I think in a way, um, people are sort of expressing their own views which is okay to do, but it may not be the view of the masses. [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN] Like --
L:  -- and so, I think it does -- I think that gets tasteless as well.
R:  I haven't been online today, but I'm sure there's plenty of Elizabeth Small[?] jokes out there.
L:  Oh, I know --
R:  But I --
L:  [NOISE] -- that's awful.
R:  -- yeah, I would find that in very bad taste.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I would too, because my mom talked to me about it this morning and she's like, "They found that girl" and I had actually not even, you know, thought about it for a while and my first thought was, "Well, that's wonderful" but then, as soon as my mom told me that she -- that he ha- you know, he thought he was Jesus or something, I thought, you know, "Here comes all of the jokes" --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- you know, it's going to be terrible.  [NOISE]
R:  Eventually yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Do you find that there's a problem, um, like say, I don't know if you're married or do you have a girlfriend, but say you take her out to a, um, a comedy act or whatever, um, what draws -- what do you think draws the line for that?  When you're going to go see a comedian?  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  I don't know; what do you have to say about that?
L:  Well, I personally think, um, I think sort of making a -- a humor about certain groups I think can be in bad taste.  Especially if you're -- if you're talking to a mixed crowd.  You know what I mean?  Like, ah -- um, you know, different race or -- or whatever, I think that could be in -- in bad taste.  Um, and then I -- I think too, I think there needs to be a -- I mean if you know that you're going to go see a comedian that, um, does a lot of, lets say what, pornographic [LAUGH] -- pornographic stuff, um, that's one thing that you go someplace where you think it's going to be clean fun and stuff like that comes out?  I think that's in bad taste.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, a lot of pointless, you know -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- blue language, yeah --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- I find that offensive as -- and it's not funny.
L:  Right, right.  And it just makes it uncomfortable, I think too, especially if -- if the rest of the room doesn't think it's funny either, um, so I don't think I would want to be a standup comedian.  I think there's too many things that you have to be politically correct for.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's only the person that you're with if they don't think it's funny, then ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And then you have to think, "Well what do they think of me if I think it's funny?"
R:  That's right, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you laugh and don't say anything.
L:  Which makes it hard.
R:  Yeah, it's best to avoid that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Haven't been in that situation yet that I can remember si- --
L:  I don't think I have -- well, I don't know, I think we've watched, like, the Comedy channel at home and my -- and, you know, I mean, I've been married for twelve years, so I know that my husband finds humor in some things that I just think are stupid, you know, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, like the --
L:  -- but that's fine.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sure, like The Man's Show[?] I mean I can't help but laugh at some of the stuff --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- they do there even though I know I shouldn't.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know I'll probably laugh at something that he, like, would never understand if it's a women thing, you know -- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but, um, I think that doesn't, -- I don't think that, ah, I don't think that's the issue about i- in bad taste.  [NOISE] Um, have you ever gone -- have you ever been in an experience where -- where either -- even, like, at a party if somebody was talking about something if there -- if a line was drawn?
R:  Well, I -- I perform on stage a lot --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yes.
L:  Awesome.
R:  So, f- like, er, for instance I can remember one time and ah, are you an Nascar fan?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'm not, but I -- I was in Anderson, South Carolina, which is like Nascar --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Central --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all down there[?], so when Dale Ernhart died, ah, it was I think more as a reaction to Elton John, you know, perverting Candle in the Wind every time dies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I wrote my own version to Dale Ernhart and I started playing on the stage that night, then the -- the drummer went over and cut off my mike [LAUGH] which is --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- yeah, because he says, "Man, you trying to get us killed?"
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And, I thought, "Well --"
L:  So, are you in band?
R:  Ah, I was at the time.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  I'm not doing anything right now.
L:  Oh, that's cool, though.
R:  So, I guess I've been as much a perpetrator of it as anybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I -- I knew most people in the room and I figured they were hip enough to pick up that I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I was commenting[?] more on Elton John than I was Dale Ernhart, but --
L:  Right --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- but it's the situation.
R:  Yeah, except that --
L:  Probably if you hadn't been where you were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it would have been fine --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but because of where you were it was taken the wrong way, probably if you had been, you know, any place else or unless you were with a bunch of Elton John fans [LAUGH] you know, I think it has --
R:  But, you seen unfor- unfortunately now, that -- yeah, it wouldn't go over now because, ah, well there again, you know, time works -- works against that type of thing because it's not topical any more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that song wouldn't be funny now.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, so is this the first time you've ever -- well we have to stay on the topic don't we?  [LAUGH] Ah --
R:  Yeah.  It has to be on the question.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  How long is this supposed to go on?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I'm trying to think.  Like, when my husband and I went to Los Vegas, okay, this is a good example.  My husband and I went to Los Vegas and I went to -- I took him to see, um, Licarsho Foe[?] which, I don't know if you know -- 
R:  Oh, I -- yeah, I've seen the movie.
L:  -- it's all male impersonators.
R:  Yeah, I've seen the movie.
L:  Huh?  Yeah.  Well, my husband didn't know that and I know that I had said it to him before I went and of course I was cracking up because they just -- they're hilarious.  Um, and my husband was actually cracking up too, and -- but once he found out that they were men, he was very uncomfortable and he didn't think it was funny at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I notice they're gays when they're on stage --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they -- I mean, there's like nothing off limits and you can --
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  And it was like, you know, I told him that's what we were going to go see, but I think why he got uncomfortable was because, um, I think that, ah, um, maybe, you know, they were coming and sitting on his lap and -- and you know, he was laughing and everything and after they left I was like, "You realize that's a man, don't you?"  [LAUGH] And he was like, "Ew" [LAUGH] -- so --
R:  Oh, yeah, I've been to drag shows and they can -- they can get away with anything.
L:  Oh, I know.  It's hilarious --
R:  My big --
L:  -- and a- again if you're there and you know what it is, then for me, it's not bad taste.  You know what I mean?
R:  And see, they could s- --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- they could say almost anything like, ah, like in reference to Elizabeth Small or make a redneck joke or whatever --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- and say -- then if you were to call them down on it, then, you'd be seen as -- as being prejudiced against --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, being homophobic.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  No, I have seen -- I've seen some cross the line, that I even felt for them was in bad taste, um, when it's -- but I mean, then again it might just be because I'm not, you know, I'm not gay so therefore I found offense to it, but I don't know, but, um ...
R:  Yeah, it's tough for a -- a straight white.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- to get away with anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, a straight white American, I should say.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I even think it's in poor taste sometimes too, like when, ah, African American comedians are up there and they're, [NOISE] you know, making fun of Afr- the African American culture.  I think that's in bad taste.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, yeah, I don't like how ah, it's so easy now, you know, to joke about the French which --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- I find that slightly offensive --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and of course, I -- I'm still waiting for Eastern Indians to take up arms I -- I think because they're still trying to indoctrinate themselves into this country --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they're trying -- you don't see them out with placards --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- like you would even American Indians, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Now, you can't say anything about them anymore.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  It's like East- Eastern --
L:  Well, that's like, -- just like the American Indians wanting to go after the Redskins Football Team --
R:  Sure, and the Braves.
L:  -- because they -- I mean like, it's -- [SIGH], so -- so I think it -- it can get out of hand.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, sure, I'm -- because I, you know, and here with the Atlanta Braves, I mean, there was a gigantic --
L:  Right, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [inaudible] ha ha over that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's ridiculous -- it's ridiculous. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I guess I've never been -- I -- I mean, I guess if -- I don't know, I've never seen -- I'm -- I'm partly Italian, um, Sicilian actually, so, you know, sometimes when they, you know, you get the stereotypical "Every Italian is a Godfather", that gets on my nerves sometimes too, but, I don't know.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Of course you've got people protesting shows like the Sopranos, too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- but --
L:  Well, and I -- I mean, you even have Italians protesting Sopranos because that's not the norm and I think that when people watch the T- -- watch TV, um, they feel that that is the norm, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, anybody that actually lives in the outside world beyond a TV surely can tell that it's -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- you know, it's just a lampoon, it's -- [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Well, no -- that was like the whole thing, you know, with everybody, you know, with, um, with everybody, um whatchamacallit, um, -- just lost my train of thought.  With everybody, um, thinking that all Italians were part of the Mafia, you know, when The Godfather came out.  People were up in -- up in arms about that because everybody -- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  I remember.
L:  -- everybody was like -- it puts a bad -- bad name to the Mafia.  [LAUGH] I mean, I mean to the Italians.
