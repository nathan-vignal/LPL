R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Pat Sullivan.
L:  I'm Kathy Hacker.
R:  Hi, Kathy.
L:  Hi.
R:  So, what do you think about this terrorism things?
L:  Um, I don't think very many people would stay calm.
R:  No, I don't think very many people are calm at this point.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] we're not even -- you know, there's none to be -- that we know of that right now attacking, and I know that it's something that bothers me every day.
R:  Well, I know when CNN started saying about the duct tape and the -- and the plastic, our Wal-Mart ran out of duct tape because people are so scared that we're gonna be attacked.
L:  Oh yeah, I mean, around here people were petrified.  You know, my girlfriend and I talked on the phone a lot about it, and you know, I have old windows and I have old doors, and we kinda laughed at it, because at the point -- you almost have to laugh to get through it.  But I said, you know, it -- no amount of duct tape would seal my house.
R:  Do you have children?
L:  Yes.  I have three.  Do you have children?
R:  Are they young children?
L:  I have a very young two year old, and I have a eight year old and a ten year old.
R:  Mine are all grown and I've got a grandchildren, and that worries me, that everybody would be scattered, that I wouldn't know if everybody was all right, and I wouldn't be able to get in touch with everyone.
L:  Yeah, that scares me.  I also have two brothers that are in the military...
R:  Oh.
L:  That are going.
R:  Anybody that's shipped out yet?
L:  Um, no.
R:  Wow.
L:  But by the end of the month they both will be.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  So, you know, that's a constant on my mind thing.  And, ah, you know, the terrorism facts are just so mind boggling and scary that I don't -- I don't know that I could be calm knowing that they were attacking right now.
R:  Do you really feel like they're going to attack us?
L:  I do think it's possible.  I mean, they did it with no aggravation, you know. 
R:  Well, with nine one one, yes, they did, but these things -- if they were to take the time to do these kind of things, which I don't know that they're going to have the time because they're -- they're gonna be under attack themselves.
L:  Yeah, I definitely think that's helping.
R:  Um, but I think that, um, if anything were to happen, and not to say that I would rather be it somewhere else, but I live out in a rural area, and if it happens it's gonna happen in New York City or Washington DC or Los Angeles.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Or one of the population capitals where they can kill more people than they can kill out in rural areas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm really not that -- that worried about myself or my own home.  I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like I say I'm worried about my family being -- my extended family, my brothers and sisters and cousins, not being -- not being able to find out if anybody was hurt or -- um, I definite- --
L:  Yeah, I think that's my biggest fear. 
R:  -- we don't have anybody that's in the military at this time, thank goodness, but, um --
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's definitely -- I don't know that it's more scary, but there's more people at risk.  I have a lot of friends that are also in the military, so I know about fifteen people...
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  ...that are involved, and you know, the bag -- the big thing with me is fear in numbers.  The more people you know going, the more likely --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you are to know somebody that doesn't come back.
R:  Somebody's not gonna come back, yeah.
L:  And, you know, that's definitely something that fear -- that I'm afraid of, and I'm afraid that -- I agree with you, I don't think they're gonna hit rural areas, I think if they do attack I think they are gonna hit more of the big cities because they want to hurt people, more people, but I do live close to a big city which makes it more for -- more fearful for me.  Um, and I do fear for the family factor.  I don't live close to any of my family, so if they did start to attack or we did start to have something go on here, it would be very hard for me to get in contact and to be close to my family.  And that would be something --
R:  And that in itself causes its own kind of panic.
L:  Oh yeah.  Anxiety all the time, I think.
R:  And I think that the -- the terrorists did -- when they, when they hit the Word Trade Centers, they accomplished more than they could of ever dreamed of.  Not just knocking down the towers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and killing three thousand Americans, but they --
L:  I agree a hundred per cent.
R:  -- they threw a whole country into -- into a...
L:  A fear.
R:  A fear of, this can happen to us.  But because before September eleventh we would never have thought this could of happened to us.
L:  No, we were untouchable in our minds.  They would of never -- why would anybody want to just attack us?  You know what I mean?  Like that's -- a lot of people felt that way.  Why would you even want to attack us, for -- you know, what are you gonna gain?
R:  Well, because we give billions of dollars away every year -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- thinking that we're doing good, and now we're being told that we're arrogant and we don't give our money to the right people.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, heaven forbid, it's our money, can't we give it to who we want to give it to?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  It's kind of one of those -- and not to use the language, but you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
R:  That's right.
L:  That's the way I kinda look at the whole factor with this.  I don't think I -- we could do anything to make it different.  Just like, you know...
R:  But I do still feel like that diplomacy needs to be given a little bit better chance.  I'm not saying we shouldn't go in and get rid of this man, because I do feel like eventually we're going to have to do that, [NOISE] I thought that ten years ago.
L:  Right.  The guy's never complied.
R:  But, ah --
L:  He's never done anything to change.  He's never going to change.  But do we feel that -- my biggest thing with all of this is, the war, I'm all for finding the terrorists, but why we're going to go over there and mess with Saddam Hussein, who I understand that he, you know, gives money to terrorists, but he didn't do the World Trade Center.  Let's find the terrorists and kill them, then worry about everyone else.
R:  I mean, I think we should keep the pressure on through the UN --
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  -- but I don't think that we should go in without the support of the United Nations and the other world powers.
L:  I'm definitely afraid to go -- the fear that we're going in alone.  Now I understand, and George Bush would say, you know, but we'll win regardless.  It's not the factor of winning.  I agree with him.  I do think that we'll win regardless.  It's not so much the winning, it's how much life do we have to give up to win?
R:  Right.  And well, I came up through the, through the Vietnam era.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I'm not so sure that we're gonna win regardless, because we did not win in Vietnam.
L:  Right.
R:  And most -- I had, you know, lots of friends that went over, a brother that went over, they came back -- some them came back, some of them came back sick and hurt, and some of them didn't come back.  Um, but -- 
L:  But it drastically changed all of them.
R:  It also changed my opinion of -- first off, can we believe everything we're being told?
L:  No.
R:  And can -- can we actually win?  I mean, if we were just going to fight this one little country, but is the rest of the Muslim world going to jump in?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or are the North Koreans going to say, oh, look, they're busy down there in Iraq, let's bomb them.
L:  Yeah, let's get them now.
R:  Let's get them now while their backs are somewhere else.
L:  While they're weak.
R:  So, I -- and they supposedly have nuclear weapons, and -- 
L:  Which is a whole other subject, I can't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I -- nuclear -- you might as well just blow up the planet.  I mean, if you're going to start a nuclear war you might as well just forget it, 'cause my thought on the nuclear part of it is, if they use any nuclear weapons they're gonna kill everybody.
R:  There's nowhere to hide.
L:  There's nowhere to hide.  You're gonna ruin the whole planet.  'Cause if they hit us we're gonna hit them, and the next thing you know the whole world's gonna be destroyed.  So I don't know why nuclear has to be brought into it at all.  I think it's a very scary factor.  I think terrorism in itself is -- the fact that people have been brainwashed to believe in a god that wants you to kill other people, and I almost -- and I know this is going to sound hideous, but I almost feel bad for the men that killed themselves, because they killed themselves believing that that's what their god wanted them to do, and now they're burning in hell for something they thought was the right thing to do.
R:  Yes.
L:  It's a shame.  I mean, if you start to really look into terrorism, it's a shame.  There's --
R:  But then we have had holy wars all through -- all through the last two thousand years.
L:  Oh yeah.  I mean, they're always going on.
R:  In the name of religion more people have died...
L:  Oh yeah.  Look at Jerusalem.  [some inaudible words]
R:  Isn't that a shame.
L:  Oh, I mean, they're --
R:  Look at what's going on Christmas Eve in the holiest part of, of the land, the, the place where we feel like is the most holy, and --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's God's chosen place.
R:  -- they were having bombings, and...
L:  Yeah.  They're killing people there.  I mean, every day it goes on there.  What happened to us on September eleventh happens in other parts of the world constantly.
R:  Yeah.  Well, especially in Israel.
L:  Oh, in Israel it's just --
R:  You've got to feel sorry for those people because they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- live with terrorism all -- all the time.
L:  Always.  And you know, that's one thing --
R:  They can't get on a bus without wondering whether or not it's gonna be blown up.
L:  Yeah.  Are they gonna survive the bus ride.
R:  Some people -- those poor people that were having their wedding reception and had a bomber walk in and blow them up.  That, that's a shame.
L:  It is insane, and the fact that these terrorists believe they're doing the right thing is insanity to me.  How can you -- how can you ever justify killing people that you don't even know?  I mean, I don't even think you should kill people you do know, you know what I mean?  Even if you hate somebody it's not right to just kill, it's not your choice to kill people.  So for these people to have been so
