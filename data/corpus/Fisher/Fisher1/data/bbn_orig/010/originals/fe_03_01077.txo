R:  I'm Serena.
L:  Hey, I'm Greg.
R:  Hi, Greg.  So, what do you think about perjury?  Would you do it?
L:  Perjury.  Wow, there's a chance that I could do perjury for a close friend.  But, you know, we don't --
R:  You have a hypothetical situation in mind, or ...?
L:  Mm -- do I ha- -- no, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  [inaudible] where are you, by the way?
R:  I'm in, ah, New York.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my f- -- this is the first one of these I'm doing.
R:  I've done it a- several times before.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I just don't know.  I don't think I would.  I don't think for the little things that it's that important, so why do it?  And then for the big stuff, I think I would say, "Well, if it's big then the truth is important" but, then again, you know, I'd never really thought very much about it, so --
L:  But what if it was a -- a perjury issue but there were extenuating circumstances --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- but as -- as far as the law is concerned it's black or white, but in reality the wrong thing is going to be done and it's especially going to be done to the wrong person.
R:  Right.  Then, you know what, I might have to think about it more, but then again, I mean, like I said, I'd never even really thought of a situation, so it's hard to say.  I mean, I've seen things on TV where people have to make those kinds of decisions --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I sort of just watch and go Hm, tough one.
L:  Yeah.  And I think there's probably a lot of movies and TV shows that that's exactly -- that's exactly the topic that's a -- it's a tough decision and there's a lot of players have to make -- make tough decisions somehow --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, well, I d- -- I think for most of us, we probably -- it probably feels black and white, I mean, you want to do the right thing, you want to follow the law, but that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't -- that isn't always logical --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, boy, I'm just trying to think, I mean, there must be some movie that comes to my mind that -- that's exactly the topic, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, ah, what was the one where, um, ah, they -- the guys, let's see, no, that's not a good example, plus I don't even feel [several inaudible words] so that wouldn't work out.  I don't know, I've not been in a situation -- situation quite like that.
R:  Yeah.  It's hard to say.  Like, like I said before, I mean, if it was something small, I'd say, "Why risk being punished and why bother with having that on my conscience if it's something small?" --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and if it's something big, then maybe the truth is important if it's something big, but [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  True.  I'm -- I'm with you all the way.  All right.  So, what -- what are the purpose of this whole study, do -- do you know, like, is it just --
R:  I --
L:  -- for the voice recognition of the system?
R:  I don't know --
L:  Is that what you --
R:  -- if it's for the system, or if it is for, um, to actually record, um, people having conversations, um, but I know it has something to do with linguistics, that's all I know.
L:  I gotcha.  Okay.  All right.  So, gosh, we don't have a real g- -- I'm just trying to think of how we can continue the conversation on this topic --
R:  I know.
L:  -- if we don't have a specific sample and we haven't really thought about it.  So --
R:  Well, I'm trying to think, have you ever heard of that book, uh, like the question book, the book of questions where they give you several moral situations and you have to work your way through them?
L:  Yeah, I've heard of it.
R:  And I think that I encountered questions similar to this, you know, what if the, you know, the wrong person was being accused of something and you know that -- you knew the truth, but the only way to, you know, get the truth out was to lie, that kind of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, the whole, would you do it?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, I think that, uh, at that time, you know, I was in middle school when we were asking those kinds of questions --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I think as a child everything seems so black and white --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and of course I always said, "Oh, no, never" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  The truth will always prevail anyway in the end.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the right people will win.  But --
L:  But now we know better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.  I -- I guess, you know, overall that's [MN] no matter how you want it to be black and white, it's going to be -- it depends and you're really not going to know it till it -- till it comes and bites you in the face before you have to decide because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if it's -- if it's a matter of, um, you know, something that would send your -- send a friend or your mother to jail because -- because of something that happened that was probably out of their control --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, most of the people you know are very, very good but sometimes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to protect, you know, protect people on, um, -- on a different level, you're going to defend them, to, you know, whatever it takes and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you put yourself in jeopardy.
R:  Well, I can think of a situation where, you know, I did the wrong thing trying to defend somebody, ah, I know my sister was in the hospital and I really didn't think there was anything wrong with her and they wanted to keep her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I argued against keeping her there and she got to go home and then ended up going back the next day and I sincerely thought that the motivation of the doctor who was trying to keep her were, you know, false and he just didn't know her, you know, and I kept saying, "Well, look, she's never spent the night alone in her life, she's eighteen, this'll be a horrible thing if you made her spend the night alone" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "without her family" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the doctor's sitting there thinking obviously there's something wrong with this family then --
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm sitting there thinking, "How could you do this to her?  That's a horrible thing to do".  So, I mean, I know how I react when it comes to defending family, whether for better or for worse.  But, ah --
L:  [NOISE] Then if a similar thing came -- came up, you may make similar decisions, right?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] If you think it's right.
R:  As much as -- yeah, I mean, I'm -- I -- now I know, but, you know, and I -- I'm sure the doctor was thinking, "Man this is how it always is, we're trying to work with families, families always try and get in the way" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm sitting here thinking, "Oh, wow, he actually did know what he was talking about" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] shocking thing.
R:  Yep.
L:  All right.
R:  All right, then.
L:  Well, did we make ten minutes?  I -- I r- --
R:  I haven't been watching, but it sure feels like it.
L:  It does.  It does.  I'm not sure we're ten -- I'm -- let me see, I -- I think we're like at seven, actually.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Keep --
L:  So, what -- what other -- what other kind of subjects have you had calls on?
R:  Um, I had a call on, I'm trying to think, ah, what did I think about the school system, if it's going from bad to worse --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the country.  And, ah, I think not.  I think that's -- it's being going from bad to worse ever since school systems were ever invented --
L:  You think it's rock bottom already [LAUGH]?
R:  Well, I -- I mean, I think that that's always a concern in every society at every time period, they all -- people always think that everything's bad --
L:  Right and the world's always coming to an end.
R:  -- in the school system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  So, on that -- I mean, whether or not it is bad is another thing, but I think that the concern is always there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I can't remember other ones.  This was the one that I think I felt the least prepared to discuss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just because I haven't really talked about it a lot.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I didn't know if this was going to be -- I didn't know how many people participate in the, and it sounds like it's going to be two everytime.
R:  Um, it's two everytime.  Um, oftentimes I have a hard time, I'm on hold for a long time while they look for someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but in the last few weeks there have always been -- there always has been someone there, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think more people are starting to participate.
L:  Yeah.  I just got -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just got laid off my job and was surfing around, found this and said, "Well, why not?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I study linguistics, so I heard through the grapevine that there was a -- an experiment going on, but obviously I can't know what it's about, otherwise it would, you know, not be right.
L:  Yeah.  And be -- decue[?] you.
R:  So, I -- I don't know what it is.  I just know it has something to do with linguistics, so, having done many projects before where you had to search out people, I was like, oh, well, I'll -- I'll do that, definitely because I know what it's like to try and look for people to volunteer for things --
L:  Help -- help out their brothers, huh?
R:  Yep [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I -- I heard of, um, a lot of companies are now sending their computer support and things like that to India --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the one -- one new opportunity that's opening up is for Americans to go there and just talk with them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and talk about this is the way somebody might state this issue and this is the way you need to address it and basically the linguistic, but also the, ah, the cultural --
R:  Right.
L:  -- details --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, I don't know, they're kind of interesting things, so maybe they're going to send our conversation to India.
R:  That I- -- that is actually very interesting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've studied similar things, um, where the -- the level of language at which we make our sort of habitual lines of speech, ah, vary from culture to culture and how you can cause communication problems trying to use what you think are the habitual, you know, formulaic expressions that someone else doesn't understand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whether it be intonation[?] patterns or, you know, it could be at a -- another level, but used to e- -- express sort of cultural information.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's a very interesting topic.  Yeah, the -- the big thing in linguistics right now is obviously, um, phonetics and phonology and the whole computer stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Computational linguistics.  That's a big one.  And that's where the money is, really.
L:  So, are you still studying, or are you out and making some of that money?
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm writing my thesis right now.
L:  Okay, so you're making no money.
R:  Making no money.  No.
L:  [LAUGH] All right.  Well, I think we have made our ten minutes now.
R:  Oh, all right.  Well, you take care.
L:  Okay.  Have a good one.
R:  All right.  Bye, bye.
L:  Bye.
