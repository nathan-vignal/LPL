L:  [COUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Ah.  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Angela Jones.
L:  Yes.  I'm May.
R:  May?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  It's nice to meet you.
L:  And likewise [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] And what do you think, would you leave the United States for a million dollars?
L:  [NOISE] I don't think so [NOISE].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think so, no.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, so, what do you want to know, why wouldn't I?
R:  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you?
L:  Why wouldn't I?  Um, well, [LIPSMACK] um, at my age it would be much too difficult to start over again and with the stipulation that I could never return, I'd be leaving family behind and, ah, that would be like giving up my life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, um, [SIGH] no, I -- I would not, you know, if there was a time limit of, say, five years [LIPSMACK], um, that would be worth considering but for a lifetime, forever, ah, no, definitely not [SIGH] within my realm of consideration at all.
R:  Mhm.  Huh.  Okay.  W- -- what would you -- what is most important to you about the United States, what reason, I mean, besides your family and ah you said -- but are there other things about the United States that would make you feel that you wouldn't ever leave?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [LIPSMACK] I really think that we have the best healthcare delivery system in the world, um [LIPSMACK], and I do have medical issues that require not necessarily ongoing treatment that is crucial, but ongoing checks and if it did become a crucial situation I, um, I don't think I could get the quality of care elsewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I could here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so that is very important to me.  Now, if the question was, would I go and live in Mexico, the answer would be different, or Canada, because, you know, I could have easy access to the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- United States, but, um, no, the thought of going overseas -- and I have lived overseas so it's not a foreign idea to me -- um, and it's -- it's wonderful to live in a country other than the United States --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, the forever piece makes it an easy no.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [SIGH] All right.  Well, I think I would agree with most of what you said, too.  My -- I wouldn't -- I don't think I would leave either, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- may -- for different reasons -- um, par- -- partially because of my family, I have a, um, a -- my husband and I have an eleven month old little girl --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that would be -- that would be very scary for me, being far far away from family to -- that could --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because I depend on my family a lot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to help us with -- with our daughter and --
L:  Sure.
R:  --um, so, I -- I think -- I think that I would have to say no also, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I mean, I wouldn't e- -- I don't think I would even consider it for a -- for a time period --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because I've never been overseas, so I -- it's kind of fear of the unknown --
L:  Okay, sure.
R:  -- um [LAUGH] I've never -- I've never -- I've been to Mexico --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but nowhere else, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- um, um -- 
L:  All right.
R:  -- so that -- I mean, I must admit it was now, like you said, Mexico or Canada, having a close proximity to the United States might be a little bit different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I do -- I have had a -- a very close friend who lives in Canada and he, ah, had -- had talked to me a lot about their medical care and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in Canada and how, you know, they don't -- they don't -- it's not as expensive to get medical care as it is in the United States --
L:  Right.
R: -- it's -- it's more -- it's kind of rationed almost --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, everybody gets medical care, but you don't so much get to choose ah your doctors and -- and the type of care that you get, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everyone does get care, whether they're rich or poor --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- which I like that idea --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R: -- but --
L:  Well, they're more into a socialized medicine situation --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, certainly I -- I hope that at some t- -- point in the near future we can change our [SIGH] medical system so that more people can have, um, quality healthcare insurance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] because that's a huge issue in this country --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  -- just a huge issue.
R:  And it's probably going to continue to be a huge issue for a long time.
L:  Right.  I think so.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yes.  And I'm very fortunate, I have excellent healthcare coverage and I don't what I would do without it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I have used it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have needed it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  Yes.  And that freedom to choose your -- your doctors and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the type of care that you want is -- is --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- definitely something that's important.
L:  That is a biggie.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, and I think also that, I mean, um, I just feel safe in the United States.  I mean, I know after the events of the last couple of years that I mean I haven't felt as safe as the- -- I have in the past, but -- but I -- I -- I still feel like that the -- the United States is probably the safest place in the world to live.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  Right.  Right.  An- -- and you know, there is no safe or perfect place anymore --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, you think you know alot about other countries, but I don't really think you do until you are there and find out first hand um, have you seen the movie "Catch me if you can"?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Well, it's an excellent movie, it's very entertaining and it's based on a true story, a man named Frank Abergnail[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he wrote a book on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on, ah, the whole thing.  Do you know what it's about?
R:  Uh-uh.  No.
L:  Okay, it's --
R:  Is it playing in theaters now?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Okay.  We don't get to the movies very often with a baby [LAUGH].
L:  No, I'm sure you don't [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can understand that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but anyway, it's about a young man who at the age of sixteen became a scam artist --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and he would pass bad checks and he did absolutely preposterous things, he passed himself off as a [LIPSMACK], ah, trans or one of the big airlines, ah, companies as a pilot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he passed himself off as a doctor, he passed himself off as an attorney, but the biggest thing that landed him in jail and gave him a prison sentence was his, um, financial, um, what should I say, his financial, ah [LAUGH] crimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what they were, crimes, he just passed a ton of bad checks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but anyway, he -- the law caught up with him when he was in France --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was put into a French prison and this was as recent as nineteen seventy four and, um, he was in this French prison for six months and had absolutely subsistence food, it was like bread, thin watery soup, he had no toilet facilities, um, literally he had to sleep in his own, um, feces and urine --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and when he came out of there he was very, very ill, I mean, close to death --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I guess my point is, nobody hears about that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if that happened as recently as nineteen seventy four --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it probably is still going on.
R:  Probably.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  Anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just one of those things and it's not important, but I know that I'm supposed to keep talking so --
R:  [LAUGH] I know --
L:  -- I'm talking [LAUGH].
R:  -- it's hard [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, [MN] that's -- that movie that you just ex- -- the movie that you talked about, um, my parents were out -- out of the country in Mexico a- -- about, oh, a year and a half ago and my m- -- my mother got her ID and her wallet stolen on the airplane on the way to Mexico on --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- vacation, so she had no ID to get back on the plane to get out of Mexico --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- and -- so, they spent, um, oh, a -- a big part of their vacation trying to -- to find out how to get, you know, her --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- some ID so she could g- -- be able to leave -- leave Mexico to come back into the United States --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they ca- -- came in -- in all this process of trying to y- -- talk to the authorities and stuff in Mexico, they learned -- ah, they met a couple that were on their honeymoon and the couple had been put in jail --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because th- -- they had rented a car and apparently the husband had made a -- an illegal U turn and the police had thrown him in jail for a U turn and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they had told him they would let him out if he gave them all their cash and his wife's wedding ring --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they'd just gotten married, so he swallowed her wedding ring --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in order to keep from having it taken by the police.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So, I mean, I don't know a- -- the -- I don't know what ended up happening to him, but my parents had -- you know, that was when they came back and told me that story that made me so thankful for the United States --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and for the way, you know, I mean, you can -- you can trust most of the a- -- authorities here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I mean, yes there are some that you can't, but o- -- on the whole you can --
L:  On the whole, you w- --
R:  -- you know, and --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- so it -- that [LAUGH] that just made me --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- realize how fortunate we are in our country that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you can --
L:  What part of Mexico did they go to?
R:  It was, ah, let me think.  Oh, I cannot, it's -- it's a resort, um --
L:  Is it on the westside or the eastside of Mexico?
R:  I believe it's on the westside.
L:  Mm.  Okay.
R:  Ah --
L:  Puerto Viata[?], Mondeneo[?]?
R:  I think it might have been Puerto Viata.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think that's where it was, maybe.  I --
L:  And it was stolen on the plane?
R:  Yes.
L:  That is so bizarre.
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they were with a big group
