L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Leah Moncus.
L:  Hi, um, Leah, I'm Joe Patricia Erenstein.  It's nice to talk with you.
R:  Nice to talk with you, too [COUGH].  Well --
L:  So, how's your day going?
R:  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Just staying at home taking care --
L:  Now, what's our topic?
R:  Ah.  If either of us would lie or perjure ourselves on the stand for a friend or a relative.
L:  Perjure ourselves ab- -- for a friend or relative?
R:  Uh-huh.  About anything.
L:  What do you thi- -- w- what do you -- what do you think, um?  What would you do?
R:  [MN] I wouldn't.
L:  You wouldn't?
R:  No.
L:  Good answer.  You sound like a Christian woman to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A good Christian woman.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, I consider myself that, but I just don't -- if -- if somebody wants me to lie for them, they're just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not the kind of person I need to be around anyway.
L:  Right.  Because, you know what that winds up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- happening, it -- it -- nothing good can come of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I mean, no matter what it is, um, Leah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nothing good can come of it.
R:  Yeah.  That's how I see it too.  Now, what about if it was like your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like your child or something?
L:  [NOISE] Well, again, you know, I -- I -- I'm -- I'm, I belong to the Atlanta Church of Christ --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm really a different kind of person now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I really, really stick to the ten commandments --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I- I- I'm -- I just -- I'm not going to do it.  I'm -- see, the reason I'm not going to do it is I'm going to, um, [NOISE], you know, I- I- I'm -- I'll pray to God that God would save my child's life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I don't worry, Leah, because what I do is I cast all of my fears onto Jesus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what he wants me to do --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- so, I have faith, now, Leah, my faith is a lot different than it used to be, you know --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It is.
R:  So, that was a recent thing for you, then?
L:  Um, well, I was baptized, ah, in June of two thousand and two.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, I'm -- like I said, you know, I -- I'm trying to live a really good Christian life now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Leah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm trying to, you know, imitate Jesus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as much as I can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you from?  You sound like a southern girl.
R:  I'm from Georgia [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  Oh, really.  Yeah.
L:  I'm here in Atlanta.
R:  I am -- well, I live in Le Grange, right now.
L:  Oh, do you like living there?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Why not?  Do you feel --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- cut off f- -- from --
R:  Yeah.  And it's, ah, um, um, it's a very narrow minded town to me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very close minded, they're just --
L:  Are you married, Leah?
R:  Yes.  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so, I -- I guess you -- may -- maybe it's real -- a real gossipy town is that right?
R:  Well, I- -- it's kind of like that, but it's also, it's -- it's, um, who you know and heaven forbid somebody down the street should find out something about you or everybody knows what you're doing and they have a say in your business kind of that [inaudible] --
L:  Right.  Everyone's -- they -- they don't have lives of their own, so --
R:  Yeah, I guess.  Country club kind of town.  Very, ah, very clique kind of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And I wasn't wa- -- raised in that type of atmosphere.
L:  Now, how'd you meet your husband, Leah?
R:  Um, I met him at a mutual friend's party, Christmas party.
L:  Oh.  Now, did -- so, did y'all -- is -- was he born in Le Grange or ...?
R:  Yeah.  He was born here.  He was -- he's born and lived all his life here.
L:  Now, where would you live if you could?
R:  Um, Atlanta or New York.
L:  Oh.  Well, why don't y'all come on move to Atlanta?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Come on, I'll talk to your husband for you.
R:  Okay.  Will you? [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, now, what -- so, lying, we're supposed to be talk --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would you lie for a -- well, anybody?
R:  I have before, like, before I actually decided that it wasn't the right thing to do and that, um, God was convicting me of that.  In fact --
L:  Oh, totally -- well, I -- I -- you know, I've -- I've lied for people and if I do, I do it occasionally, I've got to catch myself because I'm a -- I'll tell white lies which --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot -- that's still a lie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, w- -- I think, you know, the thing is, though, people really don't see that as -- as a lie --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, as -- as long as you're not, you know what I'm saying, making things sound too bad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, there are a lot of forms of lying.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's lying by omission, too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well --
L:  You know, and even like you're in church and you see some woman you don't really like and she's wearing a -- an ugly hat and, Leah, you and your husband she comes up to you and you say, "Oh, I love your hat" and you don't mean that.
R:  Right.  Well, that's what I tell my husband --
L:  But y- --
R:  -- I say, if somebody -- he asks me all the time, if, well, you know she's just got her haircut, well, I tell him, if -- if I have to lie to her because, say, it -- it did look bad, then I'm not going to say anything about it because then I'd be lying to her --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I said, "Oh, your hair looks good" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, or something like that.  So, I just don't say anything.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  There you go.  If you can't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, that's the way I was raised.  If you can't something nice, don't say anything at all.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I wasn't actually raised like that.  I was raised in a very bad home and my lying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- came from the fact that I always had to protect myself or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or my siblings, so it was --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- it's a different -- it's a different time now for me.  And I want to raise my daughter differently and I don't want her --
L:  How old's your daughter now?
R:  She's six months.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  Just had her.  So, I try to --
L:  So, um --
R:  -- protect her from that kind of stuff.
L:  So --
R:  -- I don't want to lie to her and I don't want her lying to me and I don't want her lying to protect somebody else, so I want to set a good--
L:  [NOISE] And you don't want --
R:  -- example.
L:  Yeah.  You just don't want to start lying because then lying's like a bad habit, it's just like any other bad habit --
R:  Yeah, it's hard to break.
L:  -- it will -- it will keep getting -- you'll keep doing it, you'll keep getting, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bigger and -- I mean, it -- it just tends to, it's just like anything.  It will keep growing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the more you feed it --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know --
R:  And sometimes you lie so much --
L:  Well, I -- I'm -- I --
R:  -- you forget --
L:  Leah, I'm an actress here in Atlanta --
R:  That's what I'm trying to be.
L:  -- and I did a show called In the Heat of -- h- -- In the Heat of the Night --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- out in Covington --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  And I'm doing a play now --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.  And I have to learn my lines and, oh, my gosh, it's hard work.
R:  Is it really, see, when I have to learn lines, everybody's amazed because I don't know how it happened to me, but I can just read it one time and I have them memorized.
L:  Oh, you -- well, you'll be a good actress --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, now, what, um, oh, getting on these reality TV shows --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people lie to -- in my -- see, in my business, Leah, you know, lying is, now of course look at -- look at what happened at Georgia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, look at the academic fraud.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Ooh, boy.  And what about that guy George O'Leary, he's a major liar.
R:  Really.  Really.  But then --
L:  See, he lied about where he taught football --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I mean, lying, you know, lying seems very harmless at first, I think to a lot of people, Leah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then of course it could be the end of your career --
R:  Definitely.  We've seen that the past couple of times in the news.
L:  Right.  And look at all these, you know, look at our world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  What a frightening world --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Leah.
R:  Right.
L:  It doesn't it -- doesn't it kill you to think that this would happen in our lifetime, Leah?
R:  Um, well, it seems to me that people have gotten so just I guess, jaded and have forgotten about --
L:  God.
R:  -- God and where -- where people -- I don't know, I think people have become more pessimists, thinking that everybody's bad and I don't see everybody that way, I see everybody -- somebody's got some good in them somewhere if you can just bring it out in them.
L:  Well, yeah, and the thing is, lying or any -- you know, you can learn how to be good or, b- -- or bad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like you're teaching your daughter, you're going to teach your daughter, you know, to be good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, she -- and she's going to grow up in a good atmosphere, but, you know, it's -- you -- n- -- the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
R:  Right.
L:  Right, Leah?
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  So, if you teach your la- -- if I teach my children to lie, they will be liars, Leah --
R:  Yes.  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
