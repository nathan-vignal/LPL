L:  Hi --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- this is [inaudible].  Hello.
R:  Hi [LAUGH] my name's John, what's yours?
L:  Simone.  Hi, John.
R:  Hi.  Ah, well, it's kind of a, I don't know, it wasn't the question I was waiting for [LAUGH] some --
L:  I was kind of surprised, too [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, I didn't -- to me, it's [inaudible] I don't know, I -- I -- I was looking for something a little bit more, a little maybe politically charged, I mean, a million dollars to leave the United States, ah, that might have been a good question to ask thirty or forty years ago, but a million dollars wouldn't be anywhere as near enough to get me out right now [LAUGH].
L:  Boy, I could echo that.  I really can.  Um, I love this country, um, I -- I can't see any place else I would want to go knowing I could never come back here and a million dollars wouldn't give me a quality of life that would make that in any way irresistible or enticing.
R:  Yeah.  There -- um, there are a few places that [COUGH] you could probably talk me into going, ah, but a million dollars wouldn't be enough to do it to -- to cut you off from a country, you know, to -- you -- you know, for the rest of your life.  I -- I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't like the f- -- finality of the, ah, of the offer so to speak.  I could go someplace I could, you know, I've always thought of, ah, maybe New Zealand or Australia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Th- they --
L:  What attracts you about those?
R:  Well, [COUGH] I don't know, there are a lot of things about this country that I probably we're all not real happy with, one thing or another --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one side or, you know, another and I'm sure every country has its own problems, but, ah, I- -- it's I don't know, I -- I think w- -- we've, ah, I don't know if we've over civilized ourselves here, or -- or, you know, I -- I think we -- a- -- as a country we're try- -- trying to, ah, outsmart ourselves or out think ourselves --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so we've made life awf- -- awful complicated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it would be really nice if we could simplify things a little bit more.
L:  So, you like the newness of Australia and New Zealand, they're not quite--
R:  Yeah, I- -- you know, it's just ano- -- it's another --
L:  -- complex --
R:  -- place that's been settled, I don't know, for -- for a shorter period of time, plus --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what I've seen, ah, especially New Zealand, looks really beautiful.  I really want to go there someday, but, ah, it's not someplace --
L:  Doesn't it look gorgeous?
R:  What?  Yeah.  I -- I mean, it -- you -- you don't get everything out of watching Lord of the Rings, mind you, but [LAUGH] --
L:  I was just thinking about that when you said --
R:  -- but it -- it does get --
L:  -- it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Well, it is -- I mean, it's where it was filmed and it is -- it is gorgeous and I've seen a lot about it.  It is one of the places I do plan to go someday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, I don't know.  I -- I don't -- I don't know as it really matters if we get that far off topic, because it's -- it -- it was a rather easy question to answer.  There wasn't a whole lot of, you know, necessary discussion [LAUGH].
L:  That's true, you're right, the finality of not seeing friends, not ever returning to your -- your home, your way of life, your family, that's -- ooh, wow, that -- that's too big.
R:  I mean, I'm -- I'm not even --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I mean, I'm not necessarily ecstatic about where I live now, but it's my home and it's where I've been and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't know, what -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in California.  What about you?
R:  California?  Have you always lived there?
L:  No.  Born in Chicago, raised in New York, dragged to California, now wouldn't leave [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That kind of explains -- my wife is from, uh, oh, from Illinois, but, ah, just north of Chicago, the northern suburbs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm, ah, we're in -- well, just, ah, maybe forty miles, thirty or forty miles west of Milwaukee in Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, really?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's where my ex husband is.  Well, not in Milwaukee, he's in Wisconsin, although I don't know the landscape well enough to know where.  I just know that it's, um, it's very pretty in the pictures and there's a lot of land and, ah, a lot of snow in the winter [LAUGH].
R:  Well, [COUGH] we actually haven't been getting an awful lot of snow lately.  As a matter of fact, ah, today we were outsi- -- I was outside in my t shirt.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Of course, you know --
L:  That's fabulous --
R:  -- yeah, well, it -- --it's -- it's been the first really nice day, it's supposed to be that way tomorrow, you know, too, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that's -- you know, one of those things that I -- I'm -- I've become kind of unhappy with the area that I was born and raised in, I mean, I -- I'm forty years old and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what's happened in the last thirty years, just, you know, with the build up and everything, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- used to be a lot more farmland in the area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now -- now you can't -- you know, I have a friend who would like to buy a farm in the area and all the farms have been turned into subdivisions, so the land prices are just so incredible.  I mean, I'm sure it's nothing compared to out California.  What part of California are you in?
L:  I'm about twenty miles south of San Francisco, um, in one of the areas that used to be a farm that is totally built up and they're trying to -- to get every square inch out of now, so I can totally relate to what you're saying.
R:  Yeah.  I was -- I -- I'm -- I'm, ah, real interested in the, ah, you know, here we go getting off topic again, but the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the politic aspect of the things that have been going on in California and what not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the, oh, lack of resources, electricity, water and what not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has that been, ah, major problem for you out there?
L:  That hasn't been a problem for me at all.  Um, I've been one of those people that has not ever been touched by the water shortage, ah, even when people around me were, I wasn't affected by the major earthquakes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, a lot of people I know were, ah, for some reason the area that I lived in has just been, um, untouched.
R:  Yeah.  It's gonna be interesting as the population keeps expanding, especially if we keep having such dry climate, I mean, it's just -- it's been getting drier and drier, plus I don't know, where does a good portion of the water, does it come from, ah, is it the Colorado River that gets shipped over to you from, ah, other States, or --
L:  Most of our, ah, most of our water comes from Lake Tahoe and Nevada --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the runoff from all of the mountains --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so in the years where we get really good snow we don't have a water problem, um, and our climate used to be wetter, we used to have consistent rain.  What happens now is we have periods of dryness followed by torrential rain, um, so it -- it is changing as we're increasing our demand for water and I -- I don't know where that's going to go and I don't if developers have any concept of that, or the alleged planners --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not quite sure how they got that name, but, ah, I'll go with it for the moment [LAUGH].
R:  Well, it's -- it's what -- and it's what I've heard from, i- in another context, that, you know, we plan for the next, you know, ten years whereas in some of the older countries they plan for the next hundred, you know, it's a whole --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- different concept and, ah, I know because, ah, ah, one of the things, there's Nevada, their population is, you know, really exploding and they're -- now they're getting kind of jealous, you know, of, oh, where's all our water going and plus there's a lot of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, ah, um, energy being generated, you know, a lot of -- now there's -- I'm trying to think, now, um, ah, was it Hoover Dam is that -- that's at Lake -- is that in, um --
L:  No.
R:  -- Nevada?
L:  I don't think we're Hoover.
R:  Ah, and I'm trying to thi- -- because I was there.  My -- my in laws live in Vegas --
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Well, then you know how much that's grown, that's just amazing.
R:  Yeah.  That's, yeah, they live out there, ah, a lot of my fa- -- a lot of people [inaudible] I could never -- that's -- that's like an alien landscape to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it really is.  I mean, I have -- I have fun going out there.  Three days is enough.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm such a poor gambler I can't afford more than three days at a time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, it really is an alien landscape.  I've only been to California once --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even that kind of strange, I -- I need the change of, ah, seasons.  I don't --
L:  Well, that's the thing I miss.  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's like, what you get right now is, um, like I said, I was out here in my t shirt here today, well it got to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sixty one degrees --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but when it's been twenty below, that feels like eighty.
L:  Wow.  That makes for -- that makes a lot of sense, it really does.  I -- I miss fall tremendously and while we do have spring here, um, without winter, it's not -- you know, it's just colder in the winter and it's wetter, it's not like spring and the fall where you really feel it sort of new promise and everything has that -- that sense of growth and it just smells different and feels different.  I do miss that.  Immensely.
R:  Yeah.  Around here, fall is my favorite time of year.  Spring tends to be, wet, you know, with everything melting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what not.  You get kind of muddy.  But fall we have, a -- especially, ah, the -- the latest, um, you know, I don't know, ten years, it -- the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I believe the climate is really has changed because I can remember so much more snow when I was younger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, right now, um, we have days in November that are, you know, get into the sixties.  It gets kind of, um, how -- it -- it gets on your nerves after a while, honestly, I mean one of the things around here in Wisconsin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, a- -- at the end of -- at the end of, ah, November, ah, both weekends on both sides of, um, of Thanksgiving, is our big deer hunting season.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you're supposed to be out in the snow when that happens.
L:  Yes.
R:  A- -- and, ah, I mean, two years ago we got pictures of me out in my boxer shorts out on the pier having a margarita [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  It was just a joke, but I was got -- you know, it was so warm it just -- it's not supposed to be that way and -- and really it has a lot, it has not been that cold.  It gets cold a lot later in the year and does not stay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as cold.  This year we didn't have much snow.  Matter of fact, we had most of our snow here, I believe, in March and now it's all melted.
L:  That's -- that's amazing.  And yet the people on the east coast have really been blanketed.  That -- that is interesting.
R:  Well, it's just -- it's the weather patterns, I think, but the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- part of the problem
