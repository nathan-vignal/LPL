R:  Hi, my name is Christie Garrett.
L:  Hi, ah, I'm Michael.
R:  Hi, Michael.
L:  Hi ya.  So, um, I guess we're talking about, like, ah, I guess we're talking comedy then?  So do you --
R:  The -- yeah, the line between it. [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry? 
R:  Um, so what kind of humor do you like?
L:  Um, well, I d- -- I quite, I mean, I'm impre- -- I'm always impressed with a stand up comedian if they can -- if they can actually manage a very clean sort of act because, you know, we have some that really just do rely on swearing and nothing else and they claim the, you know, they're trying to be sort of deliberately provocative without really -- er, without really being very good and --
R:  Right.  I totally agree with you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I think it -- it's easily possible to, um, have a comedy act without all the swear words and -- and, ah, getting what shall I say, raunchy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, yeah.  I -- I kinda like the old type of, ah, comedy acts, like, um, oh, Carol Burnett, she did a lot of slapstick and, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was kinda funny.  I -- I kinda like [inaudible] type of humor, um -- whose type of humor do you like?
L:  Um, well, I'm f- um, we pr- I don't know the peo- -- the people who -- who I like, you -- you might not know.  I mean, I -- I just be- -- well, because I'm from Britain and so we -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- have quite different comedians to the comed- like nobody who I like anybody's heard of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of all my friends over here.  It's really unfair, I have nothing to talk about with people.
R:  I was gonna say, um, have you ever watched Whose Line Is It Anyway, but I think all those comedians --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- they're from, ah, Canada, but I think it originated in Britain, didn't it?
L:  Yeah, that's right because you have, um, I do like that and actually that's a good example of -- because the good ones are that really tall guy, um, Ryan Styles --
R:  Oh, Ryan Styles, yeah.
L:  -- and, yeah and the Ca- -- and, um, the Canadian, but there's a British guy called Tony Slattery --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he just swears and he's really unfunny because he c- it's like he really can't think of anything else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think that -- and that's like probably the greatest example of just someone swearing just because that's all they can do.
R:  Yeah, because they have nothing better to add to their act. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Who --
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  -- yeah -- Whose Line Is It Anyway though I think is a -- is a very good show.
R:  [SIGH]  I --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- think, ah, we need a lot of humor nowadays. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] But I guess there is a line between it.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I mean I have to say there are some comedians who I think can swear like quite well, like they can come up with a very sort of bad and cutting thing --
R:  [LAUGH] George Carlin.
L:  -- and you go, "That's a great ..." and you think, "Oh, I, you know, I wish I could think of that" but I wouldn't although you wouldn't actually say it in real life, but, um, it only really works on -- on occasion and if it's all the time then it's not really -- look at The Si- I mean The Simpsons are sort of -- what do you -- The Simpsons?  The Simpsons are sort of very, um, well, you know, it's supposed to be a kids' show but there's all sorts of, um things going on in the background.
R:  Yeah, it's not exactly for kids.  [LAUGH] I know what you mean.  It's not exactly for kids, um, but it is funny.  Um, I wouldn't want our, um, if I had a -- a real small child, I wouldn't want her or him to -- to watch it, but, ah, it is kinda funny for adults.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I must admit I do watch it.  Um, what was I going to say?  I like, um, Seinfield --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- because he can -- he can take just the most kind of mundane type of life situations that are -- are -- end up being, ah, humorous --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, he puts it into his act and -- and, ah, as far as I know, unless he changed his act, he's not smutty or offensive at all.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Well, I used to like to hear him.
L:  -- I was at --
R:  Ah, did -- did you ever watch, um, ah --
L:  I've -- I've --
R:  -- impromptu -- any of the impromptu acts?
L:  I haven't -- I haven't se- -- I haven't seen him do -- I haven't se- um, you know, I've only seen like the TV show and o- only then a couple of times.  Um, I've -- I -- I know the so- um, I -- I think I -- I think I might know, er, sort of, er, what you mean though.  There is, um, because, you know, there are so many comedians that are, you know, when you go to see -- when you go to see people live, I've been to see a few people live, they are very, um, you know, because they're so, you know, so rude and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I, well, you know, um, there doesn't really seem to be very much room or very much call for like a very sort of clean kind of family comedian.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and I of- -- and I often think it must be -- it would be quite difficult to be a sort of family comedian just bec- um, because it's very hard to actually appeal to sort of more -- well, it seems to me anyway that it seems to be quite hard to appeal to like a lot of adults and, um, and sort of younger -- younger children at the same time --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, because, ah, oh well, at -- at home there's a -- we have a comedian called Harry Hill and he used to be on sort of late at night just because he was -- just because of like, alternative --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- but he was -- but he m- makes a point of just being very clean and very good and they've sort of put him on earlier and earlier, but there's a few people who just think he's silly and -- and childish --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and although I don't know, I think it'd be quite a good, um, I -- I think he's particularly good.  Oh, hey, um, what do you think about, um, the rad- -- what do you think about radio comedy?
R:  Radio comedy?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Um, as far as I know, there isn't any, ah, lately.  I know way back there was, like ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Jack Benny.
L:  Ooh, I don't know that one.
R:  [LAUGH]  I know my dad used to listen to them and he used to tell me about them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They were kinda funny.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, didn't, ah George Burns and his wife, didn't they start out on the radio?
L:  George B- oh -- oh, I, ah --
R:  Like, Gracie.  George Burns and Gracie.  I think they used to be on the radio.
L:  Mm.  I think a lot --
R:  Yeah. It would be nice if we could --
L:  It's suppo- -- it's supposed to, well, I mean, I'm saying again from not -- not necessarily from the way it works in America but apparently it's quite a -- a good way to get into writing comedy is to start on the radio.
R:  Ooh.
L:  I quite like, um, a quite like radio comedy.  It's a different -- on the radio it's still [MN] a lot cleaner again because it all[?], I mean there's no such thing as late night radio really, er --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, actually apart from one show I can think of that's really bad but, um, so it's all, um, and there's been a number of sort of good series, good sitcoms that started on the radio that have ended up being, um, transferred to the television --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at least at home.  At least in Britain.  And it's still quite a vague, ah, thing like it -- it's m- radio comedy really is amongst most of listened to radio including sort of, you know, popular music shows and things.
R:  Ooh.  So what kind of, um, radio shows were there, or are there?
L:  Um, well some of them you can have -- you don't get -- like you don't get just like a sort of stand up kind of routine and sometimes you have like a spoof -- you see -- you might have spoof shows, like there was a good spoof news program --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it just made fun of the news and it did it really, um, and it wasn't sort of topical.  It didn't make fun of what was going on in the news, it made fun of the news itself --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and how self important the news is and how they love it if there's a war going on and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, you know, there's a good bit where he does an interview between Australia and New Zealand or something and he gets the two to go to war, um and li- the -- the -- the news anchor and then -- then when it happens the whole -- it's obvious like the whole studio there has already been set up and there are people all ready in the field and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, they, um --
R:  That sounds like it [inaudible] me.
L:  -- so -- so it is, um, or you might have actual just radio situation comedies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and -- and it's, you know, and it's -- it's play is all on obviously all on -- all on people's voices and there's -- and it's v- -- and timing is very important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, there's a few shows from the sixties that were really, um, like sort of bawdy and, um, I said bawdy because I thought it was an old fashioned kind of word, you know, kind of fits.
R:  Bawdy?
L:  W- --
R:  What does bawdy mean?
L:  Oh, it means sort of, um, like -- it -- it was quite, ah, um --
