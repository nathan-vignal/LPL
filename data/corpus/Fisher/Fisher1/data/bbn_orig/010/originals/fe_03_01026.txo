R:  He-
L:  Hello, my name is Rose --
R:  Hi, Rose.  This is Deb.
L:  And, how are you doing?
R:  I'm good, you?
L:  Oh, this topic has probably been on everyone's mind quite a bit lately with the --
R:  Yeah, I think you're right.
L:  -- with the upcoming war eminent as it is.
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know about your feelings, but I think that people would probably first be in shock and then panic.
R:  Ah, I think you're probably right.  Um, I -- I really don't think we've learned a whole lot and I -- I think that, um, I think that's kinda sad because it, you know, the -- the first attack that we had on September eleventh of course shook us to the bones because we weren't expecting anything and --
L:  Oh, I know, it was like so out of the blue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're so trusting, Americans.
R:  We really are in -- in -- in the full scheme of things and I think that, um, what would end up happening, [MN] is that we might get over the shock a little bit quicker, but, um, I -- I don't know if it would [MN]-- if we would learn to trust any more, or to let go of some of it.  I don't think we've become any more cynical.
L:  Yeah, I think it -- I think one more time would just kinda push everybody over the edge.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  It's like the first time it was such a shock, and now it seems like such a long time ago, but, um, and I think we all expected something to happen right away.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like in the first few months, but nothings happened, it's just going, going and I almost think that's part of their element of surprise, just waiting 'til we're not expecting it and just let us have it. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think you're right.  My -- my husband's in the service and I can actually say, um, I -- I want this to happen because I don't want -- I don't wanna have to wait f- you know, for another decade or something like that until they decide that we've become complacent again.
L:  Oh, I know.  They're -- they're -- they -- their mind set is so different from Americans and --
R:  You know, and I -- I -- I haven't figured out why they just absolutely hate us so much.
L:  I think jealousy and, um, I mean, y- look at our -- look at our commercials even on TV.  Everyone's happy, full of life and y- they never have that type of life over there.  It's always just constant fear, constant wars, con- constant aggravation, um, they never get a chance to enjoy their life.
R:  No, they don't.
L:  It's -- it's pretty sad.  I -- I'm very thankful I'm an American.
R:  Yeah, I agree, um --
L:  [LAUGH]  It's ah --
R:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  I -- I don't know how -- how -- how they exist like they do.  The -- the sad thing is, is that it doesn't have to be like that.
L:  I know, but it -- it's kind of like the communism countries.  They didn't know any better -- better until they were able to be free from that.
R:  Well, that's -- that's why we need to get the people out.
L:  Oh, I think you're really right on that one.
R:  You know, so that these people do r- learn to realize that there -- there's a -- there is another way of life and it's a better one, and instead of hating us so much, you know, it's kinda like "Take out your garbage first".  You know.
L:  Oh yeah, exactly.  But they're -- they're so brainwashed.  They're -- in a way they're just like little children.  They don't know any better so they don't ever think of anything else, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- argh!  What a way to live.
R:  Yeah.  How -- um, where are you living?
L:  I live in Washington State.
R:  Okay.
L:  We were stationed there for a while on  --
L:  It --
R:  -- Whitely Island.
L:  It's, ah, raining like crazy.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  We just lost our power.  In fact, it just came back ten minutes ago, so I was lucky I got this call.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the wind's blowing and I think the animals are swimming out in the pasture.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh oh.  Well, we're -- we're thirty five miles outside of DC.
L:  Oh, so you're in Washington too, but the other Washington. [LAUGH]
R:  Ye- yeah.  The district.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's kinda neat --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- to be able to talk to somebody that far away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  And -- and it's amazing here.  I -- I wish -- I wish that the CNN and the -- the media would show, um, like right outside, all the roads that go to -- that lead to the Pentagon --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there is not a t- truck that goes by that isn't pulled over and searched.
L:  Well, that's reassuring.
R:  Because they -- they can't get anywhere near it.  I haven't been down the Pennsylvania Avenue so I don't know what it's like at the White House.  Um --
L:  I'm sure they're on just very much alert alert.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and -- and they have to be.  You know, my husband's stationed there now, and I -- and I have to say, you know, him going into work is a [SIGH] is a --
L:  Kind of scary thing?
R:  -- is a little disturbing some -- some days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, especially when you hear what's going on in the news.
L:  I don't think there's really any place that -- that can be considered safe, because we have like the navy and the shipyards here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, it could -- it could just happen anywhere.  I don't think anybody -- you know, or maybe Wyoming, there're nothing in Wyoming. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Kansas cornfield, but other than that ...
L:  Oh, I shouldn't say that.  They used to say Wyoming, the state that God forgot but --
R:  [LAUGH]  Or Idaho, because I don't -- I really don't think anybody lives there any more.
L:  Oh, well, there's -- it -- there's some, but there's not much to do over there, I don't think.
R:  No, well they could --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- they grow very nice potatoes.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  They're probably more expensive there than if you buy them in the store though, that's usually how it goes.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But, um, you know, I -- I remember how when this first terrorism situation started, how many months ago, that they had it on the news all the time --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and now it's just kinda taken a back seat and I really think they need to, ah, just promote it more --
R:  I --
L:  -- to keep people aware of it.
R:  -- I agree, I really do and I was just saying that, um, to someone the other day, thinking, "Have we --have we forgotten?"  Like, people -- people have wanted to move on and forget and what have you, but then again in the same instance, it's be- we're becoming complacent again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're at the point now where we're starting to get annoyed again at the, um, security in the airports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, "This is bothersome" and, "This is an inconvenience" and -- and they seem to have forgotten that, you know, hey, over three thousand people died --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- because they're complacent and they weren't paying attention and, you know, we were surprised, and you know, do you really wanna be one of the three thousand that go again?
L:  No, I was -- in fact, on my way to work today I was thinking about those people in that airplane, how brave they were.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, would I have had that kind of courage to ...?  Man, that was something.  That's amazing that -- that they would even do that for their country, you know -- 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- Americans are pretty pro- proud people --
R:  Yeah, and -- and -- I mean, just [LAUGH] -- just to think that they have -- that that these men that are, you know, leading these people, have got such charisma that they can get young men, with their full lives ahead of them, to kill themselves.
L:  I know, that's -- that's terrible.
R:  And -- and not in a good way.  I mean, you know, it's one thing to pop cyanide and, you know, out you go.  You fall asleep and that's it.  It's another thing to ram, you know, an airplane into a building, knowing how you're going to die and take all of those people with you.
L:  I know, and -- and they have no qualms about it.  They just, "This is my mission", like.
R:  Yes, and "This is --"
L:  Incredible.
R:  "-- this is going to get me to God".
L:  There's some real screwed up people out there [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- I don't -- I don't understand it.  Mm.  I'm glad I don't.
L:  Yeah.  If I had that mind set, I -- you- you're in the same situation they are.
R:  Exactly, so I -- I think we need to -- to um --
L:  I guess though, when you think of it this way, to them this is like hell on earth, so if they die, they actually go to heaven and they don't have to put up with this earth -- this life any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's the only way I think -- I don't know.  It's pretty -- pretty messed up.
R:  Yeah, it is --
L:  Terribly.
R:  -- and in the mean -- in the meantime, you've got an entire country, you know, on their knees.
L:  Oh, I know.  I'm -- I'm very impressed with the President and his beliefs.
R:  You know, um, he's -- he's taken a lotta slack because of this and, um, but I have to say, you know I'm glad he's in office, and, you know, a friend of mine is so against him and said, "Well, he's nothing but a -- but a cowboy".  Well, that's true and thank God he is, because if there was anyone else in office, you know, I hate so say it, if Clinton was in office, again, you know, our military would have been cut down to nothing, sent to four cor- corners of the world for peace keeping missions.  God knows, if you even try any kinda training during peace keeping missions, they have the right to consider that a -- a threat -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a hostile threat.  So, you know, when Bush came into office, our military was cut in half.  They had not been -- been combat trained because we were on peace keeping missions all over the world.  These men had not been home in I couldn't tell you how long, because the rotation had already been messed up, a- and yet, here's somebody that goes, you know, "I appreciate you".  You know, we've -- we've gotten raises which has been much needed, especially for the enlisted people --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- you know, and -- and somebody actually cares about us and how we live our life and -- and thank goodness this is all starting to happen --
