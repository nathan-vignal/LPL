R:  Hello, my name is Constance.
L:  Hi, this is Libby.
R:  Hi, Libby.  Ah --
L:  Have you ever done this before?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  This is my first time too.
R:  Okay, so I think we're supposed to talk about, er, drawing the line on bad humor.  I try to err on the side of, ah, not saying it if I think it is going to cross the line, ah, you know, jokes that are in bad taste are just not something that I usually do.
L:  Um, me too.  I, um, I don't know, some things that some people find funny, I just, er, [MN] don't appreciate.
R:  Yeah, I think though, probably the more interesting question is actually, you know, what do you do when you're confronted by, you know, in conversation, other people that are prov- doing jokes that are not in good humor?  I mean, do you just kinda go along?  Do you just keep quiet?  Do you try to change the subject?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes I'll try to change the subject, but --
L:  I guess that's probably more of what I do it, or else I just kind of feel uncomfortable and try to, ah, remove myself from the whole situation.
R:  I've never really confronted anybody about a joke that I thought -- well I think I did one time.  I just thought it was pretty much --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uncalled for and I just said, you know, "This really is not funny", but it was either --
L:  I think that would --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  -- oh, that would kind of depend on how well you knew that person too.  Like, I mean if it was somebody that I really knew well and they did something I didn't like, I'd probably say something different than if it was, you know, a situation where I really didn't know the person at all.
R:  Yeah, I -- if I'm remembering correctly it was, like a relative and I -- I don't know if it really had anything much -- it was kinda the, er, [MN], well, what am I going to say ...?  The attitude that I was probably was in [LAUGH] on the day as well probably -- probably, ah, made it worse, but, ah, but humor, I mean I'm really one for telling jokes either, so I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- even if you cross the line, I probably don't even tell a joke that's probably funny to everybody either.  I'm just not a joke teller.
L:  I am absolutely the world's worst --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- joke teller.  I either forget the punch line, or mess it up and lose the whole -- lose the whole joke in it so I -- I just don't tell jokes and I -- I guess I'm kinda from a family that's not into all the jokes and comedy kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah, I mean, er, my family does some teasing type --
L:  Oh yeah that --
R:  -- you know, that type of thing --
L:  -- no, that's different.
R:  -- but, not really, er -- I do get jokes like on the email though and some of those kinds cross the line at times --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- but those are easier because you can just delete them and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not worry about anybody else except for sometime there's some that, you know, some people might find offensive and then you -- I have to make a decision do you forward it to that person or not, or -- or with a, you know, a little caveat that "Some of you may find this offensive and I apologize ahead of time".  [LAUGH]  Ah, sometimes it's hard to gauge whether somebody would find it offensive or not.  What you find offensive is not necessarily what somebody else may.
L:  I guess, I figure if it's offensive to me or I feel like it might bother anybody, I just would hit the delete and not do anything else with it --
R:  Yeah, but probably --
L:  -- except for one friend who, ah, who has a little different sense of humor that I do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She -- she sends me more the political kind of -- of humor, knowing that if it's about Republicans I'm not going to like it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, that's kind of different that's where I was kinda --
R:  Well, I think some people do it to engage you as well.  I mean, some people will cross the line, just, ah, to have engaging either conversation, or, ah, to see if you're going to bite the -- bite the apple or not.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Some people just like the debate for the sake of debate, I think.  Um --
L:  Do you go to clubs and things where there's comedians performing?
R:  No, I haven't.  I did in college, but that was a while ago.  Ah, and sometimes those can cross the line as well, which is uncomfortable because you're sitting there.  What do you do, do you get up and leave, or ...?
L:  Right.  See, I -- I don't go to clubs.  The only time I've been confronted with it was like on -- on a cruise ship when, you know, one of the c- one of the shows in the evening was a comedian that was really pretty raunchy and I guess -- I think I got up and left.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My husband and I, neither one care for that kind of thing, so if it got the point where we just didn't think it was funny anymore, it was just -- seemed like the right thing to do, to leave.
R:  Right.  I mean there are lots of reasons -- well, I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter if it causes pain or not, I mean, the person's being offensive and sometimes maybe having that highlighted is not necessarily a bad thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, then they know they need to, ah, to think twice before doing it again, but, um --
L:  I -- I'm to the point -- I -- maybe I'm showing my age, but, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the -- ah, I mean I like to watch a lot of the comedies on TV but it just seems like so [MN] many of them are so wrapped around sexual innuendoes that -- I mean my kids are out of the house now, but it got to the point where I couldn't watch things with them in the evening when they were preteens and teenagers.  It wasn't comfortable watching comedy that was centered around so much sex even though, I mean, it wasn't like R rated or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, you know, even the innuendoes being there that, ah, things that I enjoyed watching by myself, I just didn't watch with them, which usually meant I didn't watch at all.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I remember that as well that, ah, I think they're -- some of the shows are even getting worse --
L:  I think so, too.
R:  -- they don't seem to be improving.  They seem to be going on that trend.  I mean, it -- gosh, if you just look at all the reality shows right now, I mean, there's very little that you can watch with, ah, with your child on TV without worrying about what they're seeing.  Ah, some of it gets close to R rated I think.
L:  Yeah, I -- right.
R:  [SIGH] How many minutes are in into this?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I don't know, this is harder than I thought.
R:  Um, lets see.
L:  So, what other kinds of comedy are there?  There's the racial comedy that is offensive to about everybody --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there is sexual innuendo type comedy, we already talked about, there's political comedy, um --
R:  I always think about, you know, like All In The Family.  I remember --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- watching it growing up and that -- it wasn't really -- I don't remember it being a bit deal or anything, but I just think that today, if that show was on, I just think that it would be like this incredible big deal that a lot of groups would just be -- be picketing, would be boycotting, would be -- and it is -- it's funny to see how just the times, that sometimes the -- I guess the comedy was acceptable at that time, but now it isn't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and probably the same -- it could be the same joke, but it is just in the time frame.
L:  That was about the only show I can think of from back then that was offensive at all.  Everything else that, you know, when I look back on it seems so -- so squeaky clean, you know, believe it to be, [inaudible] The Waltons, The Brady Bunch kind of -- of humor that you could sit and watch with -- with any member of your family and not be offended in any way.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, even for their, was like, er, kind of Sanford and Brown -- Sanford and Sons, they were about the same time, The Jeffersons.  They might have been a little bit later, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I didn't watch those.
R:  Like the Jeffersons had a little bit, you know, of the biracial couple that lived upstairs that were their friends --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they were kind of [NOISE] because of course, the spin off of All In The Family too, so -- [NOISE] but, ah, both kind of had the same type of humor I suppose.  It didn't get into the political as much [NOISE] as the racial though.
L:  Sounds like you have a baby.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, he just woke up from his nap.  I was hoping that, ah, that the call was yours before he woke up but he decided no, that he wanted to get up.
R:  So, you'll be, er, you'll be faced with this in a few years as to what you want him to be able to, ah, to listen to?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and you, ah -- and like, ah, I just think that the trend is more set toward, ah, not being acceptable speech and that you really have to watch what you're saying because I think people are more on guard and some people are more easily offended.  I mean I find myself sometimes, even if I'm just saying something and I'll soon, like looking around thinking, "Oh, who overheard?" you know, not even thinking anything, but then all of a sudden, "Oh, who might've overheard that and I wonder if they're offended or, you know, they know somebody who ...?"
L:  Or would take it the wrong way?
R:  Right, and, ah, so I guess it does happen in just everyday occurrences.  If even when you're not even telling a joke, or when you're just maybe telling a story, like, ah, you know, you went to a restaurant and you had bad service and you're trying to describe it and maybe the way that you're describing it [NOISE] could be offensive to other people and, I don't know.
