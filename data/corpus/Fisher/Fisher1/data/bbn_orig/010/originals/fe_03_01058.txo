L:  Poree[?]
R:  Hello, my name is Ruby.
L:  Hi, Ruby.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How -- how's it going?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.  [LAUGH]
R:  It is a good day for a call, I guess.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, this topic -- [LAUGH]
R:  On comedy?
L:  Yeah, um, where do we draw --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've -- I've heard some really off the wall comedy that I haven't appreciated.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, so have I
R:  Yeah, and it's usually, um, of a sexual nature and then it's like, "Okay, what do you say?  How do you [LAUGH] --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- how do you handle this?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I just kinda of, [COUGH] I usually get kinda rude actually [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because it's about the only way to handle it because the person that does it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think they realize that it's rude, or how it sounds.
L:  Right.  Now, are you talking about, um, like from personal experience or are you talking about, um, like, mm, you know, like stand up comedy?
R:  Oh, well now, stand up comedy you can't really say much.  You could walk out, I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, from, ah, it's a little of both. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, ah, otherwise the, um, I mean comedy, you know, is great.  Like, stand up comedy, I like that normally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, sometimes the -- it just doesn't fit.
L:  Yeah, because, um, like I know sometimes though, like you said, makes, like, sexual jokes or, um, [SIGH], racial jokes aren't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- tho- those are not jokes to me.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're all trying to be peaceful and -- and here you have someone standing up talking about a different, I mean, a certain type of race and how they act and to me, that's not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's not funny because that's their culture --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because if someone was to say anything about their culture, then I don't think they would like it either.
R:  Right.  [MN] That's true.  I agree. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  But sometimes, I mean I have to admit, sometimes it could be funny but [MN] then, you know, you have to be like, "Okay, that was enough".  Sometimes they all keep going and going and going with it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Ah, [COUGH] have you been in one of these studies before?
L:  No, this is actually my first time.
R:  Er, this is my first time too, and, ah, I don't know that, you know, like, how long we're supposed to talk or if we just, you know, have a conversation until we're through or -- [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, we're supposed to talk for ten minutes --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, at -- it said at least eight minutes --
R:  Oh, okay.  Did you get that off the internet?  I have not checked my emails for several days so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm glad you said that.
L:  Yeah, because actually, um, one of the representatives called me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she said that, um, that we had to talk for eight -- I mean, talk for ten minutes, but in the email it said that we could talk for at least eight minutes --
R:  Oh, okay.
L: -- and then we'll hear this recording, because they, you know, we can at least end the call or whatever.
R:  Right. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, [COUGH] yesterday, I had gotten a call, but, ah, and it was on terrorism --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- but, ah, yeah, and I wasn't here to get the phone, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I missed that one, um, but yeah, um, comedy, I mean, most people, you know, like comedy I would think.  I mean, it's kinda the medicine of life isn't it?  [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.  I mean, [SIGH], um, everybody needs a good laughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, but, I mean, some people don't use good taste.
R:  This is true.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they don't use good taste at all and --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- and all they're in for it is either for show or for the money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, um, just to be seen.
R:  Mhm.  Would you go to some of the -- like the Laugh Comedy places?
L:  No, I -- actually I've never been to one.
R:  Oh, you haven't.
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I used to watch the stand up comedies that, um, are on television.
R:  Oh, whoa.  That gets pretty --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- pretty risque I guess you could say sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  Especially the ones -- I used to watch, um, some of the ones on BET, some of them were okay --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and some of them were -- were not because there was comedians that would also, um, talk about peoples handicaps --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- now, that's not funny, I mean --
R:  No, I never thought that way.
L:  Right, I mean, they're, er, they're very insensitive when they talk about, you know, how handicapped, you know, how they walk or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, how they talk and, I mean, they can't help it that they were brought into this world that way.
R:  Right. [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, I think that, er, when it comes down to degrading someone, I think that should be a censored area that they shouldn't be allowed to talk about.
R:  Yeah.  Even though we can turn off our TVs if it's on television but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, yeah I don't like the fact that it's out there either --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, [COUGH] I get jokes on the internet.  I don't know if you've received any of those and I don't appreciate them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, I don't get, um, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't get bad jokes --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- um, I usually -- I get a lot of Christian jokes.
R:  Yeah, no tho- you know, those are good, I like those, but then there's this one place that keep writing me and I don't know how to stop them, you know, I just kinda said, "Stop writing this", you know.
L:  Mhm.  Did it have at the bottom where they -- where you can, um, unsubscribe yourself to it?
R:  It might have.  It was like I was so offended I got out of it real quick and I deleted it [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I mean after I made my comments, "Stop doing this" and I don't even open them anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.  Maybe -- I just -- it's almost like if I open it are they going to keep sending them and I probably should look for that where it says unsubscribe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would probably the best thing to do.
L:  Because I remember, at one time, I used to get a little, um, a lot of Little Johnny jokes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and Little Johnny was, hm, I wanna say Little Johnny was in elementary school or something, but some of them were cute, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they -- they're -- they were too, I believed some of them were too explicit.
R:  Right.
L:  For them to even write that a child does this and a child does that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Mm.  My times too valuable to be, you know, wasted on [LAUGH] looking at --
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] -- you know, so, ah, I don't know.  I -- I don't know if, ah, they want us to continue talking, or --
L:  Yeah, we have to.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, lets see, we covered, ah, comedy stage, we covered TV, we covered --
L:  Email.
R:  -- people in general and emails, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, lets see what else.  [LAUGH]
L:  What about the weight jokes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't like the weight jokes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't either because I have a problem with weight. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, I don't -- I don't care for the weight jokes either. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, I don't hear -- actually I don't hear too many of those.  Maybe most people I'm around are sensitive enough to -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that not -- to not say any weight jokes.
R:  Yeah, that I might haul off and hit them or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because I, um, I've caught the train to -- to and from work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hear a -- a lot of the kids -- er -- okay, I can't answer that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, by the way, if you don't know --
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, call -- if you have call waiting --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- you're not supposed to answer it because it'd disconnect -- it could potentially disconnect you from the system.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, well I -- yeah, I'll -- I'll remember that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Thanks.
L:  So, um and I hear, er, a lot of the kids, um talking about your mom jokes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, those I really do not like and I'll just look at them like they're crazy and sometimes they'll, mm, look at me like, "Well, why is she looking at me like that?" --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, n- I don't -- I don't like those kinda jokes either.
R:  Maybe I haven't heard those. [LAUGH]
L:  When you were younger, have you heard any?
R:  Well, I'm trying to remember if I -- if I did, I guess I was oblivious to what was being said. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Ah, like -- like what?  I mean, do you have an example?  Is it decent enough to say, or --
L:  Um, something like -- okay, here's one that I remember.  Your mom is so fat she sat on the dollar to make change.
R:  Oh, okay.  See, that was so long ago I -- I've forgot it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That all -- that's about the only one I remember.
R:  I remember skipping on the sidewalk and you didn't want to step on a crack because you'd break your mother's back. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, okay, I remember that one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember that one.
R:  Ah, but you -- I usually didn't hear too many of those either, I guess
L:  Actually, I heard a lot of them.
R:  I grew up in a small town and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so, maybe, yeah, maybe that's why. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, [MN] yeah, I don't know, and some people, um that I know, will try to be funny or they'll tell jokes all the time but they're not really funny -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and it's like, you know, they want -- you can tell they wanna -- it's kinda like they wanna be a stand up comedian, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
