R:  Oh, hi, I'm Susie.
L:  Hello?  I -- this is Jonathan.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  Good.  This is my --
R:  Never done this before, have you?
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We're supposed to talk about c- ah, comedy and where do you draw the line?  Is that correct?
R:  Ye- yeah, yeah, I guess that is it.
L:  Okay.  Um, I guess I'll go ahead and start.
R:  That's -- that's fine.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, with humor, you know, if you -- you draw the line where I guess you -- you, ah, offend someone else and if it doesn't offend anyone or anyone, um, -- that's one aspect that you draw the line.  If you offend anyone that, um, the person in the company or that they might know or just that offend anyone even if they're not present, that's where I would say you draw the line about humor.
R:  [MN] True.  Er -- er, well, I look at it as m- more personal thing where I would draw the line personally myself in accepting comedy because I don't tell jokes a lot but listening to jokes there's certain ones I prefer not to listen to and I'm from, um, a town that can be, ah, very prejudiced, ah, and I don't like hearing certain jokes and I'll either -- my -- I -- I guess it could be on the receiving or the sending end, do you think?
L:  Yes, yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  Ah, my way of dealing with it is, ah, well, whatever's appropriate at the time, either let the person know that I -- I don't appreciate those kind of jokes or, ah, walk away, or change the subject in a way that they know that that was inappropriate.  Or if it's my husband, I just give him a funny look --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as well.  [LAUGH] Oh, and he knows, he's learned after a while [LAUGH] that there's certain jokes that he just tells to his buddies at work and he doesn't tell me.  Ah --
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, as far as race is concerned I -- mm, well, I mean, I guess certain innocent jokes could be acceptable, like it -- it just -- also it kinda does depend on your company --
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  -- you know, if they, you know, if you're on a personal basis and there are, you know -- there's, you know, you draw a line on how harmful a joke can be and [COUGH], hm, yeah, I mean, you just don't want to offend -- it -- a great deal depends on how well you know the person and how well you know that it's not serious, so ...  Um, also so, I mean, there's a couple of aspects whether you know the person that well and, you know, how harsh the jokes are as far as race so ...
R:  True, true.  Ah, I don't know.  I guess I'm a little stricter about just receiving and sending jokes like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My jokes tend to be -- I -- I'm not saying you aren't, but, ah, the way I look at it, my jokes tend to be fairly clean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, oh I sent something [MN] just a little bit off color to my sisters the other day online --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- oh, they were just surp- they were just surprised, they said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, "I can't believe you sent something like that.  That's just uncharacteristic".
L:  Yeah, the company you're in as far as dirty jokes, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, if you're talking with, you know, a senior citizen or one of your friends your age, I mean, that also has a lot to do with it.
R:  True, and --
L:  Are you fr- where are you from?
R:  Kentucky.
L:  Kentucky, okay.
R:  Do I sound like it?
L:  No, no, I was just wondering because, you know --
L:  Oh no, I'm wondering because I lived up in Massachusetts for quite a while and came back down here and I was -- I was just wondering how my accent would --
L:  Is there -- is there any, ah, racism at all or is any -- is there a lot of prejudice in Kentucky.
L:  Quite a lot, quite a lot.  I guess that's why I'm -- I'm thinking more that than sexist remarks --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that sort of thing, because of -- I've -- I've never been tolerant of sexist jokes in any way and, ah, but, ah, the -- the race- -- races can be a problem here.  Ah, not so much now as what it was thirteen[?] years ago when we moved here, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Texas, where it's the south, of -- it's not considered really the south but you know, it's pretty -- in Houston it's pretty multicultural too --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  I have a fri- I have friends, you know, we joke around, like innocent jokes about, you know, race, you know, with my Hispanic friends or whatnot, but, you know, there is definitely a place where you draw the line.
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's like you talk, ah, you can say -- I could say anything about my sisters, but n- no dare anyone else say anything about them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, not so.
L:  Right, yeah, exactly, wh- so, if you know the person well enough or you know it's innocent, or -- you've just got to watch out who your company is or who they might know, or -- and just be on the safe side.  I just don't say anything too harsh or, you know, to inflict harm upon anyone, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that so, I don't know, I guess I'm considered pretty boring that way, that so.
L:  A- --
R:  I will -- I will try a joke every once in a while, but I always botch it up anyway, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- that so.
L:  Well, there's plenty of jokes that don't have any, ah, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- harm to them, so I don't think that's boring at all.
R:  Oh, that's just -- no, I just always flu- fluff up my jokes.  I just throw the punch line in there ahead of time or -- or whatever, just, ah, I -- I'm better at writing them, than reading them I gu- -- or saying them out loud I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, but, ah, I don't know.  Ah, humor -- I read somewhere where humor is the element of surprise as well.  I don't know if you've ever heard that or not?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Well, as far as they go, blonde jokes, those are pretty innocent, so, I mean, not many people would get offended by those.
R:  I -- I would guess not.  I mean, you kind of expect that -- well maybe if you're a true blonde it -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I'm blonde and I don't really care --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but I'm not -- I'm not a girl, so, um, so that has, I think, a different view, but, you know, um, I think race is the -- the sensitive area that you should -- race and vulgarity.  Those are the two areas where you should definitely, unless you are in close company, you should not, you know, veer into.
R:  True.
L:  And, even then -- even then you have to watch out.  Nothing serious, nothing, you know, harmful -- to harmful or any --
R:  Well, I think it all -- it -- it goes back to the [MN] -- the phrase being politically correct --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know.  Those are the general ones but there -- there's so many others and I -- I guess you could whitewash everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and look at it and say, "You can't say that".  Ah, I -- I used to be a teacher and I don't know if you are aware of things like, ah, politically correct fairy tales and that sort of thing --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- whitewashed until everything's out of it?  Which is humorous in itself, that we have to be so careful of that we put up so many boundaries in order to be, ah, non offensive to everyone.
L:  Yeah, in this day and age.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, ah, this -- this is kinda a dead topic for me.  I don't know what else to say about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean --
R:  Especially not telling jokes or not knowing jokes.
L:  Right, well, maybe -- you -- have you ever been offended by a joke?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  You -- are you -- ever -- are you ever offended by a joke?  Even --
R:  Um --
L:  -- even though, like, if it doesn't apply to you, but --
R:  Right, um, not usually -- not personally.  I -- I can't think of many that are told personally to me that I'm offended by but, ah -- if it offends someone else -- if it offends my belief in anything.
L:  Does it make a difference if you know someone of that, er, for example, of that race?  If you think of someth- -- say there's someone, you know, if you have a black friend, if you're -- does it make a difference if you picture a black friend when -- or if you have someone, ah, I don't -- if you know someone black?  Does it make a difference whether you're offended or not?
R:  No, because I don't look at it that way.  I -- it's -- it's more of a matter of general humanity and what that person is saying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and their attitude, ah, that tells me a lot about -- in telling a joke like that, I -- I guess it tells me a lot about that person and their bel- -- their beliefs and priority --
L:  Education level or --
R:  Y- well, yeah --
L:  -- their -- how they're brought up?
R:  -- where they feel they stand in the whole scheme of life and how I feel about them at that point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially when it comes to racism, or sexism for that matter.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Ah, but I don't see so much of the sexism because I just, ah, I was in the army for several years and I just -- I h- heard a lot of it and I learned to just not feel it --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I just do not allow it in my presence --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in -- in subtle ways I wouldn't say that offends me.  You -- you can -- I -- body language tells a lot, er -- [NOISE]
L:  But, would there be jokes about women that are innocent that would make you -- that you would appreciate?  That would just be a little funny?
R:  Blonde jokes I'd say.  Yeah, they're -- they're -- they're funny in a way because you could [NOISE] -- I tend to substitute just anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a blonde.  A blonde is a -- just a --
L:  Nothing -- nothing to -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a dunce of some sort, so, but, ah, I don't know, maybe that's where you look at it and everyone has their prejudices and their degree of tolerance because, ah, if you really think about it, th- that -- this is where it gets to be -- where everything -- you can look at everything as being politically correct.  A blonde joke is still making some -- fun of someone of lower intelligence --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so -- [LAUGH]
L:  You're right but I mean -- 
R:  It doesn't bother me, but it -- [LAUGH] maybe it should.  I never thought of -- I --
L:  What -- what about a woman -- a joke about a woman?  There, um, -- would there be a joke, any joke, say it is innocent that you could appreciate?
R:  Innocently?
L:  Yeah, I mean, say it's not really offensive?  I mean --
R:  Probably.
L:  -- there could be jokes, I mean, that poke fun like lightly --
R:  Probably because, I -- see, my -- my girlfriends -- I mean, we do poke fun at men all the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  Ah, but in -- you know, come to think of it, there's a lot of jokes that my girlfriends will send me online, but I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I just wouldn't send to my husband because, well, he wouldn't find it funny. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably -- probably be hurt by it, [LAUGH] so I don't send them on.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Ah, you know, and I -- I guess that --
