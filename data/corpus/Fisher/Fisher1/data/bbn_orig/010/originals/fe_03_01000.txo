L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Melissa.
R:  Hi, Melissa.  My name's Tim.  [PAUSE] Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know about this.  It's the first time I've ever done anything -- [LAUGH]
L:  Me too. 
R:  -- like this.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, as far as terrorism goes, I think, um, nine eleven sort of opened a lot of people's eyes as to what they would do and what they would look for if something like that were to happen.
L:  I think I'd probably panic.
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I was in Canada when nine eleven hit and it was [MN] a little unnerving because, you know, [MN] there I was in a foreign country and didn't know what the status of going home was and didn't really have a good idea as to what was going on.
L:  Right, and you still had to get back home.
R:  And I still had to get back home.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ... 
L:  Wow.  I was home.  I was just glad I didn't know anybody that was involved.
R:  Yeah.  My, ah -- my wife, she had just flown probably two or three weeks prior to that and she'd met a couple -- that they were [NOISE] going on vacation [NOISE] and, ah, he worked in the top floor of the World Trade Centre.
L:  Oh.
R:  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, they were an elderly couple.  He was getting ready for retirement, and I don't know if he was there when it happened or -- or if he'd already retired or what.  But, it was, ah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a little unnerving.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd say so.  I haven't [NOISE] -- it had been a while since I have flown prior to that and I've been a little wary about flying since then.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, I know the company my wife works for, she -- she flew a lot and, ah, they -- they have since sort of grounded everybody and authorized people to drive rather than fly if they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uncomfortable with flying.
L:  Exactly.  That's the same way it is where I work.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They've cut back on flights and trying to find alternatives to business travel rather than flying.
R:  But, ah, it -- it seems to have worked out well because w- the time -- as far as tran- transport and everything, the time seems to work out because you don't have to waste an hour or two at the airport going through checks and everything and, no further than she have to fly, that hour or two makes up the difference between the time difference in driving, [LAUGH] so ... 
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, it works out pretty well.  [PAUSE] But, I guess we've kinda gotten off topic a little bit, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's still tourism, I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And terrorism.  It's all related, I think.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, you know, I -- I think everybody has, ah, gotten more of a chance to get used to -- not used to it, but [PAUSE] got more aware of -- of being prepared for something like that to happen.
L:  Right. 
R:  And, ah ... 
L:  Right.  It's a little scary.  We all think it's not going to happen where we are, [PAUSE] that it's going to happen somewhere else.  I don't -- I'm not sure where you are, but I'm in a small town in Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, I'm in, ah -- actually, I'm near the, ah -- if you're a NASCAR fan, if you know --
L:  Exac- --
R:  -- where the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Lowes Motor Speedway is? 
L:  [NOISE] Yep, I've been there.
R:  I'm standing looking at it right now because -- 
L:  Oh, you're kidding? 
R:  -- because it's my front yard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH] Wow.  Yeah, I'm a big NASCAR fan.  Um, but, you know, being in a small town in Ohio --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you think, "Oh, it's not going to happen here, [MN] terrorism".  But, you know, it's usually the little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- places like that that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where you think it's not going to happen.
R:  Right.
L:  Hopefully it won't happen at -- I've even wondered, like, watching the races, "Will everything -- anything ever happen there?" 
R:  I know, it makes you wonder.  I mean, you stop and think about these highly publicized events like the Super Bowl and -- and things like that as to -- if somebody were to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to dry- to try to do something during one of those, would they be successful and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would they be bold enough to attempt something like that.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Well, wasn't it just last week at one of the professional basketball games there was -- [NOISE] it ended up not being terrorism and they thought it was just a prank, [NOISE] but something happened where everyone in the -- in the aren- in the [NOISE] stadium was gasping for air and was having problems breathing.  I mean, they stopped the game.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I --
L:  I just -- I just saw a clip of it on the news.  I didn't get all the information.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  But, I mean, that just shows you how easy it would be at any kind of event like that where there's a lot of people, how easily they can -- they can harm a bunch of people at one time.
R:  Right.  No, I didn't read anything about that.  I don't know.  But, ah, you know, the -- the security precautions and everything they take, it, ah -- sometimes you have to wonder if it's really necessary, but then you look back and say, well, you know, the people that got on the planes that day --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- they didn't -- didn't think it was necessary.  They didn't think anything unusual.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just, ah ...
L:  It's unfortunate.  Who would've ever thought that terrorists would have used -- used our own passenger planes as bombs, basically.
R:  Yeah, and -- and who's to say that, you know, next time, if -- if it is a next time, they may not use passenger planes.  They may use cargo planes.
L:  Right.
R:  Because cargo planes carry the same amount of fuel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know what the -- [SIGH] the restrictions as far as passengers or as, you know -- [MN] you know, remote control -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or anything like that.  I mean, it's just difficult to say what -- what might happen.
L:  And it could be something that we, you know th- that hasn't even happened.  It could be something totally different.
R:  Right.
L:  Some other form of transportation or, you know, just about anything. 
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE] But -- oh, all right.
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  But, um, it's just -- it's just surprising to me that the -- the number of people that they've gotten linked with all this terrorist activity, that -- that they were educated in the United States.
L:  Oh, exactly.  That's what -- and that's what's scary.
R:  And, you know -- because I'm -- I'm in the C- Carolinas and several of the people they've, ah, named as being terrorists, they've been in, ah -- [PAUSE] you know, in schools here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think one of them went to North Carolina State and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one of them went to North Carolina A and T.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, that's just right up the road.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's hard to say what's -- what's going to happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- or how many of them have come through a Duke or, ah, Ohio State or anything like that.
L:  Right.  Probably quite a few.  Quite a few, unfortunately.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  There was, ah -- we even had a -- a gentleman here who's, ah, originally from that -- and his family are still there and they actually came in and just walked out with him one day.
R:  Mm.
L:  Nobody -- nobody knows why or what happened.  I mean, he's back to work, so evidently they didn't -- could not [NOISE] connect him with anything.  But, [PAUSE] I mean, that's -- that was pretty close to home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was -- that was real soon after all that happened.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's just unpredictable.  [LAUGH]
L:  Very unpredictable.  [PAUSE]
R:  And, you know, people have -- have been here and -- and worked here for -- for years and years and then all of a sudden [NOISE] there's some sort of connection somewhere along the line that -- that nobody thought about.
L:  Well, and it's one of those things like they always say, whenever they interview people who have lived near them or whatever, well, I would've never -- never suspected.
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]
L:  And that's the way most of them were.  They we- they were assimilating right into their communities.
R:  Right.  [PAUSE]
L:  [MN] It makes it scary to -- to go anywhere anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it's scary to go and scary to think that [PAUSE] the things that you didn't give any thought to, that -- that they're illegal weapons now.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] I think I've lost about three pair of fingernail clippers [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just for the fact of not thinking about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, because you're not in that mindset to think that way.
R:  And -- and to stop and think that a pair of fingernail clippers as a deadly weapon --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- is not something you think about every day.
L:  No.  No, it isn't.  I -- there's probably all kinds of things I carry with me on a daily basis that I wouldn't even give a second thought to of using in, you know, some violent way, [PAUSE] whereas, you know, if I go to the airport, [several inaudible words] s- stop me and say, "Well, you can't have that".  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  "You can't take that with you".
R:  And -- and it's kind of unnerving, too.  Um, I didn't realize it until I went through an airport down in Miami a few years ago [PAUSE] that -- did you realize that sugar [PAUSE] will set off [PAUSE] the detectors? 
L:  No.
R:  And the reason I found out was really by accident.  We were on a layover and we were waiting at the airport and I went to get a cup of coffee [PAUSE] and I put the powder cream and powder sugar for the other person that was with me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in my shirt pocket because I had two cups of coffee to carry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I walked through and I set the alarm off.  I had already been through earlier and hadn't set the alarm off.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the person working the machine said, "I see you have two cups of coffee.  You don't happen to have a couple of packets of sugar in your pocket, do you" and I said, "Yes, I do".  He said, "Take it out".  I took the two packets of sugar out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- laid them on the conveyor and they went through and I walked back through and it didn't set it off, and he said, "It does it every time".  [LAUGH] He said -- 
L:  Did he say why? 
R:  He says [MN] nobody knows, but he said, "I saw you had two cups of ...
