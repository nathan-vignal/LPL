R:  Hi, this is Heather.
L:  Hi, this is Noreen.
R:  Hi, Noreen, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you doing, Heather?
R:  Good.  This is quite the interesting subject for, ah, you know, my first call.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Have you done these before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Okay.  I guess, ah, well, I'll start it off.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, you know, whether or not people would remain calm.  I mean, I definitely don't think so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that's already been proven.  Um, you know, when -- when I'd heard that the security council had come out with some, ah, big terrorist thing, gosh, when was it about a month ago, and they were saying that you had to run out and buy plastic sheeting for your windows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And duct tape and all that, I mean, you know, people were just mobbing the stores and, you know, buying up all the stuff that they had, and I don't know, um, kind of freaked me out a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I -- I figure it's something that's definitely going to happen.  I mean, I really do see it in the cards but I don't know if I would freak out or not.  How do you feel about that?
L:  Um, I agree with you.  I would say that people will -- would definitely freak out if we had another -- another terrorist, um, action.  The one thing -- I mean, I definitely go back to nine eleven and I think about how it -- that was a major terrorist action against us and --
R:  Right.
L:  Our country just fell to pieces.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we're still paying for it.  Our economy is still in the pits.
R:  I'm still out of a job.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, are you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so as far as what would people stay calm, I don't think people would stay calm.
R:  Yeah, I mean it -- it's really -- it's a -- gosh, this is just the worst subject to have to talk about for this first thing. 
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  I thought they were going to talk about, like consumer stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I guess I didn't -- I didn't flip out when I heard about the thing with the plastic sheeting and everything like that.  I guess -- I guess the one thing that I'm thinking about more than anything is, um, you know, people get so upset and they say that the government hasn't told them enough and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're not giving out enough information and, you know what, I'm grateful for the lack of information that's given if you will because if we heard of every single little thing that came across their desks, the FBI, the CIA and everybody else, we would be in a constant state of panic.  I mean, we couldn't handle it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because, you know, a lot of it is unsubstantiated and a lot of it they catch anyway so there's really no need to send us into a state of panic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If it's not necessary.  Um, like that plastic sheeting thing, it turned out to be a scam.  I mean, it wasn't true.
L:  Right.  
R:  But they did tell us about it and everybody ran out and, you know, did what they had to do and got so upset when it really was not necessary at all.  We never had to go through that.
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, so that's kind of a -- that's kind of a tough call too because everyone gets so upset with the government but as far as I'm concerned, you know, you really -- there's limited stuff that I want to know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Tell me if it's coming right now, you know what, I'll prepare for it, I'll call my family, I'll tell them I love 'em, you know, but -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  But I don't -- I don't need to know.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  All of it, because I'm going to live in a hyper state of, um, panic and -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  I don't want to live like that.
L:  Yeah, and there's only so much that you can do.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  In preparation for something like that.  I mean --
R:  Exactly.
L:  When I heard about the whole warning for duct -- duct tape and everything else, I -- the first thing I thought was that -- that it's almost like trying -- the government trying to scare everybody rather than trying to -- 
R:  That's what I said to my husband.
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just thought it was ridiculous, I mean, come on.
R:  Yeah, that is so funny.  I said that to my husband and he said, "Well, you know, I don't think so", and I said, "Honey, nobody wants to rally behind the president right now".  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But if he actually showed that, yes, this can happen, and it can happen today -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, then people will actually go, "Oh my gosh".
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's for real, you know.
L:  I know.
R:  Oh, that's so funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That you would think the same thing.
L:  [LAUGH] And even with him going out and getting the smallpox injection and everything else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I just thought that he is kind of a little bit off the deep end, I don't know, it just doesn't really -- maybe it's my own denial, but I just feel like he's kind of creating this state of fear that doesn't really constantly hit us yet. 
R:  Well, I think that it exists.  I mean, I think the state of fear is, you know, has mirrored it.  I mean, I know that, you know, looking at Saddam just himself, I mean, he's scary enough.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there's enough stuff that he is perfectly willing and able and capable of releasing on the country, actually on the world if he chose to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, we're the people that he's, you know, looking at right now. 
L:  Right.
R:  And it's definitely possible that he could do it tomorrow and, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if the man's a lunatic.
L:  Right.  
R:  But, you know, I think that probably what the president is trying to do in that situation is try to assuage anybody else's fears.  You know, he's the leader of the country and we're looking to him for support and guidance and, you know, to be the backbone of our country, and if we think that there's a chance that he could come down with something or be afflicted with something that otherwise he could prevent, then he needs to go out and be sure that he prevents.
L:  Right.
R:  That, you know, what I mean?
L:  That's true. 
R:  Because I didn't even know about that shot, but, I mean, it makes sense to me that he would go out and do that to let people know, you know, "Hey as far as I can, I'm taking my own precautions.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, don't worry that -- that I'm going to be affected, you know, because I'm trying as much as I can to keep that from happening".
L:  Right. 
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm a big fan of his.
L:  Oh, okay.  I hadn't -- well, I'm glad I got to hear you say that because I always think of the other point of view of him just being hyper vigilant but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  He is really doing his job I guess and -- 
R:  As best he can.  I mean, I wouldn't want to be him and there's no way.
L:  Yeah, definitely not.
R:  I mean, I wouldn't want that job at any time anyway but now is definitely not the time I wouldn't want to be in that position.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What else do we need to talk about with terrorism?
L:  Um.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, ah, how have you been affected?  You said that you're still --
R:  Yeah, out of a job.
L:  Out of a job.
R:  Well, our company -- I worked for a wireless company and, um, they closed down the Chicago location.  That's where I'm from.  
L:  Okay.
R:  They closed that down back in late August.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um, I did start a business after that but it didn't take off and so I've been looking for the last, probably two months, three months, but two months more digilent- diligently.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, yeah, I'm still -- I'm still looking.  The economy's just so poor.  People are looking at -- to try and get me to take ten thousand dollars less than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Than I'd worked for for the last thirteen years and I just, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can't justify that, but they think that in this state that everyone's in right now that everyone's going to come down and, you know, and take that -- that lesser money and stuff.
L:  And settle for something.
R:  Yes, so it's really affecting, um, the economy in that respect too.  People just think, you know, you're just going to go out and settle.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, but then it's going to take me the next ten years to build up to where I was, so, I mean, that's -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, not an option as far as I'm concerned.
L:  Yeah, it's a tough thought. 
R:  I'm just kind of hanging out waiting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Going on [inaudible] as much as I can.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  That's good, yeah.
R:  Making contacts and networking and stuff like that.
L:  Right. 
R:  So -- 
L:  Right.
R:  So how about you?  Do you have children or anything that are affected by this?
L:  No.  Um, I'd say probably the people who are affected most would be my family.  I have -- actually I have -- my dad's from Pakistan and we have family who are in Pakistan and my --
R:  Mm.
L:  And I have some cousins who are at the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Right after nine eleven.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So we were all pretty nervous about that and then, um -- and my sister was especially nervous too.  She's still in high school.
R:  Mhm, oh my gosh.
L:  So she gets a little bit of, um, probably the most anxiety in our family about --
R:  Did she have a problem with -- with bigotry and stuff after that?
L:  No, not really because we're half Caucasian so we don't really look very --
R:  Okay.
L:  Middle Eastern.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, she didn't have any problems with that.
R:  Oh, thank goodness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because that's just, you know, you are an American.  I mean, --
L:  Right.  
R:  What does any of that matter, you know? 
L:  Right.
R:  You weren't there.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  And back to the topic, I guess, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With people freaking out after the terrorist attack, there was plenty of anti -- anybody who had any sort of middle eastern look, whether they were, you know, Pakistani, Afghani.
R:  Right.
L:  Anywhere from the Middle East, even if they were Indian and not even the same religion -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Everybody was -- not everybody, but there was some major prejudice against people from --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  Those backgrounds.
R:  I worked -- I worked with a gentleman from -- where is he from?  I think he was from Pakistan, and, um, I had asked him, you know, what -- what his take on that was, how he'd been affected by it because I'd heard a lot of things about people freaking out, and he had said that his wife had encountered some things, um -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Because she's from the country too and so she, you know, still wears the whole ensemble --  
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and everything. 
L:  Right.
R:  And so she was at the mall I guess with his two young daughters and, you know, people just giving her jeers and stares and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, um, yes, so I can just imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But do they shut the call off do you know when it's over because I was checking the clock? 
L:  I don't know.
R:  And it has been ten minutes.
L:  It has been, okay.
R:  Um, it said on the thing to be on at least eight minutes.
L:  Right.  
R:  Um.
L:  I don't know, I'm not really sure.
R:  I don't know.  Maybe we should just talk for two more minutes just to cover our --
L:  Okay.
R:  Backsides.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you can think of any more things that you want to talk about about terrorism?
L:  Um.
R:  What is the one single most -- ah, what is the single most frightening terrorism act that you could even imagine?
L:  Um.
R:  To me it's chemical.
L:  Yeah, I would have to say, um, probably --
