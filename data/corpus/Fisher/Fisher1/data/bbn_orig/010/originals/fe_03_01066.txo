R:  Hi, I'm Judy.
L:  Hi, I'm Emily.
R:  Emily, where do you live?
L:  I live in Spring City, and you?
R:  I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, I'm in Pennsylvania. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, and we're supposed to be talking about comedy and where we draw the line.
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I would draw the line -- I -- I've -- I've  -- I could definitely say I would draw the line at language.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like, ah, I like clean comedy.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it can be, you know, a little unclean but it has to be tasteful.
R:  I know, not like, ah, oh, Eddie Murphy and, um, what's that other comedian that is so funny but his language is outrageous?  My --
L:  Robin Williams surprised me when I saw him do stand up.
R:  Oh, I've never seen him just do stand up comedy.
L:  I mean, he's hysterical, but the language is, ah --
R:  Yeah.  He -- 
L:  -- way too much.
R:  I would think that he would -- yeah, he probably uses the f word and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything else.  No one --
L:  In fact, it's funny because the first time I saw him was on TV but it was like in the late eighties and I has only known him on Mork and Mindy and thought of him as a really wholesome --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- young man -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Ooh.
L:  -- and I was quite shocked.  My favorite stand up comedian would be Bill Cosby because he does such a clean --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- hysterical act --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that -- that's the kind of comedy that I would say that -- that I like.
R:  I do too and he, ah, he can be funny without using any vulgarity or any -- I mean --
L:  I know, his face alone is, ah, is hysterical.  The faces that he's able to make.
R:  I know.  I love watching him.  You laugh at him just watching him.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But, I can remember when I was little and of course I'm a lot older than you are but we used to have, um, a record and I would sit and listen to it over and ov- it was Bill Cosby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean, I listened to it over and over and over again and I just fell in love with him from that.  But now, you know, that he had his own show and everything, I mean, oh, it -- we still watch it.  It's on, like, um Nickelodeon at night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's one of the few programs [LAUGH] that I can watch with little kids at night because it is, you know, so wholesome and -- and so funny and you don't have to worry about what they say or what they do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I know.
L:  Like, with the car- cartoons today I don't know if you are watching them, but they're so adult oriented that it's almost sad for my five year old who doesn't get half the humor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I have to decide what he can -- like there's so many shows that are funny to adults but not appropriate for children --
R:  Right --
L:  -- and it drives me crazy.
R:  -- and they're violent.  Some of these cartoons are in -- are violent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just amazed --
L:  I mean, when I watched Loony Tunes as a child I knew that what they were doing was not real --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it was funny, but the stuff they're doing now is so well animated that it -- I don't see how they draw the line.
R:  Um, I don't think they do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, and I can't tell you the name of the movie that I saw, it's been four months ago but -- and it was a child's movie but there was a lot of adult connotations in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and of course the children didn't understand.  It went right over their head, but I thought, "Now, why do they even have to put that in here?".
L:  Yeah.  It makes me sad for them that they have to watch something that half the stuff they don't even get. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  It's like -- but I think they do that because they know otherwise we adults would probably fall asleep maybe, who knows.  I don't know.
L:  Well, see I wouldn't because I love -- I love all the kids' shows -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  that are good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] wo- but maybe they think, you know, the adults would fall asleep so that's why they put it in, but little do they know that they could just make it nice and funny and clean and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and hysterical for little ones.
L:  Yeah and --
R:  They -- they try and get to a bigger audience though, I'm -- I'm convinced
L:  I just thought of -- of something else.  There's a lot of things that, um, I would consider okay in comedy like racial jokes and I don't mean that in a weird way, like I'm married to an Italian so I find Italian jokes hysterical and I'm Irish and I find Irish jokes hysterical --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I just find racial jokes like that funny.  That are -- they're funny, not -- not rude or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, ah --
R:  Offensive in any way.
L:  -- offensive, yes and -- and I -- I just find that -- that, ah, people are so sensitive about that today and I think it's ridiculous but then some people do go over the top like with the whole black white issue --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- that drives me crazy that, ah, the -- some of the stuff that I hear about that.  Now, some of it is funny and a lot of it is about white people and I find it very funny, but, um, I think some of it is either taken too sensitively or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- def- definitely done over the top but it seems like we're losing the ethnicity of America in comedy like you have -- it seems like comedy is the only place that they don't have to be careful about what they say. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  So I guess that's good but --
R:  Anything goes.  Freedom of speech, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah, and --
R:  But you're right.  People with different ethnic backgrounds, I mean, and they can laugh at themselves.  Look at that movie, My Big Greek Wedding, you know?
L:  Oh, I love that movie, it is hysterical.
R:  I mean, I haven't seen it yet but it looks like it -- it's going to be absolutely funnier than any --
L:  Oh, I think that you that you can put a couple of different ethnicity's in there, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could definitely put Italian in that movie, it would be exactly the same.
R:  Same.
L:  I don't know exactly what else you could put that would be exactly the same, but --
R:  Yeah, but if we can't laugh at ourselves, sometimes I think we -- you know, people just get too wrapped up in, you know, the fact that they are Italian or they are -- or they're offended by, you know, jokes where people say, "An Italian, and a Jew and a preacher went to the river" you know --
L:  Right --
R:  -- and they --
L:  -- and I grew up with jokes like that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and now you never hear them anymore.
R:  No.  No, because they're afraid somebody will [LAUGH] -- will take them to court and they'll have a civil law suit. [LAUGH]
L:  Have you seen the commercial where they have a priest and a rabbi and an Italian, like every ethnicity and they have a horse and all these people in a bar?
R:  I don't think I've seen that one.
L:  It's hysterical.  All these people --
R:  What's it advertising?
L:  -- in a bar that would normally be in one of those jokes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're -- I think it's a Heineken commercial --
R:  Oh, yes I have.  Yes I have.
L:  -- and they show Heineken --
R:  -- yes I have.
L:  -- and they say, "This is why they walked in" or something like that.
R:  Yes, I have. [LAUGH]
L:  That's comedy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That was great.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  But we recently, ah, we recently went to Italy.  My husband's actually from there and it was --
R:  Ooh, what a thrill.
L:  -- oh, it was beautiful.  And they are hysterical, I mean, you can't -- you can't hel- I mean everything they do is funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everything they do is dramatic and -- and passionate --
R:  Well, because they use their hands, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  And everything they talk about, like I'm limited on the language but -- so parts I couldn't pick up.  I was like, "Oh, what are they talking about?".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it will be something stupid --
R:  Feel like you're missing out.
L:  -- like going to the store. [LAUGH] But they're so -- they're so humorous in the way they do things and of course they like to make fun of things that I did.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  And I'm totally fine with that because --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's different to them, and ...
R:  That's what makes the world go around, that we're all different.
L:  Exactly.  I do think though now, ah, with the war on terror and everything, it's very inappropriate to be making fun of the President.  I really don't like when they do that.
R:  I agree with you and I don't know -- I know David Letterman hasn't been on lately because he's been sick but I hope that he, or Jay Leno don't, you know how they do their opening and they take jabs at the daily news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they always take jabs at the President --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I sure hope that they keep that out of their opening, ah, whatever, you know.
L:  I mean, we've come -- these are older people too, like Jay Leno --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and David Letterman that have grown up in a society where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they need to respect their country and it's okay to make jokes in an appropriate time, um --
R:  Oh, they had a hey day with Clinton.
L:  Right, and he deserved it. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But again, if we were facing war with Clinton, I'd feel the same way even though I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- didn't like him at all --
R:  I know.
L:  -- but, um, I just feel that they need to -- we need to whether we like -- whether people agree with it or not, need to present a united front and --
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  -- everybody can see our television, I mean, that everybody that needs to or wants to around the world [MN] leaders and things like that and -- and it's, I'm sure they already know that Hollywood is against it and --
R:  Yeah.  They've made it known.
L:  -- that's all common knowledge to them, so it doesn't help when we're broadcasting it on TV -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- so, I -- I think that -- I'm always surprised, even with Clinton, that people could make, ah, remarks like that in comedy, because --
R:  I was surprised too but I mean, they really --
L:  -- like thirty or forty years ago wouldn't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you be, like, arrested? [LAUGH]
R:  I think so, and, you know, there were things going on thirty and forty years ago that they could've talked about also, but they didn't.
L:  Right.
R:  They really dig deep nowadays and the, er, and some times it's anything for a laugh and that's where I think, "Oh, yeah" that's where I draw the line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like you said when the --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- when the country is, you know, in a -- in a crisis like this and they're gonna make fun of the President or make jokes about -- I -- I'm a little bit tired of the French jokes, you know --
L:  I haven't heard them.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Well, because the French, you know, and -- the, ah, well, they really are our friend, however, they haven't decided yet whether they're gonna join us in this venture --
L:  They haven't decided?
R:  Evidently.  Well, now they're just making horrible fun of them and I've been hearing stuff on the radio, ah, different things like, "Well, we're not gonna call, um, our French fries French any more, we're gonna call them American fries and we're gonna --"
L:  I've -- I've heard Freedom fries.
R:  That's it, Freedom fries and I mean, any time you would use the word French, they're throwing freedom in there because, I mean, they've just been making such terrible fun of the French -- [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm just tired of it, I guess, you know.  I don't -- I -- I mean, y- do we expect them to join us now after we've made fun of them and you're, you know, making jokes about them and criticizing them?
L:  I -- I actually haven't heard the jokes.  I've heard them more of boycott the name --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and the products but I haven't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- heard the, ah, the jokes but then it seems like the last two weeks I haven't seen any television, so [LAUGH]
R:  You're better off. [LAUGH] You're better off unless it's Comedy Central, right? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
