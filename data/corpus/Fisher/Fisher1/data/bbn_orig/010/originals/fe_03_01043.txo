L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
R:  Hello
L:  Hi, my name's Martin.
R:  Hi, my name's Nancy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  That's good.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Me, neither.  It'll be a first time for both of us.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] Where are you from?
R:  [COUGH] I'm from Connecticut.  Yourself?
L:  Ah, Georgia.
R:  Georgia?  Ah, -- I detected a little bit of southern twang.  Where in Georgia?
L:  [LAUGH] Atlanta.
R:  Oh.  I've got a sister out that way.
L:  [COUGH] But, I'm not southern.
R:  You're not southern?
L:  No.
R:  You got a little bit of it.
L:  [LAUGH] I am -- I have a northern drawl.  I speak slow, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not southern
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not northern, that's for sure.  No, my parents are from Michigan and they grew up -- I grew up in south Florida, so I don't have any southern.
R:  [MN]
L:  Now, what were we supposed to talk about?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  Humor?
R:  -- humor.  Humor and what is acceptable and what is not.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You start.
L:  Well, I -- obviously, um, offensive to most people, or to some people is -- my girlfriend is screwing with me.  Get out of here.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Bye.  Um, [COUGH] you can't use racial epithets or -- or religious epithets without being offensive to somebody so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that's -- that probably draws the line, although sometimes it still is funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, you have to know who you're talking to.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, there are cer- -- there are certain people that -- that take that humor and run with it and there's other people that would be completely offended.  You have to know your -- you have to know who -- who you're talking to and figure it out.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I also -- I do not like bathroom humor.  That's just me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have three children and that is their absolute favorite kind of humor.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, give me an example of bathroom humor?
R:  Um, er, just -- just anything about -- see for me bathrooms, there's a couple of different kinds of bathroom humor, but I -- I think it's, um --
L:  Well, what's the kinds your kids use?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the ki- -- the kinds my kids use are -- are -- it's basically about potty stuff and -- and farts and, you know that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's their kinda bathroom humor.  They're -- they're quite young, but I -- I don't like any kind of humor that -- that, um, [MN] is --
L:  Is risque?  Is that what you're saying?
R:  I -- I don't mind risque humor --
L:  Okay
R:  -- I just -- I just don't like, you know, I don't like talk about bodily functions I guess is -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't appreciate that kind of humor very much.
L:  Okay, so you're literally meaning bathroom humor --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I am, yeah.
L:  -- anything that pertains to --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- using the facilities?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Risque humor, I don't mind.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't mind that.
L:  No, I don't think there is anything wrong with that actually.  Um [COUGH] --
R:  And, sometimes I think people get a bit carried away with -- with, um, what they find offensive.  You know?
L:  Ye- well it depends on how you mean carried away.  I know I get upset probably more than some people, but I don't ever say anything usually.  I don't get in -- unless it's really obnoxious.  [LAUGH] I mean if, ah, [COUGH] like I -- I'm kind of offended by, um, sexist humor sometimes --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I won't really say anything, I'll just kind of avoid that situation.
R:  Now, when you say sexist humor, you're talking about women talking about men, or men --
L:  No --
R:  -- talking about women?
L:  -- usually men talking about women.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm that way too for the most part, and I will speak up and say something.
L:  You know, and there's other situations that are similar to that that I would be, um, whether it's racial or sexual preference or -- or any of that stuff.  Sometimes I would say something and sometimes I would just ignore those people and say I don't want to hang out -- [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I just don't see them as -- as enlightened enough to even get past that -- that level of stuff.  But, then again sometimes that stuff is funny and I laugh at it, even if I feel bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, I don't really have much choice if it's funny.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, --
L:  [LAUGH] A lot of times, it's just not funny, and it's really offensive when it's not funny.
R:  Right, right, and I'm trying to think -- I know that there was a -- a Seinfield episode, Seinfield being one of -- one of my favorite shows --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, [MN] and it aired once and they had to just take it right out, they could never -- it could never even be shown in syndication again, and it -- and I can't remember that -- some group found the humor offensive.  I can't remember what it was about, um, it was a minority group that found the humor completely offensive and I didn't think that they meant it in that -- in the tone that these people took it in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I thought that they took it a little too far in -- in blackballing this particular episode because I -- I didn't see it the way they -- they took it, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I think sometimes people have very thinned skins and -- and they will say it's offensive when I think they're just looking for a reason to complain.  Does that make sense?
L:  [COUGH] Well I -- I -- yeah, I understand the, ah, looking at it that way.  I -- I see that happening less than some people do I think.  I see definitely there's some people that -- that -- that overreact, but I also understand where you can't really know how it feels to be another person.
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  You can never know that.  So, even if it seems a lot to us, it may be a lot and it may not be, you know, it depends.  I guess you have to talk to more people in that group really to find out how bad [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, but --
L:  -- it really is.
R:  -- I take myself into consideration and -- and when things affect me directly, I have more of a sense of humor about it even -- do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I -- and I don't take it quite so literally and -- and -- and-- and I can, you know, laugh it off and -- and I don't [SIGH] I don't really see that it -- it affects me that much, um, so it's hard for me to understand that something simple and -- and I've seen a lot of different, um, situations where this has happened.  Something simple has really affected someone and I can't see how it could really affect them that much.  Does that --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- make sense?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I -- I -- I agree in -- and there's some instances that I feel the same way.  Um, there're not as -- there're enough of those instances for me to -- to put a lot of emphasis on worrying about it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I guess is what -- what happens, and that just comes down to what your threshold is of when you get bothered by that or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, okay.
L:  And that could be different with every -- that could be so far apart from both of us and yet we still say we agree -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but we don't even know.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what else is offensive?
L:  [COUGH] Ah --
R:  Or, what's not offensive?
L:  Politi- well, I'm thinking political humor, but that can -- that's generally not offensive.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I love people like Chris Rock that are just outrageous at times. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's -- I don't find that offensive at all, although I'm sure some people can, um --
R:  I don't mind outrageousness, but I guess this is where my mothering comes in.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think sometimes things can be funny without having to use a lot of expletives and do you know what I mean?
L:  Um, you know, obviously some people can do it very well and as a mother I can understand completely, but as somebody who's never had kids [LAUGH] sometimes that stuff is really funny.
R:  Oh, it --
L:  [LAUGH] and it --
R:  -- it can be very funny -- and -- and in certain situations it is very funny.
L:  See, my father hates it in all situation.  He says it's just bad.  I just don't go -- I don't subscribe to that.  Sometimes it is just way overblown and worthless --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but sometimes it's -- it's damn funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, in the right situation it can be hilarious --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it doesn't --
L:  Around kids obviously it's not appropriate in way, shape or form.
R:  No, and it's becoming more and more prevalent in -- in any kind of humor, even television.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, there's a lot of things that are becoming prevalent that's -- [LAUGH] that's offensive for the popular culture, that's not really against any particular group.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] I think the whole idea of just -- the w- teaching the way people behave which is a very different way than I learned and there is probably zillions of different ways but there're all different than mine.  Um, there's sometimes -- some -- there's some people that are just growing up fabulously and some people that just have no concept of -- of a life that I see that exists.  [COUGH] I don't think I can make any sense without getting overly specific and I don't think I can get that specific.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know if we can either.  I -- I kinda know where you're going.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I kinda know where you're going.
L:  [COUGH] It's weird, it's weird.  I mean it --
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a -- it's a different ball game out there, humor wise, um, than when I was growing up.  Um, you know, when I was growing up, it was the -- the seven bad words that you couldn't say on television --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was, you know, as -- as risque as it got --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for the most part --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and -- and now, that is like a daily occurrence.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah that [COUGH] -- yeah, I think they can use, what, five of them on TV?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
