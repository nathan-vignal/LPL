R:  Hello. 
L:  [NOISE] Hello. 
R:  Hi, my name is Amanda. 
L:  My name is Dawn Humphries. 
R:  [NOISE] Dawn? 
L:  Yes. 
R:  Okay.  Um, I guess we can start talking now. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you want to start or do you want me to start? 
L:  [NOISE] It doesn't really matter. 
R:  Um, well -- so I'll start.  Um, I think a lot of people would be really scared -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they will not be able to remain calm -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- regardless of -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, the situation they're in or the location they're -- [MN] I'm sorry -- they're in.  Um, I -- I think I would --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know if I would be calm or not.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think depending on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how close the things --
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- are happening, you know.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I have a little daughter, so I think that would be my main concern, is --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, how 'bout yourself? 
L:  Um, I'm not sure how I would react myself either.  Like you said, I'm sure a lot [NOISE] of people would panic, but depending on how close and how dangerous it is and what kind of attack it is -- like, um, if it's a bioterrorism attack or if it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- some other kind of -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- really big destruction, then it might be more of a panic for people. 
R:  Right.  Yeah --
L:  I have three children, so I know what you mean by you'd be more protective --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and more concerned about the children.
R:  Right.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Right.  Um, I was talking to my husband the other day.  It's -- I [MN] -- it seems like the war is so far from us right now that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we don't -- we didn't realize that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- okay, are we in a war right now?  I mean, nothing -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in our life changes so far, but I'm sure if -- you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if we can't go to work or we can't get outta the house or, you know, w- -- you know, we have a hard time doing groceries or whatever --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- that would make such a huge difference.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you located?
R:  Ah, in Michigan. 
L:  Michigan.  Okay, I'm in Kentucky. 
R:  Oh, so --
L:  I'm thinking is there any near -- ah, like, a military post or anything near where you are located or? 
R:  Uh, if it's what? 
L:  A military post --  
R:  No, there isn't, but Detroi- -- we are, like, an hour away from Detroit -- 
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- and, um, September eleventh they did have to evacuate the building.  Like, they have the jam[?] building, which is like very big --
L:  Ahah. 
R:  So a lot of automotive -- big automotive companies are here -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- and they have their office here, so, um -- so there was some concern, um, you know, a lot of people had to go -- to leave the building and stay out.  And also because of the bridge to Canada, being in Detroit, you know, that, um -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that was closed and a lot of people couldn't come back to the United States and a lot of people couldn't go back to Canada, you know, people that commute to work, because there was quite a few people that live in Canada --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- that commute to Detroit, that work in Detroit, and a lot of people that live in Detroit l- -- work in Canada.  So --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I remember at that time we did feel -- I mean, [MN] absolutely on September eleven, you know, we did feel, you know, "Oh, my God --"
L:  Right.  
R:  What's going to happen?"  Um, seems like the time went by and now, you know, you just hear, you know, things here and there in the news and [SIGH] you quite don't realize that it's really going on, it's not only a movie, you know.  It's just -- it's really going on, although it's --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not really affecting you direct. 
L:  Right.
R:  But it is sad, you know.  The other day I was watching TV and just flipping the channels because it's [inaudible] really hard to really watch TV --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there was [SIGH] [NOISE] -- just stopping on one [NOISE] of the channels there was this guy, um [MN] -- ah, he was, um -- he was going to the war and he was head of the family and there was -- his wife was there and there were, um, I think --
L:  Saying goodbye. 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] old in her arms and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and he was crying and, you know, she was saying, "Oh, he knows her dad is going and my not come", you know.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So I was like [MN] -- jeeze, I was just balling, you know -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- and crying.  My husband was like, "I'm not going war!"  I'm like, "I know."  It's just, you know, horrible to think about it.  There's --  
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- all those families out there that are going --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and --
L:  Right, my husband is prior military.  Uh -- 
R:  Oh, is he? 
L:  He was in the army, and -- so I kinda know what that's going -- like, we didn't have a family at that time.  We hadn't started having kids yet, but he did go to the Gulf War -- 
R:  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
L:  -- and he was there for about six and a half months. 
R:  Did he actually go in in combat or? 
L:  No, no -- 
R:  Just -- 
L:  -- he was, um -- he was more back farther than the lines. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  He wasn't sort of towards the lines or anything, but --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- he was pretty close to where -- like, they stayed in barracks, and just shortly after they had left the barracks the barracks were bombed. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So he was close but not real hands on combat or anything like that. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So -- but I was kinda thankful in a way, now looking back, that we didn't have any children at that time, but --
R:  Right.  It does make a lot of -- 
L:  -- it's harder to think -- 
R:  -- difference now. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, I know. 
L:  But it's a diff- -- it seems like with the terrorism it feels different than what it was before, because with the Gulf War there wasn't really much of a threat of --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- you know, the United States being -- you know, the United States soil being attacked --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and now it's different.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more our home, and this may affect us more than just sending troops over, you know. 
R:  Mhm.  And, um, I think what -- the terrorists had told us that [NOISE] it can happen any time anywhere in any way.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So that's what was scary.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] It's not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, [NOISE] you are gonna hear the airplanes coming by or whatever and then there's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gonna be bombs, you know.  It can just come, you know, through --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- chemical [inaudible] and, you know, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- different diseases -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Different illness -- I mean, who knows? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know. 
L:  Right.  My husband was talking to me a little about it because of the scariness of it.  But he -- I was saying, "With the bioterrorism is there anything that we could do to help prevent that or protect ourselves" --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and he said, "Well, really, basically, the only thing we could do is to get out of the area if we know it's sent to our area" and he said there are some bioterrorisms that -- like, say, if it's a disease, that they could, um -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- that we can have an antidote for it or something, you know, to counteract --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whatever disease that they're sending if we can try to figure out what it is soon enough.  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And he said basically just getting out of the area and then time for it to -- you know -- 
R:  Ah. 
L:  -- evade the area. 
R:  Yeah, well, that's a hard thing to do too [NOISE] 'cause -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you have work and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know. 
L:  You can't just pick [NOISE] up a family and run.  If you were just --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you know, a couple or something -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- it'd be easier but -- 
R:  It's not like you're by yourself and you can just take off. 
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Right. 
L:  But if it was a matter of our lives and protecting our children and keeping them safe, you know, at that point in time, if it came to something like that, I'm sure we'd be able to handle it a lot better than, you know, right now thinking about it. [LAUGH]  
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Did, ah -- were you able to contact your husband all the time [NOISE] when he was there or? 
L:  No, no, ah, 'cause a lot of times he was, like, in Saudi Arabia --
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and out in the desert, where there wasn't phones. 
R:  Right. 
L:  So -- every -- every once in a while we did make contact, which helped a lot, but -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- um, when he was out in the desert there was not really a whole lot --
R:  Mhm, yeah. 
L:  -- of phones and stuff. 
R:  Right, and I remember in the Gulf -- in the Gulf War there were a lot of mistakes happen [NOISE] -- I mean, it's in every war -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know. 
L:  Right. 
R:  I mean, places that had nothing to do with the war or nothing to do with [MN] being a target -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- end up being a target, you know, and that's what kind of scares me, 'cause we don't -- I mean, we live in a small, little city, you know, in the suburbs of Detroit, and we don't have noth- -- you know, we don't really have nothing, but who knows if by mistake something happened here, you know. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You're never really safe.  And my mom received an email like a month [NOISE] ago -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- saying, "Oh" -- you know, it's like -- I think a lot of people are receiving those emails saying, "Oh, you know, prepare from this day to this day.  Something's gonna happen.  Blah, blah, blah", you know, and it's so hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the email was saying, you know, for you to save wa- -- you know, go to the store, make a storage of, um -- make sure you have enough water supply and [NOISE] enough food supply, and then it was just like so intimidating, you know. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And I said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "I -- I'm sorry --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- I'm not going to get into this, because otherwise I might freak out", you know. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, so it's, [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, just hard.  You know, y- y- y- you know that the -- you know that there is a fear but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you can't live in a fear. [SIGH]
L:  Ahah.  Yeah, the panic -- [NOISE] like the question that we were asked about panicking, do you think a lot people'd panic, and -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- yeah, there will be.  You know, just like you were saying [NOISE] the people that are emailing all those emails -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  They're panicking already and nothing's really happened yet.
R:  Right. 
L:  So, [NOISE] there probably will be a lot of panicking. [NOISE]  
R:  Right.  Ha- -- um [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I was watching, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think a couple of days ago [NOISE] there was on Oprah a guy talking about fear and how much fear Americans have and so on and so forth and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- now we have fears so many -- so many fears already and now, you know, we have a -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fear of having -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- terrorists knock on our door, pretty much. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, [SIGH] you know, it's just so depressing and [NOISE] --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, for sure that affects, you know, the children and they'll -- you know, are brought up in this, you know, "Oh, any minute now", you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "something can happen and I have to grab you on your arm and we have to leave everything behind", you know, and it's just like, "Wow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not sure if I can do this.  I'm not sure if" -- it's just, you know --"
L:  It's a lot harder concept [SIGH] -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- with children, yeah. 
R:  Right.  So [SIGH] --
