R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] My name's Sammy.
L:  Oh, my name's Tonya Ramble.
R:  Um, I -- I don't know exactly what we're supposed to do except answer the question. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I guess the question was how -- if we would stay calm or would we panic during a terrorist attack.
R:  I think it's just human nature to panic.
L:  Yeah, I do too.  And you know, we just -- I don't -- I've been thinking about getting some of these books, you know, that kind of tell, you know, what you need to do in case there is a attack, but as of now I don't know -- I wouldn't know what to do.  [LAUGH] I think that's what would frighten me mostly, you know, is, um, I don't know, you know, how you could make a person safe, or your family safe.
R:  Right.  Well, I know that we cover this a lot when we're in church, and, you know, right now it's just more of a godly issue to me because, um, I feel that I need to be prepared no matter what happens, because, you know, they tell you to tape up your windows, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they tell you that the brick breathes, the sheet rock breathes, and then, you know, when it comes to the gas mask, um, they're only good for an hour and then you have to take them off and change the filter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, I don't know...
L:  I just -- I don't think there's really a lot a person really could do, you know, I just think... oh, does anyone really know, you know.  We've never really had to go through something like this to really know, you know, how bad it could be.  But I'm like you, I think it's all so -- you know, I'm a believer, I'm a Christian, and I'm -- I believe a lot of this could be, you know, the in the time stuff, you know.
R:  I'm, um, totally with you. [LAUGH]
L:  So you know, I -- and that's kinda scary, to think, well maybe there -- well, of course, as far as war goes, there again in the Bible it says there will always be war, rumors of war, so, you know, you probably feel that way too, or believe that way.
R:  Oh, yes.  And, you know, the rumors have gone on for years, and...
L:  As far as like, you know, making us -- you mean like our time might be close to being an end you mean, or what?
R:  Oh, I think we're definitely in the end days.
L:  Towards the end, yeah.
R:  But, you know, who's to say how long the end days are, you know.
L:  According to God, I mean, how long -- yeah, 'cause -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- a thousand years is like, you know, that's like nothing to Him.
R:  A minute. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  A second. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I um, I really don't know.  I think I would -- I would panic, yeah.  If I felt I could be safe in some way, you know, like you could tape up your windows or whatever, you know, but then sooner or later you're gonna have to come out and, as far as, like, now are we talking germ, um, or just everything?  Or radiation?
R:  I would assume anything's at hand.
L:  Anything.  Because see, I mean, sooner or later you're gonna have to come out. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  So, you know, how long -- you know, you could maybe get your gallons of water and your food stored up for a while, but pretty soon you're gonna have to come out of your safe -- you know, your home.
R:  Yeah, and we're on well water, so, you know, what's to say that our water wasn't contaminated during whatever it is, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause they've brought up the suspicion -- you know, because the West Nile just popped up out of nowhere.
L:  Now, what was that?
R:  The West Nile virus with the mosquitos.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, you know, they think that there may be a connection.
L:  There could be.  I was wondering about that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That somebody could have brought -- was that sort of a foreign thing anyway?  I mean that was -- it was never heard of it in the United States before.  Have we ever heard of it in here -- in the United States before?
R:  I haven't.
L:  It was a fairly new -- it was a new thing.
R:  And you know, and then there's like when I heard it on the news it was like two thousand people, you know, were infected with it last year, and it -- you know, it just makes you wonder what lengths these terrorists would go to to, you know, hurt us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just because of our beliefs.
L:  Right.  And that's scary with, you know, they think they're doing the right thing, you know, like they're honoring their god, you know, they're -- you know, that -- so it's -- the sky's the limit.  They could do anything to us.  Because they're honoring God when they can hurt us, you know.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of a sick religion, +isn't? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is.  I'm so glad I have no part of it.
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  But how do you feel about not letting anyone come to the United States?  You know, they've stopped all of that.  Don't let anybody from the Mid East come over here and go to school or whatever.  I know some of them sneak in, but just to put a stop to that.  You know, we've got so many people saying, oh, we can't do that, you know, that's not humane or whatever --
R:  Well --
L:  -- but it's not humane to have all of our people, you know, die either.
R:  That's kind of the catch twenty two, because, you know, we do stand for freedom and a lot of them don't know that from where they're from, so they come over here, you know, and you can't -- we didn't originate over here, we came from England, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, I don't know -- 
L:  Oh, I see what you're saying, like if it wasn't -- I see, like if -- it's like fairness or something.
R:  Right --
L:  Is that what you're -- yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of hard to -- 
L:  Say that you -- 
R:  -- say that you can't come here -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, when we're originally visitors ourselves.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  And it's -- I guess the Indians are the ones that can [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] that's right.
L:  -- really say, well this is our land [LAUGH].  I guess they would have the right to, to voice their opinion on that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  The American Indians.  Yeah, that's a --
R:  And there's so few of them left. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  But ah, I don't -- you know, it's just like a lot of people don't agree with letting the Mexicans come across the border.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, you know, we do missionary work over in Mexico and they have some really bad situations, and you know, they can't survive unless somebody comes across the border to work and send them money.
L:  I see what you're saying, so if we stop that then it's gonna be the same for every place, you know.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Or even our tourism, you know, to go travel into a -- a foreign country, you know, that would all be put a stop to too, I guess.
R:  Yeah, 'cause if you don't let, you know, their people in your country, I don't see where they would let us in theirs.
L:  Right, right.  So see how what -- you know, I've never went overseas --
R:  I haven't either. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but well that's kind of a dream, you know, to just go visit another country, I don't know exactly which one I would, I mean, I've kind of thought about it, but I don't know.
R:  Well, my brother's been to Turkey, and when I worked with a machining company, when they used to go to Turkey, or even Brazil, you know, they would come -- they would get off the plane and there would be people standing there with, you know, M16s.
L:  Oh no.
R:  And that's kind of a scary thought.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And then if you go to England there's always the threat of terrorism over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I don't -- I think --
L:  Canada may be safe. [LAUGH] But that's not too far -- I mean, you know, that's not really -- I don't feel that as going -- that's kinda North America anyway, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I don't think I -- that's not overseas.  I mean, we're just kinda like one, in a way.  So I wouldn't --
R:  Yeah, we're still on the same continent.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't -- 
R:  [NOISE] excuse me.  
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  But I -- 
L:  Well any- --
R:  I don't know really what else to say, but, you know, we all just need to make sure that our lives where they need to be, because the threat of terrorism is reality, and you know, it's inevitable, I believe.
L:  Mhm.  I know.  And it's the whole -- you know, I feel it's a new thing.  I mean, about ten years ago you didn't really hear of this, you know.
R:  Well --
L:  And -- well now talking about getting to the economy, the stocks, the stock market.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- you know, they say you can go kinda by history, you know, it would kinda let you know a lot of what's gonna happen in the years to come.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, there may be five, six, seven years of bad -- like right now there's what, three, this is going on three years of bad economy.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think --
L:  But then they say, well just wait it out, maybe in three or four years it will start picking up again.  But you know, this terrorism stuff is a new ball game.  So I don't know.
R:  I don't either.
L:  I don't know what to think about that.  This is new.  I mean, someone can just bomb something and the stocks will go down for months and months and months.  You know, and that -- I feel that there may not be an end to it, you know?
R:  And when I was younger I didn't even think about it anyway, you know, now I'm at the age to where it's something that I have to think about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I don't know whether my children are going to be able to grow up and find out what it's like to have families of their own because of these idiots. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  These suicide idiots.
L:  Yeah.  You see, there's no control over them.  I mean, they get in an airplane and they kill themselves too, you know.
R:  No kidding.
L:  It's a -- it's scary to think, you know, there's no value of life there, human life, not even for themselves, you know.
R:  And it doesn't matter if it's children involved.
L:  No, not at all.  It's like, they're Americans.  They're gonna grow up and they're gonna be bad, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we hate all Americans.  So there's no mercy.  That's scary.
R:  'Cause I think, you know, even with the threat of war we've taken into consideration, you know, the innocent bystanders.
L:  Mhm.
