HI MY NAME IS SAMANTHA  (fe_03_00702-A-0001)
HI I'M IN VIRGINIA  (fe_03_00702-A-0002)
UM YOU CAN START OR I CAN START IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER  (fe_03_00702-A-0003)
RIGHT CAN THEY BE MORE AWARE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN  (fe_03_00702-A-0004)
SEE WE LIVE IN A VERY RURAL AREA WHERE NO ONE IS AWARE OF ACTUALLY WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND THEY BELIEVE NOTHING CAN BE DONE  (fe_03_00702-A-0005)
WHERE IT REALLY COULD BE  (fe_03_00702-A-0006)
WHERE IF PEOPLE WERE MORE PREPARED  (fe_03_00702-A-0007)
RIGHT BUT NOT ALL TIMES YOU CAN BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE  (fe_03_00702-A-0008)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00702-A-0009)
SOME THINGS YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT  (fe_03_00702-A-0010)
BUT WE ARE LIVING IN AN A TIME WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD WORRY  (fe_03_00702-A-0011)
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK THEY DO  (fe_03_00702-A-0012)
OH I AGREE COMPLETELY AND THEY KINDA KEEP US IN THE DARK  (fe_03_00702-A-0013)
BUT IF WE WERE MADE MORE AWARE WE COULD PREPARE OURSELVES MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY  (fe_03_00702-A-0014)
AND MORE HOMELAND SECURITY  (fe_03_00702-A-0015)
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SO MANY SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN SHIPPED AWAY WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH HOMELAND SECURITY  (fe_03_00702-A-0016)
WHICH I THINK WE NEED  (fe_03_00702-A-0017)
BUT AFTER NINE ELEVEN PEOPLE NEED TO BE MADE MORE AWARE  (fe_03_00702-A-0018)
RIGHT INTERNATIONALLY  (fe_03_00702-A-0019)
SO THIS IS SUCH A BROAD TOPIC  (fe_03_00702-A-0020)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00702-A-0021)
WE HAVE THAT ALSO AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FAMILY THAT BELIEVES ONE THING AND DOES ANOTHER  (fe_03_00702-A-0023)
TO PREPARE THEMSELVES IN CASE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_00702-A-0024)
WHERE THEY'RE REALLY OVERLY AWARE OF WHAT COULD GO ON  (fe_03_00702-A-0025)
BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00702-A-0026)
THE BIGGEST THING THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE IF IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IT'LL HAPPEN ANYWAY  (fe_03_00702-A-0027)
SO BY TRYING TO STOP SOMETHING THAT'S PRETTY MUCH INEVITABLE  (fe_03_00702-A-0028)
THAT'S JUST WASTING TIME AND MONEY THAT COULD BE PUT TO SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_00702-A-0029)
BUT I'M SURE NOT MANY PEOPLE [LAUGHTER] WOULD AGREE WITH ME ON THAT  (fe_03_00702-A-0030)
I THINK BY LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN YOUR OPINIONS ARE KINDA DIFFERENT AS IF YOU WERE LIVING IN A LARGER CITY  (fe_03_00702-A-0031)
WHERE WE LIVE SOMEWHERE WE FEEL MODERATELY SAFE AGAINST THINGS LIKE THAT SOMEONE IN A BIGGER CITY WOULD NOT  (fe_03_00702-A-0032)
RIGHT THAN IF YOU WERE IN  (fe_03_00702-A-0033)
LIKE NEW YORK WHICH SO FAR  (fe_03_00702-A-0034)
WE HAVE THE DISADVANTAGE OF LIVING CLOSER TO WASHINGTON D._C. BUT  (fe_03_00702-A-0035)
WE'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY WHERE WE STILL CAN FEEL SAFE AGAINST ANY KIND OF BIO TERRORISM OR ANY KIND OF TERRORISM  (fe_03_00702-A-0036)
BUT IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT CROSSES YOUR MIND ON OCCASIONS  (fe_03_00702-A-0037)
BUT REALLY THERE'S NO STOPPING IT AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT BUT JUST PREPARE PEOPLE IN CASE IT WAS TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_00702-A-0038)
MINE TOO IT'S JUST GOING IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT [MN]  (fe_03_00702-A-0039)
UM I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER TONE OR SOMETHING ON THE TELEPHONE  (fe_03_00702-A-0040)
AND AN OPERATOR COMES ON OR SOMETHING I'M NOT REALLY SURE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DONE ONE OF THESE  (fe_03_00702-A-0041)
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID BEFORE  (fe_03_00702-A-0042)
I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW  (fe_03_00702-A-0043)
WELL THAT WORKS FOR ME [LAUGHTER] AS LONG AS I GET THE MONEY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00702-A-0044)
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF DOING THIS  (fe_03_00702-A-0045)
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED  (fe_03_00702-A-0046)
YES IT IS YOU GET A CHANCE TO KNOW EVERYBODY'S OPINION  (fe_03_00702-A-0047)
YES YOU TOO  (fe_03_00702-A-0048)
YOU HAVE A NICE ACCENT  (fe_03_00702-A-0049)

YES I UNDERSTOOD YOU JUST FINE  (fe_03_00702-A-0055)
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'M DONE  (fe_03_00702-A-0056)
