THEY'RE NOT VERY OFFENSIVE ON TELEVISION USUALLY  (fe_03_00740-A-0027)

WELL I I DON'T LIKE HUMOR THAT'S  (fe_03_00740-A-0029)

SOME MAN BEING RUN OVER THREE TIMES  (fe_03_00740-A-0046)
AND I COULD SEE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD FIND THAT OFFENSIVE  (fe_03_00740-A-0047)
IT ALTHOUGH I'M SURE IT WAS I THOUGHT WHEN THEY DID IT AND IT WAS FUNNY WHEN THEY DID IT AND I LAUGHED BUT UH I COULD ALSO UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF THAT  (fe_03_00740-A-0048)
I LIKE THE TYPE OF HUMOR THAT'S MORE SELF DIRECTED  (fe_03_00740-A-0049)
COMICS THAT GET UP THERE AND MAKE FUN OF THEIR OWN LIFE AND THEIR OWN SITUATIONS  (fe_03_00740-A-0050)

OTHER RACES AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW HE HE DIRECTED THEM AS IF THEY WERE IT ONLY AFFECTED HISPANICS BUT YET I YOU KNOW I LAUGHED BECAUSE I COULD SEE  (fe_03_00740-A-0061)
