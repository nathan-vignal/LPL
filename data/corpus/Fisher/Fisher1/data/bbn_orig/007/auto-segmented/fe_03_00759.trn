IN JUAN STILL VERSUS THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_00759-B-0096)
THEY RULED THAT THE U._S. SUPREME COURT RULED THAT EVEN IF A WITNESS ANSWERS A QUESTION IN A MISLEADING WAY AS LONG AS THE ANSWER IS LITERALLY TRUE PERJURY HAS NOT BEEN COMMITTED  (fe_03_00759-B-0097)
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE GUY UM THE WITNESS WAS ASKED IF HE HAD EVER HAD BANK ACCOUNTS IN SWITZERLAND AND HE SAID HIS COMPANY DID  (fe_03_00759-B-0098)
BECAUSE HIS ANSWER CONCEALED THE FACT THAT HE HAD HAD BANK ACCOUNTS IN SWITZERLAND THE PROSECUTOR PROSECUTED HIM FOR PERJURY  (fe_03_00759-B-0099)
AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT SINCE HE HAD NOT ACTUALLY LIED HE HAD NOT COMMITTED PERJURY  (fe_03_00759-B-0100)
