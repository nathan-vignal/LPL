THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST TOLD US WHAT THE CHARGE WAS WHAT WAS THE PERJURY PERTAINING TO  (fe_03_00766-A-0016)
I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD DO IT FOR JUST A FRIEND AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY SOMETHING  (fe_03_00766-A-0017)
LIGHT FOR ME TO DO IT FOR MY SON  (fe_03_00766-A-0018)
I WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS ANYTHING SERIOUS  (fe_03_00766-A-0019)

YEAH  (fe_03_00766-A-0036)
THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SITUATION TOO  (fe_03_00766-A-0037)
IF IT WAS SOMEBODY I GREW UP WITH AS A CHILD I'D BE PROBABLY MORE PERTAINING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAN I WOULD BE FOR SOMEONE I ONLY KNOW A FEW YEARS  (fe_03_00766-A-0038)
YEAH  (fe_03_00766-A-0039)

I DON'T GUESS THEY REALLY EVER DID SAY YOU KNOW THE SUSPICION WAS THAT HE HAD ANOTHER WOMAN SOMEWHERE  (fe_03_00766-A-0062)
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ENDED UP BEING IT OR NOT BECAUSE HE NEVER DID MARRY ANYBODY ELSE  (fe_03_00766-A-0063)
AFTER HE GOT OUT HE WAS EVEN ALONE SO I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_00766-A-0064)
