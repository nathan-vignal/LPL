L:  Hello.
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi, my name's Lydia.
R:  Hi, I'm Cheryl Vanderloop.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Monasha[?], Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, um, Chicago, Illinois.
R:  Okay.
L:  We're pretty close.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, not too far.
L:  Okay, so, um, do you want to answer the question first?
R:  Yeah -- yeah, I guess -- you know I was thinking, I'm not really sure I get the kinda -- well, I don't want to say it depends on the type of attack, but I'd have to say with some kind of bomb or something.  I'd --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- have to say that I think people would probably really panic if it was some type of bomb.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think if it was more discreet, you know, like a --
L:  You didn't have the chance? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly -- like, if it was bio terrorism they may not really realize --
L:  What's going on, right.
R:  -- what's going on, yeah.  It almost depends on how it's done you know.
L:  Right.
R:  The same things -- if they don't realize what's happening -- they don't have a chance to --
L:  To react, right.
R:  -- to react, yeah.  I mean I don't mean to, um, take over the conversation, I'm just trying to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes it hard, I haven't done a survey or thing like this before so --
L:  Yeah, this is my first one too.
R:  Yeah, I've tried to think of how to answer some of these questions and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it makes you wonder in a lot of these things -- these things are in the back of your mind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and kinda wonder about it but, um --
L:  Well, I think that, um -- I think the same as you as in terms of panicking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know what I mean.  If there was a terrorist attack, I am sure that most people would panic in that situation and in terms of myself, I think I probably would too, [LAUGH] although --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's just because you haven't really -- you don't know what to expect when you're in that situation, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know you can say you'll keep your cool, and you'll think about what you got to do but once you're in there, who knows, you know?
R:  I know.
L:  So ...
R:  And then if you get hurt or something in the process.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I mean imagine how your adrenalin go- -- you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Let's say if you got hurt, even if you know it was just, um -- you know you think of a bombing or something like that, and if you just have, um, cuts or bruises or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you see blood or something.  [LAUGH]  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, yeah some people just freak out to that.
R:  They do yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a scary thing, go into shock.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Or something.
L:  Well, you know, now that I think about it a little further, I think initially I would probably panic, to figure out, like, okay am I going to live or die --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and how can I get out of this situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I think if I was kinda, like if I was in the -- the trade towers or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when that happened.  I mean, depending on what kind of physical situation I was in, I think I probably would try and help people to get out.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  I think there are some people that panic to the sense where they just run out -- and you know -- they're not thinking about anybody or helping anybody along the way, they just want to save themselves.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  So I think -- I think I would try and --
R:  And you're more of, you're more of a person that would try and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- remain a little more calm and try and get people --
L:  After the initial shock, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  And that is good that you can remain calm like that 'cause, I think I'm that way too a little bit where, you know, if you were kinda assess the situation a little bit more you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can kind of say, well, you know -- it's hard [LIPSMACK] to see though too because I didn't realize all the smoke and the, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know where there almost -- um, not the smoke, but, um, [LIPSMACK] with the ash and stuff like that --
L:  Oh yeah, in the air.
R:  -- where they can't see.  You know, you can't, you know, hardly breathe --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's a scary situation too where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you can hardly see where you're going or -- you know [COUGH] --
L:  Or breathe yeah.
R:  -- excuse me, can't breathe, that's like jeez you just want to get the heck out of there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right, I --
R:  You know.
L:  Well I think your -- probably your body's natural inclination is to panic when you can't breathe anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  That's why so many people probably drown and stuff is 'cause they just panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I don't know it would be a tough situation, so --
R:  It would be.  It's, uh, hard to say but you would hope that -- that if you could try and find a way out then you'd, you know, go back in and try and help people or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah and hopefully react as calmly as possible, just to try and get as many people helped as possible, and get yourself out.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it seems like the theme for most of the conversations this week have been surrounding --
R:  The ...
L:  -- you know war and terrorism ...
R:  -- the attacks or something like that.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I wonder if the study is mostly, you know, about that.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Uh.
R:  --'cause I noticed on the website I think, they posted, um, some of the different questions, like, if you were offered, um, so much money to leave the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was kind of an interesting one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would have been interesting to talk about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you could never return or whatever.  That would have been neat to talk about or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever, you know, but yeah I think now -- I think the concern more is, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, what's going to happen if there's going to be a war or something.
L:  With the war and everything what's going to happen to the state of the union happening this week and everything.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, it's -- well, it's a good topic I mean 'cause it gets you kinda thinking of what could happen and in -- we get a chance to see some of the stuff like the CNN reports when all the, uh, terrorist bombs go off in third world countries or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you know you kinda get to see how they're reacting and the situation as it's unfolding so to -- so to speak.
R:  So to speak, that's right.
L:  Yeah, and I think that's where I base most of my -- how would I react 'cause you can't really set your expectations on what it's gonna feel like to be in the situation, you know.
R:  I know.  You know it's such a hard thing to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't watch a whole lot of the news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um -- so I don't keep up with it every single day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I have a hard time 'cause I -- I tend to -- you know, like, I watch it and I get all nervous about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so if I stay away from it [LAUGH] I feel a little bit better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you can't control what's going to happen.
L:  Right.
R:  And if you sit and watch it I don't know -- I tend to just get too worried about it --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  And um you know.
L:  -- there's a lot of different -- I mean there's a lot of people that have different views on that.  I don't think that I would probably watch it as often as I do if it wasn't for my boyfriend who's, like, a CNN junkie --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so it's always on in the background and stuff and --
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  I guess -- I guess I don't completely focus in on it, but I do pick up things just because it's on, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm kind of in the middle.  I'm not really keeping myself away from it, but I'm not in -- you know diving right in to it and just getting surrounded by whats going to happen in war and all that you know.  Kinda more like, well, let's see what happens and hope that our -- our government does the best thing for us, you know.
R:  Mm.  That's right.
L:  That's all we can do, right?
R:  That's right; you just gotta trust them, that they know what they're doing.
L:  Right, right.  I was watching uh some -- some, uh, debriefing on sea span or something and they were talking to, uh, Rumsfeld and they just kept asking and asking where is the evidence?  What's the evidence?  What's the evidence?  What's the evidence?  And there's -- it's so -- it's funny to watch because he has to be so patient 'cause he doesn't say I already answered that, or I'm not going to answer that.  He actually tries to answer it without really answering the question.
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's pretty good, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But it's interesting to have that information available if you are the type of person that wants to know about it.
R:  That's right -- and it doesn't -- I mean it's good to listen and watch and at least it is available.  'Cause it doesn't pay to, you know, hide your head in the sand, you know.
L:  Yeah I -- 
R:  'Cause that's not -- I mean you know --
L:  Ignorance is bliss.
R:  -- you gotta realize that it's part of life you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  It's out there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things are going on so you can't just live in your little world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and pretend, like, things aren't you know happening.
L:  Right, or that they may not affect you.
R:  Right.  And I don't have, um -- I really don't -- I don't have any children or anything but --
L:  No, me neither.
R:  -- I do have, um, you know family members obviously, and people that could be affected and --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- you know.  My boyfriend has a son that's, um, eighteen and is planning on joining the army.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, you know I mean there's kinda -- well, yeah, and you better believe he'll probably end up after basic training you know --
L:  Yeah, being shipped out.
R:  -- going somewhere.  Exactly, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's kind of a scary thought you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, getting ready for that.  When he did tell you that he was thinking about doing that?
R:  He [COUGH] -- he's been for the past year now -- well, no a little bit before that he wanted to go into the navy and then the army offered him [MN] something so he can be in the -- I think he was going to be a military police, you know like that sort of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they offered him as far as a position so that excited him.  He thought that'd be kind of a neat thing you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah
R:  So -- and, um -- but now as of I guess sons are going to graduate like June or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know that --
L:  All the basic training is out of the way in June for him?
R:  Yeah, well, he has to -- actually has to graduate high school in June.
L:  Oh, wow! [LAUGH]
R:  So you know what I mean?  So, then he'll be going into, you know, basic training exactly.
L:  Well, I guess it's kind of a catch twenty two, because it's good that at that age he knows kinda -- he's dedicated to doing something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then, you know, the flipside is how dangerous it is --
R:  Exactly
L:  -- that, you know -- what could happen.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, and he knows that, but well it's good for him so ...
L:  Mhm
R:  But yeah this is how -- I mean that -- that's the world today is so he has to realize what can affect him and everything but --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that's what he wants to do.
L:  Yeah, and I think a lot of people as far as like the war thing coming up, you know coming down the path, or on the horizon and stuff, it's just -- there's always -- there's a lot of different views on that too because I know that personally my boyfriend is, like, on this, "Well, war will be good for the economy". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know and but he's not thinking about like the lives and the you know -- I don't know it doesn't seem like he's thinking further than just how our economy is going to be affected.  'Cause there's so many factors that you know factor into a war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  That's true.
L:  Besides that.  Besides how good we gonna make out --
R:  Make out, yeah.
L:  -- in terms of this war and you know with things that we have to produce and stuff like that so ...
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, so mhm
R:  But ...
L:  Okay I guess we should keep talking about terrorism. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you know how long the calls are supposed to be?
R:  I don't remember and I know that it said, um, that it -- the operator or whatever will come on and say when it's done or it's gonna be done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so ...
L:  To wrap up your call?
R:  -- it'll give us a little warning or whatever.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But I don't know if it's like fifteen minutes or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's all right, we can talk about um, oh, like, if you -- like bio terrorism or something like that too if you want.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  I don't know a whole lot about different kinda things --
L:  Right, right, 'cause I know there's like chemical warfare in the bio terrorism and it seems like they're kinda the same thing because --
R:  That's what I thought, yeah.
L:  -- it's all, like, things that you can't see, chemical things in the air or they drop bombs that have these --
