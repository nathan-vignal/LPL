L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Emma.
R:  Hi Emma. My name is Keaton.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh, really, me too.
L:  Good. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so what business would you start?
R:  Um, I don't know.  It's a tough question.  I haven't thought that much about opening my own business.  Have you thought about something already?
L:  I'm an allied[?] major and so I haven't really thought of being an entrepreneur, but if I did, and money was no object, I would definitely do some sort of charity thing, like, a non-profit organization more than a business.
R:  Oh really [inaudible] Do you know what kind of non profit?
L:  Um, probably like, battered women or children that were abused --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- something along that line.
R:  That's really --
L:  Or, maybe like, me and my husband could go down to Mexico or something and start an orphanage program.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know, that's just what came into my mind first.
R:  [LAUGH] That's [several inaudible words] my sister is a, um, masters of public administration --
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's in that program and so she is working for non profit businesses like that and she enjoys it.  Um, I'm can -- I'm a linguistics major and I'm working for, kind of a sponsor [inaudible] right now in a small business company ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it's kind of a neat deal[?] it's something that I -- I wouldn't mind being in, I guess, later if I was to open my own [inaudible] it's a software producing company and so we have a bunch of different computer projects and software packages.
L:  My father does that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's kind of just finding a niche in the market that hasn't been totally exploited yet and see if you can start it up.
L:  Thought about what you would do if, like, money was no object?
R:  Mm.  It's probably not what I would love to do most, but I think it would be one of the more practical things that I could do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and just having some experience with it already, and eventually I could find something that I liked within that and software's pretty wide open, I mean, I love languages and there's a lot of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- opportunities with language processing software and translation software and things like that.
L:  That's why I'd love to get, um, I think I'd love to do the [several inaudible words] because I have a [inaudible] in Spanish, he's lived in Mexico and --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Um, I'm a Spanish minor and a TESOL minor, and so, we could, like, really get something going down there and maybe just live there for a couple of years while it was starting off and then move back up here and have our own family in the United States but then go down there every now and then, like, check on things, make sure things are running well and send them money.  We can do fundraising up here.  It would just all be so much fun.
R:  Yeah, that does sound like a lot of fun.
L:  [several inaudible words] and I could use, like, all my, um, early childhood education training, to, like, train, hire workers and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, I'm getting excited talking about it, but money is an object so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we'll just have to throw that out the window. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's great though.  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff [inaudible] international too especially if you speak other languages --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Spanish, there's so many Spanish speakers too, especially.  It's great.  I speak Italian and could do something over there but it's definitely not as big a market as, ah, Spanish. [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] a -- a useful language, more so than, like, Serbian or, I don't know, something, Orlando[?].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And if you can understand it, like, if you know a time you can understand Spanish --
R:  That's true.
L:  And you can read French, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of [inaudible]
R:  Hm.  What, let's see, what do you think you would need to start up a business like that?  Other than capital, what kind of a business owner do you think you could be?
L:  Um, well, Dan's my husband, and he'd do all the financial things. [LAUGH] He's better at it than me, so he would take care of the finances and I'd do more of the training and the hiring, um, we'd probably go around together and whatever country we were in in the area and find out, like, where we should rent the building and find how to start that type of organization down there, like from the government, the different things we'd need.  I'm sure we'd do all that together, but he'd probably do the finances more by himself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then we'd just hire people first.  That'd be the first priority and train 'em before any children come in, decide what ages we're going to do and different things and then start getting the kids in there, I guess.
R:  So, you think you'd start with a big bang all at once, like, full size corporation, or are you going to start on a lower scale?
L:  Oh, we'd start -- we'd probably start small, like, we'd have like, ten or fifteen kids and like, a four room building or something and then move on up as it got more and more successful, as I'm sure it would.
R:  Wow, you've thought a lot about this.
L:  I really haven't, I'm just busting out.  I'm getting excited --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but of course, like, it would just take a lot of money because we wouldn't have any money coming into it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I just think that would be something nice to do because of the low economic situation.  Like, I'm sure the government doesn't care, like, maybe they care but they don't put as much money into things like that as our government does.
R:  Yeah.  So.  Actually, I worked down in an orphanage in Mexico for a couple of months.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And ah --
L:  I wanted to do that [inaudible] when I get a chance.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that sounds so cool.
R:  Yeah, I certainly like listening to great stories, but it sounds like they really do need a lot more of that kind of thing, they just couldn't hold all the kids that they need to.
L:  Mhm.  It'd be cool too, because we could bring couples, like, the church, adoption agency, maybe, I don't know how they work, like, internationally but, like, not just like, have an orphanage, be a safe place for the kids to be, but really work on getting them adopted into good families and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff.  Really make a difference.
R:  Mm, oh that's cool.  I'm excited, that would be -- that would be awesome.
L:  It would be. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If we had money in the bank and stuff --
R:  How long do we -- I'm getting married in April.
L:  So, does -- how long have you been engaged?
R:  Ah, a little over a month now.  Since December twenty ninth.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]  What were you going to ask me?
R:  How long have you been married?
L:  Um, just five months.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just got married in August.
R:  Pretty exciting stuff.
L:  Yeah, it's really cool.
R:  Um, do you think it would be easier to start up your own business if you were alone, or being married?
L:  Oh, I think for me it would definitely be easier being married, because I would just have, like, a companion with me, in, like, everything I did and someone whose opinion I could totally trust about everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think I would be totally hindered if it was just me by myself, like, I'd feel so overwhelmed.
R:  Yeah, that's true, there'd be a lot of work to do.
L:  Hm?
R:  There would be a lot of work to do.
L:  Yeah, I think that even if -- even if money, like, was no problem that it would be something I wouldn't do, if I wasn't married, it would just be something else I'd like, dream about but not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually put in action because I wouldn't -- I don't know, for some reason I just wouldn't have the courage to do it myself.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  So, you would do the business with your friend or brother or would you start up some complet- completely different?
R:  I don't know.  I think it would be a lot easier to kind of get a handhold, just -- you branch off, than an existing company.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I think there would definitely need to be a part where it became an independent thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I think that starting from scratch all by myself would be a much more difficult proposition than, um, working with someone who was already kind of in the business who'd kind of help me get a foot hold.
L:  Oh for sure, you can learn the way things work and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that kind of thing.
L:  Get your name out there. 
R:  Yeah, and just kind of understand, ah, the way things work and get some contacts, but, yeah, I don't have any specific plans.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's definitely something I would like to do down the road a little bit, ah ...
L:  So, would you do software like, gaming or ...?
R:  No, I -- I'm, more into educational software.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, like, there's a, I don't know, BYUN's um, program computer in the humanities, which is all about computer assisted language learning.
L:  Yeah, Champs, right?
R:  Right.  Um, so I enjoy that kind of software which is designed to help people learn and that would go well in with my theorem, linguistics just helping people learn languages, understand languages, even if it's translation software, although they haven't really got that to work very well so far.
L:  That'd be cool.
