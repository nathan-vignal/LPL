L:  Hi, my name is Samantha.
R:  Hi, my name is [inaudible] uh, living in Texas.
L:  Hi, I'm in Virginia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, you can --
R:  So, uh --
L:  -- start or I can start --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it doesn't really matter.
R:  So, I think in terms of the, uh -- about terrorism.  I think the government, the US government may -- may need to do something like the resignation or -- or something like that, yeah.  [several inaudible words] I mean it's [several inaudible words] people more alert with those, uh, yeah -- those kind of things, yeah.
L:  Right, can they be more aware of what can happen?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  See, we live in a very rural area --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- where no one is aware of actually what could happen, and they believe nothing can be done.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where it really could be -- where if people were more prepared.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  We are living in a town and so, um, we look at the TV and then -- yeah, we always, yeah, aware of those, uh, you know from the TV [inaudible].
L:  Right but not all times you can believe everything you see.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-uh, yeah.
L:  Some things you have to use your own judgment.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  But we are living in an -- a time where people should worry.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, I really don't think they do.
R:  Yeah, in fact there is the larger of, um, those, uh, worries or something -- I mean most of the people may not know about only those scientists, um, or those work with the uh --uh, labs know about all those stuff and yeah ...
L:  Oh, I agree completely and they kinda keep us in the dark.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  But if we were made more aware, we could prepare ourselves mentally and physically.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Maybe the -- maybe the government need to spend more money on those, uh -- um, to tell you something.  And -- yeah.
L:  And more homeland security.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Because right now so many --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- soldiers have been shipped away, we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- don't really have that much homeland security.  Which I think we need.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  But after nine eleven people need to be made more aware.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we should be more aware of the homeland as well as the other countries.
L:  Right, internationally.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  So, this is such a broad topic.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And most of people -- most of the people do not know too much about, uh -- unless they -- they are family with those, uh, you know.
L:  Right.  We have that also, and then you have the family that believes one thing and does another, to prepare themselves in case something would happen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where they're really overly aware of what could go on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think right now the biggest thing -- the government couldn't do anything to stop something that's gonna happen because if it's gonna happen, it'll happen anyway.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm, yeah.
L:  So, by trying to stop something that's pretty much inevitable ...
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  That's just wasting time and money that could be put to something else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm sure not many people [LAUGH] would agree with me on that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think by living in a small town your opinions are kinda different as if you were living in a larger city.  Where we live somewhere we feel moderately safe, against things like that someone in a bigger city would not.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think if you live in some rural areas is maybe a little bit more safer than the --
L:  Right, than if you were in --
R:  -- large cities, because most of the -- those terrorists, I think they mostly aim at those large cities and --
L:  Like New York which [inaudible] so far.
R:  -- with a lot of people, yeah.
L:  We have the disadvantage of living closer to Washington DC but we're far enough away where we still can feel safe against any kind of bio terrorism or any kind of terrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's still something that crosses your mind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on occasions.
R:  No, because on one knows, uh, where it will happen you know and [inaudible].
L:  But really there's no stopping it and they can't do anything to stop it.  But just prepare people in case it was to happen.
R:  Mhm.  No, I think that's -- that's almost [inaudible] and that's my opinion.
L:  Mine too.  It's just going -- it's something that if it's going to happen, it's -- we just have to accept that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay.  [MN] So, that's it?
L:  Um, I think we have to wait for another tone or something on the telephone.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And an operator comes on or something.  I'm not really sure; this is the first time I've ever done one of these.
R:  No, this is my second time and I think if we've finished then we can hang up or ...
L:  Is that what you did before?
R:  Yeah, and that's what I did last time but I'm not sure ... are you sure that we have to wait for the tone or ...
L:  I honestly do not know.
R:  Because the last time when we finished, we just hang up and did not wait for any tone.
L:  Well, that works for me, [LAUGH] as long as I get the money.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because that would be an important part of doing this.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But as far as I'm concerned --
R:  Yeah, it's one the most important parts and, uh, also [inaudible] quite interesting.
L:  Yes, it is, you get a chance to know everybody's opinion.
R:  Yeah, yes and it's also nice to talk to you.
L:  Yes, you too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You have a nice accent.
R:  I got an accent?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] Yes, not one that we hear very often here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We get to hear the southern accent but not -- not really anything else.
R:  So, did you hear most of what I said, or ...
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes, I understood you just fine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But as far as I'm concerned I'm done.
R:  I'm done too.
L:  And you have a great day.
R:  You too.
L:  Bye-bye.
R:  Thanks, bye-bye.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
