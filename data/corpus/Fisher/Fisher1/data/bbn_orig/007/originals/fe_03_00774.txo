R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's [inaudible]
L:  Hi, my name is Wayne [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you.  Would you leave the United States for a million dollars?
L:  [LAUGH] Huh.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  But, ah, for a million dollars, never to come back?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's what they said.  Um, like, ah, ah [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] because, when I came to the United States -- I -- I wasn't born here.  I was, like, ah -- I don't want to leave this country.
R:  Right.
L:  But [LAUGH] but, with a million dollars -- where would you go and still have the same -- I don't know -- you have to find, like, somewhere, where you'd enjoy that and enjoy the freedom at the same time.
R:  That's -- I mean -- I enjoy the luxury of the United States, but one million dollars would last a very long time in very many other countries, and ...
L:  Exactly.  Like ah --
R:  I could live very well in South America for a long time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah ...
L: Yeah.  Sure, I guess that's, ah, an offer that's hard to turn, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I also, I -- I didn't choose to come to the United States, I was born here and it has been great for me, as a place to live, I mean, we have a lot of freedoms and there's a lot of luxury in the United States, but I, ah, would prefer [NOISE] to not have to work --
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I just wouldn't not have to worry about, em, monetary income ever again, or to ah ...
L:  Yeah.  Ah -- ah -- if I take that million dollars and change it into, um, um, my local currency in my country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that will come to um, five -- about six million.
R:  Certainly.
L:  Mm, so, that's a lot of money.
R:  That's a lot of money and ...
L:  Yo- yo- you wouldn't have to do anything for the rest of your life, like.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, what would you miss about the United States?
L:  Yeah, I would miss everything, oh my gosh, [LAUGH] oh yeah, ah, ah, I would miss everything.
R:  Such as?
L:  The people, the, ah, freedom, ah, not having to worry about what you -- what you believe in, like, ah, you're free to say what you think is right, you don't have to, like, go with what other people believe, you don't have to do things that you don't like just for the sake of your community, or you're group -- the group of people that you live with.  Whereas here --
R:  Do you think that's true in the United States everywhere?
L:  Say that again?
R:  Do you think that's true, everywhere in the United States?
L:  I don't know, like, it -- to me, when I first came here, I, um, I found it very easy to, ah, like, when people ask me about my beliefs, when they get to know me, I mean, um, I -- I feel comfortable telling them what I believe in.  Which is, like, nothing. [LAUGH] So, ah, but I couldn't do that in my country.  I'd be very bad -- in a very bad situation.
R:  I see.
L:  [LAUGH] you see, but, ah, I don't know, I haven't seen places where you, um, -- maybe if you have family here, I guess you'd have to go with that, I don't know [LAUGH] Maybe it's just because when I came here I just was alone, so, ah, just didn't care.
R:  Yes.  I see.  I, ah, my family lives in the South, and there, um, it's not a matter of state persecution, but there's definitely a lot of social pressure to believe in a lot of Christian ideals and a lot of ah ...
L:  Yeah, ah -- ah --
R:  -- believe that people assume a -- a wide spreading [inaudible] but don't necessarily apply to everyone.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- I think -- I think it's -- it's the same thing, but here you enjoy more freedom. [LAUGH] Trust me. [LAUGH] A lot more, so --
R:  May I ask you which country you immigrated from?
L:  -- I -- I came from Egypt.
R:  Ah.  Yes, I can believe that.
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- I -- I didn't belong there, like, ah, I mean I love my family and everything, but ah, I just don't [LAUGH] I don't believe in any of that so, I -- I just couldn't express that.  I was considered, like, if I did anything, it would be bad.  Would be really bad.  You -- you cannot --
R:  Like[?]?
L:  You cannot -- like, you cannot go out on a weekend and drink because that's like, taboo, that's bad.  You feel bad, you feel that you're really a bad person, because of that pressure, and ah, I -- I don't feel bad here.  I feel that I'm, like, quite, ah, reasonable person, like, very normal, like less than normal sometimes [LAUGH] I mean, I didn't, ah, people, like here when I came, it's like, the appreciation, I -- I got from people, the chances, the opportunities, ah, that's something that money cannot [LAUGH] you know, you cannot translate that into money [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's why I said, oh, if I leave the United States, I'm gonna be, like, ah, I miss everything.
R:  Interesting.  That [NOISE] um, what else are we supposed to talk about?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we're supposed to, um, what, um, things we -- we would miss --
R:  Yeah. What things would --
L:  What you would do with ah, a million dollars?
R:  I, ah, well, I think with the million dollars I would just try to live as independently as possible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, you know, maybe set up a farm and try to grow my own food and [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I'm with you. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, try t- to make it last for as long as possible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't exactly know if that's possible, or, I mean, I presume it would be, a million dollars is a whole lot of money in the United States.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In many other countries it would be even more, so ...
L:  Like, if you put it in a bank, if you change that into Egyptian money and put it in a bank, that will come up to almost, like, ah, f- f- f- like almost six million Egyptian pounds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you put these in a bank you have a nice -- you don't have to do anything.  You have a nice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- income, like monthly, but, you can even save money from the money that you get on that.
R:  Certainly.
L:  Because the interest rate is really high, you -- you make some -- you make some -- I don't know, I can't remember that, but it's, like, ah, the interest, ah, that you'd get is about, um, thirteen percent or something.
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  [MN] yeah, that -- that could definitely get a farm, right.
L:  Yeah.  So you make so much money and you don't have to worry about anything, I don't know, I'd be -- I'd go bad if I did that [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But maybe I would have some time to, I don't know, lose some weight, practice sports, do something.
R:  Right.  Um, hm, I'm not really sure what I would miss the most about the United States because ...
L:  Family [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they could presumably visit me?
L:  Ah, yeah, I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  If I were in Canada or, you know, some place close, they could -- they could visit me.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] That's ah, um -- oh, not the weather. [LAUGH]
R:  Not the weather in the United States?  Which areas of the United States have you lived?
L:  Um, I live in the North, in ah, east coast, ah ...
R:  Yes.
L:  Baltimore.
R:  Ah, yeah, I um, I live mostly on the eastern half of the United States, but, in -- ah Tennessee, for example, the weather is wonderful, it -- it gets hot in the summer but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not -- not that terribly hot, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and there's about two weeks that it's very cold in the winter and that's it, otherwise it's very temperate, very pleasant.
L:  Mhm.  That is true. [LAUGH] Like, here, I -- when I was getting here I realized that each season is very distinct, like -- yeah --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- this is spring, this is winter, this is fall, but in Egypt it's so similar, except for, like, you get, not really -- you know, we don't get any winter, like winter here.  A couple of cold days, maybe, not really like, freezing, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  We don't even go near freezing [LAUGH] so, the weather here, I -- I sometimes I see the four seasons in one day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Like, ah ...
R:  It's true and beautiful[?]
L:  -- and tornados and things like that, I know Egypt it's really hot, I didn't like the heat but it's dry.  Here in the summer, oh, it's -- 
R:  Right, it's very, very humid.
L:  Oh, humid!  So humid --
