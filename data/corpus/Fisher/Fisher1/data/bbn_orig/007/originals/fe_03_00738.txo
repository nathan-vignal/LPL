R:  Hell- hi, my name's Paul.
L:  Hi, um, Ed.
R:  Hey, Ed, how are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  So, I've never done these before.
L:  Uh, me neither so I guess we're supposed to talk about comedy.
R:  And how you draw the line, okay.  Um, well, I guess ... the line is probably, uh, the use of, like, stereotyping so I probably -- I don't --
L:  Well, I don't know.  Personally, I -- I don't really take things too seriously.  Um, I'm Asian and, um -- and, um -- I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you heard Shaq[?] comments a couple of weeks ago or --
R:  No.
L:  -- a couple of months ago.  He was talking about Yao Ming, the China center, the [inaudible] guy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, he makes, um, some -- some ching chang chong chok[?], something like that -- that -- uh, to simulate, ah, Chinese pronunciation, um --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and a lot of people just got really angry, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's interesting 'cause I guess sort of I'm just a nice sort of [inaudible].  So, I thought one of those people that suffers from political [inaudible] so maybe I get too, um [LIPSMACK] -- too concerned for people.  You know, I guess that's interesting sort of -- ask almost -- the people like, you know, an Asian person if this is [inaudible] to 'em because it doesn't offend the people that [inaudible] making fun of then why should it offend everyone else, right?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's really a fine line.  It's really hard to determine, 'cause I mean what I find offensive, might not be offensive to you.
R:  Right.
L:  And what you find offensive, you know, might not be offensive to me. 
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'm -- I mean ... to -- I guess, you know some commercials for example they take it real conservative and just throw out some stupid humor.  Or some try to push the envelope and you know people get -- get offended.  Uh --
R:  Well, that's true, yeah.  Yeah, so it's almost like, you know, if it's -- if it's not smart, it's definitely offensive.  [LAUGH] So, it's sort of funny.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I don't know if we'll ever be able to find a -- a true definition of -- of where the line stands.
R:  Well, it's in -- it's sort of like, um, [LIPSMACK] you know the Supreme Court when it comes to obscenities, pornography obscenities, it's sort of a --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's sort of -- we don't know what it isn't yet, so it's sort of like --
L:  Right.  Right, I think, um, for, uh, pornography or obscenity though, even a little bit more clear cut than -- than offensive humor you know, because pornography you can see it.  It's black or white, pretty much.
R:  Right, right, right but, yeah, all I meant was -- yeah, you're right in terms of offensive humor, it's also -- well, I guess the other thing they talk about with pornography is the community standards.  So, it's sort of like --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- in this case it's sort each person's standards so, um, you know like Sein- -- I don't know if you watch Seinfeld and you know and there -- and George is going down the street in his little motorized wheel chair being chased --
L:  [MN]
L:  -- by other people in motorized wheelchairs so like --
L:  Yeah, I saw that.
R:  -- who, I think that's -- I mean, I think that's funny but maybe somebody who's sitting in a motorized wheelchair wouldn't.  But --
L:  That was -- that was hilarious.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  You know some people -- some people could find it offensive I suppose.
R:  Well, I find what's interesting is sort of like, you know about Shaq's comments [inaudible], there'll always be ... somebody that wants to say they're representing everyone.  They'll be the Asian American anti defamation league or something and that'll be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that'll be somebody who wants to get on their soapbox 'cause they want their fifteen minutes of attention to say how offensive he is and he should apologize and da, da.  You know, it's interesting that whatever group is being -- whether it's Polish or whatever it is, somebody is willing to sort of stand up and say hey, hey, you know, I speak on behalf of these people and you know you've real ... but oftentimes those kind of people are just in it ... glory, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- it's -- I mean, most times when -- when -- when I find some situations like that I just tell people, you know, just lighten up.  You know, I mean, some -- some things are just not worth getting offended by, you know.  It's -- life is too short to -- to really take everything so seriously.
R:  But then don't you think it's also -- when you're ... a group -- like, there's certain words that you could use that you wouldn't want to hear a white person use, like stuff -- like even in a -- like I think about, like, Richard Prior, you know, used the word, you know, nigger but that's a wo- you know, that -- and that was okay but I guess if a white person in a comedy [inaudible] used it -- 'cause I guess there's all that extra stuff that goes along with it if you're not part of the group then are you using it in a [inaudible].
L:  I mean, that's -- to me it's kind of hypocritical, you know.  I mean you know, Chinese -- I'm Chinese and, uh, I guess the term is chinkster or chink you know, and -- and I mean, if people use it, I don't really get that -- I don't really get offended.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- if people are going to tell me hey you can use it but you know people of the other race can't use it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then, I mean that -- that's just stupid.  You know if it's a derogatory term then it's a derogatory term; it's not funny, it's not funny.  You can't say, oh, if I say it's funny then if you say it, then it's not funny, you know?  I don't think -- that just makes everything even more blurry I guess.
R:  Right, right.  But I guess you know it's interesting 'cause, um, last night I was -- speaking of comedy drawing the line [LAUGH].  Last night I happened to go see Joan Rivers.
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and -- but it's am- in person, you know, it's amazing 'cause fir- she, just every other word is a cuss word.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which is so surprising and close to seventy and she's saying F-ing this and F-ing that and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but that -- a lot of ... um, but she talks about specific famous people whether it's Jackie Kennedy or [inaudible] Taylor or Chelsea Clinton, uh, so do you ... do you think that somebody who's in the public eye is kind of -- has to be more willing to be a target of that kind of humor or --
L:  I -- I think they're -- if you're in the public eye, I don't think there's any way you can get away with that.  You know, uh, if you're in the public eye people are interested and you will be the target.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I don't think there's any way of getting around it.
R:  Well, I guess what's interesting she did say that she left Chelsea Clinton alone when she was a kid.
L:  Right.
R:  But now that she's grown [LAUGH] bec- it's also because I guess somebody like Chelsea Clinton who ... do anything except be born to those people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not fair [NOISE] I always remember on Saturday Night Live when the Clintons and Gore's were nominated and they -- you know they -- they had these gorgeous girls playing the Gore girls and then they had -- I think they might have even had a guy play Chelsea, you know, and it was really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it was funny, but you did feel sorry for her because she's -- I thought here's this awkward teenage girl and yet it is funny, you know.  But it's  -- it's also because she hasn't put herself in the public eye and I remember at the time, like, Hilary Clinton had complained about it and then I think most people did back off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's, like, sort of, like, th- the Bush girls; I mean here, you know, again, like those you know -- so they have a drink or so they do ... only it's the -- they're on Letterman and Leno monologues and so I guess it's --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- when you're -- if you're -- if it's -- if it's by association I think that's probably when people would say and that's not really fair.  But I guess it's also like what you were just -- I mean it's -- but if it's -- I guess if it's -- it's funny, it's funny you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I just think people just take things a little bit too seriously.
R:  Yeah, especially when it's supposed to be comedy.  Now, what do you think about though when they do ... well, I guess it's what they -- they -- like a black comedy, like about death or ... like, is that -- is it different rules or is it just always still just -- oh if it makes you laugh, it makes you laugh, I mean --
L:  I mean, yeah, I watched let's say black comedy shows and if there was a white dude up there talking the same material --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think he would be stoned to death already.
R:  Sorry, when I said black comedy, I meant like, um, not about black people, I meant black comedy is an expression that means about, um ... just like you --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- you know when, like making, like death like did you see --
L:  Black humor?
R:  Black humor, yeah, black -- exactly.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like National Lampoon Vacation where [several inaudible words] and -- 'cause she dies in the back of the car but they keep driving so they just tie her to the top of the roof.
L:  Uh, I think black humor is, um ... even riskier as in, uh, a lot more people are gonna get offended.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I remember, um I went to see a play in a -- one of those small community, uh, kind of theatres 
R:  Uh-huh
L:  And, um, it was um --
