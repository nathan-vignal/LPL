L:  Hi, I'm Pam Gocher.
R:  Hi, m- ah, my name is Nedhu Bubcha[?].
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  I'm doing just great, so, what kind of business would you open?
R:  Mm, I would like to open a restaurant.
L:  Ah hah.
R:  And what about you?
L:  Well, I live down in, ah, Florida, and I have often thought about that it would be fun to open an ice skating rink.
R:  Oh, wow, that would be fun.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You like ice skating?
L:  Uh-huh.  I do.
R:  Good.
L:  But, um, it would take a lot of, um, you know, thinking about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- finding the co- ah, correct property and then setting it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was once trying to figure, if I won the lottery --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that I might have enough money to do it, but then who would I -- [LAUGH] who would I get to come down and teach at it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what kind of restaurant would you open?
R:  Ah, I would op- I would like to open a fa- fast food chain.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  [LAUGH] That's my dream.
L:  Do you have a -- one in particular that you like?
R:  Ah, yeah, ah, Indian cuisine.
L:  Oh, I love Indian food.
R:  You do.
L:  Yeah, I lived in India for a couple of years.
R:  Oh.  I'm from India.
L:  I thought you might be.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just from your name.
R:  Ah.
L:  Is there a fast food one already set up or would you have to set up the whole franchise?
R:  Ah, the one, actually, I have a restaurant in India.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  My fa- my father has one.
L:  What part of India?
R:  Delhi.
L:  Mhm.  I lived in Maharastra.
R:  Oh.
L:  When I was there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, north of Bombay.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we went up at one point to Delhi.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  And, um, I -- I enjoyed that city very much.
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.
L:  Yeah, yeah, going to the circus [SIGH] Piccadilly Circus.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, how long have you been here in the States?
R:  Ah, around three years.
L:  Three years?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ha- have you thought about bringing your dad over to help you set up a restaurant here?
R:  [LAUGH] Might be[?]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  Do you think he would want to come?
R:  Oh, maybe.  I'm not sure.
L:  At least for a visit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would be nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, let's see, if I were to start an ice skating rink, as I said, I would have to find a decent facility, now, I notice that up in Birmingham, Alabama, they -- they have what appears to be, ah, it's almost like a motel, except they've --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- torn the walls out and just made it into this huge area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, that could be done.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I would put it in Destin, Florida and then I would have to find people who would want to -- to ice skate.  I think there would be a lot of people in the summer for example, who would like to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it gets very hot down here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then there would probably be people in the winter who come down from the north --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and who enjoy their, um, who enjoy those kinds of sports but don't enjoy doing them out in the cold anymore.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, they could do that --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- down here. 
R:  People would like that.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not so sure that I would be the best -- the best manager, but I have a friend that I know that would be an excellent manager.
R:  Mhm.  You can hire that.
L:  Yeah, you can hire that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what kind of foods would you -- would you sell in your restaurant?
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Huh?
R:  Ah, I want to sell Indian spicy food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, ah --
L:  Biryani?
R:  -- lots of people -- yeah -- Biryani, like, lots of people like the spicy food of dhal[?] and, er, I like cooking so that would be a great [inaudible] for me
L: Mhm.
R:  But, ah, for that I need a lot of money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that's the main issue, I do not have that much money, so --
L:  D- um, how, let's see -- I love -- you w- so you would do mostly northern Indian foods?
R:  Yeah, northern Indian food. But I --
L:  Do you live in -- do you live in --
R:  North India.
L:  And do you live in -- I know Delhi's north India, do you live in the north at this point?
R:  Ah, no. 
L:  In the United --
R:  In California.
L:  You're in California.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  'Cause I also love good dhosas and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and southern Indian foods too.
R:  Ah huh, ah huh.  I think in California there are lots of Indian restaurants.
L:  Are there?
R:  Or chains[?] out there.  Yeah.  People, ah, people have a lot of choices too.
L: Mhm.
R:  So, that I want to start a business. [LAUGH]
L:  Well now, would you b- would your -- would your food be predominantly vegetarian?
R:  Ah, vegetarian or non vegetarian, both.
L:  Both.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well that's -- that would be a good -- good range.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well I- I think that would be very interesting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's -- since the closest that I can find Indian food is in -- in Atlanta, Georgia --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which means I have to drive five hours to get to it --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Actually, I think in Florida there are not much Indians.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's why, ah, in California there are lots of Indians.
L:  Well that makes a major difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when you have the population.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Not as much the population to support it, because you would expect to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to sell to other people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, people just -- when you've got a larger population people get used to thinking about the fact that --that -- that food of that ethnicity would be there.
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE] So, ah, how about your -- your business, like, hm, you want to start a medium business or large business?
L:  Well, of course, an ice rink would be ... [LAUGH] I don't know, I always thought it'd take a couple of -- cou- you know, I was thinking this morning, hm, I'm wondering if I could do this for two hundred and fifty thousand.  Somehow, I don't think so.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  I'm betting it's going to be closer to a million or more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and -- and then, th- you know, the question then becomes, what kind of income do you have to make off of it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  In order to make it a viable business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where you're not just pouring money into something that you love --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and not expecting a return.
R:  You don't -- you should have always thought of that[?]
L:  Yeah.  And I don't -- m- my -- the friend that I was talking about, who could manage it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- originally wanted to set up an ice rink in Newport News, Virginia --
R:  Oh.
L:  --and so, he's done a lot of research on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why I'd bring him down. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I have a feeling that we're beginning to talk in the seven figures. [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  So that -- that would be a much more heavy investment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than -- than I'm at this point --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- in my life, capable of doing, but -- but if I won the lottery ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It might be something that would be worthwhile considering.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  The other thing I've thought about doing, as a part time business, would be astrology charts.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I'm -- I could even do that as an internet business.
R:  Uh-huh.  Internet business?  Oh yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like astrology charts and all that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Astrology [inaudible] 
L:  So I could do charts on the internet.
R:  Yeah, that would be, um, nice idea.
L:  But, I don't -- it's sort of slow going at this point.
R:  Are you astrologer?
L:  I've done astrology charts.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  And, ah, I had my chart done in India --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they did with, ah, vedic astrology
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, it's always very interesting to see the -- the similarities and the differences.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- between the systems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- how --
R:  Are you going to start an internet business?
L:  Do I want --
R:  Do you have a faith[?] of astrology?
L:  Well, I -- I actually s- have a -- I've s- s- saved a DNS name, you know, you can get 'em for --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- thirty five dollars at a whack --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- called Astrology Charts about US.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's a matter of putting together a web page and getting it out there and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seeing if there would be any response.
