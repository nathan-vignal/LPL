R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is Kenneth.  I'm down in Georgia.
L:  Kenneth, you said?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  My name's Hannah.  I'm in Provo, Utah, right now.
R:  Provo, Utah, yeah, they want us to speak about comedy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, I don't have any, um, particular comedy favorites.  I watch a lot of the old, ah, comedy reruns, such as, ah, I Love Lucy, and things of this nature.  How about yourself?
L:  Um, yeah, I don't really watch much TV, particularly.  I like funny things, though. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, such as jokes and ...?
L:  Yeah, my dad used to tell a lot of jokes when I was little.  I liked that.
R:  Okay, yeah.  Um, I receive a good bit of jokes through the email from some, you know, some pen pals and things, forwarding joke type things, material.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But, other than that, um, I don't watch a- a lot of the, ah, new comedy sitcoms.  I like the older ones, I guess.  I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm still stuck back in the sixties, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess that kind of relates to -- what was our question?  It was, like, how do you draw the line?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Okay, well what do you think about that?
R:  Um, you mean, we're not trying to get on to that?  Um -- I don't know.  Ah -- draw the line, where?  I, um -- what do you think they would mean?
L:  I think, just like, because you know, how some jokes are offensive to some people but not to others and ...
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  You know, when does comedy stop being funny and start being offensive or hurtful?
R:  Well, I guess, um, I don't know.  I guess it would, ah, that would be, ah, um, pertaining to, ah, what sort of audience, you know, I mean, some people really like, um, adult type of comedy ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess they would go to the nightclubs that were pertaining to the adult situations, and if not, they, ah, well, you know, like with Bill Cosby, Kids Say the Darndest Things ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that, ah, I guess that's involving children, so they know, um, you know, I guess it's going to be rated G, because kids are involved.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, but as far as drawing the line, I, um, I guess that's left up to each individual.  I mean, ah, you know, you don't sit around and tell the dirty jokes around the kids.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah, I'd say that's the same thing, that it -- for me, like, I always try to monitor what kind of humor I'm using or what kind of humor I'm paying attention to based on who I'm with.  Because --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- some people -- I know some people who are really offended easily at types of humor that may not be offensive to other.
R:  Mhm.  Like some that can't take jokes, even the slightest joke.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I know some people that just don't really have senses of humor, so ...
R:  And sometimes it gets a little over their head, or something, and they take it the wrong way. [LAUGH] You know, the way it's not meant to be? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I do that all the time --
R:  But ah, there's a lot of those out there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, other than that, um, that's the only way I could answer the question.
L:  Yeah.  I think on television sometimes they cross the line too often.
R:  Well, yeah ...
L:  For me.
R:  Yeah, they do, um, although I don't have any kids at home, but I know watching some of the programs, you know, um, I think they can tend to cross the line, ah, somewhat.  Um, for, um, even when they say it's like, rated G, sometimes you find those little cliches in there that are -- you really don't think they should have been, you know, for a younger audience.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know if they really monitor them as well as they should or not, so.  Anyway ...
L:  Yeah.  I think that, [SIGH] I don't know, I mean, I think it's good that you kind of stick to the old TV because ...
R:  Right, well I guess that's --
L:  The old TV tends to do that a lot less.
R:  One reason I like it, which you know, I mean, I don't mind some of the newer comedians, but I just -- I guess I'm still, like I say, hung back in the sixties [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the older comedy sitcoms -- I don't listen to radio, well I listen to radio but I don't listen to comedy on the radio that much.  Here, I mean, down where we're at, you're probably in a larger city, you probably can, you know, have comedy on your radio.  But here, it's just strictly music and commercials.
L:  Mhm.  No.  I don't know, I don't listen to the radio much here because ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, I lived in Boston a few years ago and they had comedy on the radio there and I think they crossed the line way too often.
R:  Right.  Well you --
L:  So I don't listen to it, cause -- I'm not that easily offended, but they did it way too much.
R:  Right.  Some of the DJ's have their little corny cut through jokes, you know, that they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tell some what, but ...
L:  It was way too dirty for me.  I didn't --
R:  Yeah, and I think even, even here sometimes they could -- could keep some of to themselves.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  But um, other than that.  Um, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well it's a hard question, and ...
R:  But you know, it's kind of um, you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But um ...
L:  I guess it's supposed to be to warrant discussion.
R:  Right.  Um -- the -- they do tend to get carried away with it, at that um, especially with um, different ages even, ages, you know, the audience, so, um, I guess you just have to be careful and just hit the nuke button when you think it's coming on, but that's hard to do, you know, we can't very well do that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I have a lot of friends here that don't like to watch movies that are rated R.
R:  Right.
L:  And I grew up that I did watch movies that are rated R so, some, you know, some of my favorite movies are rated R, because there are some good ones --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, I've watched -- I've kind of watched some of them with some of my friends here and just promised that I'd edit ...
R:  Right.
L:  And it's interesting to see, because there's -- you know, there's stuff that I didn't edit ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I didn't find it offensive at all.
R:  Right.  And just watch their reactions?
L:  But then my friends are, like, "I can't believe you didn't edit that!" [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm growled at.
R:  It's like, wow, you're grown.  I mean, you just -- like you say, you know, it's some of the slightest things that we don't take a certain way, it offends other people and they just -- I think the biggest thing is they just, um, take it the wrong way, you know, they're maybe not meaning to, but they just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and some people aren't -- just aren't into, ah, things like that, so ...
L:  Yeah, definitely.  When I -- I remember back, in high school, I teased people a lot.  Just like, joking around with my friends and I'd kind of make fun of them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't mind if people made fun of me, you know ...?
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I expected them to reciprocate and I'd have friends -- you know, I had a few friends that didn't quite understand what I mean by it.
R:  Right.  Well, that's the way I was.  I mean, I liked to cut up back in my school days, you know, and trip people and what have you, even things, this and to make smart  -- really, not smart remarks -- not really cutting them down, as you say, but --
L:  Yeah, just --
R:  I enjoyed them getting back at me.  That's why I did it, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because I liked to doing it, but, but -- ah -- you have those that are ready to fight. [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Yeah.  Well look, I had some friends that, you know, if I teased them, they'd get back at me with, you know, for every witty remark I made directed at them, they'd make one back at me, so it was no problem.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  And then I had other friends that are like, "You're so mean.  Why are you always making fun of me?"
R:  Yeah, that's right.  Some people take it.  It's, "You're always putting me down", I'd say, "No, no, you can't take a joke".  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.  That's kind of a pity, because [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- kind of, among some people, I, you know ...? [LAUGH]
R:  Really not much to joke around here, well there is, there's a lot to joke around here in South Georgia with our slang, our lingo, I guess. You know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like what?
R:  The way we talk, I guess, with y'all -- with y'all and, um, you know.  A lot of, ah, people make fun of our language, I know, our little lingo.  But it's just part of being in the south, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I've never really been very far south, so -- I wouldn't know.
R:  I haven't been far north, except for um, Parley, central Illinois, I've never been up to Utah.  Hm.  I maybe need to go out to Utah, they probably have some good, um, places.
L:  It's pretty.
R:  But, um ...
L:  This is my first year living here, so, I'm not that ...
R:  Okay.  I've been hung here all my life, in this, um, sitcom here, as you could call it.
L:  Yeah.  No, I've -- I've moved around a lot, so I didn't ... [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] I used to live in Virginia, though, that's kind of where I grew up.
R:  In Virginia?
L:  Yeah.  In northern Virginia though, so it's still not very far south.
R:  Oh.  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  Okay, but I -- no -- I didn't know when I put in for this thing, I didn't know they'd call so soon.  They kind of caught me off guard in this way, called three times, I said, "Jesus", you know, it take this -- I mean, it happened this quick, you know [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I didn't know what to talk about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, I'm going to have to be alert, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  No -- I -- cause I just -- I just confirmed it like five minutes before the phone rang.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I expected it to be maybe next week, or something.
R:  Well, me too, I mean, I do surveys, on line surveys, you know?  That bit, and -- but -- I didn't know it would take place this ah, soon.
L:  They're quick about it, but that's ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe they're doing their study very efficiently.
R:  Mm.  Maybe there's some psychiatrist back monitoring me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When it tallies from the South, he watches too much comedy, too much I love Lucy in the past.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's about all I do is sit and watch, I mean, I really like those old ones though, you know, like Green Acres and things that don't come on any more, you know?  The old comedy sitcoms?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like on TV Land.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watch a good bit of TV Land, especially when my wife's asleep at night and I can't sleep.  I wat-
