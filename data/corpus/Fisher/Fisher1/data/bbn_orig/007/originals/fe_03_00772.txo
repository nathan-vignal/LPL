R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, hello.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how about yourself?
L:  Real fine, thank you.
R:  Good.  Um, my name is Carla.
L:  Well, my name is Dale Christiansen.
R:  Dale Christiansen.
L:  Yeah, can we say where we're from and stuff?
R:  I think so.
L:  I thi- well, I'm from North Dakota.
R:  Oh really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm from Kansas.
L:  Wow, we're in the mid west.
R:  Well, yeah, we're not too far apart, there, are we?
L:  Yeah.  Now, ah, ah, the topic of the day, supposedly -- I'm sitting here baby sitting the grand daughter.
R:  Oh.
L:  She just came by, so I didn't know whether to take the call or not, but she's fine.
R:  Right.  Good.
L:  She's running around, she's pulling out her, ah, potty chair here for ah -- she got a, oh, what's the name of that character, that red faced guy?  Elmo!
R:  Oh yes, Elmo.
L:  She's got an Elmo potty chair. [LAUGH]
R:  Good for her.  Good for her.
L:  So ...
R:  But no, the topic of the day, I, um, I know I would not take a million dollars.
L:  You would not take a million dollars to leave the United States, huh?
R:  And never come back.  No.
L:  Oh, it means never come back, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Would you?
L:  Well, I- I think the stipulation on never coming back is the part that's kind of bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would go to Australia, I'd visit there.  I have relatives there.
R:  Oh, well see, I don't have any family outside the United States, so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would have nowhere to go.
L:  Well, I would go to Australia, especially to Queensland, as they call it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because, um, years ago, when I was a young man, my great aunt even told me, at the time, she said, "How about coming over here and going to the university here in Brisbane?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I always used to say, "Brisbane" -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Jane, get off that phone! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Young lady.  Her name's Jane Elaine.
R:  Oh, that's pretty.
L:  Yeah.  She's -- yeah, she's a handful.  Do you have children, ma'am?
R:  I have one, and he's eighteen, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so, that's a lot of fun.
L:  Well, this is the youngest son and he married, and this is his daughter, and -- oh, she's a handful.  They -- they went out, you know, they ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well I like it.  I enjoy her -- her coming over because then we get to spend time, you know, together ...
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Which is -- there's a kind of bond between grandchildren and their, you know ...?
R:  Oh sure.  Yeah.
L:  Well, how long have you lived in Kansas?
R:  Oh, all my life.
L:  All your life?
R:  Yeah, all my life.
L:  Were you raised on a farm?
R:  Yes I was.
L:  So was I.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yes, I actually was raised with eight children on a farm.
R:  Well, there were six of us, so ...
L:  Yeah, so you understand ...
R:  Yeah, my husband had nine.  There were nine in his family, nine kids.
L:  Okay, then you understand that we also had cows and we had pigs, you know, and we had the hogs --
R:  Yeah, we had --
L:  -- we had sheep.
R:  We had chickens.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We didn't -- we didn't have sheep, but we did have horses.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  We had -- we had pigs, cows and chickens.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And a bunch of dogs and a bunch of cats and ...
L:  Yes, was it difficult for your, ah, parents, then to survive on a smaller ...?
R:  Oh yeah, they didn't do very well, I mean, they both worked outside the, you know, in town, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah kinda, tried to --
L:  That's what has happened here, unless you went real, real big, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, the one thing that I say that we miss in this country, though, is we have to get, our -- our insurance.
R:  Yes.
L:  That is one of the reasons I would leave the country when I'm older.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I see --
L:  Because --
R:  And I haven't -- I haven't thought about that.
L:  And because of health insurances and taking care of -- the reason I say that, is I had an uncle who came down with that Alzheimer ...
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And he went through every cent he had, and he had a lot of money.
R:  Sure.
L:  He was a single fellow, he had a farm land and so on sorth[?] -- so forth, but a few years ago there was no, ah, homes that would take him, or anything --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- any place to care for him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the cost was about three hundred and eighty three dollars a day.
R:  Oh, my.  Wow.
L:  And when he got through, um, most of his estate was gone, and so on and so forth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, so that is a concern for myself.
R:  Well, and -- and as far as, you know, I know there is a big, ah, oh, you know, talking about how much prescription drugs cost ...
L:  Well, see here, we're always going across the border for the -- the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the dentals, to be quite frankly, we go across to have our dental work, and we also go over for the prescriptions.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And --
L:  Because they're so much cheaper.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think you could do it if you were to go on line.  You can find Canadian companies, but I don't know exactly how it works.
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  But here, we were sneaking it across, is what's really going on.  It's ah ...
R:  Yeah.  An- and it's too bad that you have to do that.  You know, that it's so high in -- high here that you have to do that and --
L:  This young lady, here, she's looking up at Grandpa talking on the phone to a lady.
R:  [LAUGH] But yeah, I don't know, I --
L:  She's a member of Big Big Forms[?] -- or, what is the name of the site?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Oh.
R:  I can't remember. [LAUGH]
L:  Big Big Savings, is that where you signed up, on that website?
R:  I see, on some website.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, I can't remember --
L:  With the blue background.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and I can't remember what it's called.  That might be the one.
L:  Yeah, I know that --
R:  And that there, for a while, they'd call and I forgot my pin number.  I had it written down by the computer but ...
L:  [LAUGH] You -- you sound like me --
R:  I'd forgotten it, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Same here [LAUGH]
R:  I finally found it, so I could participate and --
L:  [LAUGH] With my memory, I couldn't find the f- pin and I'd race around the house here and look for it and finally I'd get it and put it in.
R:  Yeah.  And I did one yesterday on "Would you perjure yourself for -- on a -- for a relative or close friend?  That was a hypothetical question that I did yesterday, so, you know, that was ah, interesting, and I -- I didn't realize, I guess, that it was going to be, like, almost a daily thing that they ...
L:  Yeah, well, some, I guess, can get up to twenty if they're, you know ...?
R:  Gosh.  Yeah.
L:  But you have to have five different phones in the home.
R:  Oh, I see, yeah, I don't think I do.
L:  I don't know what that has to do with anything.
R:  I don't know either.  I don't have --
L:  I think what the study is, I think, from what I understand, I think they're trying to hear the linguistics of how we talk, in communicating.
R:  Oh that, that may be true.
L:  And you and I both have that flat, mid Western, so there isn't any problem, you know.
R:  Yeah, and the lady I spoke to yesterday sounded just like me.  I didn't ask her where she was from.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you just, you know, she just got on there answered the question and hung up, and --
L:  Well, see --
R:  I didn't ask her where she was from.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we we- I was born here in North Dakota.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, over the years we would rather -- we lived in Florida for a while, now --
R:  Oh really.
L:  That is really something else again.  It's a totally, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Totally different culture, totally, environment and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Way of life and mentality and thinking and attitude, and --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  And I felt right then, I'll tell you this, ah, what's your first name, again, ma'am?
R:  Carla.
L:  Carla?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Carla, I felt that when I lived in Florida, I was living in a foreign country.
R:  Well, yeah.  I -- you know, I've -- I've not ever been there but I've heard -- you know, seen it on the news, and movies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and heard a lot about it and know, people who, you know, go there for, you know, part of the year and what not and -- and from what I hear, it is really different there, than it is here.  A lot different.
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  There's a lot of poverty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a lot of, um, -- there is a lot of wealth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Extreme wealth, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, at one time, Florida's number one crop were oranges, you know, that's what was the thing that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- their number one crop today is, ah, cocaine.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I don't doubt that.
L:  And that makes a real difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everything, it makes a difference in the crime rate and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  And I know here, um, there's a lot of, um, Mexicans coming over the border --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they're just inundating us here.  I mean, we're -- there's just a lot of them, and um, around here there's a lot of those meat packing plants, you know, like IBM and -- and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they all work there, you know, [LAUGH] and it's just -- there's just a lot of them and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- th- there's quite the language barrier, you know, and ah, that kinda causes some problems, you know, for --
L:  Do they, ah -- excuse me for interrupting.  Do they teach it though, in the schools there?
R:  Well, i- it's not a requirement.
L:  Spanish?
R:  It's not a requirement
L:  Oh.
R:  But you can take it, in, um, I know in the schools, you know, it cause-, when, ah, Ove[?], our son, was in school, it -- you know, he'd come home and say, "Gosh, we've got a whole bunch of new ones in today, and --"
L:  Yeah.  I understand.
R:  "-- they don't speak English", and it would kind of disrupt the class, and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was kind of, you know, a pain in the neck there, but you know, he's out now, so I guess that's not, you know, it doesn't bother him anymore.
L:  Are you in a big city right now?
R:  No.  We're um, we're in a small town, about six thousand people.
L: Oh, okay.
R:  And, ah, so, yeah, we don't live in a big --
L:  Well, I've got that kind[?] of mentality too.  Six thousand, that's a pretty good size town. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, I guess it is.  It is, you know, really it is.  It's a lot -- a lot bigger than, ah, where I came from, it was about six hundred people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Here in Kansas.
L:  This town, the town that I'm in, is about say, forty five thousand.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And it's located in the Serse[?] River Valley, so we have north hills and south hills.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And we're located in the valley, no, it's -- it's a very pretty city.  It really is.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  But ah, we have a lot of -- in the autumn, you know, there's a lot of trees and hills and we have deer that run through here, and --
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah --
L:  North Dakota is, is, um --
R:  -- that would be, that would be nice.  That would be nice.
L:  I think there in Kansas, you're pretty flat everywhere, aren't you?
R:  Yes, we are.  Yes we are and th- there's a lot of wind, and -- and --
L:  Yeah, we have the wind here.  We have that.
R:  Oh, and it's so dry here right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ah, like today here, it's seventy one degrees.
L:  Mm.
R:  Today.
L:  That's warm.
