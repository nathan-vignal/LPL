R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Right, I'm Paula.
L:  I'm Jane.
R:  Ah, I guess we're supposed to talk about bad comedy.
L:  Yeah, and all that does is got too much sex in them.
R:  No, I think that's going a little too far too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think the worst thing about comedy these days is bad language that they use.
L:  Yeah, there's too much of the F word in it.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's not --
L:  It seems like they can't even make a -- a --a TV show any more without that word.
R:  I -- I know, I don't see what's so funny about it.  The -- um, I -- I think that's probably the worst thing there is about comedy today.
L:  And I've got teenagers now, and they can't see any thing wrong with it.
R:  That's the problem with teenagers these days.
L:  I also teach in the church so I really have a -- a -- um, hard time trying to tell them that some of these shows that they watch that they think are so good, are not.
R:  Yeah.  I th- think th- they grow up with a different standard, ah, of what's acceptable and not, from music, the -- the TV, the movies.
L:  Yeah, I've got a -- I've got a twenty two year old now and when she was a teenager she thought Friends was the greatest, and there is a lot of comedy in it, but I never realized how much drinking was in it.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and sex, as though it's all kids do.
L:  That's all they do in that show there.
R:  An- and they don't work.  I don't see how --
L:  And nope, all they do is just wander around.
R:  I don't see how they live in those wonderful apartments. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause they don- they don't work.
L:  No, cause kids today can't do that.
R:  No.
L:  As my -- as my oldest is finding out first hand, now that's she's married.
R:  Ah yeah, that kinda takes a toll on it.
L:  Yeah, after [inaudible] insisting it was not reality, she tell -- tells me now that she was stupid.
R:  Oh, yeah, that can, kind of, happen. [LAUGH]
L:  But there are some good comedy out there.  I like some of the stuff that thirty one here in this area now's got on, where they can watch Seven Seven and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And Gilmour Girls an- --
R:  I've never seen Gilmour Girls.
L:  You don't get Gilmour Girls?
R:  I've never watched it.
L:  Oh, it's excellent.
R:  I like um --
L:  It is excellent.  I mean the woman had a baby out of wedlock, but it's excellent how she carries on and -- and how the teenager survives, now, and of course she takes care of everyone.  She's got a job and how she succeeds, but it's got a good moral thing underneath it.  There's no cussing.
R:  Yeah.  I like Who's Line is it Anyway?  With Drew Carey.
L:  No, I don't think I've seen that one.
R:  Oh.  I love that.
L:  So, wh- we must be in totally different areas.
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Yeah, and I'm in Missouri.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, Who's Line is it Anyway? is completely improvisation.  It's um, they don't do any preparation, there's no script.  They come up with it off the top of their heads.  Um, and Drew Carey hosts it.  It -- it's hilarious.
L:  Oh, Drew Carey has gotta be --
R:  He -- it is th- he an- um the -- the tall skinny guy from the Drew Carey Show, Ryan Falls --
L:  Ah huh.
R:  -- he's on there, and Wayne Brady, and there's just -- they do everything, right off the top of their heads.  They si- make up songs, act out things.  It's one of the funniest things on TV.
L:  Oh.  Well, one thing I like about Seven Seven now, they've got that one in this area which I was so glad to see, cause I didn't know what it was till my daughter was telling me about it. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I finally sat down and was looking at it with her and it's about a minister and his wife and their family, but he doesn't --
R:  Yeah, I've watched since it started.
L:  Yeah, but it doesn't make it like, they don't have any problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what I like about it.  They find out that the world does have problems no matter what.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they learn how to deal with them.  So ...
R:  Th- they've dealt with some pretty rough stuff on that show.
L:  Yeah, they don't have those good old comedies on.  I don't know how old you are, but I know I like the -- the used to like the Cosby's an- ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And those shows and I wish they had some of those shows back on.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they used, I don't know, sh- I'm only twenty five.
L:  Yep.  You're about half my age.
R:  But, yeah, I -- I've watched comedy when I was growing up, you know, like, I Dream of Jeanie and Bewitched.  I love -- and I Love Lucy is one of my favorite shows.
L:  Oh yeah.  I love Lucy is still one of my sixteen year old's favorite shows whenever she sees it on.
R:  That is -- that is classic comedy.
L:  I don't think that show loses its value.
R:  No, and it -- it they never re- at the time, they were doing with things that were, you know, borderline bad taste, but today, it's just funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's so --it's comical to -- to watch it, plus you can -- my mother in law and I, she don't watch much TV, but she and I can sit down together and watch that show.  Because we both love it.  And it just never, ever gets old.
L:  Yeah.  It don't get old, because I mean, ev- my daughter'll stay up late, I don't know which night it's on, Saturday or Sunday, I think it's Sunday night after church.  And she won't go to bed early cause she'll want to see those old -- old I Love Lucy shows.  And she says if you don't have good laugh in today's world it's not even worth living.
R:  Yeah.  Um, have you ev- ah -- ah -- what's her name?  Chandra Pierce?  She's a Christian comedienne?
L:  No, I've probably not seen her.
R:  Oh, she's funny.  She --
L:  Is she on cable and stuff?  I can't get cable where I'm at.
R:  Well, ah, she's written a lot of books.  She does -- she does shows, ah -- ah -- um -- at -- at bigger churches and at religious functions.
L:  I was going to say, well, see I'm at a rural church now.  I've been in the rural church for the last eleven years --
R:  Ah, so, m- --
L:  And so I miss a lot of that big church stuff.
R:  My -- my church is about thirty members and that's about as far as we get.
L:  Yeah.  That's about -- well I don't know, we've got about a hundred and fifty now.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, we've been growing, now it wasn't that big when we first moved here.
R:  Um, there's a -- there's a couple of hard types that I like a library.  Her comedy video.
L:  Hm.  Well, currently I haven't seen her.
R:  She's funny.  And she's -- I mean, she -- she's -- real bizarre in her religion and so she brings that into her comedy show, and there's a guy who travels with the Gaythers who does ah --
L:  Now, I love the Gaythers.  So, you're getting at my age.  I l- I've got a whole bunch of their tapes.
R:  I have -- I only have a couple.
L:  I can't afford 'em, but one year I won eight of them at a bible book store.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So I sent my mother one and a couple to a couple of friends and I kept the rest of them, cause I couldn't part with them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's -- there's a guy that travels with them who, he -- he travels with a box of props and he makes -- he makes fun of the Gaythers and the people that travel with them --
L:  Ah.
R:  But it's -- it's -- it's good fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and he -- he's pretty funny.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think if more people could clean up their act they'd be a lot funnier.
L:  Well, that's just like, okay, America's Funniest Videos.  That's one of my sixteen year old's favorite shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she likes to see all -- especially of course, her part's the animals.  She likes animals.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if they've got animals in it that's what she likes.  But she'll just sit by the hours and watch it.
R:  I used to watch it but it's gotten to where they show a lot of, you know, people getting -- men getting hit in the groin, and that's just not funny to me.
L:  They need to back away from that now.
R:  I like --
L:  It seemed like there for a while they went into a lot of that and I didn't find it that funny either, so I said something to her and then she had it on here day before yesterday, I think it was,
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was basically all good clean stuff, there wasn't anything on it, it was all animals and kids and -- so it was more back where -- where I didn't mind her watching it.
R:  Yeah.  But ah -- my husband and I first got married, he watched the, um, South Park ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he got me in to watching it and it -- it's just [SIGH] my --
L:  It's different.
R:  It -- it's nasty.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean they --
L:  I've only seen it a couple of times, cause we can't get it here.
R:  Oh, my good- they have a -- a towel on the show that smokes pot and gets high.  And tries to get kids to do it with him.  And that's just not funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's wrong.  And they -- I mean, they- there's some really unfunny stuff on that show but people keep watching it.
L:  Well, that's kind of like Will and Grace, it -- it's a comedy, but I kept telling my daughter, she couldn't watch it cause it had a gay on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you watch it, it is funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now, she was sitting here yesterday and had it on, and I said, "No, that one you got to turn off".  Because they were, like, they were promoting everything about the gays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he's teaching this guy how to be gay, and I said, "That's it.  I draw the line".
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I mean, the show itself can be funny with him living with a girl but, a- a- and the comedy things, but -- it -- an of course one girl pretending, but then when they got into everything was about teaching this guy how to be gay who didn't even want to be gay.
R:  And that's just wrong.
L:  I said, "Now I draw the line there.  That show has had it.  You can't watch it no more".  Because I knew exactly what it would get to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yet that guy that told it ain't even gay.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  'Cause he's married and got kids.
R:  I don't see why he would want to act like he is.
L:  No, personally I could not -- I could not do anything that portrayed something I don't believe in.
R:  Yeah.  Um, my five year old is addicted to The Simpsons.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Now, I used to not like that show when it first came on because it showed him nude one day standing in line in an unemployment office ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But of course he's not a real person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But since then, I've been watching it with my daughter and it -- it's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  An- and it's been pretty clean and I don't see anything wrong with it.
R:  Well -- th- they have the occasional bad word, but you know, I've taught my son not to say those words.  He knows --
L:  They're not as bad as other words on other shows.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He watches, um, King of the Hill comes on right after Simpsons --
L:  Yeah.  That one comes on here too.
R:  -- he -- they'll sit and watch that while they eat supper and -- I mean, they just giggle and laugh.
L:  How old is your son?
R:  Five and two.
L:  Five and two.  Boy, you've still got a long way to go.
R:  Oh, I know it.  I mean -- my guys are actually, um, I watch a lot of their kids' shows with them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which normally aren't funny.  To them they're not funny.  But to me they're hilarious.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's a -- this one --
