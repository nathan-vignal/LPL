R:  Hi.
L:  My Name is Latrine[?].
R:  My name is Beth.
L:  Hi --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- that's a really rude topic that they gave us.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I thought it would be --
L:  -- would you ever --
R:  I thought it would be about, you know, friends, s- some kind of social topic, and we're talking about perjury.
L:  Perjury.
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess it's just -- they want to understand how people converse to some end.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Okay, so, would you commit perjury for a friend or family member?
L:  Would you ever commit perjury?  Automatically?  I say no.
R:  Right.
L:  But I understand it would be different in the situation, you know what I mean?
R:  I agree.
L:  Is that what you think too?
R:  It's definitely what I think.  You know, if -- if something happened, or your child or your husband or someone did something ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  It wouldn't be a very good situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  I don't know.  I guess it comes down to, it's illegal, kind of, but it comes down to, I guess, what you would feel right doing morally.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know, [LAUGH] it's really tough.  I'm sure you've been in a situation before where, it's not -- it wasn't in a court of law or anything, but it was, like, a situation where, say you're in school, or in -- you know -- you know, somebody cheated and -- you know, -- you're a -- you're the witness but they're your friend, or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  That would be difficult.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  If it came down to a court of law, I'm not sure that I would be able -- I probably wouldn't do perjury, but other situations, I mean, what are they going to do you?  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  Hm.  Okay [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, [COUGH] tell me --
R:  How long do we keep this conversation going on perjury? [LAUGH]
L:  Ten minutes, I'm sure they tell us when ten minutes is up.
R:  Okay.  Perjury.  Um, well ...
L:  I don't know, I guess what it comes down to, is you have to do what you think is right.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  If you're doing it to help somebody else out, in the end you're still going to have to live with yourself, and that might be selfish, like, you -- that might be the line between you sending someone you love to jail, or not, but in the end, they did something wrong and it's not up to you to -- to keep them from that, I guess.  So, I would probably just tell the truth, like, I wouldn't go out of my way to, you know, say a whole lot of things that I wasn't asked directly, maybe, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'd just answer honestly.
R:  Um, the only thing is, when it comes down to a friend or family member and you know the person personally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do you -- and let's say it was one incident that they, you know, could re- go to jail for a very long time for, but you know that the person -- you know -- it was one incident.  Um 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know that I could actually send the person to jail.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I feel, like, it's a different situation whether it's a minor offence, or, say, a murder or homicide --
R:  Right.  A murder or homicide, okay, th- those could injure other people.
L:  You'd be sending them to jail for a longer time, but at the same time they must have done something much more wrong to have deserved, you know. [COUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I just looked up perjury on the internet.
L:  [LAUGH] Did you?
R:  And, ah, we could talk about, let's see, Monica Lewinsky ...
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH] We could talk about Clinton. [LAUGH]
R:  Or Clinton, or -- there are all kinds of books, wow!
L:  Well, Clinton basically just made up his own definition of sex to answer the questions with, like, "I didn't lie". [LAUGH]
R:  That was him just saying ....
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  I've never seen anyone who could, just, stretch the truth so much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, here's the legal definition of perjury.
L:  What is it?
R:  Um -- okay:  "When a person, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal officer or person, in any case in which a law of the US authorizes an oath to be administered that he will testify, declare, depose or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition or certificate by him subscribed as true, willfully and contrary to such oath, states or subscribes in a material matter, which he does not believe to be true or any [LAUGH] declaration, certificate, verification or -- or statement under penalty of perjury willfully subscribes as true, any material matter which he does not believe to be true, which he believes are part of the US code".  That sounds like it.
L:  Uh.  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I think the problem is when you get up in front of [LAUGH] a court room ...
R:  Right.
L:  It's still -- that's legally right, or maybe in the case of marriage, you know, there's even an exemption, you shouldn't have to testify against your spouse, I believe, so it actually comes down to which side's more sacred to you, your marriage vows [LAUGH] or -- or the laws of the US.  It's actually funny which comes first. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, actually in some cases you don't get spousal immunity.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, that -- that could be really hard.  I don't know what those cases are thought.  Um, hm.  Wow.  [MN]
L:  Such a strange question.
R:  It is really strange.  Not at all what I expected.
L:  I know, and it's only been four minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you serious? [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.
R:  We have, what, two more of these that we could possibly get?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Hopefully it would, um, spin a little more conversation.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, each call -- I'm trying to see what the rules are.
L:  You're just supposed to talk on the topic as long as you can, for ten minutes. 
R:  Okay.  Perjury.  You know what I feel like?  I feel like I'm in, ah, back in school, where you had to speak in speech class.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On some topic that was drawn out of a hat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh well.
L:  You're supposed to speak for four minutes, which, when you're giving a speech, seems like forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Mm.
R:  Okay.  So, perjury. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- I think we've covered it.
L:  Perjury. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I don't -- I don't know much -- I don't know too many legal terms.  I [LAUGH] don't know very much about the law, it's hard to say more than that. [PAUSE] I wonder if they mean in a legal sense[?]?  You know?
R:  Right.  Um, [PAUSE] Oh, this is interesting.
L:  What?
R:  I guess Clinton had read this one.  Um, hm, so, "Perjury is a felony punishable with incarceration in prison", okay, we knew that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, "The US Supreme court strongly uphold the principle that if a witness tells the truth and no crime of perjury has been committed.  In Juan[?] Still[?] versus the United States, they ruled that -- the US Supreme Court ruled that even if a witness answers a question in a misleading way, as long as the answer is literally true, perjury has not been committed".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what happened, was, the guy, um, the witness, was asked if he had ever had bank accounts in Switzerland and he said his company did.  Because his answer concealed the fact that he had had bank accounts in Switzerland, the prosecutor prosecuted him for perjury.
L:  Huh.
R:  And the Supreme Court said that since he had not actually lied, he had not committed perjury.
L:  Right. [SIGH] That seems wrong, though, because wh- socially, if you were withholding the truth or misleading someone about the truth, it's the same thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  I don't understand why his at- why the attorney he was questioning didn't follow up with, well, did you yourself ...?
L:  Right.  Did you personally outside of your business, right ...?
R:  'Course, I'm sure they had +reasons for their prosecution that we, of course, wouldn't understand.
L:  Right.  Like, instead of getting an actual answer, he would rather discredit the witness later, maybe the witness was hurting them too much.  Something like that.
R:  Definitely.
L:  I don't know.
R:  All right.  I no longer work at law firms, so I thought I didn't have to deal with this stuff any more.
L:  [LAUGH] Did you used to?
R:  Yeah.  But I worked in, like, health care, which is about as far away from a court as you can get.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, okay.  How long has it been?
L:  Um, I think it's been about eight now.
R:  Yay!
L:  But I'm not sure.  Um, I wonder if they'll cut us off?  I haven't done this one before, so ...
R:  I haven't either.  Um ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Let's see, what else?
L:  Perjury.
R:  [PAUSE] I am flipping through the internet so we can talk about perjury.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Um. [NOISE]
L: It's so hard.  It would be almost impossible to answer unless you were in the situation, I think.
R:  Right.
L:  And of course you'd want to think that you were honest, but you'd also want to think that you well, you know, the sort of person --
