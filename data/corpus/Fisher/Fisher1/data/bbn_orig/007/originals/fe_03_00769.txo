L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Katarina.
R:  Katarina?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi, this is Dustin.
L:  Who?  Dustin?
R:  Dustin, yeah.
L:  Dustin.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey. [LAUGH] is this --
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing all right.
L:  Good.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  No, this is my first phone call that actually got through.  I've been --
R:  Me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, I think this is the first one I've gotten, so ...
L:  This is what?
R:  This is the first call I've gotten.
L:  Really?
R:  For the thing, yeah.
L:  Oh well, you're lucky then.  I've got a few and it just never got through, so ...
R:  Oh, it just rings?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, anyway, so what do you think about the topic?
R:  Um, I think it's just, kind of funny, to just -- to get, like, people to talk.
L:  I think so.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know, kind of weird, how they have, ah, the recording and everything.
L:  Yeah.  I wonder how they -- how they did it all, but -- but -- but I don't mind.  I don't mind talking, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Where -- where -- you -- where are you from?
L:  Czech Republic. [LAUGH]
R:  No way!
L:  Yes, way.  Why?  Why does it surprise you?
R:  I'm in, ah, Los Angeles.
L:  You're from Los Angeles?
R:  Yeah, that's where I am.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You're not lying to me, are you?
L:  I am not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wait, so -- so -- do we have to pay long distance, or something?  Is that the deal?
L:  [LAUGH] No, wh- see, I am from the Czech Republic, but I'm not in the Czech Republic, right now.
R:  Oh, where are you?
L:  I'm in Utah.
R:  Oh, you're in Utah.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  But you -- you were born there?
L:  No, no, I just go to school here.
R:  No, you were born in the Czech?
L:  Oh yes, uh-huh.
R:  Republic.
L:  Yep, that is correct.
R:  Wow, where do you go to school?
L:  I go to BYU -- do you know --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Do you know BYU?
R:  Yeah, are you a Mormon?
L:  I am.
R:  Wow.
L:  Well, I guess you know something. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah, I used to, ah, love, like, the forty niner's and, like, Steve Young.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, like -- like that his great, great grandfather's -- he was Brigham Young, or something?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Wow, you know more than I.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you follow your religion very closely?
L:  I -- I try.  Definitely, yeah, and actually, I guess we should really talk about the topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And I'd like to. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Because, like, see, at first I didn't even know what perjury is and then my friend explained to me that it's, like, kind of, lying, right?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's lying in, like, court, like, under oath, supposedly.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Like, ah, I think you put your hand on the bible, actually.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're supposed to, like, swear under God and ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And all that, and ah ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow, so would you ever do that?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I've never really thought about it.  It -- it -- it'd all depend on, like, consequences and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, all the circumstances as far as ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Depending on, you know ...
L:  Hm.
R:  I -- I --you know, I -- I -- I wouldn't want to say no, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, like, I -- I would never know if I was in that situation, and if I would, you know, change my mind.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  So -- so if you -- if you -- if you, like, went to court an- and ah, it was your friend or somebody an- and you knew that they did something bad, and you were there to tell the truth, what you knew, and you knew that he did it.  Would you -- would you st- would you not say he did it, just because it's your friend, or would you tell the truth?
R:  Ah, well, it -- it all depends, you know ...
L:  If you swore on the bible?
R:  It all depends, on, as far as I c- if I felt, you know, he deserved -- see -- then it kind of -- it kind of goes, like, as far as where I have control and like, if I would want to ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, if I'd want him to get punished for this, or if I, you know, if I want to do all I can in my power to help that person.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  So, if -- if somebody in your life that you would want to -- want this to happen -- like to -- to punish him?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Would you punish anybody?
R:  You know it, I -- I -- now that you said that, a person actually came to my mind.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R: Really, yeah, but I --
L: I'm sorry.
R:  -- haven't really -- I haven't really thought about that though.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess I wouldn't, but it's kind of funny that you said that because this person kind of popped up into my head --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I haven't thought about this person in a long time.
L:  Wow, hm.
R:  Wow, that's interesting.
L:  It is.  I'm -- I'm surprised actually, because --
R:  You wouldn't?
L:  -- you know, now that I'm thinking about it too, you know, after you explained to me what exactly it means, you know, I don't think I would -- I would, um, I don't think I would lie.  Just because, I mean, come on, I believe in God and so I would not lie to him and if I swear to God that I wouldn't lie, why would I lie?
R:  How old are you?
L:  You know, that just doesn't make sense to me.  And, like, I w- I would hate myself for the rest of my life.  I would be like Judah, you know, I would have to just kill myself if I lied.  If I did something against God, and so --
R:  Yo- you -- you've never lied in your life?
L:  W- of course I have.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it was -- it was just because I was stupid and because I make mistakes just like everybody else, you know, but I'm trying to not lie, really, and also not judge other people, because that's just not my place.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  I knew that.
L:  You know, to judge others because I don't want to be judged by others either, so why would I judge them?  So, you know, but --
R:  I think it's very natural, though.  You know, judge --
L:  To judge?
R:  -- judgment is -- it naturally occurs and it's just constant, no matter what, it's being human.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure, yes -- I -- I'm sure you- you're right, but I think that even though it's natural, like, we can't help it ...
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH]
L:  We can still -- we -- we can just keep it in ourselves.  We don't have to carry it out, you know, we don't have to, like, um --
R:  Verbalize it or ...?
L:  Yes, or, like -- like, punish the people, you know, say, "You are the worst person in the world".  You know, I don't think it's our right to do that.  Just because, I mean, I don't know, it just doesn't -- it's not -- it's not right.  You know, like, I can't tell you, even though I don't know you, I can't tell you, "I don't really like your voice, like, your voice is weird".  It's not true, but, I mean, I like your voice, but, you know, I can't say that because you don't deserve that, nobody deserves that.
R:  Thank you.  I like your voice too.
R:  You know. [LAUGH] Thanks. [LAUGH]
R:  Can I ask you how old you are?
L:  How old?  Twenty five.
R:  Twenty five.
L:  Yeah.  How about you?
R:  Guess.
L:  Oh no, I don't like guessing.
R:  What would you say?
L:  Well, you sound like y- you might be about my age, maybe.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm nineteen.
L:  You're what?
R:  Nineteen.
L:  Nineteen! [LAUGH] Well, see all the people sound --sound younger to me.
R:  [LAUGH] You sound younger than twenty five, actually, I don't know, it could go either way.
L:  Yeah, yeah, see it's very -- it's deceiving, voice is deceiving, so, you can't tell --
R:  Does, like, the time click off or something?
L:  What?
R:  Does the time click off when we -- when we stop talking?
L:  I have no idea. [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, this is the first time, so I don't know what's going to happen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I suppose they're just going to cut us off.
R:  Oh really [LAUGH] do you keep talking, or something?
L:  Yeah.  But -- but let's talk more about this -- this perjury thing.  Because, it's really interesting to me.  So, do you believe in God?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, that's a -- that's -- I believe in a higher power, like, I guess you could -- you know, sum it down to that, you know.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  God.  But, I don't know, sometimes I find myself losing that belief.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, where I just feel as though there isn't --
L:  What situation?
R:  -- a higher being, and it's, like, just me, it is just, like, my control as far as --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my whole existence.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Wow.
R:  But -- yeah, but those -- those times don't come too often though. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  So, do you feel like, um, like, like, when you -- when you do something good, and when something good happens, do you, like, give credit to yourself because you did it?
R:  [LAUGH] You know, mos- most of the time I give it to -- thanks to the God in the higher power.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Usually there -- like -- like, especially now, just how I'm living and just, like, earlier I wasn't feeling too good, but now it's kind of a lot better. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, what I fi- you know what I find kind of bad is, ah, when I'm feeling bad I kind of blame my God too.
R:  Oh yeah, that's typical.  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately though, people usually think of God when something bad happens and they curse him and they don't like him, they hate him, and they think it's his fault.  But when something good happens, you know, it's, usually, God is not undermined very often which is sad, and that's the way it is in my country and I know it's -- it's in minds of a lot of people, you know, because they don't know God, and that's the problem.  I was the same way.  I -- I haven't been a member of the church my whole life and so I -- I, you know, I had those feelings too, so now, I -- I can see both sides, you know, and I can tell you, it's so much better where I am now, than where I was, you know, five years ago, so, I don't know.  Are you still there?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.
L:  Okay.  I thought we were already cut off. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no.
L:  Because you were so quiet. [LAUGH] But, yeah, so ...
