R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, um, are we supposed to introduce each other?
L:  Speaking. [PAUSE]
R:  You are?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um --
L:  M- m --
R:  -- what are we supposed to do?
L:  I'm not sure either so, introduce yourself.  Hi, my name is Kevin.
R:  Okay, my name is Shelly.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- it says th- th- it says the subject is comedy and h- how do you draw the line as -- what is acceptable, what isn't, and ah, I think that's a personal decision.
R:  Um.  I think so and it also depends on the environment.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Are you drunk? [LAUGH]
L:  No, definitely not.
R:  Oh okay, I'm sorry.  Um, yeah, so, ah, I think comedy also, it depends on the country and culture.
L:  And --
R:  Because -- because -- because some jokes are appropriate in some cultures and then some jokes are not appropriate in some cultures, right?
L:  And also, w- w- w- within a culture it depends on, um, who says -- who's saying the joke and when.
R:  That's true.  And to whom.
L:  Exactly, because, um, there -- f- for example, in this country there are th- th- there are quite a f- few comedians th- that -- I think that s- s- jokes are funny but, ah, it depends on the setting and what it's about.
R:  That's true.  And I think comedy style is different, because, I don't know, I think when foreigners come to the US and they watch the comedy shows, they don't understand the jokes at the beginning.
L:  Well it -- it- it's -- it- it's the same thing with um, s- sometimes in newspaper or magazine, ah, they -- they --p- print stories f- from other countries and ah, every culture's di --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have -- have their own way of looking at things.
R:  Yeah.  I agree with that.
L:  And for example, um, one, um, one American comedian, ah, he's been around for quite a while, that ah, I have always been a big fan of him, Mr. George Cohen[?], he- he- he's di- di- did such a -- a good job of laughing at the way we are.
R:  Ah-huh. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Which state do you live at?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Are you on the east coast or west coast?
L:  I'm on -- I'm on the pacific coast.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And wh- wh- wh- where are you?
R:  Um, west coast.
L:  Wh- wh- whereabouts on the West Coast?
R:  Ah, it's like, around College Point Inn.
L:  I'm -- I'm in California myself, central California, San Jose[?] Boswell[?] County.
R:  I see.  Ah, well, do you know how long we're supposed to, um, discuss the topic?  I wonder, because this is my first time.
L:  No -- no -- no -- I -- I don't know either, because th- th- th- this is the first time I've -- this is the first time I answered t- t- t- to one of these calls.
R:  Oh really.  So, yeah --
L:  So, ah- ah- ah- w- it- it- it sounds like we're both curious [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, and the beginning was kind of weird, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  Anyway, who's your favorite comedian?
L:  Woody Allen.
R:  Oh really?
L:  I've -- I've -- I've been a fan of his for -- for -- a long time, well, I'm -- ah -- I'm -- I've -- I've been around myself for qu- qu- quite a while.  I- I- I'm aged forty four and I- I- I've heard a few -- few different ones and ah, I- for quite a while I've been a big fan of Mr. Woody Allen.
R:  Mm.  See, like, some people, they don't understand his um, humor, I think.  Like, he's kind of sarcastic and, right?  And -- and I think some people, they -- they don't, like -- they don't like him at all and they don't -- they don't -- they cannot laugh at his jokes because they don't understand him.
L:  Or a- a- another thing s- s- s- s- some people don't understand is a lot of his, um, ah, d- d- d- New York, Manhattan style.
R:  That's true.  What is the difference?  Is there a difference, in comedy style between east coast and west coast?
L:  I think so.
R:  Really?  Because I know, like, people on the west coast don't usually like people on the east coast, right?  Like, their style is so different.  Like [inaudible]
L:  I'm quite sure, an- an- an- and also um, it- it- it's quite different from here, and ah, in the mid West and th- the reason that comes to mind is because um, m- my daughter is now in Michigan at the University of Northern Michigan and she says it- it's kind of different s- s- s- society over there.
R:  Hm.  I see.  Hm.  Interesting.  So, I guess, I don't know, is there supposed to be, like, a signal or something, or just do we just [inaudible]
L:  I'm also cu- I'm also cu- curious myself, I d- d- d- it's, um, interesting it- it- it's interesting talking to you but, ah, I'm -- I'm -- I'm wondering, is -- is -- is there a- an -- o- is there an operator -- operator listening to us? [LAUGH]
R:  I think -- I think there might, like, three[?] quarters and then maybe listen to them and analyze later on, maybe.
L:  Are they -- are they, are -- are -- are they going to listen in case -- in case e- either one of us s- says- says s- s- s- s- s- something that we're going to be th- th- the next big comedian?
R:  [LAUGH] I doubt it. [LAUGH] Like, looking for new talent?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I doubt it [LAUGH]
L:  Oh well, I'll find something else. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Anyway, I think they just -- I think they um, it's like, automatic system that's like, machine calls out, I think.
L:  I'm also curious [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well it- it- it's been interesting talking to you.
R:  Yeah.  Nice talking to you too. [MN] What time is it?  Is it ten forty five where -- where you are?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  Pacific time.
R:  Well, I hope, um, -- I hope, ah, you have a good night.
L:  Likewise and ah -- it's interesting talking to you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  E- e- e- enjoy your comedy, wh- wh- who -- whoever it is.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Bye.
L:  Nice talking to you.  Goodnight.
R:  Bye.
