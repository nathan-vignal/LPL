R:  I don't know, I've always enjoyed clothing and any time a -- any type of retail [PAUSE] type store.  Um, guest[?] stuff, country crafts, things like that.  I'd be more interested in -- [PAUSE] Okay.  And my name is Cindy.
R:  My name is Chrissie.
L:  Hi Chrissie.
R:  Oh, I didn't know if you could hear me or not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know how this works.
R:  I don't know how it works, either.  I know, and it's worth a try for ten bucks. [LAUGH]
R:  Really.
L:  [LAUGH] I'll answer any question you've got. [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.  I would be interested in opening a craft store, actually.
L:  Yeah, a cr- and actually you can do them yourself -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so you don't have to put -- 
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- any money in pockets to pay somebody to do them for you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That comes later, after you've done made all the money you could. [LAUGH]
L:  You're right.
R:  But yeah, really, especially in the Ozarks.
L:  Oh, is that where you're from?
R:  Yeah, I'm up here in Branson, Missouri.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So we got a lot of tourists that come and they're always looking for craft stuff.
L:  Yeah, I'm in Ox fall and close to ah, the Smoky Mountains park and there's a million tourists coming through, ah, looking for -- looking to spend money, so ...
R:  Yeah.  I wish I was one of 'em. [LAUGH] I've never been to the Smoky Mountains, I'd have to say.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So that's pretty close.  Now, what do we do?  We just chat with each other, or ...? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  I can do that for ten bucks too. [LAUGH]
L:  There was another question about, how, if we would be -- how successful we'd be at it, but ...
R:  I don't -- me -- first time, I don't know.  It's probably, that's like a fifty fifty chance right there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And with the cost of the buildings around here, the rent people have to pay are really high.
L:  Right.
R:  So, unless you really had a good -- something to pull the people in, like, sales, or you know, just something that would pull them in.
L:  I wonder how successful I would actually be if I had to motivate myself to get up and go to work in the morning, [LAUGH] if I didn't have to?
R:  [LAUGH] That's me too.  Night job.  I'm on a night job. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, me, myself, I- I'm a homemaker also, my fiance's a truck driver and I've got a little four year old, he just turned four, and we're going through potty training and the last thing I need to think about is a business. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, exactly.  I mean, if no one was making you get up and go to work, you know, could you? [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] Really, really.  I- I'm always looking for those grants that help, like, I wo- I would love to have land somewhere and have, um, wild animals, take care of wild animals -- 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- or, you know -- you know, h- or some kind of safety for them and have the government, you know, help you take care of these animals and stuff, and I get along with animals more than I do people, I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, you know, [LAUGH] and I'm not so sure about wild, but, I mean, even cats and dogs.
L:  Oh cats, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'd love to.  You a cat lover?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, me too.  And I'm sitting at this place right now, we -- we pay six hundred dollars rent and they won't let us have any animals.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm like, "You're taking a lot of money and I don't even -- I had to get rid of my cat because of you.  My beloved cat".
L:  Oh no.
R:  And so now, yeah -- so I've spent the last three months calling, "I want to move.  I want to move.  I want to move". [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  "If you're not going to let me have my animal then I got to leave". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  We actually have a cat here in our office ... [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool.  That's really neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it your own office, or is -- your boss just lets you?
L:  Well, it just kind of happened and he [LAUGH] just let's us. [LAUGH]
R:  That's sweet.  I think that's really nice, and it -- it 'cause, one, emotionally, they're really good for you ...
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and they -- they -- they calm you down, th- you look at 'em, you can't help but think how cute they are.
L:  Oh, exactly, and it's just nice and getting up and coming to work in the morning, [LAUGH] 'cause I miss her, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's true, too, that's true.
L:  So it's neat, and then we have, ah, probably about ten wild ones outside that we feed, so ...
R:  The wild ones?  Yeah, they're just kinda -- oh, and you always want to tame 'em and stuff, but once they get the -- get out there, especially male cats ...
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I've lost so many male cats, because they hit that age, that certain age, and they're ready, they're gone, they're grown up, they know it all.  They're just like a kid, you know?  They know it all.  They're out of here.  I might see you once or twice when I come to eat, and that's it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, there you go.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I decided, yeah, I'd definitely have -- I had a male cat we'd have him neutered, that way he'd be chilled out and calm down.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But, if -- but females, I had them, and I ended up with twenty one cats one time.
L:  Oh no.
R:  Yes.  It was, I mean -- she was just like boom!  She'd get knocked up, and then I was like, you know, yeah, "I'm not letting you out for at least two years --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she'd get out, I wouldn't see her, she'd come back, she'd be knocked up again.  I'd say, "I'm not even done getting rid of your other cats".
L:  Oh that's what happens to us down here, I mean, the one that we have in the office, we just kinda tamed it, brought it in, but, the rest are just wild.
R:  Yes, yes, see, and th- that's -- that's you know, the hardest thing is when you do get some and you're just like, oh, "What have I done?"
L:  No, that's what I think, it's like, "Oh no".
R:  People called me the cat lady.  I was like, "Oh, come on, thirty one years old, I'm not, you know, I'm not this old crippled woman with a bunch of cats.  I got kids too, you know". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny, because that's what they call me too.
R:  [LAUGH] That's hilarious.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so now, what do we do now?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Wow.  That's weird.
L:  I don't even remember how long it was supposed to be, or ...
R:  Me neither. I don't -- and that was like the -- that was the question.  An- and fifty fifty chance of being successful around here.  Um, I say, yes, only 'cause you have to be optimistic if you do anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, to be reality, is the way the war and everything, the economy, we probably wouldn't make it.
L:  Right.  And there's pr- oil, yeah, yeah, if you could come up with, I don't know, something really special that no one had thought up yet, to make.
R:  That would be a good idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm always going through these magazines and th- th- there are these off print magazines and they're coming up with these, you know, just little knickknack that helps you in the kitchen and stuff like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'd say, "Now why in the heck didn't I think of that one?" [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L: [LAUGH] And these people are going to be rich.
L:  And you're just trying to think of this -- this -- this idea that no one has thought up yet, and, it's like, [SIGH]
R:  Invention, that's my -- my husband, he is the inventor.  He's just constantly he's coming up with them, and it's like, "Yeah, okay, now I have all these inventions that you've come up with --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and I'm behind you on maybe n- less than half of 'em". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The other ones, I think, are a little over the top, but ah, now where do we go from there?  Then you have to go get somebody to patent it, who isn't going to steal your idea --
L:  Right.
R:   -- or say, "Oh, it's already been done", and then next year here's your product.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you can't trust these companies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just, like, "Paul, what are you going to do now?"  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  "You're going to keep on driving a truck is what you're going to keep doing". [LAUGH]
L:  I'd say the price of rent in any place that's in the tourist center would be just outrageous.
R:  It is.  Even thrift stores.  They have thrift stores down here, and I'm talking, because I love clothes, and -- and um -- these -- you know -- and there's like at least seven just in -- in my area, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which -- and they're -- I'm like, well there's so many.  Are they making it?
L:  Yeah.
L:  So I asked the lady, you know, she'd just opened it, and I was like, "Are you making a profit off this?"  She goes, "Well", she goes, "to be honest, we're like, breaking even right now".
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm like, okay, maybe the summer time you could actually make a profit, but during the winter, you're -- you're lucky if you break even then.
L: Yeah.  Do you craft a lot?
R:  Ah, no, I wish I did, but I -- I actually need someone to tutor me, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can -- I can do it, but not by myself.  If someone shows me the first couple of times, or I've had questions, som- like -- like taking a class of some kind.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be great, and I -- I would jump on it.  But other than that, no, I'm not good with -- I had my fingers stuck together. [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  I do -- I mean, I can do it, but I will spend a fortune making something and I just don't see -- you know, making a profit on it. [LAUGH]
R:  True, true.
L:  Or selling it, you know, after you spend all that time making something, selling it for, you know, what it's worth to you --
R:  Right, because to you it's more because you put your hands, your -- yeah your right, your time, all that into it and you're not going to want to let it go cheap.  But I did find this company that, for fourteen ninety nine, and I think the cheapest when it's on sale, it's nine ninety nine, it's a little magazine, it's called Collections.  And -- I -- I buy it -- like very month I buy something from 'em --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they have beautiful, beautiful, um, stuff and you have to assemble it yourself when it [LAUGH] gets to you, which I didn't like that much, but [LAUGH] I don't particularly have screwdrivers and hammers and nails around my house. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I really -- you know, and they just -- they must make a lot of money selling it that cheap.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that's why th- th- they're becoming so successful, is because they don't -- nothing's over fourteen ninety nine in the magazine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, everything in the magazine's fourteen ninety nine, and I was just -- I was really impressed with them and I've been buying gifts for people and Christmas stuff and you know, anything I could off it so I don't have to leave my house. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do.  I ha- I hate going to town 'cause it's always paying bills, unless it's to go shopping, I really don't want to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but anyways, it was nice chatting with you.
L:  It was great chatting with you.
R:  I wish we knew what to do.
L:  I was -- do you want[?] any of the boards?
R:  Um, no I don't.  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No, I'm just one of the survey -- I entered survey -- to take ten dollars for every survey you take from Fisher --
L:  Uh- huh.
R:  -- and they call you in between a certain time.  The first two -- I missed, man, I kept pushing the thing -- I didn't know my code.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  And I was like, "Wow, what's my code!"  And so I went back in and they -- I finally cal- found the number and I called them, and they gave me my code, and I wrote it down backwards.  I don't know, dyslexia or something, I don't know. [LAUGH] So, then the next day I was waiting and waiting, waiting, and I went, oh I'm going to get my ten dollars today. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and ah, it calls, and I'll be danged if I didn't put it in backwards, so I called them again and they told me the number and I was like, I got the last two numbers switched around.
L:  Oh.
R:  But today I got it right, but I have no clue what we're doing.
L:  Well how did you find out about, um doing it?
R:  Oh, I'm a freebie junkie.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, and I found it on a freebie site and it said, you know, ten dollars --
