R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, golly I've never done this before so  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's my first time too.
R:  Okay, I'm Nancy.
L:  My name's Beth.
R:  Okay, um, I guess we're supposed to talk about comedy, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Its just kinda strange.  Um, well I guess I can start this.
L:  Sure.
R:  What do you consider bad taste in comedy?
L:  Um, gosh you kinda have to hear it to really know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  Okay, what would you consider -- do you have children?
L:  What I consider appropriate for them is different from what I consider appropriate for me.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  I have a granddaughter that we're raising.
R:  Okay.  I have a fifteen year old son who thinks that anything goes for him, and I have to really watch it, you know, I -- I just think that I'm -- I'm  not  -- I don't think nudity is appropriate in a comedy.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I think the -- some of the vulgarity -- some of the [inaudible] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- goes a little bit too far.  Um, even say watching comedy club on TV.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  [LAUGH] That shouldn't be for kids.
R:  I think, well I don't even like it for me and I'm not a prude but I -- I just don't think that the use of the F word you know without --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- coming right and saying it, every other word is necessary to get a funny idea across.
L:  Yeah, that and I don't like it when, um, my husband likes to watch Death Jam Comedy on the BEP network --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't like it even when the black people are using the 'n' word.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Referring to themselves and the -- that just -- it's -- I don't see where the swearing or that kind of stuff is really necessary.
R:  Well, that's it.  I mean, you know, what does the -- what's the point -- does it make something funnier?  No, I don't think it does.  You know, I don't think it -- it adds to humor at all.  Um, you know how long are we supposed to talk about this?
L:  I guess there's supposed to be a recording that comes in and tells us when we're over.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  They had called me once before but they couldn't find anybody to participate so ...
L:  Yeah, same thing here.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, the other thing that we recently watched was Shrek.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, everybody told me it was great, it was hilarious and all that but my granddaughter is six --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and throughout the entire movie, um, there's a donkey in the movie, uh, there's an ogre and a donkey that are the two --
R:  Right.
L:  -- main characters.  Throughout the entire movie they referred to the donkey as an ass.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Now I've seen Shrek a couple of times and I've never noticed that, I guess maybe I need to --
L:  Well --
R:  -- pay some more attention -- well, my grandson is almost -- he'll be three next month and it's like he goes in phases, he wants one movie a hundred times in a row.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  And Shrek was a couple of months ago.  That was his -- his movie of the month and, uh, so I watched it first to see and I must of totally missed that.
L:  Well, it's -- it's one of those things where, yeah, one word for a donkey appropriately is an ass, but they use it -- and my granddaughter is in the potty humor stage.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  So, maybe that's why it became more appropriate to her.  You know, there's thing like, um, right after he saves the princess he says he's got to go save his ass.
R:  Okay, yeah you know what; now that you point it out I remember that.
L:  Yeah, and -- and my granddaughter just started -- she just though it was the most hilarious --
R:  Oh, yes I'm sure.
L:  -- thing in the world because they said -- they said a dirty word.  [LAUGH]
R:  And she was rolling on the floor laughing.
L:  Oh, she thought it was -- and then after that whenever we'd go by -- we live out in the country so we'd go by a field with horses or cows in there she'd say I wonder if there's any asses in there.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And then start laughing hysterically and ...
R:  I guess, like I said I have a fifteen year old son.  I also have three children in their twenties and thirties and, uh, even them I have to really you know really crack on them a lot around my son, and while he finds it -- the swearing the profanity -- he seems to find it -- it's just no big deal to him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is to me.   And if I -- what's the point?  You know, I tell my daughter constantly when she's talking you know she'll be telling a joke or something and as well they often  -- thing did this F-ing thing I'm like, Tricia, oops shouldn't ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, you're not making it any funnier you know.  Your use of the words are detracting from the humor if anything else and that's how I feel about the comedy on TV.  And, are you a fan of Brittany Spears?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think that children should be allowed to be children and I think Brittany Spears and, um, the other one, Christine Aguilera that are both so young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they were the Mousketeers are encouraging these little girls to --
R:  Grow up.
L:  -- to grow up and try to be sexual way too fast.
R:  Now, I'm not familiar with Brittany Spears, but I had rented a movie the other night and I wasn't even aware she was in it.
L:  Oh yeah, I haven't seen that one yet.
R:  And, uh, it's an older one, Crossroads. 
L:  Yes, it's her only movie.
R:  The movie was fantastic, but it showed her nude -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Why?  You know, it didn't -- it didn't add anything to the movie in my opinion at all.  The story line, the plot was a really good plot but why -- why the nudity?  You know, it just didn't -- it made no sense to me whatsoever and of course my fifteen year old hey you know.
L:  Loved it.
R:  Oh yeah.  Show me more can I watch this again, um, you know.
L:  Well she was a, one of the Mousketeers in the eighties I think it was or the early nineties, the New Mousketeer Club.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I think back to when Annette Funicello started doing the movies back in the early sixties --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and Walt Disney said to her, "Whatever you do, don't show your belly button".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think he must be rolling over in his grave.
R:  Oh, without a doubt.
L:  Because Christine Aguilera is an old, um -- is one of the Mousketeers from the New Mickey Mouse Club, um --
R:  See, I'm not familiar with her either.
L:  Oh, she's the one.
R:  I've heard of her.  I just --
L:  She's just the same, yeah -- the -- she's an early -- I think she might be twenty now but she wears the very risque clothes, sings the very risque songs, and my kids are now twenty three, twenty two and twenty one --
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- so, I've monitored quite a bit of MTV in the last few years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Hey my kids are older, they're like thirty two, twenty nine, uh, twenty five but he's been out on his own for so long that you know -- he watches -- I've never had the opportunity.  The fifteen year old, I have a lot of opportunity and he uses common sense too, but you know when you're watching a movie --
L:  Mhm.  It kinda comes out of nowhere.
R:  Yeah, you can't fast forward, oh oops, don't watch, cover your head.  You know [LAUGH] oh come on ma, you know, and I guess -- I guess it's a part of today, but it doesn't have to a part of my today.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, uh, listening to kids around the schools, and, uh -- we live out in the country too, so the school system is pretty -- we lived in a big city until a year ago and there's a lot of difference in the way the kids act, the way the kids dress, the whole -- you know.
L:  Yep, I lived in a large +metropolitan -- area -- metropolitan area, until my kids were -- let's see my oldest one was a sophomore.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then we moved out to some other -- from school where my daughter's graduating class was going to be seventeen hundred kids to an area where the whole school from kindergarten through twelfth grade had about fifteen hundred kids.
R:  Right.
L:  And the difference was, uh, dramatic, but --
R:  Oh ter- -- yeah, but to the good side.  You know, yeah you know I have to -- I -- talking about, um, Brittany Spears and watching the way she was -- of course it was a movie, you know I'm sure that you know she was being paid and she was a little goody two shoes in the movie, um, very innocent, very you know -- never -- never -- has never done anything wrong; never dated through high school; never partied; none of the things that they do; and she got out on her own for a summer.  And she didn't turn terrible by any means, but now I forgot what point I was going to make, huh.  This age thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
