L:  Hello, my name is Brenda.
R:  What is your name?
L:  Brenda. 
R:  Brenda.  My name is Sandy.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Okay, so we're supposed to talk about opening a business, huh?
L:  Ah, sounds that way.
R:  Okay.  It's something I've actually been thinking about a lot, but I don't even know how to go about it.
L:  Well, actually, I worked at a bank for, I guess, eighteen years --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and part of that time I worked in a loan department --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, I know, you know, what's involved in getting the funding, ah, together for a business.  You know, you've got to have a business plan and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have to present financial statements, ah, you know, they prefer that you have, um, ah, you know, a plan put together as far as, you know, ah, potential buildings that you can rent, the cost of, ah, [SIGH] you know, the rent, so what you'd anticipate the utilities would run.
R:  Okay.
L:  The more detailed the better, as far as getting funding goes.
R:  Oh well, you know a lot more about it than I do, already. [LAUGH]
L:  And then you have to have a financial statement, you know, showing your assets and liabilities and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopefully, you know, that can secure a loan, if not then, you know, you'll have to put a bit of collateral for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, that would probably be the first test and then --
R:  Um, what type of business have you thought about, or have you, actually?
L:  Ah, if I were to do it, [SIGH] I do computer work a lot.  I'd probably open a computer store, probably, ah, you know, build and sell computers.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Would be what I would do, ah, service those.
R:  That would be a good thing to get into.
L:  Yeah, th- they're pretty good -- made for it in this area. I know from experience there's not too many [LAUGH] people -- qualified technicians around here that work on 'em.
R:  Yeah, right, that's true.  Yeah, it's the -- it's the going thing, so, that would definitely be something good.
L:  I think so.  A company like Hewlett Packard and IBM and several of the big companies don't have their own reps any more, they contract out.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And you can work through them and they, actually, you know, they send you out all the calls and then you call in and, you know, the customer actually tells them what's wrong and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they say, "well, it's probably, you know, this, this or this", and they send you out there with a part to replace it.  If it's not that then, you know, you sort of just replace the parts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There is no cost to you for that.  They ship it off to you.
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  That would be a good venture to get into, you know, especially if you know something about it, you know.
L:  I think so too.
R:  That's pretty interesting.
L:  A pretty good demand for it.
R:  Yeah. I li- well I like books a lot and I've often thought about, ah, opening a used book store, you know, because I frequent one a lot, you know, it's a second hand bookstore, and um, you know, like I say, I just don't know.  There -- there's a lot of things that I like, a lot of things that I'm interested in, um, I also do -- like to do a lot of crafts, you know, in fact, um, my daughter and I have just taken belly dancing lessons [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- yeah, and [LAUGH] --
L:  I bet that's interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's just for fun, you know, well, she's twenty one and I'm fifty, so it's a big difference but we have a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I made us some dancing scarves tonight, you know, I really enjoy doing stuff like that.  But, you know, as -- as far as, ah, opening a business, I, you know, I have so many varied interests that I wouldn't even know what I'd -- what I'd want to do.  But it is something I've thought about.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Arkansas.
R:  Arkansas, okay.  I live in Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, we are a long ways apart then.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  How's the weather by you?  Pretty nice?
L:  Ah, it was up until, I guess about three o clock this afternoon and we got a thunderstorm that came through and the temperature's dropped about forty degrees.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] that would be a heat wave for us.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I think we're down in the teens tonight.
L:  Ah, this is the coldest weather we've had in this area in quite a while.  Its' --
R:  Yeah. [inaudible] 
L:  And we've got the low hour[?] manual thing going on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's tornados one week and hailstorms[?] the next.
R:  Yeah, we get that in the summer, but, ah, you know, we've never really been hit seriously.  At least not -- I'm in Milwaukee and we don't usually get hit.  But outside -- you know, outlying areas usually do.  So, um, [LAUGH] I don't know.  Um, I forgot what other questions we were supposed to talk about with this.
L:  I think how we were to go about it.  Um, I think, you know, I guess the first thing would be to format a business plan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You would have to formulate a business plan in order, you know, to start and then you would present it, ah, you know, depending on the type of business, I guess you would either need to find somebody to go in with you that could provide the funding or you would have to obtain funding on your own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you would have to find a suitable location for it.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Market it and --
R:  Yeah, and well, with money being no object, I guess that would take al- a lot of things out of the way.
L:  Unfortunately it's not the case [inaudible]
R:  Right, yeah, that's for sure.
L:  Ah, that would be --
R:  I think you would have a good plan with, ah, the computers, you know.
L:  I think so.  I've thought pretty seriously about it.  It, ah, since IBM and HP have started the contracting out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it --
R:  Could you know anything, like, about programming, or fixing them, or, all of that?
L:  Ah, I throw the things together all the time at work, it's what I have to do most of the days, is throw them together.
R:  Wow, that's interesting.  Mhm.
L:  Throw them together and repair them and, um, and sell software.  I can do some programming, ah --
R:  Wow.
L:  --I'm not big on the computer, ah, you know, the languages like RPG and COBOL it's ah, or, you know Visual C that they're programmed[?] in today, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I can get around and, you know --
R:  Yeah, that's pretty good.
L:  -- repair minor little stuff or faults[?]
R:  Jeez.  Did you take cl- schooling for that or did that just, kind of, come with the job, or ...?
L:  Um, I took some classes in it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, ah, whenever I went to work for a bank, that was primarily what I did, is, ah, you know, worked on their computers and if something was wrong I was the person that always had to figure out what it was.
R:  Wow, that's really good.
L:  And it kind of came along naturally.  Then whenever I went to work for an electric utility I became a network administrator and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- ah.
R:  So you do have some definite, ah, advantages to that, you know.
L:  So I -- you know, I've thought seriously about, you know, perhaps doing that.  Ah, I think there's um, you know, there -- the only problem is, there's so many of those places that are fly by night, I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the biggest conflict you would, um, come up against would be trying to, ah, convince someone that you were, you know, really serious in the endeavor, that you weren't going to be here today and gone tomorrow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that would be the big thing, because I've seen these shops go in and, you know, they're there six months and then they're gone.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  So, I think that would be, you know, the biggest obstacle you would have to overcome.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that, you know, this day and age though, it sure would be something good to get into.
L:  Yeah, and I think that the way to go would be maintenance.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  Even though, I mean, I know they are getting cheaper and cheaper but a lot of people get attached to their computers and rather than start over with something new they'd rather stick to something.  Like, we just bought, ah, memory for ours --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- you know, and a video card, so, you know, my daughter could say well, let's hang[?] in for a better one, but actually it was a lot cheaper just to get more memory for it.
L:  They're getting dirt cheap.  Hallmark actually have a computer now that's, ah, an eight hundred megahertz.  It's got a hundred and twenty meg of ram and I think a twenty gig part drive with a network card.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's just the tower, it's not the monitor or the keyboard or the mouse, for a hundred and ninety eight dollars --
R:  Lord[?].
L:  -- and you install the software on it, and I mean, it's a good computer for a hundred and ninety eight dollars.
R:  Yeah, wow.  That's amazing.
L:  So, I mean, it's going to get to the point where people that are building these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can't afford to build 'em for what they're going to sold at.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Wow, that is a good deal.
L:  It is.  I've thought that if I had to upgrade, that's probably what I'd do, should go buy a tower and just install[?] the software on it.
R:  Yeah.  So, well, I don't know [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  I think we've covered pretty much, I don't know ...
L:  I guess there's -- I don't know if they come back on or not.
R:  Yeah, um, because my daughter does this and she said they just kind of cut it off.  She said it usually goes about ten minutes, or something like that.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, and she said they just kind of just stop -- stop you in the middle of it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I don't know. 
L:  Ah, me neither.  Um, where do you live in Wisconsin?
R:  Ah, in Milwaukee.
L:  In Milwaukee?
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a actually a book store that, oh, I'd say about sixty miles from here, that has really become famous in, probably in the South, John Grisham, the au- the mystery author --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Is from this area.  He grew up near here.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And he actually goes to this bookstore for book openings, and I mean, it is huge whenever he goes over there to, ah, whenever he has a new book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  People come from all over.  They try to get reservations.  What they'll try to do is reserve so many people for a book signing, and of course they get to buy his book when you go in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the first edition, he autographs it for you.
R:  Wow.
L:  And what you have to do whenever this happens is, you have to email them at a certain time, they'll start, like, at eleven o clock, you can't send an email at ten fifty nine because they won't accept it --
R:  Okay.
