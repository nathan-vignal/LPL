L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.

R:  Me too.
L:  You're from Indiana too?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, what part?
R:  Um, we're near Fort Wayne.
L:  Oh, okay, well we're closer to Chicago.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, this is the first time I've done this.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  You too, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure what we're doing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay, I seen on the computer that, um, a lot of people said they last usually about ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- some people said that they didn't know when to stop because they didn't come back on and tell you so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I guess we're just supposed to, um ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Chit chat yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  ON humor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, um, you know what, I like all kinds of humor so nothing really -- you know I'm not offended by it in any way.  You know, I guess some people are by cursing and stuff like that but I -- you know it doesn't bother me.
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- it's to a point, I guess if there's a lot of bad language --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't care for it with children in the family.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, if they're around but otherwise it doesn't affect me too much either.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm because have you ever been to like stand up comedy or anything?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No.
L:  No?  We've done that a couple of times.  My husband and I have gone to, uh, like the Comedy Farm over here in Chicago and stuff like that and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they have, like, uh, three or four different comedians come up and do a show and we find it very entertaining. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty funny.  Mhm.
R:  It would be.
L:  Oh, what kind of movies do you like, comedy?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, pretty much any of the comedy movies I'll watch.  Um, I prefer them over the action or any of the others.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, how about -- have you seen like Blue Streak?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Martin Laurence or ...
R:  I ... they don't sound familiar.  [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] Mhm. Yeah Eddie Murphy, he's pretty funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I don't watch a whole lot of movies.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, we're ... although some other comedy shows on TV we'll watch but ...
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, we been watching that, um, uh, what is that with the teenagers -- two -- that dad of the two teenage girls?
R:   Eight Simple Rules, is it that one?
L:  Yeah, that one.
R:  Yeah, my daughter loves that one.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we can relate to that because we have a sixteen year old daughter  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, mine is going to be thirteen in --
L:  Okay, so yours is just starting out.
R:  Yeah, they're -- yeah -- a lot of things, kinda.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's pretty funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I always like that show.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] Oh, say, this is kind of odd I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, let's see, I don't know.
R:  Do they come on and ask other questions or are you just -- is this the only one?
L:  I think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think so, 'cause, uh, when I was reading about it on the computer they said that they -- some girls are, like, all they -- come on -- you know they don't come back and tell you so we just hung up.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  And another girl said that they did come on and say okay your time is up you can hang up now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I'm not sure but how did you find out about it?
R:  On the internet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I don't remember.  On some board they were posting where you could sign up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I was kinda beginning to regret it here because they -- I just -- um, did it today and they called three or four times --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and [LAUGH] I'm, like, wow what have I got myself into?
L:  Oh, well I signed up probably about a week ago but I have the caller ID so I didn't know ... you know --
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I'd seen it on there a few times and I was, like, what is this University of Pennsylvania there. [LAUGH]  It kept showing up and I haven't been home.  My sister was here.  She was, like, somebody called and asked for the pin and I just hung up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I've missed a call like a lot but they've been calling me a lot too.
R:  Yeah, that's what I've been -- how often they were going to do that but --
L:  Mhm.  I know.
R:  Yeah, the first time they -- well, the first time I was on the internet and then second time I answered [NOISE] and I hit the button to do the survey.  And then he said they had to find another participant and hold on and I did that for like twenty minutes and they never found anybody so I ended up hanging up.
L:  Oh, so they never came back on, uh-huh.
R:  So, I thought I'll try one more time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  If I have any better luck.
L:  Yeah, I know it took -- it -- after you do like three of four, that if you qualify, that you get like twenty six calls.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  You get, if you qualify for it you could do twenty six calls in the next three or four months.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Call in every day.  Mhm.
R:  I guess I don't have else to do here in Indiana, it's not --
L:  I know.  We're from a pretty small town too here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is it snowing there?
L:  Um, it's kinda like raining snow today.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's just, um -- it's not a lot of snow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But how about over by you?
R:  Yeah, it looks pretty much like snow but it's real white and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't look like it's sticking real well but ...
L:  Yeah, this is really slushy here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like about a week ago though we got -- we got hit real good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh we ...
L:  With a lot of snow.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I'm tired of seeing snow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know, we're, like, looking to relocate.  We can't take this any more.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I keep telling my husband there's gotta be somewhere better than this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Uh ...
L:  I know.  My sister just moved here from Arizona and, uh, she said, oh, it's still like in the seventies when they left.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that would be wonderful. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, what did you come here for?
R:  Yeah really. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  This cold awful weather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  But she just moved to Indianapolis so --
R:  Okay.
L:  I had her living with me for two months, her and her three children.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they just left yesterday.
R:  Okay.
L:  Got my house back.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Nice for a while.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  It's nice to have my house back but I'm in a mess, [inaudible] for two months I got really attached to her little ones [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus she had a four month old baby.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I fell in love with him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm on the [inaudible] but they're only three hours away now so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that's not bad.
R:  No.
L:  Instead of, uh, thirty hours away.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, much better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, did you happen to see what time we started doing this?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  How many minutes it says. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it's probably been five ten minutes yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  A couple more minutes hopefully.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Have you seen that move Sweet Home Alabama?
R:  Yeah, actually we, um, we went on a Disney cruise in October --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it was playing on the boat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, yeah, otherwise we hardly ever make it to a movie theatre.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  My husband works a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we're just gonna ...
L:  Yeah, mine does too.  Mine works two jobs actually.
R:  Does he?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, mine's --
L:  He's hardly ever home.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's like mine.  I see him an hour or two each night and ...
L:  Mhm.  That's me too.
R:  Oh, we don't get a whole lot of movies but we did get to see that one.  That one was pretty good.
L:  Yeah, it looks pretty good.
R:  I think the other one was uh, the -- My Big Fat Greek Wedding, have you seen that one.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Yeah, that was another one we watched on there.  It's kind of a comedy.
L:  Mhm.  I heard that was pretty good.  Did you like it?
R:  It was okay.  I guess it wasn't as good as -- 'cause we had heard -- a lot of people told us that it was good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess it wasn't as [NOISE] -- oh, guess the humor wasn't [LAUGH] -- wasn't as good as we thought it would be but --
L: Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was okay.
L:  Yeah.  I -- my son and my husband get ready to go see that new boy biker boys --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I think it's called.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know what that's all about but ...
R:  Yeah, I don't know too much about it.
L:  Mhm
R:  I've heard about it.
L:  Well they'll go see that today and my daughter's going to go see, I think it's called Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Have you heard of that?
R:  Well, I -- whatever the awards were on, the other night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know they won a lot of awards for it.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think Richard Gere's in that one, isn't he?
L:  Oh, is he?
R:  I was thinking ...
L:  I haven't seen any advertisement for it.  She told me she was going to see it and all like I never even heard of it.
R:  Yeah, I hadn't either until that -- the awards show and --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- they kept bringing that up and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then won several awards for it so --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- I'm not sure what it's about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'll say that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  So ... oh, goodness.
R:  Ah.
L:  I got furniture to move, I just got home.  [LAUGH] Just walked through the door [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had to rearrange my living room to accommodate my sister and her kids so --
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  -- we're wanting to get all that back in order today.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All the furniture, like, why don't we run upstairs and do this survey real quick.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How much longer?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  So these pay ten dollars, isn't it?  Supposed to pay ten dollars a survey?
R:  I -- I don't know.  I guess, I didn't -- 
L:  You didn't see that part?
R:  -- I should have read more about it before -- I have a habit of just signing up for things and --
L:  Yeah.  That's what I read, that it's ten dollars a survey and we're supposed to do three.
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  Then, if we do all right with those then I guess then we're hooked up for the next three of four months.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] For twenty six surveys.  [LAUGH] I don't think I'll be doing that one.  [LAUGH]
