L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Nat.
L:  I'm Judy.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice talking to you.  Um, this is my first time at this, is it your first?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it'll be a little strange I guess at first.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the topic is interesting I got, though.
R:  Um, yeah it's very interesting.
L:  You have any -- any particular comedians that you like and what you find -- do you find anything that they do offensive?
R:  Um, well I don't -- I don't find much offensive.  I generally take things well.  Um, I guess, like George Carlin.
L:  Oh, yeah I love him.
R:  He's -- he's brilliant.  Um --
L:  I think I'm a lot older than you from the sound of your voice.  Are you familiar with --
R:  I'm a college student.
L:  -- the Smothers Brothers?
R:  What was that?
L:  The Smothers Brothers?
R:  No, I don't remember them.
L:  No, they're from back in the sixties, they were really funny.  They had a lot of albums out.  I'm going to switch phones here; see if it sounds better.  Hang on just a second.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  There, is that better?
R:  Yep.
L:  It is for me too.  Um, The Smothers Brothers used to, uh, have a TV show too for a short while.  In fact, they hosted, um ... [LIPSMACK] what did they host?  Um ... it wasn't too long ago but I don't remember what it was.  They're both still around and ... Carlin, actually -- George Carlin is from the same era.  I think they're about the same age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just that he's managed to stay in the limelight a lot longer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have never --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I've never seen him in person though, have you?
R:  Uh, no, I haven't.  I really want to.
L:  Yeah, see, that's one of the problems with this subject is, I only see them on television and not on cable even so ...
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- they're not very offensive on television usually.
R:  Well, they're -- the censors bleep it out.
L:  Yes.  Well, I -- I don't like humor that's ... uh ... very derogatory to ... and hurtful to people of a group or -- whether it be ethnic or whether it be, um, political or anything, I'm -- I'm not real comfortable with that type of humor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I was thinking with -- with more like -- with things that might be morally improper I like.  Um, just because it -- it sort of relaxes people, it's not -- like, things are just in society that are so uptight and the guys that make fun of them you think they're crossing the line but I mean I don't have a problem with that.  I think when people get hurt by what people say ... um, I think hurt, not offended, but like hurt is where -- where the line is.
L:  Yes.  Uh, I -- I ... sometime that's a fine line though between offended and hurt I think.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I was listening to, um, The View the other morning.  Are you familiar with that show?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they were talking about the woman who ran over her husband three times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she's on trial I believe in Texas, is it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they made jokes about it and some of their email called them to task for making fun of some man being run over three times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I could see where people would find that offensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- although I'm sure it was -- I thought when they did it and it was funny when they did it and I laughed but, uh, I could also understand both sides of that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah --
L:  I like the type of humor that's more self directed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Comics that get up there and make fun of their own life and their own situations.
R:  Mhm.  So, what about -- what about comics that are of a particular race and they make fun of their own race.  'Cause sometimes, you know -- there's not -- they're making fun of themselves but some people get hurt by it.
L:  Well, um, I can't think of any instances I've really seen that.  I know they do that.  I -- I, um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  There was uh ... hm, is his name, George Lopez?  He was --
R:  I think so.
L:  Yeah, Hispanic guy who always fun of, um, of the way his parents acted and because he was Mexican American and they did this and that, but a lot of what he said related to things -- other races and people you know.  He -- he directed them as if they were -- it only affected Hispanics but yet I, you know, I laughed because I could see some of the same things around me and I'm ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not Hispanic but I think it crossed over borders in spite of the fact that it was --you know, they way he talked it was directed towards his ethnic group.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, I can't think of anyone else.  I guess maybe Chris Rock does sometimes, doesn't he?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, see --
R:  But if --
L:  -- there again, I've seen him in some movies and on TV like on the Tonight Show and I think he's hysterical but I hear his routine in the clubs is really raw.
R:  Yeah, I've actually gone to see him.  It's ... I don't know it's [inaudible] such a fine line.  Because it's funny, and you -- but at the same time, you know, it promotes stereotypes.
L:  Yes.
R:  But at the -- I don't know there's two ways -- you can look at it -- it builds the stereotypes up and in some ways it also knocks them down because you know when you laugh at something and you -- you know you put it out there -- something that maybe people wouldn't talk about but it's prevalent in society.  This way a minority being treated or something when you put it in --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a comic light, you know, sometimes it's --
L:  Yeah, well, if you're the one who is doing the stereotypical thing --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- and you see a comic making fun of that, I think there are poss- -- two possibilities.  One is you don't think he's funny and you don't see the humor in it. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or else you sit and you think hey wait a minute [LAUGH], you know.  I've done that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're right.  That's -- that's not the way I should be behaving so -- so maybe it serves a purpose that way.
R:  Mhm.  I think it's -- it's a very individual thing.  Um, you know, some people -- some people get offended by anything, and I guess I'm probably the other end of the spectrum whereas I can't get offended by much.  Um, there isn't --
L:  I think since we started this I've been trying to think of what offends me.  I, uh, there are things that do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- but ... I -- not so much with comedy routines.
R:  Uh, I saw a commercial just on Newsdays.  I didn't -- it didn't offend me but I was, like, it's not funny.  Um, there's one -- it's for a hardware store where this -- this guy -- this lady and her son is at the medical examiners office and they're trying to identify a -- his dad and so they show him the face and they don't recognize him then they turn him -- they like turn him over and they show his butt and then they look -- bring out a picture of her -- him bending over, like, fixing plumbing stuff or something --
L:  Oh.
R:  And they go, "Yeah, that's him".
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah but it's -- it just -- like, it sounds it but I just like you know -- for somebody who might have just had to go through that or ... I don't know.
L:  Well, you -- yeah, well, you get into that with any type of situation.  Uh, yeah you can't ... there -- there's very little humor that probably doesn't have someone out there saying, "Well, you know, that just happened to me and that's really awful that they should talk about it like that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Unless, like I said, it's the self deprecating kind.  That's, yeah ...
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't think ... you get into too much trouble with that but, um, there are some things that just require laughing at too.  I mean, that -- that type of, uh, commercial is ... funny but --
R:  The first time I thought it was funny and like I -- I've seen it a couple of times and I'm -- just, me an my roommate were watching it the other night and we were just, like, not that you know it's like --
L:  But the chances of that actually -- I mean, the chances of that actually ...
R:  Yeah, it was kinda the way it was presented too because even as I describe it like it does sound funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it just was -- I don't know, there was just something about it that wasn't that funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was presented very seriously and very --
L:  Now, do you like that spring commercial with the dachshunds?
R:  Um, is that the one where he orders a hundred dach- um --
L:  Oxen, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I think that is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time and it just cracks me up every time I see that -- those dachshunds sitting there hitched to that big hay wagon.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, you know and that doesn't offend anybody it's just very, very funny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh ...
R:  They have -- have you seen the --
