R:  Hi, uh, I'm Alexandra.
L:  Hi, I'm Betty.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  What do you think?  You think -- I don't know -- I guess I would panic or actually I would remain calm because I know if I panic it's going to make it worse.
R:  Uh, I could probably see being calm in the beginning and then [LAUGH] panicking as it got worse and worse.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like that, that's right.
L:  [LAUGH] Something like to that effect but no, um, I, um -- I think I would -- I mean 'cause sometimes you think you would just, like, really freak out during something and then you realise that you do have a certain degree of -- you do retain a certain degree of calm.
R:  Yeah, you would probably --
L:  Yeah, 'cause I was involved in a fire -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when I was in junior high school and you know they were evacuating everybody and I was -- I was surprisingly calm.
R:  Oh, well that's good.
L:  Yeah I was a [inaudible] with this.  I mean, it was pretty big; it took out the whole cafeteria.  But you know in a terrorist attack and stuff like that, I guess you know now that I have kids I mean I would not panic but then I would really have to keep my bearings for their sakes.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you would think of what's important, I guess.
L:  Yeah, you'd have to get them out and whatever it is that you gotta do.
R:  But I think the general atmosphere would be of panic, I mean, you can imagine people ...
L:  Yeah, 'cause around here --
R:  Getting in their cars --
L:  -- we've had --
R:  -- planes.
L:  Yeah, well round here we've had a couple of shopping centers that have been threatened with bomb scares; and you know different terrorist tactics and stuff and I mean I don't go out much, I'm a stay at home mom.
R:  Uh, I'm pregnant right now [LAUGH] and that's what I'll be too.
L:  Oh, how far on are you?
R:  Uh, six months.
L:  This is your first?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know you'll find that -- the children they either make you or break you.
R:  Uh, well.
L:  I mean, mine made me -- they refined me considerably and you know what you think you put them before anything else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like during a terrorist attack the first thing -- your first thought is get my kids out.  You don't even, after a while you don't even think about yourself.  All you want to do is just make sure that they're gonna be ok.
R:  Yeah, but you have to be, you know, able to help them, I mean --
L:  Oh sure, sure.
R:  So, you do have to think of yourself too.
L:  Yeah, so you know you have to be able bodied and stuff.  I mean if you're injured, you're injured but you know it's like they say, you got like the superhuman effort and stuff.  The suit like a super --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- dose of adrenalin.
R:  The adrenalin, that's right.
L:  You got a big adrenalin rush when, you know, okay I gotta get my kids out, gotta get me out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Gotta, you know, got a lot to live for when you have -- when you have just your children.  It's, like, oh, I have three, this is my -- I'll close up the shop -- I have three of them.
R:  [LAUGH] It depends whether there's too you know, what kind of attacks.
L:  Yeah, 'cause the world trade centre thing was so -- I mean I know a lot of people who were there because I'm -- I'm originally from New York City.
R:  That's where I am.  I mean, I'm not in Manhattan but I'm nearby.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, which part of New York are you from?
R:  Queens.
L:  Oh, right over the bridge.
R:  We're in Queens.
L:  I'm from the Bronx.
R:  Oh.
L:  A lot of my family was there, right, you know -- a lot of them -- they -- I have one cousin who really -- she kept really kept her bearing.  She is in a -- she was, like, right across the street.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she's in a wheelchair.  So, you know she really ...
R:  Oh really.
L:  She was really heroic about it and she got out.
R:  She left early?
L:  Yeah, no she was -- she just made it out.  She made it out after the explosion [NOISE] and you really couldn't see anything was like, so -- it was so -- so full of smoke and -- and ash, I mean it was horrible.
R:  Yeah, I saw that.
L:  Something like that is just, like, so daunting and, like, wow, how do I get out of this?
R:  I would think that most people would be thinking I've gotta leave here [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've gotta get away.
L:  Well, you know as some said there were some people who were really heroic.  They had time to get out and they stopped and they went back and they got other people.  But, you know, I mean, I don't know, that's the kind of situation where you [NOISE] really got to be in it.
R:  Yeah, it just depends.
L:  But you know we can only speculate on what we would do.  I mean a lot of things in life are like that, oh, I don't know what I would do if, you know, if I went through such and such as such thing.  Well, guess what?  You know, I was -- I was always afraid to go through, you know -- I said, oh my goodness -- it -- labor sounds like it really hurts.  It really it your mental attitude --
R:  Yes it does [LAUGH] and that's what I've been thinking about now.  I mean --
L:  Well you know, it's your mental attitude really makes a difference. 
R:  But, it's hard to control fear.
L:  Because you know take the Le Mars classes.
R:  Take what?
L:  Take the La Mars classes, they will help you.
R:  Oh yeah, I'll get to that eventually but ...
L:  Uh-huh, and -- and to get -- get yourself a book called Supernatural Childbirth.
R:  Supernatural?
L:  Yeah, it's called Supernatural Childbirth.  I had two pain free children with that.
R:  Really?  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, because what it does instead of focusing on breathing and relaxation; what you're basically doing is you're praying through this thing.  [NOISE] Well, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like anything in life, you pray through it and God gets you through.  I mean, there's the same thing with the terrorist attack.
R:  But that only works if you are religious and believe in God.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, not really.  Not really because I didn't consider myself a highly religious person when I -- when I first did it.
R:  But -- when you felt the pain?  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I was, like, let me tell you, pain has a very humbling effect.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] please help me.  [LAUGH] Yeah, but you know it's not anything unbearable, especially if you -- I mean, I had really large children.  If you have a normal size child --
R:  Well, I really hope so 'cause I'm only five feet tall.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, you're only five feet tall.
R:  If I have a big baby I'm through it.
L:  And if you have something in the six pound area --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- the way most people do, you'll be okay.  The problem with me is my kids were nine fourteen.
R:  That's a lot.  That is really a lot.
L:  Yeah, mine were almost -- my -- my -- I had my last one was -- they had to induce me two weeks early because he was really getting huge.
R:  Getting too big, yeah, I mean how could you get it out?
L:  Well, they induced me two weeks early and he was nine pounds and nine ounces.
R:  Yep.  Really big.
L:  Now, that's more pain than any terrorist could possibly inflict on me, honey.
R: I can only imagine and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah and he has -- well, he had really broad shoulders --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And he's gonna be like a big strapping hunk of man.
R:  Well, that's good for him but it's not good when he's coming out.
L:  Yeah, well you know it's like I told you, get that book and, um -- 'cause really God can get you through anything: terrorists, labor, you name it.  I mean, I found him in labor.  I was, like, there you are -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- making this whole thing bearable.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it's like nothing you've ever felt.  It's, like, you know the -- the cramps you didn't get for the nine months; they give them all to you in the same day.
R:  They all come at once.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's really nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They give 'em all to you in the same day.  But you know what, they're not unbearable.  I had a nurse who was an angel; she put hot towels on my back.
R:  Yeah.  Heat will help.
L:  'Cause that's where it really gets you is in your back.
R:  I would think so.  A lot of women say that they have that.
L:  So, you know what, just like anything -- like any pain you think -- you know you think one way, and something -- you know if I ever caught my husband cheating I would kill him.  You know, what happens is that you have a good one and you catch him cheating, the truth of the matter is you change, like -- you know I would do anything to get him back.
R:  Yeah, well.
L:  You know or anything.  I mean, that happened to me with my last one and [inaudible] breaking up with him ain't gonna happen with this one.  Like honey, please.
R:  You better not. [LAUGH]
L:  A change of attitude honey, a drastic change of attitude.  'Cause you know human beings are unpredictable.
R:  Mhm
L:  We're about as unpredictable as we -- as it's gonna get.
R:  Yeah, because we have free will --
L:  Yeah, we certainly do.
R:  -- to do whatever we want.
L:  We have free will [NOISE] and -- and we don't we really don't know I mean some sometimes [NOISE] in horrible situations -- can you hear my nine month old?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes these horrible situations bring out the best in people; sometimes they bring out the worst.  Sometimes you panic, sometimes you'll be okay, you know, and sometimes -- and like you said in the beginning, you're like, ah -- and then [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah there's gotta be some panic.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Sometimes panic is good. Although not really -- is it fear, not so much panic, it's fear?  [MN] Because fear can --
R:  [inaudible] everything.
L:  -- you can use fear to drive you to save your own hide.  You know, that's why God put it in there, you know you, like, okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is a bad situation; I better get my happy butt out of this.
R:  Self protection.
L:  Yeah, the power of self preservation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because you're, like -- it's a -- you know, it's scary to be caught in something like that. [NOISE]
R:  But, it really depends what it is.  I mean if -- if -- if there's gonna be a nuclear -- if there's a nuclear explosion, I mean, that's very different from --
L:  Oh yeah
R:  -- a couple of cases of anthrax, you know.
L:  Oh yeah, with the anthrax and stuff
R:  It depends.
L:  Yeah but you know what it's --I mean -- like you said, the anthrax, it depends on what it is or if it something like anthrax or --
R:  Or contaminated water
L:  -- nuclear explosion, or I mean you know -- you don't know what sick and twisted thing can be conceived in the mind of somebody like Osama Bin Laden you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, oh my goodness I mean [NOISE] Oliver North was ridiculed when he -- when he, panicked because Osama Bin Laden threatened him and [NOISE] you know when we -- and we I mean the -- the -- everybody put up one man to [inaudible] through ten kinds of changes, and now we see what Osama Bin Laden was capable of, and we see that the man was right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in panicking over having his family threatened by this guy.  So, you know you never know what sick thing can be conceived in the mind of one of those terrorists.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And the only thing that'll keep you sane, is knowing God is still in control.
R:  Well, I'm not really religious at all so that doesn't help me much.
L:  Well, you know what?  You don't -- you know what?  I'm not religious either; I don't believe in religion, organized religion.  But I believe --
R:  I don't believe in any of that.
L:  -- in having a relationship with God.
R:  I don't, so --
L:  You know, do you -- do you --
R:  -- that's not a consolation to me.
L:  -- do you at least admit that he's there?
R:  No, I don't believe in any God.
L:  Well, you're an atheist.
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty much an atheist but, um  --
L:  Oh, that should be interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  But you know, with life and everything I think it's all random, and I don't think there's a grand plan I don't think there's a puppet master I don't think that there's a reason for everything.  I think it's just -- it's just --
L:  Well, first of all there is no puppet master, because there are no puppets.  We're not puppets.
R:  It's just --
L:  It's like you said, we were given free will.
R:  -- random chance that we're just here --
