R:  Um, hello, this is Cathy Kelly.
L:  Um, hi, this is Barbara Cunningham.
R:  Cath.
L:  Okay, um, I'll let you begin.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, I'm sorry but I -- I didn't actually hear all of the question because the television was too loud --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I turned it off.  Um, was it how do you -- how do you create the differentiation between comedy that's in good taste and comedy that crosses the line?  Was that --
L:  Um, I believe it was how do you draw the line between acceptable comedy and --or bad?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah it was something about acceptable comedy and -- and something that might be just little over the line.
L:  Yeah, yeah
R:  Um, I guess it would -- part of it would depend on the situation you were in.  Um, if -- I think you would have to judge by the people around you.  Some -- if some comedy that might be in bad taste to some people may not be to others, so I think that might be -- be part of what you have to use to judge the difference.  Um, I personally think that -- that -- that, uh, comedy that makes fun of ethnic groups or, uh, religious groups is always in poor taste.
L:  I do too.  I -- I agree one hundred percent with that.  And also you've got to have, um, to take into consideration about little children too.
R:  Yes, yes.  Definitely children too.
L:  Hm.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm trying to think whether there's any, um ... hm, anything else that ... I mean, personally I -- I wouldn't ... I probably, like, Howard Stern in the morning, that kind of comedy I turn right off.  That just doesn't appeal to me where I know a lot of men might listen to it.  [LAUGH] But --
L:  Actually that's the way I feel too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I was just trying to think whether -- you know, whether I could think of anything directly other than -- like I said I listened to his show for about three minutes one day and that was enough for me.  Um, I know that -- I know that men sort of differentiate too, you know, like between men and women there's gender differentiation, you know, like, women might think some things are way over the line comedy wise where men don't [LAUGH] so I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's another thing that sometimes makes a difference.  Um ...
L:  Also too, with like in mixed company --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, like, uh, you know some people might not like -- the ladies might not -- like you said -- like to hear anything like that or what stuff like that.
R:  Right.  And where the men might be used to telling jokes that you know --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- the bathroom humor is what I call it.  [LAUGH] It's like ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, trying to think whether there's ... I mean, I -- I have a really good sense of humor.  I mean, people have always told me that I laugh at just about anything; silly things that aren't even funny to other people just strike me funny.  But I definitely don't like any -- any humor that offends people or --
L:  No, I don't neither.
R:  -- would make them angry or you know, like you said, and you have to kinda look at the age group and you know would it affect -- would it hurt someone's feelings from their religion or the way they look, or you know, anything like that.  I think that's when you cross the line.  That's what you don't want to do.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to do that 'cause you might be with someone and -- and they might feel different and then I think you need to let them know how you feel.
R:  Yeah, I definitely think so too and if you -- I think if you have offended someone by something you said you should definitely apologize right away and be more careful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the next time and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But I guess that's about all, all I have to say I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh gosh, I don't know what else to -- that we could add to that.
R:  Yeah, um.  I'm just trying to -- I'm trying to think also whether ... hm ... [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I really don't know.  I mean, I've been in office situations where you know, you've -- you walked by an area just as someone's telling like a really off color story or joke and you know, I kinda just keep walking pretending I didn't hear it but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I know that's another environment you have to be very careful in -- in offices you know, when you're -- you know, you have to make sure you don't kinda cross over the line with things there when other people might be around to hear it.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  But ... [LIPSMACK] I guess that's ... that's really about it.  [LAUGH]  I don't really ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- know of anything else to say.
L:  I don't know of anything else either 'cause I think you about said it all and --
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, you know, I'm not one really that, uh, does a lot of talking or anything but I agree with what you say about that and, um, you know there's a lot of school kids that -- that do, um, a lot of off color things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can hear 'em and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  That's right.  Yeah.
L:  And I hope that I have brought mine up that they don't do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah I hope so too [LAUGH] with mine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I just can't think of anything else.
L:  Um, have you participated in any of these other topics or discussions?
R:  Uh, no actually last week I just -- I was out both times that they tried to call me.  It was -- usually, I'm here most evenings but it just was a coincidence that we had two events last week and I missed -- and that was the first week we had -- I had signed up so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so this is the first one I have participated in.
L:  Okay, do we get -- I don't know if we had to talk the full ten minutes or --
R:  Oh, I -- I missed that about the ten minutes.  Are you timing or --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I wasn't either.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I didn't -- I didn't know whether we had to talk the whole time or -- or they would let us know when to stop or [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay I thought I mis- -- I thought you were from ...
L:  No.
R:  Now, I understand, okay 
L:  No just, uh, randomly selected.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  This is the first time I've talked to anybody.
R:  Yeah, me too so ...
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- I don't know whether someone somewhere is timing us or not.
L:  Yeah, I think they're recording it to see what, you know ...
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Um, well let me think if I can think of any other situations or, um, [LIPSMACK] ...  Gee ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  Oh, if you were -- okay, like, you were young and -- uh, young and school ch- school age --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- okay, and you were alone on a date or something like that and you were wi- uh, with your date and, uh, you were with a group of other people and they started, you know, talking and stuff like that about, uh, and making fun of different people of different race and stuff like that, do you think that you would speak up?
R:  I -- I -- I guess it would depend how well I knew the people.  I definitely wouldn't be laughing along with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... I probably, if I could, either would just walk away from it.  I -- I guess it depended how well I knew the rest of the group. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If it was a group I knew really well I would probably say something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it was a group that I had just met, you know, or didn't know many if any of them, just friends of my date's or whatever, I would probably just sort of keep quiet and I guess by my quietness hope they knew I wasn't ... you know happy about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think some things like that goes on, you know.  There are some school children that doesn't -- they're afraid to speak up.
R:  I think so too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's definitely and I know when I was school aged I was very shy.
L:  I was too. [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] probably -- I probably would have just sort of kept silent unless they were really good friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I probably would have said, "Well, can we talk about something else?" or you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think it's right.  But would you probably have done the same thing, I guess if --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [inaudible] I was real, real shy and you know a lot of them -- not only that would be joking and carrying on about body parts and stuff like that and you know -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know and you go uh-oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  I would have been very embarrassed by that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I would have too.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I know sometimes even just -- you know, you're with adult friends and we have one friend in particular although he's a very, very nice person, you know he'd do anything for anybody, will sometimes -- now, he doesn't call people, like, by racial slur names --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- but every once in a while if our group is together he'll tell a joke or something, you know, and as much as he's a really great person, there are a couple of us in the group that just kinda cringe you know it's, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and immediately we change the subject.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- but, I mean, he would never call anybody by a -- you know. a racial name but sometimes he'll repeat jokes and things --
