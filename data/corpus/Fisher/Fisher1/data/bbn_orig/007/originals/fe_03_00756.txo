L:  Hi, my name's Mark.
R:  Hi, my name is Denny.
L:  Hi Denny.
R:  Hi Mark. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How do you tell between, ah --
R:  Is this, [LAUGH] well, whatever makes me laugh outright and the other one makes me, sort of, hold back. [LAUGH] Or go agh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but what about, er, humor that makes you laugh and, er, you know, I mean, it's acceptable in different circumstances, right?  It depends where you're with -- I mean, who you're with.
R:  I was thinking mostly about the comedy channels that we watch sometimes.
L:  Gosh, I don't watch that much TV any more.  I used to watch Get Shorty.  There's a good example.  Are you familiar with, er, oh, what's that guy?  Really short guy, was in War of the Roses.
R:  Ah, I don't know.
L:  Um, argh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What was his name?
R:  Ah, I don't know, is he a comedian?
L:  Yeah.  Really short, bald guy, funny as hell.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  De Vito -- no --
R:  D- Danny De Vito?
L:  Danny De Vito, that's him, right?
R:  That must be it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, he's really funny.
L:  Danny De Vito, um, John Travolta, Rene Rousso, ah, a couple of guys like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Great movie.  Have you seen it?
R:  No, I don't think I have.  I remember trailers about it.
L:  Oh, it was -- it was really good, Get Shorty.  Check it out.
R:  Yeah.  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But um, it was hilarious, but ah, right at the end of the movie, [LAUGH] right at the end of the movie John Travolta's, like, ah -- ah talking about how Danny De Vito isn't suitable for the part because he's too short.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, he says it right out, he says, "He's too short and he can't play the part of a bad guy who's calling a gun and supposed to shoot somebody else, etc. etc".
R:  Mm.
L:  And it was funny as hell, but you know, at the same time it was, like, wow, that's kind of fresh.  It was different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, all the humor before is, like, really artificial but Danny De Vito is incredibly short, I mean, it's obvious, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But nobody ever plays on that.
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah, but th- he can make fun of himself, that's wonderful.  A wonderful talent.
L: [MN] Yeah.
R:  I think comedy in general is really important because, gosh, if we couldn't laugh, it -- it doesn't actually matter to me if there's bad taste or good taste.  I think it's important to have them, irony, the humor.
L:  Well, we're talking about acceptable versus non-acceptable.  What's an example of not acceptable humor?
R:  I really don't think there is an example. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I- you know, I mean, may be Beavis and Butthead.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  But I don't even think that's not acceptable.  I mean, you have to experience it --
L:  You, know, I stayed away from -- I stayed away from that for the longest time and today I came home from work and I was exhausted, I turned on the TV and there's Beavis and Butthead do America.
R:  [LAUGH]. Right, so, then you can switch --
L:  No, I plonked myself down and I watched a portion of it.  It was actually kind of funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just really didn't appreciate it when I was growing up.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  It wasn't my kind of humor back then.  I thought I was too smart for it.
R:  Well, I grew up in the days of Lenny Bruce and that was, you know, he was really unacceptable at the time.
L:  Lenny Bruce?  What kind of humor did he do?
R:  Well, he was, um, a very cynical man.  He lived in Hollywood and he became, um, a heroin addict and I don't know if he died of an overdose of heroin, but he was, like, stretching the boundaries.
L:  Hm.
R:  Kind of like what Janice Joplin did with -- with rock music. 
L:  Hm.
R:  He was doing that with humor.  He was one of the first bitter comics.
L:  Lenny Bruce.  Have you ah, huh ...
R:  Yeah, he's pretty famous, if you're ever going to do any research on comedy, he's one of the early wise guys, I guess he would be, you know, Sid Caesar.
L:  Would be who?
R:  Si- have you heard of Sid Caesar?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH] Where did you grow up?
L:  [LAUGH] I grew up in India.
R:  Oh, so no wonder! [LAUGH] These are all Los Angeles people. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.  No, um, I'm -- I'm forever jotting these names down because I've been looking for the good movies to see lately, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, Sid Caesar did a lot of live TV in the fifties.
L:  Sid Caesar.
R:  Yeah.  C.A.E.S.A.R.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, he still does some things, but he's an old man now, but he -- you know, he was so fresh and funny --
L:  No, go on, go on.
R:  And op- actually the opposite of Lenny Bruce.  Lenny Bruce was dark and angry and bitter and cynical.
L:  I've got a really good example of unacceptable humor.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How about the Osbornes?
R:  I -- you know, I haven't watched that.  I don't -- I -- I -- I'm not into -- I don't know what's going on there.
L:  Well, I don't know what's going on there either because it's just not funny as far as I'm concerned, but here's this family, with, um, you know, Ossie Osborne is the dad and ah, you know, swearing up a storm and on one level it's kind of cool because he's, you know, he's honest, he's up front, he's forthright, I mean, there are no- there's nothing hidden.  But at the same time, there's -- I mean, it -- it's kind of not funny.  It's funny because it's shocking, I mean, people watch it because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's different from the norm, right?
R:  It's off putting, huh?
L:  -- new.
R:  Puts you off instead of takes you in.
L:  Well, it puts me off.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I find it unacceptable.  Why do I find it unacceptable?  Because here's an old guy, Ossie Osborne, who's gone through hell and back, I mean, there's something, I -- I don't know, is there -- is it worth -- I mean, that whole thing of losing -- of -- of having innocence for a period of time and then losing it and sort of, slowly developing a sense of maturity, a sense of how things really are, is that really worth anything?  I mean, is that period of magic innocence really worth anything?  And, you know, if -- if Ossie Osborne has been through hell and back, is that up front with everybody.  I mean --
R:  You mean, does it make any distinctions in his relationships?
L:  Well, yeah, I mean ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is he -- is he -- you know, are his kids, do they still have that?  Or, you know, do they sort of, lose it, does it become --
R:  I would guess -- from what I've read, I would guess you're right.  They have lost it and they never had it actually.  But I've actually never heard these people talk.  I've only read about them in the newspaper.  So, um, [COUGH] I think acceptable is what draws you in and unacceptable is what puts you off.  So, in that case you could apply it to just about anything.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so for different people, it's different things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Entirely.  What the hell's the topic, again?
R:  [LAUGH] Comedy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The line between --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- acceptable and unacceptable.
L:  I'll tell you what's unacceptable, Jerry Springer.
R:  Okay.  But that's not comedy.
L:  Oh.  I don't know, I mean ...
R:  You think that's comedy?  I don't think that that is comedy.
L:  I don't know.  When I watched that, I sit there, you know, half turned off, half roaring in laughter going, oh my God, this is incredible!
R:  Mm.
L:  And you know, slightly disgusted at myself for actually leaving the TV on for those thirty more seconds.
R:  Yeah, but that's another distinction, isn't it?  Laughing at and laughing with.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, if you laugh -- I mean, I just remember this one guy that was on Jerry Springer, I couldn't believe it, he was ah, [COUGH] a neo nazi person who was old and dying of cancer right there on the show.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, it was horrible.  And I didn't feel engaged at all in that, and, you know, that was just people who laughed at that in the audience, they were laughing at this poor guy --
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that's unacceptable.
L:  You know, I'd agree there.
R:  Yeah.  But I think, that, you know, the best kind of humor is the kind that really gives you a -- an insight and it can do that because it pulls you in.
L:  [SIGH] What do you do for a living?
R:  I'm a teacher.  I teach college, English as a second language.
L:  Cool.  Where?
R:  In, um, California.  Northern California.
L:  Awesome.  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh.
L:  How's California weather?
R:  Well, it's very, very foggy here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In the winter, so we're having our foggy days right now.
L:  I like that.
R:  Yeah.  Are you snowed in?
L:  Well, we just went through our period where we had, like, minus thirty five wind chill, and ah ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Have you ever been up here?
R:  Well in -- not in the winter time, just in the summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Ours are beautiful, you know, the summers always make this place, like, heaven, I mean, it's all worthwhile.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, then winter comes along and it's hell.  It's kind of reversed, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I lived in New York City for seven winters so I know what that is like, but ...
L: Oh my God.  In the city?  That had to be real hell.
R:  [LAUGH] It wasn't as bad, it -- you know, the first snowfall that I was there, my friends took me to Central Park before anybody had walked on the snow.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, and it was so beautiful.
L:  How big is Central Park?
R:  Um, it's about, gosh, let's see.  It must be more than a hundred blocks long -- long city blocks, ah, going north to south and then east to west, it's -- it could be between one and two miles wide.  I can't remember the --
L:  Hm.  How long have you been a teacher?
R:  Since nineteen seventy. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really.
R:  A long time.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  What do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a programmer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I work in a -- I work in a research department, um, up here in West Group in Minnesota, West Publishing, West Group Thompson.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, it's kind of funny 'cause we're working with natural language programming --
