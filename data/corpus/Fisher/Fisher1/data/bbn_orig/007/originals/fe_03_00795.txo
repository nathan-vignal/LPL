R:  Hi, this is Diane.
L:  Hi Diane, ah, my name's Trina.
R:  Hi.  Ah, so, um, opening our own business ...
L:  Yes.
R:  What kind of business would you open?
L:  Well, um, I -- I was just thinking of it when they brought[?] the topic, and, me, maybe like a bookstore, or, um, like, a place, like, a video store, like, but not like Blockbuster, more like a independent film type video store.
R:  Oh, that sounds cool.  Yeah.
L:  What -- what have you thought of?
R:  Um, just with the thirty seconds I had [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to think about, um, I was thinking maybe a travel agency, something like that.  Um, I really like to travel and --
L:  That'd be cool.
R:  -- yeah.  I was thinking --
L:  Like, what kind of travel would you specialize in?
R:  Um, maybe overseas travel.  I was thinking, I kind of like languages and I was thinking maybe that would be a way to, um, maybe for myself to travel [LAUGH] more [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, you know --
L:  You know, you have to check out the places you're going to send people to.
R:  Y- yeah, so, I don't know, it seems -- I mean, I've never really thought of myself as, um, business oriented, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I- I wouldn't know.
L:  Me either.
R:  [LAUGH] I wouldn't know how to go about it. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But maybe if I had someone who was a little more business smart, you know, I could at least, ah, you know, maybe use some of my travel knowledge --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but um, a bookstore is cool too though.
L:  Yeah, you know, it's -- I mean there's always -- it's always cool when you find, like, a -- like a nice little, ah, like, neighborhood book store and, you know, um, I don't know, used book store, I guess, especially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess my one concern with that would be that, you know, it probably isn't the best money maker, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, 'cause money is no object [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, it seems like these days with book stores, I mean, you can do all sorts of side things too, like, you can have a little coffee thing going --
L:  True.  True.
R:  -- and make money with that, and ah --
L:  Yeah, I'd do that, and I like, like, I've seen[?] you know, try to make it like a -- like a real community bookstore, I guess.
R:  Yeah, instead of one of those huge chain bookstores.
L:  Right, right, so that you kind of like, know your customers and you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you have, like, groups meeting there and stuff.  That would be really cool.
R:  It is cool, yeah, like, have all the clubs, things like that.  Yeah, my dad, um, ah, my parents live near, kind of a local bookstore like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think it's really a chain, and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's kind of, you know, it's kind of cool because my dad leads, like, a book discussion --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- thing, and I don't know, it seems a little more personal, you know, that's --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- kind of lacking in businesses.
L:  Yeah.  Th- the video store, you know, it's -- there, um, I used to live, ah, in Philadelphia and there was this really cool little, ah, film place in Delaware and they would kind of have, like, it was real small, like, real crammed in, but they had stuff that was, like, really hard to find and I was th- I always like places like that because, you know, inevitably you're looking for the kind of movie that you can't find in a Blockbuster and it's annoying.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, plus th- the big industries are dictated by so many constraints.  It seems like whether it's, you know, a video stores or book stores --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, they're -- you know, they kind of go for the big corporation [inaudible] and so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, yeah, I know what you mean.  Like, I -- I don't -- I don't like Blockbuster [LAUGH] anymore.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Seems like everything is, like, censored, or, you know ...
L:  Right.
R:  It's just, um, it's hard to find, even like, foreign films, like sometimes --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, I like to think --
L:  Totally.  They just get rid of all the foreign film section.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know, it depends on how big the store is, but ...
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but still, I think they're kind of constrained by, like the bigger corporations are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- obvious restraints, so, yeah, that would be great to have the freedom to kind of choose what you want to provide to the community and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have more of a balanced approach, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's funny though, it's like, it's never -- it -- it's like, never -- some- something I've really considered about doing it and, you know ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Me neither, no, actually, I just never thought I had that option, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that would never be an option for me, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I know the kind of businesses I seek out and I want to patronize, so --
L:  Right.  I guess -- I guess that's part of it too, is like, you know, I would have to like the store -- I would -- I -- I wouldn't want to, like, you know, start, like, um, like, a beauty salon or something, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  That would be no fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, I know, yeah, it would have to be something that maybe you see in your community that is lacking, you know, so, yeah, that's kind of an interesting idea.
L:  Where would you, like, suggest for people they travel to?
R:  Oh, gosh, you know, I feel like, there are so many places I still want to go, but, um, I don't know.  I -- I've always wanted to go to Portugal --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and you know, different parts of Europe, I guess, um, Eastern Europe, too, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I mean, I've traveled -- I know France pretty well, um, and, you know, I could maybe use those language skills that we've t- maybe France could be --
L:  That'd be pretty cool.
R:  -- my main connection, or something like that, you know.
L:  You could do like, a special tour of France.  That could be --
R:  I could do, like, all the Francophone countries.  I could become an expert in all [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  There's um, there's a bunch of African countries that speak French and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like, Cameroon, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then other islands.
R:  I re- yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah.
L:  Caribbean islands and stuff, too, so you could, you know, specialize in French travel.
R:  That's actually a good idea now that we're talking about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Kind of weird for you to figure it out, yeah, that would be cool, because, like, there's kick back too and I've been there, but um --
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, and there's, like, parts of Belgium and --
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  -- Switzerland and definitely, like, French Africa would be very --
L:  Yeah, you could have, like, a all French inclusive tour, like, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even like -- like, a special language intensive tour.
R:  Yeah, I could even maybe h- help hook up with, um, like, study abroad programs, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe have kind of, like a, I don't know, have that be one of my businesses or something -- you know, part of my businesses.
L:  Yeah, that would be -- that would be nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and you know, that would be a good outlet for special French travel.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of interesting, I guess, I feel like I need to learn more languages, but, um, yeah --
L:  French is a good start -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  -- they have a pretty broad range of, where French is spoken.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Plus, I -- I actually went to, like, an independent travel agent once --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it was kind of cool, she had her whole office, um, like, just set up in her home, like, she could work out of ho- her home but she had established apparently all these contacts where she could get, you know, discounted airfares an- for people --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- and, I guess that would be a lot of networking which I'm not used to.  I would probably just need to, like, maybe find someone --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to help mentor me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Get me in the business.  But, um, I mean, that would be a very, you know, you would be able to work at your own pace, kind of, your own time line, just be kind of more like a independent contractor, you know, through things.
L:  Right.  I -- I mean, I've never, um, well, I took, when I was in college, I took, like, um, a trip with this, ah, agency in, ah, Slippery Rock, PA, like, um, on the western edge that -- they'd sponsor these summer trips to Austria every summer and that's basically just that's their main thing, it's like, this three week trip to Austria and they've been doing it for, like, thirty years and they, um, you can take like, a short college course while you're there and ah, th- they set some side trips and they take care of, like, yo- you know, the air -- the air fare and the -- you stay, like, with a family or like at a bed and breakfast type place and stuff, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
R:  This was all they do, then?  They just -- this is one company that -- or ...?
L:  I have a feeling they have to do something else [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, just because it would -- it would seem --
R:  But it's only the travel thing that you know about.
L:  Right.  I think -- I think actually I did get some -- some literature from them about some other things and there was, like, um, like a trip to, ah, Italy and there were -- there was --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- some kind of other Europe trip that was, like, in the winter, I think.  But the -- the Austria program is, like, their big famous program.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That they use.
R:  Now, that sounds amazing though, yeah. Wow, it has an option to take a class or something?
L:  Yeah, most people who do it usually take the class and it's like, it's like, ah, three college credits and it's, if you -- specially if you take, like, um, t- they took the German one and that was real cheap.  That was, like, only, like, a hundred bucks, like, three credits and --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- you can't beat that.
R:  That's super cheap.  Yeah.
L:  The other courses are a little bit more in- there's, um, they h- they hook you up with a couple of other Pennsylvania State universities --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they do actually some special courses through them, like, I think there's there's geography course and stuff, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --I mean, you could -- you could definitely have, like, a real specialized --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah travel agency.
R:  Yeah, that seems like a -- yeah.  From the little I know about the business it seems like -- I mean that's just a huge market too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, and France is pretty popular, you know and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] I think, but, um, people are always going to be interested in traveling there, learning the language to some extent, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so.  I don't know, because -- keen idea. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think -- do you think, I mean, it would do well, or ...?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I live in, like, the Chicago area, so --
L:  Oh, I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you really?  Oh, I thought --
L:  I live in Oak Park.
R:  I th- oh, in Lincoln park?
L:  In Oak Park.
R:  Oh, Oak Park, okay
