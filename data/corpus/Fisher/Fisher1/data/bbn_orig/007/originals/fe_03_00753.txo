L:  Hi, which one of us is going to go first?
R:  Oh, you can go first if you want. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, um, you can call me Alice.
R:  Okay.  Ah, my name is Bob. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  And the question is ho- what's [SIGH] what's the cut off point for -- on acceptable humor.
R:  Yeah, er -- I don't know.  That could be very different for each person.  [PAUSE] [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm trying to figure out exactly what th- what they mean by this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I guess it's, you know, how, you know, how dirty a dirty joke is too dirty, or -- or, how racist.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, is it okay to tell Polish jokes, or -- or -- should you be politically correct?
R:  Yeah.  Around those lines, but, how to tell, ah, I really don't know that one. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean, if a person says, "That's not funny", that's probably a dead give away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Cause sometimes you sa- you might make a joke that seems funny to you and it's funny to everybody else, but somebody just takes it the wrong way. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And then you stand there feeling stupid.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um -- I guess if you don't know your audience it's -- it's probably best to stick with really safe jokes.
R:  Yeah, if you know who you're talking to, you're less libel to put your foot in your mouth.
L:  Mm.
R:  Of course, even then, somebody ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well ... [SIGH]
R:  I don't really think there is a way to, cause no matter what joke you tell, someone or somewhere will be offended by it.
L:  [SIGH] Probably.  I'm trying to think of the, you know, the absolute blandest jokes imaginable and -- they're not funny, they're just boring. [SIGH] So -- if it's funny, it's going to have a little bit of bite to it and that's bound to offend somebody.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Otherwise you tell it and they just sit there and look at you.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know which is worse, if you offend somebody or if they just don't get the joke.  You know?
R:  Mm.  I'd put a line about even on that one. [LAUGH]
L:  And they say, "Huh?  I don't get it.  What does that mean?" [SIGH]
R:  And then you're trying to figure out how to explain it --
L:  And the more you try to explain it the stupider it sounds.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] So ...
R:  [SIGH] Acceptable or not acceptable.  How to draw the line.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like, ah, you know, do I te- tell the joke about how men are stupid, then does that offend you?
R:  It wouldn't offend me, but ...
L:  I mean, like, what a- what are the jokes, like, how do you get a man to exercise?  Put the TV remote on the floor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, if you told a dumb blonde joke, or something, you know ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Hm. [SIGH] Maybe we should just fill our ten minutes by telling [LAUGH] dumb blonde jokes and light bulb jokes [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, [LAUGH] or the most offensive things we can th- the jokes we can think of and say why we shouldn't tell them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, we are getting paid for this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, ah, like tonight, I was driving down the road, happened to -- a mail box jumped in front of me.  See, I think that's fairly funny. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Hit the mailbox --
L:  I had a tree jump out in front of me one time. [SIGH]
R:  I don't like it when that happens.
L:  No.  No, the car doesn't like it either.
R:  [MN] At least we know where to draw that line.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] I don't think anybody would find that offensive.  You know, th- they might find it a little bit old fashioned, but not offensive.
R:  Unless they have some kind of phobia of mailboxes.
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  They had a mailbox fall over and hit them on the head as a child [LAUGH]
L:  Or they're a postal employee.
R:  That's even worse. [LAUGH] I make postal employee jokes a lot because I know someone who's mother works in the post office.  She doesn't like it very much when I make them [LAUGH]
L:  My dad used to work for the post office and he used to tell post office jokes [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And also really offensive ethnic jokes.  Usually that he'd been told by somebody of that ethnicity.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, a j- joke that insults Jewish people would be told by a Jew. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  They -- they tend -- the people tend to tell the worst jokes on themselves, you know ...
R:  Yeah. [MN]                     
L:  Which is why Eddie Murphy is -- why some people think Eddie Murphy is funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I don't tend to go much for comedy, myself.
R:  Mm.  I like it a little bit.
L:  An- most of the jokes that I -- I like tend to be bad puns or things that are just so off the wall that -- that people go, "That wasn't funny.  Wh- what?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I- I've -- I've been told all my life that I have a weird sense of humor.
R:  I kind of like the stuff that's more, like, along the edge, cause it seems more, it seems just funnier.
L:  Yeah, I mean, there's a whole psychology of humor thing and what makes something funny is that it's actually painful, but we laugh at it because it's not happening to us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- an- to -- to be funny, humor has to be a li- little bit, little bit offensive or-- or there's just nothing humorous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean wh- wh- why -- why -- the olden silent movies, why was the classic joke, the guy slipping on a banana peel and falling down?  What's funny about falling down?
R:  Because it's somebody else.
L:  Yeah.  It's funny when somebody else falls down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not funny if you're the one that falls down and lands on your behind.  That hurts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, watching somebody else fall down is funny.
R:  [MN] Or like, a joke, you know, the old jokes where people say, you know, like, a priest and a rabbi goes somewhere ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it -- it just doesn't make sense if you just say a person and a person.
L:  No.  And if you say, you know, a -- a -- a -- a priest, a rabbi and a cowboy, you know, you're going to wind up in- [LAUGH] insulting Catholics, Jews and cowboys. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure that if you told a joke about a duck, you know, somebody who loves ducks would be offended.
R:  Yeah, Peter would be on you.
L:  Yeah.  What- what's that television commercial with the ducks?
R:  A- AFLAC.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Those are funny.
R:  Yeah, those are funny.
L:  Those are funny. [SIGH] But I'm sure somewhere there's a duck that's offended.
R:  [LAUGH] The ducks don't appreciate it.
L:  No. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Hm. [PAUSE]
L:  You know, it's hard to talk about a pre-arranged subject for ten minutes with somebody you don't know at all.
R:  Yeah.  It is a little bit.
L:  Right.
R:  Especially when something like this.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm tempted to just start telling jokes, but that's probably not what they want.
R:  [SIGH] Hm.  What is acceptable joke and what is not?  What -- what's the line between acceptable and not acceptable?  Er?
L:  Well.
R:  I was about to say, basically something that would offend somebody.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I think everybody has a fairly clear idea of what's politically incorrect.
R:  Not, like you said, it depends on who you're telling it to.
L:  Yeah, well I mean, if -- if you know you're among friends that aren't going to take it personally.  But if you don't know who you're talking to, then -- then you've got to keep it within the politically correct boundaries, you know, basically, the kind of stuff that they print in the Reader's Digest.
R:  And you can tell the same, you can tell a joke to --
