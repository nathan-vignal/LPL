L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Shelly.
R:  Hi, my name is Amy.
L:   Hi Amy.  Ah, the topic of the day was acceptable humor and where to draw the line.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I feel that, ah ... I think most humor is pretty acceptable except for when it comes to probably making fun of maybe, um, you know, ah, what do you want to call physically deficient people.
R: Right.
L:  And, you know, mentally retarded or something like that.
R:  Yeah, somebody's um ...
L:  I don't find any humor in -- in things like that usually.  I -- I've heard the jokes and the humor on stuff like that but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's always, to me, kind of, made me feel like it was in poor taste.
R:  Right.  I, ah, have a sister that's, um, has cerebral palsy and so that's for me too, if anybody that's got any kind of a handicap that I hear made fun of is just like, whoa, right there for me.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't care for it.  I have a son with diabetes, and um [SIGH] and I also have a cousin with cerebral palsy too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um, and then I- I've -- I've known people and had friends that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have physical deficiencies and um, they have to struggle so hard in life [SIGH] --
R:  Right, it's already hard for them without being made fun of.
L:  -- as it is. [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  It -- it's very um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] so, I -- I don't know.  I guess it's just such a turn off to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  People that like, uh, wait to -- it always bothers me when they've got um, different jokes or they make people, but it's always like, the bigger -- the bigger people on TV shows, right, they've made fun of it.  It's not usually about them or anything, it's not like the show's usually not about somebody that's a little heavier --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's usually almost always about the problems they have, or you know, being made fun of and everything. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I had a -- well when I was, um, twenty one I had my son and ah he was a perfect baby when he was born, he had a ten apgar rating in fact --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- and um, my best friend in high school, ah we had our babies, tog- you know, she had a son also at twenty one.  They're a month apart --
R:  Mhm.  Oh wow.
L:  -- and her baby was born with Down's syndrome.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] And um we've stayed in contact all these years, now we're talking twenty five years so it's a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and her son has grown now, same age as mine, twenty three, and ah, he's, of course will always be at home until, you know, he passes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um, it -- it's just such a tender subject with me because I've seen how she -- you know, I always had quite a bit of freedom when I was raising my kids and she never had any --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you know, her and her husband couldn't just pick up and go on vacation or go out whenever they wanted and me and mine could.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  And, ah, she really sacrificed a lot, you know, and, but you know, she says he's the most wonderful gift that she ever had, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I, I just feel like sometimes people take the humor to the limits --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I also don't like the um ... I don't know how you are, but what's that guy's name that's on real late at night?  I've seen his show once or twice.
R:  Ah, Conan?
L:  Ah, no, it's um --
R:  Craig Killborne?
L:  No.
R:  Letterman, Leno?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I li- I kind of like those guys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, this guy is super gross.  He's super horrible.
R:  Um, I'm not sure.
L:  Long hair, glasses, Howard Stern.
R:  Oh yeah!  Yeah, yeah, right, right.
L:  [MN]
R:  He drives me crazy.
L:  I do not like him.  I see nothing funny about that man whatsoever.
R:  No, he's wrong.  He's got a -- he's supposed to be married and everything and love his wife and all the stuff that he does on that show, so, no, it's not funny to me either, it's just a ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I watched it one night and I said, "This is such a waste of time and a bunch of trash".  I said, "I have never heard anything funny come out of his mouth on any subject as a matter of fact".
R:  No, me neither.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] And ...
R:  No.  It's disgusting.  I'm surprised they can --
L:  It's demented.
R:  -- yeah, I'm surprised that they can even show it on TV and have people that actually want to see it.
L:  Hey, I don't know old you are, but when I was growing up, things like that wouldn't be allowed anywhere, period.
R:  Right.  I'm twenty four so I'm pretty used to the stuff, I mean --
L:  Oh, okay, well I'm forty four so, add twenty to your age, you can imagine what it was like when I was growing up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, stuff like that had to be totally underground [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  I've got -- I've got two kids now, one's three and one's about to be two and I just whoa, I -- don- you know?
L:  I have a three, and a -- I have a two and three year old grand -- grandsons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I have a little grand daughter that was born the day after Christmas --
R:  Oh, that's good.  It's hard to turn on the TV and --
R:  Hello!  Yeah, because nowadays even on your -- your regular standard programming, even on the evening shows that come on early, they've got a lot of adult humor on those sh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kids aren't going to bed until eight or nine o clock at night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah, you know, they're really exposed to a lot of things that are just not good.
R:  Right.  And we get that out of Drew Carey Show, that one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, ah, you know what I'm saying?  Like, these regular sitcoms that, you know -- we used to sit down as a family and watch a lot of shows like ah Lost in Space and Leave it to Beaver --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and probably stuff you don't remember, maybe.
R:  I know Leave it to Beaver though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And ah, you know, those were good family shows, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now they -- you turn on the TV and it's like, oh they have to expose the children to all this type of humor and different things because it's educational.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Educational.  And it's like my dad would say, "Why do I need to know that?"
R:  Right.
L:  "If I'm not going to involve myself?  I've already decided that I don't want to be around that stuff, so why do I have to be educated about it?"
R:  Right.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I agree with him.  I think that he's right.  It's like, um, you know, there's just certain things that you just -- you don't need to be exposed to, because why are you exposing yourself to it?  So you can try to emulate it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [COUGH]
L:  You know, but um, I -- I just really feel that, you know, I like the -- my dad is the king of the one liners, this is what my husband calls my dad; he calls him the king of the one liners.  He's got this type of humor.  It is very, very funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's acute humor, and it's also witty and it will make you think.  Now, this is the kind of humor I like.  I really like that kind of humor.
R:  Right.
L:  And um, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's nothing gross, nothing that would, um, you know, turn you off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you would really -- it would also cause you to think, and at the same time you will be laughing and rolling. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, that's good.
L:  I like that real well, but [LIPSMACK] um ...
R:  We watch -- ah, my dad, he likes that TV Land and we watch a lot of the Leave it to Beaver re runs, the Andy Griffith's Show and all that stuff.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I -- I like those shows.
L:  Yeah, that's what I grew up on.  I grew up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I Love Lucy and Petticoat Junction --
R:  Mhm.  I used to watch that one with him.  I like that one a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.  Green Acres.
R:  [COUGH] Mhm.
L:  You know, those are the kind of shows I wish they still had and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to tell you the truth, [LAUGH] I don't know a whole lot about TV because ah, the only show that I ever watch is Fox News.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love Fox News, down here it's channel thirty three on cable, and ah, I -- I love Fox News because it really keeps me well informed, and I guess being at my age now, I'm more interested in world affairs, whereas when I was younger I couldn't have cared less.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  I was busy making a living.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, now I'm -- I really am interested and I want to know what's going on all around me and I want to be informed.
R:  Right.
L:  And I, honest to God, never watch another show except Fox News.
R:  No.
L:  I've looked at some of the um sitcoms that they have now, and I told my husband, I said, "Every single one of them makes me sick".
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I don't even watch regular TV at all.
R:  No.
L:  It's never turned on, the only thing I turn on is Fox News and the only thing my husband watches is sports. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, here we got a lot of cartoons. A lot of ca- --
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Well, even -- ah, Alabama.
L:  Oh, you're not [inaudible] in Florida?
R:  No, we get ah, they use -- my kids rent a lot of cartoons and I'll tell you what, even them, some of the cartoons they got nowadays for a kid, I try and keep my kids away from because they're not even funny.
L:  Oh!  I'm glad you brought that up.  Let me tell you something, I told my husband the other day, because sometimes he'll turn on a few cartoons and he'll be watching, because he's got two kids that are seven and eleven and I never even knew what cartoons were nowadays, because I haven't watched cartoons in years.
R:  Oh yeah, they're different.[LAUGH]
L:  Holy cow!  I was sitting there one day and I said, "This is a cartoon?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said, "You know what?  If I was a kid nowadays that would not even hold my attention".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, "I don't even know what a kid gets out of that", and ah, now, when I was a kid we had the greatest cartoons in the world.  We had Road Runner, Bugs Bunny --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Tweety and Sylvester.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah, Tom and Jerry, of course Tom and Jerry was, I think my number one.  I loved them.  And um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't understand when I was watching it, I said, "That's not even a cartoon to me".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said, "What the heck is it?"
R:  Right.
L:  It's not a cartoon.
R:  It drives my dad crazy because I got that Little Rugrats and it's supposed to be babies but they -- the- the- they do everything.
L:  Isn't it sickening?
R:  Yeah.  They get into everything, they're doing all this bad stuff and it's like, why do we want our kids watching that, and they're thinking it's funny and stuff and these kids are getting into trouble and then, what's my kids going to be thinking?
L:  Wh- when I watch it, I have watched several of those cartoons with my husband when he's been sitting here because I go, "Why are you watching that?" and he goes, "Oh, I don't know, it's just a habit".  Because when he has his kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the weekends and stuff, um, he watches it with them because this is what they want to watch --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I said, "That, I -- I -- I can't imagine that that -- that constitutes a cartoon".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And who calls it that?
R:  Right.
