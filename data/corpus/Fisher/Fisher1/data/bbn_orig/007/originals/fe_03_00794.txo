L:  Hi, my name's Sheryl.
R:  Hi, this is Chris.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Hi, good thanks.
L:  Good.
R:  Um, I don't know if I would start my own business, in fact, ah, my husband has done that, and that's pretty tough, especially in a economy that's n- really not certain.  You can't really depend on what you could make.  I don't know, [LAUGH] what do you think?
L:  Well, I've seen people running their own businesses too, and um, most of them end up working, um, a lot harder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at it than -- than the rest of us have to work for -- for a paycheck from somebody else.
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, you have to get into it because it's something you love.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, um, but they did say if money were no object.
R:  Well, that is true.  You have to work harder though, even, um, without, you know, having to depend on, um, that paycheck, you are going to work harder for it, though.
L:  Oh, that's for sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  That's true.
L:  But I still thought it was a really interesting question because I always had this fantasy life, back in, you know, back in -- idea in the back of my mind that, ah, it would be really, really cool to, ah, be running my own plant nursery.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Tree seedlings and -- and vegetables and perennials and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- helping people design their gardens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's the kind of thing, you know, where, you know [SIGH] if you could do it, um, on a schedule that didn't make you crazy --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and you know, already -- if you were already independently wealthy so you were just doing it for something to entertain yourself --
R:  Well, if it's just for fun, yeah, that's true.
L:  It would be, um, it would be a sort of -- that would be -- that would be a lot of fun because, ah, if there's anything in the world that, ah, looks like work but I consider fun, it would have to be gardening and playing with plants and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- growing things.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my old fantasy was, um, to g- to be into, ah, farming, [LAUGH] be self sufficient, so, but they -- they work very hard.
L:  Yeah, they -- they --
R:  But if you love it, then that's what you want to do with your time.
L:  It's the, um -- the complete self sufficient, ah, family farmer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Communal farm.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I suppose perhaps if you owned, or if you were made a gift of all of the property and all of the equipment and enough money to pay the taxes for ten years it might not even be that desperately awful.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] If you were doing it --
R:  If everything was taken care of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's true. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Because n- in none of that is it exactly the, you know, the work, because, yeah, sure it would be hard work and worry but it's the -- it's the finances and the -- the -- the, um -- the economic pressures that I think that make it a misery.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think there is a lot of pressure though, when you're working with the land now.  You know, there's the weather, I mean, when you don't have to worry about an income that certainly must take away ninety percent of the worry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, it would still be hard work I would imagine.
L:  Physically harder work than -- than most of us desk bound people can take, [LAUGH] or cope with.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a point. [LAUGH] Yeah, just taking a walk is an effort, that's true.  Yeah.  I don't know if I could, um, really imagine any other business though, if it, um -- working with the land is nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, my husband does something totally different with electronics and um, that's just so iffy, so ...
L:  Well, it's all iffy.
R:  But it's -- h- he enjoys it though.  I guess if you could just take away the money factor, it doesn't matter what you make, then ah, you know, you c- you can enjoy the customers and traveling around the world and meeting new people.  You could just enjoy that aspect of it, I guess, and that takes the pressure off [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to ah, having to, ah, really depend on it.
L:  That's quite a gift though, to be able to -- to -- to even think about doing -- just doing something that you -- because you love doing it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A friend of mine, um, restores and refurnishes antique furniture --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, he's very successful at it, but you know, he -- he -- he also works extraordinarily long hours -- but, ah ...
R:  Mhm.  And that's tough work.
L:  Yeah, he gets to be a -- you know, he -- he -- he is an artist and he gets to work with beautiful things all the time, but ...
R:  Mhm, and then you get to see the results of your labor when you're done with that project.
L:  Mhm.  But still, the downside of -- of that, because it is his own business that he started is, um, if he's got a lot of projects in at any one time, he'll work a hundred hours in that week.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I suspect that there were times when he was starting up, if he didn't have any projects --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you know, the bills didn't get paid.
R:  Right, right, that's the problem with having your own business.  Yeah, in the real world when you depend on that money, so, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that's hard work.  My sisters, though, are both really into, ah, or have been in the past, refurnishing antiques --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all kinds of things like that, and it's beautiful, but you know, it -- it's an art, it really is, but, ah, it's hard, it could be back breaking work.
L:  Well yeah, quite literally because, um, because you've got so much repetitive motion.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I know -- I know that just from the little bit I do on fixing up on my house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a, you know, ten minutes with the saw in one direction and my arms are exhausted and I have to rest for another day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  I even joined a gym.  I told them I wanted -- what I wanted was to be strong enough to do work around the house and --
R:  Oh, that's why you joined a gym? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that was a joke.  They didn't know what I was talking about. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's true.
L:  But then again, you know --
R:  Well, I figured if I really got going around the house, I wouldn't have to join the gym, but [LAUGH] doing what I need to do, but ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it -- it's hard, you know, when you're out working for someone else all day and then, ah, yeah, a lot of people start a business like that, they still have their own jobs --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  When they're -- when they're, um, trying to make that transition, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, start it at home and then they sit -- have to be up half the night packing orders or something.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, um, I know someone who was starting a home handicraft business ...
R:  Mhm.  Now, that could be fun too, if you enjoy doing that then you could go to a lot of craft fairs --
L:  Ah huh.
R:  -- and um --
L:  I- I --
R:  -- I've even been to, ah, tag sales around the neighborhood and ah, one older couple, or at least the woman, she's making little baby, ah, things, like baby blankets and things like that and she has her -- they have a little business card.  The husband makes something, I don't know if he makes bird houses or something like that, and the wife makes little blankets and other little things like that that they sell.  And, ah, you know, they have a business card and, um, maybe even a website, I don't know.  But, ah, that was a nice idea, I picked up, um, a little blanket for someone expecting a baby, and, um -- I thought that was very sweet.
L:  Then what, they go to -- they go to -- they go to yard sales and, or, um, swap meets and stuff and sell that way?
R:  Yeah, well, not too much now, but in the last few years I was going to a lot of tag sales.  That almost became an obsession [LAUGH] to find things, and ah, you know, I enjoyed that.  Sometimes you could really find some nice things.  But, ah, that was -- this older couple's little business, you know, with the handicrafts and I thought it was really sweet, and you know, they did a beautiful job on things.  It was really presented very well.
L:  That would be the -- that would be the way that -- that you could stand doing it is if it were, um, just kind of a s- supplement, um, you know, if they were, as you say, an older couple --
R:  Well, they got their writ[?] card --
L:  -- if they had social security and some retirement income and so that this was a s- supplement for the -- the luxuries of things.
R:  Right.  Right.  For the little extras.  That's right.
L:  The one thing I would think, if you started a business of doing your own home handicrafts, you would take the stuff that maybe that you and I do for fun and relaxation because we enjoy it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you'd end up turning it into something that you had to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it was work.
R:  Right.  See, ev- that would become work, what was fun is now work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have to produce so many blankets and build so many birdhouses.  But you know, if you enjoy it, then, um, you know, some people become, I don't know if I'd say obsessed, but, um, you know, they really -- once they start they don't want to stop it, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe that's the secret for a successful small business that you start like that.  You have to be that kind of compulsive type A person that you're not really happy unless you're working at something all the time anyhow.
R:  Right.
L:  So you might as well be doing it for yourself.
R:   Might as well be productive, right? [LAUGH] Make your time useful.  Ah.
L:  I was raised by parents like that.  I've spent most of my adult life --
R:  Whoops, excuse me --
L:  That's all right.
R:  -- someone just hung up the phone finally, excuse me. [LAUGH] Okay.  I'm sorry, you were saying...?
L:  No, no, no, I just spent my whole life learning to -- learning to goof off and not work all day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Well, I can, ah, I don't know, I enjoy my down time. [LAUGH] And ah, you know, I go out and work all day and then I can't really think of doing much else when I get home from work.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
R:  I'm not, ah, in the mood to take on other projects really, so I admire them when they're able to do that.
L:  Of course, I- I know people, also, who, um, I know a couple of people who are writers and who have full time day jobs.
