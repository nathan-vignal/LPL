L:  Hello, my name is Vicki.
R:  Hi, my name is Melissa.
L:  I would -- [NOISE] I would probably panic.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, I probably would too. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, this is nice; this is cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We're on a military base, so I have more fears of them attacking us, so ...
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- I would definitely panic.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  And I hear you have children.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  [LAUGH] They'll be my first scare.  [NOISE]
L:  I wonder if they'll ask us the next question or we can just sit here and talk.
R:  I don't know, I know we're supposed to stay on topic as much as possible but they really don't give you too much to talk about.  [NOISE]
L:  Where are you located?
R:  [NOISE] We're in New York, Fort Drum.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, and you've already had one scare up there already.
R:  Well, luckily I wasn't here, at the time when it all happened.
L:  Where were you?
R:  Oh, it was before my husband was in the military; we were down in Delaware.
L:  Do you have fear of him being shipped off?
R:  Well, he's already been to Afghanistan, so I already went through it once.  We're just hoping he doesn't go to Iraq next.
L:  Yes.  Yes, well, you live with fear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little bit more than the rest of us, don't you?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's more in your face the terrorism.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We can go with our daily lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And know it's a possibility.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But your husband's in that business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old are the little ones?
R:  We have a six month old and a two year old.  [NOISE]
L:  Wow.  Now, see, they watch their daddy go off and I have a twenty five year old son who I'm afraid is going to be drafted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then there's terrorism, it comes all back to that word, doesn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.  They need to give us another topic too.
R:  [LAUGH] Or at least, you know, put more to the question.
L:  Right. A's and B's.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  And this is supposed to last for ten minutes?
R:  They claim.  This is my first phone call so ...
L:  Oh, mine too, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess we're both new at this.
R:  Yeah, I've read everyone else getting their phone calls and having interesting topics and it's, like, well how did I end up with one that was so -- just blunt, and they were nothing more to it.
L:  Right.  Well, let's see what else we think of when we think of terrorism.
R:  Um.
L:  Um, you know they didn't say foreign terrorism --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they could be United States terrorists.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, like Oklahoma you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people terrorizing people.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, I mean in that case, we've probably done terrorism acts going to war with different countries ourselves and 
L:  Right
R:  In the past.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  We're over here in North Carolina.
R:  Uh.  We were down -- well, me and my mother were down at the marine base down there before at Cherry Point.
L:  Oh, were you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had snow.
R:  Oh, we have snow up here.
L:  No, but --
R:  Tons and tons and tons.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I suppose that our conversation's being recorded so I don't know -- I mean, I guess we should suggest that the topic needs to be a little more explanative.
R:  Yeah.  Put out there, how would you act or what would be the first thing going through your mind or something like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Right. What would you do?
R:  Um.
L:  Children would be the first thought, sheltering them.
R:  Yeah, first thing you got to figure out where they are and make sure they're safe then try to figure out what is going on.  [NOISE] You know, where is it happening at?  [NOISE]
L:  Do you need to take further shelter, do you need to, you know?
R:  Well, we're in an upstairs apartment so, it's where would we go to you know get shelter?
L:  Right.
R:  Anything could be flying through the air and just you know knock one of the walls in or anything.  [NOISE]
L:  Do you have family around you?
R:  Three hours away my mother lives.
L:  Ah, uh-hum.  So you just came by yourself with the babies and husband.  How about his family?
R:  His family is down in Louisiana.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  So, you're kinda by yourself there huh?
R:  Yeah, most of the time it's just me and the boys.
L:  So, let me ask a question, I think they'll ask you.  Um, how old are you?
R:  I'm seventeen.
L:  You're seventeen?
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, I'm forty four.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've a twenty five year old son.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what, as a mother being by yourself if that happened -- you know.  If you were around in New York when that did happen, what would be the first thing you would do?  Do you have a vehicle of escape?
R:  Well, yeah.  I would -- well, hopefully they wouldn't lock down the base or anything and then --
L:  Now, there's -- there's your support group.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I know any of the winners[?] and recent things where there maybe terrorism [NOISE] they've locked down the base and no one can get off or on.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it means there's a way I'd get back down to Delaware, you know be with my family, make sure everything's going good.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I guess basically try to escape out of whatever we just got done experiencing.  You know try to grab a grips of everything that had happened.  But if not, I guess we'd end up over at the family services building here on base with everyone else. Huh.
L:  Mhm.  I think that terrorism has really affected our economy.
R:  It's affected just about everything I think.  The way people think, [NOISE] the way they act with each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's supposed to tear us apart but in many ways it brought us all together.
L:  Uh-hum.  I don't know.  Example, we just had a -- a plant over here in North Carolina blow up.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-hum.
L:  Eight people died.
R:  Hm.
L:  Unfortunately, but if your first reaction is, was it terrorism?
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE] That's why my husband is an MP so he's at the gates, you know, checking everyone that comes in.  And I [NOISE] was asking him, would -- do they act any different to the people from the Middle East and stuff?  And he claims they don't.  But in my opinion this [NOISE] right being an American, if I was an MP I'd probably would question it a little more.
L:  Right.
R:  Just because that's the first ones that you would suspect even though now they're showing that it's blacks and whites and you know people right here in America that are involved with it too.  But, I guess it's because it you know most of it is pointed to the Middle East.  So I would question that a lot.
L:  Hm.  You know, but you think I keep thinking back to -- I can sit over here in North Carolina and play with my computer and I can do this ...
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  But, how long has your husband been in there?
R:  He's been in for almost two years now.  He was in training when September eleventh happened.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, I was a friend of [inaudible] because some of my friends had also been in training and I just knew everyone was going to be deployed and then two months after he got out of training, he got deployed.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I can go in my little world I see it on the news.
R:  Mhm.  But it's --
L:  It's not reality.  It's reality to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's not just -- I'm thinking about how is it going to affect the economy and you're thinking is, well, what are you thinking?
R:  [NOISE] Well, right now with Iraq, I'm thinking will he go?  How would it affect the children?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because even -- our older son took it hard when he went away -- when he went away for the training and, ah, he came back and he didn't want nothing to do with daddy; he thought he left him.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, [LAUGH] that's my biggest thing.  I can deal with being alone and being with the two children, raising them on my own, you know, 'cause I married into this.  This is what I got basically, you know; I understand that.  So my main concerns are how will all this affect the children?
L:  Right.
R:  And when they get older I just hope that things are better than they are now.  [NOISE]
L:  Do you have, uh, other young ladies over there, as friends?
R:  No.  The youngest ones I've met are like twenty five with children.  Most of them are in their thirties and forties with children at the same age as mine.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you might find somebody to talk to now.
R:  Well, I guess it's kinda hard because me being young, I kind of stick out of everything.
L:  Well, do remember, the terrorism has brought a lot of people back to church.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hadn't gone for twelve years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and went back two Sundays ago.
R:  [LAUGH]
