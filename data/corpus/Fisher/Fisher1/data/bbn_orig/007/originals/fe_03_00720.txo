R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Would you be calm or would you panic?
L:  I would probably [LAUGH] -- probably get excited first and then -- and then panic.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's me.  I usually stay calm 'til everything's over.
L:  Oh, well -- yeah -- well, that's kind a like I would I guess -- but after -- well --
R:  But then I go to pieces.
L:  Yeah.  After [inaudible] I'd probably start bawling or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I'm Sherie.
L:  I'm Bernie.
R:  Bernie?
L:  Uh-huh.  They call me BJ, so --
R:  BJ.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where do you live?
L:  In Ohio.
R:  Ohio.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Really.
R:  Can you tell?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I hear that accent.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what everybody says.
L:  Yeah, I get around it and I pick it right up again.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I know.
L:  Oh, I don't know this is the first time I've ever done this, so --
R:  Me too, me too.
L:  Oh really.
R:  When I had been looking.  Do you do big big savings?
L:  Uh, what do you mean?
R:  On the internet?
L:  Um, I -- well -- I just kinda -- you know -- into a little bit of everything on there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually, you know.  I do genealogy as my main thing.
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've got a friend that does that.
L:  Yes.  I've been doing it for quite some time and [SIGH] that's one of my main reasons for the internet was that, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It's, uh, a lot of information.
L:  Oh yeah.  Ha ha.
R:  Uh, I like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I go on big big savings, and I had been reading where everybody had been doing their phone calls.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you are supposed to stay on, um, until they end it, I think.
L:  Oh, is that how they do it?
R:  There's a recording.
L:  So, what do you do?  Just talk to one another all that?
R:  Yeah, um, their subject during a terrorist attack.
L:  Well, yesterday I had one on bio terrorism.  I had no idea what in the world that was even about, so [LAUGH]  --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, then they said on this one today and I thought, well, I'll try this one.  I don't know what it is. you know.
R:  Well, this is my first time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I figured they had been missing me because we usually leave here from work at three o'clock.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So, we had just run a little late today.  [LAUGH]  We have snow and ice.
L:  We did too.  We got a big snowstorm here yesterday.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, they cancelled schools and everything, so we was digging out today.
R:  Yeah.  That's kinda -- we've had more snow this time.  I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, a whole lot more snow.
L:  I'll bet.  [LAUGH]  Was it cold out?
R:  Terrorist attack.  I don't know nothing about terrorist attacks except September eleventh.  I mean --
L:  Well, that's the same as me.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you heard about it and seem about it and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was on the news and so forth.  I mean, you know --
R:  I think everybody panics.
L:  I think they would too.  I mean --
R:  I really do.
L:  -- you know, after that happening. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, everybody's edgy anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  Edgy.
L:  [MN].
R:  But, like I said, I kinda -- I'm always calm until after the fact.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then I go to pieces.
L:  Yeah, I would too.  I mean, it's just the idea of -- you know, when they had that anthrax was going around in the mail --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff, you know that feeling was kind of scary to open up a package you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And well, I did get a letter from, uh, from someone in the mail but here it was they forgot to put the return address on it; scared me to death. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Oh well, we even went as far -- we got us some disinfectant and every time we touched the mail --
L:  Did you?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Well you can never know, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause, you know, they passed each other somewhere --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  I -- I had a pair of gloves on and I tried to open that one package. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you never can be too sure.  Yeah -- I guess.
R:  But, uh ... well, hm. 
L:  Yeah, I wonder if they're listening or ...?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, I don't know if they record or --
L:  I don't know either.
R:  -- how they do or anything.
L:  Do they have to get an opinion won't they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  You'd think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I think this is fun though.
L:  Yeah, it is, it's different.  You could talk to different people.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I wonder how many you can talk to at one time doing this.
R:  I don't know.  They could do three way at lea- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everybody could have a ...
L:  [MN]
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  Uh, I was on the internet and, uh, they sent me a thing in the email -- someone did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it was like an invitation, you know.  It said ten dollars a survey or whatever.
R:  Right, do you do a lot of surveys and stuff?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  I do too.
L:  Yeah, I love them.  As long as I get paid for 'em, I don't mind it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  I've had some, where you enter -- and contests and stuff, and I never win none of those.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and I get the free samples and all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I did win a [LIPSMACK] fifty dollar gift certificate to Amazon.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, so I was really thrilled by that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I bet you was.  [LAUGH]  I would have been too.
R:  [LAUGH] I was really thrilled.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, you know -- a lot like um -- [LIPSMACK] what is it?  Do my points a lot.
L:  Uh-huh, that's what I do.  Yeah, I do that a lot.  I get, usually end up getting the kids Burger King tickets with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's easy.  I mean you can get those quicker, you know.
R:  Right, and uh, let's see -- my survey, do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  NFO --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I have done that for years in the mail.
L:  Have you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, not the one in the mail too much, I'm not much a, you know -- I don't know why -- I -- just --it's easier for me to go on the computer and do it I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, well I've done it since before they ever had that the comp- you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right -- right before the computer ever thought of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I know.  Uh, that's why with me and my genealogy, I do the same thing there you know.
R:  Yeah, I've got a friend in California --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Pat, who does a lot of genealogy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She does -- she's real good on computers.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, she's the one that taught me what little I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, you know I learnt myself basically, that's what I did, yeah.
R:  That's the best way.
L:  You know and that way [MN] [LAUGH] ... well, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, what you learn you should be able to retain you know.
R:  Remember.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's it.
L:  Yep.
R:  That's it, and that worm that hid, I think -- I don't know if I ever found where that come from or not, do you?
L:  Uh uh.  [MN]
R:  That hit Satu- wasn't that last Saturday.
L:  Is that what hit?
R:  Yep.  It was a worm.
L:  Well, you know what?  My computer went down last Saturday and we had to strip it down from [SIGH] amazing things and put it back up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We had, uh, [inaudible] wiped it completely out, all my files and everything and I am starting from scratch all over again.
R:  Oh, isn't that horrible?
L:  Yes it is.
R:  I hate that.  You lose everything.
L:  I mean, Windows, drivers, you name it --
R:  Everything.
L:  -- you know and all that.  And here me not knowing diddly crap about it and I'm trying to figure this out, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, getting mad at Texas [inaudible] for not telling me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  I was getting irritated real bad.
R:  The last I had heard, the worm originated maybe in Japan or somewhere.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, 'cause they had a -- it knocked ATMs and all out.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, the one I had, attached to my router and it was called XJupiter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know if you've ever heard of it or not but it was a website and it was sending me dirty pi- -- um, stuff you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And it's still doing it but they ain't in my web.  They're not in my browser now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're just emailing me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm trying to get that out there, so ...
R:  That's right.  It don't matter what you do.
L:  Oh, no, you still get 'em don't you?
R:  You still get it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it seems like they try to attach names, all these different names, you know, 'cause, like, I work with Sarah here at work and have friend Jennifer and I'll get -- from Jennifer, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like they're trying to get you to open it.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just -- oh, I hate that.
L:  I do too.  I don't like it, it scares me to death.
R:  Yeah, it does.  It does.
L:  Well, how long do -- do you know they stay on line or anything?
R:  Uh, from the way they talked on there it was, like, ten or fifteen minutes.
L:  Mm.  Well, I hope they let is know what we're doing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I want to make sure I'm doing it right.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, exactly.  Because I got on there you know and read all these people -- that's a good place to go where you find out about a lot of surveys --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff.
L:  Where's that at?
R:  Big big savings dot com.
L:  Well, I'll check that out, I've not been there.
R:  Yeah, and go in to the forms --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, like, it'll have, uh, deal discussions and rewards discussions, each point and surveys and stuff.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's how I found a lot of my stuff.
L:  I'll be darned.
R:  That I'd never heard about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  And you know it's so hard when you go to a survey.  It's not like I said before, some will pay you and some won't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  And then if you tell who it is, they get mad at you for telling, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Exactly.  I have went to the place where you preach -- I can't -- planet feedback.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never heard of that one either.  [LAUGH]
R:  You could go preach on there and they'll even send the company letter and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If you're having trouble with them, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ask you what you would like to do to fix this and all.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  That's a good place too.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, uh, the big big savings and you can find out what survey sites pay.
L:  I'll be darned.
R:  And all this stuff.  It's -- it's a really good place.
L:  Yeah, well I was -- you know -- I went to the search engine and pushed in surveys or something one time -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to see what they give me, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and gives you a lot of different ones on there.  It seemed like you really got to pick and choose --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  Nobody tells you this is good or that's bad you know or  --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I've never seen this company before and -- oh well, I'll give it a try, yeah.
R:  Well, yeah.  That's what I figured.  It can't hurt to try.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All they can do is not send us our money, uh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and it's through the university, isn't it?
L:  Is it?
R:  Uh, Pennsylvania, is that right?
L:  Well, that's good too, yeah.
R:  I believe.  And I do surveys through that, for, uh, Jonathon Baron --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's, like, on Thursdays at one o'clock.  You gotta log in at you know a certain time and be there and it's just like fifteen minutes.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, uh, they pay really good.
L:  Have you ever got anything from them?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, have you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  They pay really good, but that's on the big big save.  All these places that pay good on there.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because you've got hundreds of people you know doing --
