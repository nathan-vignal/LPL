L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. 
R:  My name is Angela.
L:  [NOISE] Mine is Tammy.
R:  Sandra?
L:  Tammy.
R:  Tammy, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, um, I'm from Kansas.
L:  And I'm right here in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about terrorism, huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what was the -- the question?  I was watching a movie and I didn't hear it all -- all of the question.
R:  Oh, he said something about, um, we're supposed to talk about if we think people would  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be panicked or calm during a terrorist attack.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean that would be kind of self explanatory.  Look at last year.
R:  Uh, that's what I thought.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  I mean -- 
R:  I think that.
L:  -- that -- I mean I actually had to sit there in the bed and cry you know.  I'm, like, this can't be happening here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Can't be happening here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's kind of a shock, feeling.
L:  Yeah it was, and I couldn't -- I just couldn't even ... [NOISE] you know imagine what the people were you know going through at the last moments of things like that.  I mean, that's kinda ... nobody wants to think about nothing like that.
R:  Really I know it.
L:  Right.  Other than that, it happened and it happened you know what I'm saying?  In my opinion it happened because I mean, hey, look who we have as president.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I think there could have been some -- something done you know -- somebody should have paid more close attention or something.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, yeah exactly.  I mean there's always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk about the CIA is so intelligent you know and everything.  Well, why didn't they know anything about that before?
L:  Yeah, you know then supposedly the FBI got threats you know [NOISE] prior to September eleventh and you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nobody acted on it or at least -- in, you know, in this country's eyes they didn't act on it or act fast enough.
R:  Mhm.  No, I don't think so either.
L:  Oh [NOISE] I mean, what else can you say about that?  A lot of people lost their lives --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, families [NOISE] are destroyed because of that and you know, I mean people have to pick up and try to move on.  I mean, that was real tragic.  That wasn't just you know your ordinary maybe hit and run accident or something like this.  This is thousands of people at -- at a time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I mean that ...
R:  Mhm.  It's devastating and now --
L:  I don't think this country would -- would ever be able to rest [NOISE] if always it's going to be in the back of everybody's minds now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean --
R:  And it's affected our economy you know, there's -- where I live there's lay offs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all over the place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ...
L:  Oh yeah, I mean the economy is down.
R:  Mhm
L:  Really down, oh, it's hurting now.
R:  It is.
L:  It really is.
R:  It is.
L:  'Cause I haven't been able to find a job for the past maybe five -- five months now.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And you know it's -- it's down.  It is affecting everybody.
R:  What line of work were you in?
L:  Uh, basically the general office.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know secretary or clerk, things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Cashiering and you know ... it's, uh, I don't know ...
R:  Hard.
L:  -- but this country wasn't prepared then and they wouldn't be prepared today if it happened again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They would not be prepared.
R:  We almost kind of wonder if there was some kind of a back plan, uh, you know -- okay we were never to go start war with Afghanistan and now it's all turned into you know the Iraq and all that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, was it -- was there like a back plan in the making for we need to get Saddam again, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  I mean, 'cause they started out with one minute you're looking for Bin Laden, they haven't found him, it's been a year later here.  You got you know -- just take guesses about where he is or is he alive, is he dead and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, now you know, it almost Saddam Hussein.  I mean they've had a lot of other people in between there, the Al Queida, I mean, who exactly are you looking for?
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly, yes.
L:  You know, I mean, you're looking all over these countries [NOISE] and not finding anybody.  There's a lot of innocent lives being taken which isn't -- you know, is not necessary.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, how could this country not know?  I don't -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unexplainable.
R:  Yeah.  I know, it's ...
L:  But you can believe Bush will be protected at all costs.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  At all cost.  While his country, his people and you know people who vote for him and stuff like that, you know, is torn apart.  But he's hiding securely.  Like okay will they really still come and get the person that they actually want because we are innocent, we had nothing to do with this ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at all.  You know we can't control -- I mean we can control it to a certain extent who we elect as president, but some of us know we may have made a mistake in who we elected.  I mean, what can you do.  You can't take it back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, but you don't have to continue to support it either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... I don't know -- I reckon -- I mean that -- well, I don't know.  I'm not really into politics.  I pay attention to certain things but this -- this terrorism thing, if this building has -- for one -- I can't imagine ever working in a building with that many -- you know floors.
R:  Oh, I know it.
L:  Kind of scary.
R:  It would be.
L:  And you know --
R:  I'm afraid of heights anyways and I think I would just be afraid to go work at that height.
L:  Yeah, you know, I mean ... they play it over all through the year -- all year long about September eleven.  You know, the stories over -- you know news stories, old stories ... it is just unimaginable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just unimaginable.
R:  It is.
L:  Oh, I saw it on TV -- I'm, like, okay, what is this, um, something from a movie or something.  I think --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- this better not happen here.
R:  I know it.  I just remember my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cousin calling me and she was, like, "Have you watched the news this morning?" and I was like, "No", and she said -- she was all crying and she was like "Turn on the TV".  So I turned on my -- like, oh my God.
L:  We saw every channel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Every channel.
R:  And then I sat there all day and watched it and then when my husband gets home from work we watched it all night and I watched it for, like, three days in a row.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was like I can't watch this any more, I'm just getting anxiety.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it makes me sick to my stomach.
L:  Amazing you know there is, like, all of a sudden all the large towers and things like that were probably the next targets in all these cities and I'm, like, okay we have a lot of that downtown here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, our news stations here you know are -- if Houston Radio -- no, 'cause if the country was all ready you can imagine -- do you think actually once [inaudible] would be ready?  No.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  And we were really worried here because we're the air cost capital of the world here.
L:  Really.
R:  So, yes. So it was just really kind of you know scary and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the base was in a -- like, really high security and all that and ...
L:  [NOISE] I don't know. I mean I -- I -- you wonder could -- could that --you know anything could have been done   I mean, is it possible something could have been done to stop it?  I mean, maybe to stop it -- like it was -- you know how it went down with so many lives being taken but I don't think they would have been able to stop it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- without somebody getting killed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean 'cause they let a lot of people in this country that were living right next door to people ... and doctors and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Plotting against this country and I'm, like, [several inaudible words] -- now you don't know who to trust.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't know.
R:  Yeah.  We almost wondered too if the, uh, plane that went down in Pennsylvania --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- or wherever, if that was shot down.  You know I mean ...
L:  [NOISE] You know they never said anything else about that.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they've talked and talked about how the passengers, like, overtook the terrorists --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and crashed it and all that.  But we don't know for sure.  I mean they could have got wind that that plane was coming to the White House and sent out an airforce one that -- or whatever you know --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- to go and knock it out.
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.  I mean, it's something that really, you know, can be discussed for hours and hours, you know, because --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah it could.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean the thing that I did not like was the medias concern is that they didn't focus too much on the Pentagon, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, New York City was hit the hardest okay, we agree, but you know what about these people at the Pentagon?
R:  Yes.
L:  You know they didn't really cover too much of that and maybe because it's the government you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is understandable but I mean I thought they should have gotten a little more coverage you know --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- besides just Manhattan.
R:  Yeah, I mean their families were hurting too.
L:  Yeah, you know, and nobody has heard all of their stories.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, well if they do -- whatever they do ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I know it.  So, how did you hear about the phone studies?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh, probably through my email.
R:  Yeah, internet.
L:  So I get so much of it 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Scams and things like that so maybe this one just got lucky I didn't delete it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So.  [LAUGH]  You know but ...
R:  I know.  I'm as stay home mom so I'm always looking for something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to make a little bit extra cash here and there and I -- I read on this.  I go on a bulletin board and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was reading about that and I was, like, oh, well that sounds kinda cool and ...
L:  [NOISE] I think I found it in my email or I clicked on it some kinda way, I don't know.
R:  I read something about how you can -- you'll get -- like, after three calls --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and, you get ten dollars a call and then I guess after that if you, like, get picked or something --
