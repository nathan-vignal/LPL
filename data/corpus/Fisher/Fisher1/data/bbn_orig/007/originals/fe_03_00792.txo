L:  Hi, my name is Lyn.
R:  Hi, my name is [inaudible].  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, ah, is this your first call?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Is this the first time -- can you hear me?
L:  I can barely hear you.
R:  Ah, hold on a second.
L:  Okay.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, this is better, I guess.
L:  That's better. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, is this the first time y- y- you get special call?
L:  What time?
R:  Ah, no, is this the first time you have special call?
L:  Yes, this is the first time.
R:  Okay, me too.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, in a sense. [LAUGH] I -- I actually got another one but then it was cut off or something, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, okay, ah, I don't really know what we're supposed to do.  Just talk --
L:  I don't either.  I think we're supposed to talk about if we, um --
R:  Want to start a business or something, but --
L:  Right, what would we start?
R:  How long are we going to talk to before --
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, just [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm not sure.  It never, it -- you know, I got my, um, information yesterday and it never really said how long we're supposed to talk.
R:  Yeah.  I- I don't see it anywhere, too.  Anyway, um, let's talk [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  Um, um, okay, maybe just a small introduction.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, um, I'm an independent consultant so I work for myself, ah, independently and I've thought about starting a business but, ah, I haven't looked into it seriously yet.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I am just a stay at home mom.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  I have one.
R:  Oh, how old is -- is it a he or h- she?
L:  I have a son --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's seven.
R:  Oh, seven.  Cute. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, have y- so -- do you -- have you thought about starting a business at home, or ...?
L:  I'm trying to actually find a job --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- where I can work at home.
R:  I don't --yeah.
L:  -- so, a home business would probably be sufficient [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- or it'd be a good idea.
R:  Right.
L:  But I have no idea how to start -- how to start one.
R:  R- oh, you mean start a home business, or ...?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so w- when you say home business, you are -- y- y- you're referring to working for somebody else, right?  Not owning your own business?
L:  Um, I'm -- yes.  That's what I'm referring.
R:  Right.  Okay.  Well I- I've no idea -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in that area.  Yeah, but um --
L:  I'm assuming the first place to look, though, would be on the internet.
R:  But, I mean, working at home, y- y- I mean, at least I have heard of -- of a few so called work at home schemes, which I don't know how legitimate those are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, if you are looking for those in the internet, I guess you should be a bit careful.
L:  I know, that's what I was thinking.  It's hard to find something legitimate.
R:  Yeah.  An- and especially if they ask you to pay for something first and then maybe there's a flak. [LAUGH]
L:  That's the, ah -- that's all I've been coming across, is, um, things that I would have to pay for.
R:  Yeah, it doesn't make sense, right? [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, unless you are studying for your own business and you had to invest in -- in the Kumons, or in -- in maybe knowledge transfer or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or-- or a franchise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know.  Yeah.  But -- but what if -- what if you want to start your own business?
L:  Well, I guess the first pl- if I wanted to start my own business, the first place I would look is on line, probably for government, um, like, funding.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because I know they have a lot of -- I don't know what you call those things, ah --
R:  Grants.  Yeah.
L:  Grants, yeah [LAUGH] they have a lot of grants out there for certain --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things, so I would look to see if I could find information on that.
R:  That's interesting, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's m- why don't -- why don't you do it?  I mean, there might be something that might fit your skills and -- and you might even be able to do it at home.
L:  I know.  I don't know why I haven't done it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, sometimes kids ... [LAUGH]
L:  I'm procrastinating, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] No, with kids around it's sometimes hard, I guess.
L:  It is hard.
R:  Um, well I don't know ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah ...
L:  What would you do?
R:  Ah, me, actually I've thought of a few things.  I actually, I- ah, first of all I'm not married, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, about to in -- in very soon, in a few years, and actually I'm looking at some franchises that relate to child tutoring.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you heard about Kumon?
L:  No.
R:  Kumon is like, um, math tutoring, ah, franchise.
L:  Okay.
R:  Obviously, is a -- is a math class, but, ah, the purpose of the class is not -- is not only to improve, um, just -- just -- just like your child, sort of catch up with the classes, but to go beyond that and then -- have you -- have you me- you may -- you may have seen those, um, I mean some kids who can just multiply, like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, you give them two numbers, thr- two, three digit numbers and they -- they can multiply like that --
L:  Right.
R:  Kumon goes into that quite a lot.  So they teach, um, sort of tricks and ways to think, so it goes beyond just doing math -- it -- it goes into thinking and --
L:  Interesting.
R:  and skills which I think is very helpful, so if I can make a business out of it, then it's going to be both, ah, fulfilling and rewarding, I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah-uh.
R:  Yeah.  So that's one of the things I'm looking at, yeah.
L:  And how do you spell that?
R:  K.U.M.O.N.  Actually I might be able to give you a website -- hold on one second.  Ah, yeah.  K.U.M.O.N. dot com.
L:  Okay.
R:  Kumon, yeah.
L:  And it's a math ...?
R:  Yeah, it- it's very much focus on math, but, um, like I was saying is, you know, so it is used a lot with thinking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, teaching a child how to think and then how to use -- I mean, the brain so that it is more st- stimulated.
L:  How did you find out about that?  Just ...?
R:  Oh, I just read in magazines and ...
L:  Oh really.
R:  Yeah.  It- It's like, ah, it's a franchise -- I actually read it in, ah, Inc, and I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, I.N.C. magazine.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, they talk about franchising and business opportunities and it's like -- actually if you want to work at home you might want to pick up another magazine called, um, Entrepreneur.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  They have advertisement about working at home, ah, smart jobs, ah, that kind of thing.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- I would assume that would have been for, like, some, you know --
R:  No, not really big scale, no.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH] Or you can start with their website, entrepreneur dot com.  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh, dot com.  Okay.  That's cool.
R:  Just check it out and, ah, because those kind of information ...
L:  That sounds interesting.  Now, are you in the United States?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  You are?  Where are you?
R:  Oh, Ten- ah, Nashville, Tennessee.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm out in California.
R:  Oh.  I didn't know they are going to call overseas too?  I didn't know that.
L:  Um, I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I know when I got on the web -- I just signed up, like, last night, so I'm very surprised that -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I got a phone call already.
R:  I called about, oh, I -- I signed up a week ago and I just got this phone call today.
L:  Really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I guess, I don't know -- [LAUGH]
L:  It's amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, um ...
L:  Yeah, I don't know really, how much -- how --
R:  Let me look at the email again. [LAUGH]
L:  -- much we're supposed to talk.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Just be ready to [PAUSE] says in real live conversation have specific -- specific goals, to give and get -- to get or give information --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mm.  There's no specific information you want to give or get --
L:  No, no specific in the email, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But yeah.  Um, the hyp- we were supposed to talk about hypothetically --
R:  Yes starting --
L:  Um, if we wanted to start our own business.
R:  So, for me would be --
L:  And money wasn't an option.
R:  Yeah, so m- the Kumon thing would be th- the first choice.  I mean, helping --
L:  Ah huh.
R:  -- you know, fr- --
L:  Well anything in franchising, I think would be -- would be good, like, even, um, they said money was no option, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I would think like a McDonalds, or --
R:  But then, I mean, i- it has to be something that you would be passionate -- passionate about, right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but that you --
L:  Right.  Well, I like food.  Maybe a Chili's restaurant -- I really like food, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good -- Chili's restaurant -- um, Mexican please. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, Chili's, you know, the hamburgers and pitas and --
R:  Okay, so, if -- ah, do you include Taco Bell?
L:  No, I don't like Taco Bell, so --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay you know that's --
L:  Maybe del taco, but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do Taco Bell.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.  No.  Or, like a, um, or like a store, you know, like a target store.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, they said, like, you know, for franchising, I don't think they franchise those though.
R:  No, I don't think -- yeah, but you can -- you can get a seven eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A Bin Inn store.
L:  Yeah, or out here they call them am pm's so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  I think they're just different chains.
L:  Yeah, different -- same thing different chain.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, different chains. [LAUGH]
L:  They do all the same stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah, something like that would probably be a good, um, business.
R:  Yeah. Actually th- I- that's not for me. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  No.  I -- I don't see myself owning a s- like a grocery store, or a convenience store, I -- I --
L:  No?
R:  I don't know, it's just I -- I think I -- I want to do something more, like, the Kumon thing really catches --
L:  More educational?
R:  -- sort of, um, being a bit more beneficial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To the children. So --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  I mean, like, this is personal choices, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But for me, if I'm going to go into business I would choose something that is at least a bit useful. [SIGH] Yeah.  I mean, groceries is definitely essential --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, I mean, it's not personally fulfilling for me, so ...
L:  Right.  See I would be in it to make money. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, um, I would too, [LAUGH] that's what I need, to make money -- money, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, a- are they going to cut us off, or ...?
L:  I'm not sure.  I don't know.
R:  And, I'm not sure if we hang up now then are we going to be credited, or what?
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] How long have we been talking?  Five minutes?
L:  Maybe five minutes.
R:  Or more, yeah.  I don't know.  Ah, the topic is, if you want to start a business, okay, what are the difficulties, I guess, one of them --
L: Well, we talked about franchise.
