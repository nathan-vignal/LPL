L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi.  I'm Judy.
R:  Hi, it's nice to meet you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Nice to meet you also. [LAUGH] 
R:  And, um, well, they want us to talk about, ah, starting a business.
L:  Yeah, starting a business.
R:  Um, really that's not been something that I've very much thought about, because I'm not sure if I would be very good at being a business owner.
L:  Yeah?  Why not?
R:  Well, I'm not a- as disciplined as I should be, let's just put it that way. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  My self discipline, um, I don't know, I -- they said that money would be no object and -- and -- I've -- this is the second call that I've done today --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was th- you know, af- the first one was, like, ah huh, [LAUGH] and then I thought about it for a while, and I would think, maybe, um, you know, a non-profit thing would, if money was completely no object --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a non-profit thing would be good, you know, maybe a, um, a shelter for animals or something like that, I -- but I'd probably end up bringing them all home.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, well, let me see.  If money were not an object I would think, I would really like to do some sort of, like, importing business --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, um, I really enjoy traveling, world travel, and --
R:  Oh, hey.
L:  -- yeah, maybe finding ah -- you know, going and finding neat, um, cultural artifacts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things and bringing them back and selling them in, like, a little store.  I think that would be fun.  It'd involve things that I'd enjoy, traveling, and --
R:  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Where would you go?  Everywhere?
L:  -- different culture.  Oh goodness, yeah.  Everywhere, um, probably, you know, countries where people don't go too often, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like non -- non European countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, maybe African countries or South East Asian countries, things like that.  Um, you know, where, kind of like a Pier One Imports, only ...
R:  Oh, I love that place. [LAUGH]
L:  I do to. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, that s- that sounds -- that sounds like a really good th- good thing to be doing.
L:  Yeah, but I like the non-profit idea also.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yo- you enjoy animals?
R:  I love animals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.  I have five cats.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  It might be just a cat, [LAUGH] only one -- the only thing, like I said, I might just have more at home than [LAUGH] I would at the shelter. [LAUGH]
L:  There's actually a -- a place near where I live here that actually does that, they bring in a- th- it's kind of a home, but it's a huge area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's acreage where they bring in -- actually exotic animals who, you know, for whatever reason, zoos can't keep them anymore --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so they started bringing them to their home and they've kind of got this exotic animal [inaudible] --
R:  I-- I -- I did consider that too, and I- I'm not sure about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I l- you know, I really love animals, I just don't know if I could treat them as wild and not try to make pets out of them.
L:  Yeah.  And I think it'd be difficult to at least -- they live -- you know, next to a tiger and lions and [LAUGH] but, yeah.
R:  It's interesting.  I have two --
L:  -- not in your home, but, like, in your back yard.
R:  -- small children too, so that would always have to come into consideration in any -- anything -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- any kind of business I would get into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'd have to be something that could be worked around soccer and school and everything else. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  That's wh- why I thought that maybe something like that would have a more flexible schedule, but I don't know, I mean, animals need as much of your time as kids, or more, um --
L:  Yeah.  But as a business, maybe, ah, have other, you know hire other people to --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- to do the [LAUGH] leg work on it.
R:  Yeah, you could definitely um --
L:  Money's not an --
R:  -- do some good there, I believe.
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
R:  And you wouldn't be worried about traveling all over?  Have you traveled before?
L:  Yeah, I have actually, um, I have just returned from living overseas for a few years and did a lot of traveling --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- in Asia, so, um, I felt fairly comfortable in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in that aspect of it, now the le- the legality of, you know, all of that would -- I don't know anything about any of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, it's just a dream, I guess.
R:  I've al -- yeah, I've always wanted to travel.  I think Australia would be one of the --
L:  I think it would be too.
R:  -- one of the places I'd like to, ah, to go, but I definitely do love all the, ah, the African and um, African cult- culture and the art.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, some of the Middle Eastern stuff is beautiful, the rugs and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- all the different things that you can get there.  I think you could make a -- a big profit really.
L:  [LAUGH] I think so, probably.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  So, that's -- you know, another side of it I suppose.  But I don't know if I would necessarily be good at the managing of the business --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- ah, my father in law owns his own business and I know, it's -- it's a never ending task for him to keep, you know, all the different aspects of the business in order, you know.
R:  That -- that sounds a little daunting to me, too, but if money's no object you can always hire people to do everything, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that's -- that's a very far fetched concept for me, money being no object. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Me also.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, if money were no object I don't know if I would open a business.  I'd just ... [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, there are other things I would like to do too to earn money. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, but, but, um, I -- I -- that is something, you know, I would to ha- I would love to have that problem [LAUGH] to be -- to have to figure that one out, in truth.  I guess --
L:  [LAUGH] I agree.
R:  -- the check's in the mail, I suppose. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that would be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Speaking of animals, my dog keeps coming up and pawing at me --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he doesn't like it when I talk on the telephone, so --
R:  Oh, neither do my kids, so [LAUGH] It -- they'll be pawing at me any time, I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We- were having beautiful weather.  I opened the windows and saw my cats all looking out and trying to see which birds they want.
L:  Ah, yes.  My dog's just outside chasing the birds around our back yard.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, w- would there be a -- there would definitely be a market in your area for -- for the things that you would want to bring in?
L:  I don't know that actually.  Um, I live in a college town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so probably not here because college students don't -- kids don't have extra money for that sort of things, but maybe in another -- maybe in a different part of the States, possibly.
R:  There may be professors and [LAUGH] and people that work at the college might enjoy things like that.
L:  That's true.  I didn't think about -- about them.  I'm trying to think if there's anything like that here, besides Pier One --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I can't think of anything in spec- specifically, so --
R:  Sounds like i- it would be -- if you could be buyer for, um, well, that's not owning your own business, or if you could, ah, be someone that goes and finds things for museums and stuff.
L:  Oh yeah, that would be really neat.
R:  [LAUGH] I could think of all kinds of things.
L:  [LAUGH] I would enjoy that.  I could too, I would just be -- it would be a great job to have, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- probably not where I'm going to get any time soon. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, well we at least -- we get le- at least we get to talk about it [LAUGH] and do a little dreaming, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's always nice.
R:  Well, it was good talking to you.  I --
L:  It was nice talking with you also.
R:  -- I don't believe we have a time limit, but I have kids calling.
L:  I understand. [LAUGH] Well ...
R:  You take care, and good luck.
L:  Same to you.
R:  I hope you get to travel soon.
L:  Oh, thank you, and take care of those cats.
R:  Okay, I will.
L:  [LAUGH] Bye bye.
R:  Bye bye.
