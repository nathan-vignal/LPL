R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Lynette.
L:  I'm Andrew Hanson.
R:  Hello, Andrew, nice to meet you.
L:  Hello, nice to meet you.
R:  Okay, let's see, the topic of the day is how do you draw the line between acceptable and a sense of humor?
L:  Yeah, it's kinda hard, because some people are very easily offended.
R:  Yes, this is true.
L:  And some are not.  I mean, people like me, I've got a real warped sense of humor.  I've had brain cancer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um [COUGH] -- to me, everything's pretty much funny.  But it just depends.  Also, it's on your audience, wh- wh- i- i- if you're with your mother you can't tell, you know, certain jokes but, you know, your friends, that's pretty much acceptable.
R:  Um, th- there's some truth to that.  I -- I certainly change my humor based on who I'm with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I -- I think I find it really interesting because, um, I grew up a -- I -- I'm half Polack, half hillbilly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- blonde, and a woman.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, my wife's hillbilly too, so that's okay.  That's great.
R:  [LAUGH] and ah, and an- and I grew up to become a chemical engineer so I'm obviously not stupid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  You're not stupid, you're very intelligent.
R:  [LAUGH] So, you know, but even in school and stuff I -- I mean, at my house, um, hillbilly jokes and Polack jokes it was kind of along the things of -- of -- we just told those things and we didn't worry about it.
L:  Yep.
R:  A- a- and so, um, I grew up kind of viewing jokes as -- as jokes.  But -- but I had a friend who, uh, no, I had a couple of friends, but one in particular who, ah, just a year or two ago, really enlightened me that it really affected their own personal self esteem --
L:  Oh boy.
R:  -- um, to hear a certain -- i- i- it wasn't -- it wasn't one of these nasty things where they were all defensive, it was more a thing of, ah, he was talking in general about how having grown up in the seventies and an- an- and that very feminist culture, an- an- the whole man bashing ...
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- th- th- that he had actually realized that as he grew up that he was very ashamed of being a man, and so, you know, an- an- and didn't know what was -- what was good and what was bad and so it was very interesting that -- that, ah, I realized that on a very subtle level that those kinds of jokes really could hurt somebody.  So, I'm -- I think I'm a little more careful about it now.  I still pretty much'll tell anything.  But I really do have a tendency to target my audience and -- and deal with --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- people who --
L:  You have to.
R:  -- a- and try to do it -- instead of it being a thing of I -- I just tell jokes and hope no one gets offended, I now kind of make sure that these are pretty stable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- secure in their own person people before I tell those kind of jokes now.  Even things I used to think were pretty harmless, like blonde jokes and man bashing --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- jokes, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, today we- ev- everybody is so sensitive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you can't say black sheep wi- wi- without offending someone, so, as an engineer also, structural ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- and ah, had a brain tumor, and lost all my skills so I'm unemployed.
R:  Oh, that just is horrible.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well it's typical, I mean ... look, I'm alive so I can't complain.
R:  Good point.  Good attitude.
L:  My friends are all dead -- my friends are all dead so ... Um, as a minister, I was a minister first and my wife passed away I could -- I couldn't go days I got POed[?] and decided to go -- go to be an engineer.  I became an engineer and I really -- I really enjoyed it because the challenge, the math challenge.  But, ah, in engineering, th- th- they're so anti women I thought, "Oh come on, what are they going to do, you know?  Give you PMS?"  Jeeze.  Um, [COUGH] ... I hear a lot of jokes, you know, in -- in the boardroom especially.  I thought, "Uh oh, wait a minute, this is not cool.  No.  We don't discuss things like that".  [LIPSMACK] But it's really a matter of you know -- a matter of taste.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some peop- some people can take a joke, some people can't.
R:  This is true.
L:  My wife's son has no sense of humor.  Everything is dead serious.  I'm, like, "Get a grip". [LAUGH], I had -- I've had radiation and chemotherapy about three different times, hey, life has to be joy or you're a pain in the butt to be around. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and that's what -- I -- I -- I tell people.  Give life the light touch.  It really doesn't matter, okay, twenty years from now who really cares if you're a vice president?  You know?  So, that's really about my -- really about my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I- I- I work with cancer patients and I tell them, "You know, develop a sense of humor".  "Why?"  "Because people like being around someone who's happy and telling jokes than someone who's a whiner and a complainer".  Yuck, I hate whiners.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, I have a high tolerance for everybody, including whiners. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's like okay, I know you're sick, you've got cancer, but you know -- you can make -- you can make this the worst thing in your life or the best thing in your life.  It's what do you want to do with it?  It's up to you.  
R:  That's true, but y- you know that's -- just remember, that's kind of a learned skill, too.  I mean, I know people who have pretty okay lives all things considered and they're very unhappy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Part of it's attitude but part of it really is i- l- learning to face adversity and overcome it is a learned skill.  It's not -- it's not always [SIGH] ... it's not always as easy as deciding whether you want hamburgers or -- or steak for dinner, or -- 
L:  Yeah, i- i- it's tough.
R: -- if, if, i- i- it's like teaching -- in some ways, it's kind of like it -- it -- it's as hard as learning another language, an- an- or, you know, because it is a -- y- y- you have to teach yourself -- or even a whole new way to think.  I- it's not just about um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] You have to train your wh- wh- or like being on an exercise regime, you know, you gotta be on it for years before you get good at it, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and really, you see some benefits right away, but the truth is, is learning to think positive and -- and to put a good spin on things and to look for the best.  As I said, it- it's really hard to get into the habit of it.  It's really easy to screw up and fall off of it even once you've developed the habit, unless it's something you were raised with and you think of it like breathing.
L:  Well, um --
R:  Um ...
L:  I'm a cancer counselor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I work with cancer patients on a daily basis ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I work in hospice, usually ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I tell people, "You -- you can make this the worst thing in your life or the best thing in your life.  It's really up to you".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, "Well, give me an example". Okay.  Uh, nurses came in one day, "You know, Mr. Hansen, your blood pressure is way out of control, your sugar's out of control.  You're dying".  I thought, "Oh, crap.  I hate dying".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it ruins your whole day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm like, aren't you worried about it?  I'm very concerned but I'm not going to panic about it, okay?  Panic is not my middle name any more.  Used to, you know, but through cancer I've learned a -- you know, life really dos- doesn't matter all that much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In forty years who really cares if you were vice president of operations?  Who really cares if you developed a new system for nuc- [inaudible].  Who really cares?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's my point now.  You know, does it really matter?  I was in taking chemotherapy one day and a guy -- a guy was just raising hell about, if he dies he's okay, his wife won't get those damned dishes.  And I thought, "Who cares about the dishes?  You're dying, okay?  Make this the best thing or the worst thing of your life, okay".
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you want to be a cry baby, fine, cry, but no one's going to be around you.  When you laugh people want to be around you.
R:  By the way, there's a -- since you do a lot of counseling, there's a set of books out, um, the one that I got and have been reading is How to Raise the Optimistic Child ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, there's a couple of others about -- and there's about how to become optimistic instead of pessimistic, an- and, I -- I think --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- it's a really great set of books.
L:  I tell people, "Is the glass half full or half empty?"  Hm.  It's half empty, okay you got a problem.
R:  [LAUGH] Hey, you know what though?  You know, I'm one of those people that um ... I- I- I've had people describe me as, you know, she's the girl who says "Look!  There's a -- there's a ring around the bottom of the glass.  It's not empty". [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]  But, even so, you know, everybody's got their bad days and their down days.  It- it- it's a --
L:  Oh, I know that.  I ha- I had terrible time with cancer and went through che- ah, went through radiation with my brain tumor and everything, and had three surgeries in four months.  I w- w- went through a terrible time, but I always had a sense of humor.  And I -- I always treated nurses with respect.  And one nurse told my mother.  She said, "I'm so glad he's here.  He is so pleasant.  Even though he's going through hell, he tries to be so nice to us".  I said, "Mother, I -- I -- wa- wa- wasn't born stupid, okay?  They can make life a hell or heaven".  It's up to you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Give them much crap then th- th- they'll make your life miserable.  Okay.  I'm real nice to them because what I -- I ha- had terrible thirst.  They'd destroyed my pi- pituitary gland --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could not stop drinking liquids.  I mean, I'd go for any orange drink and [MN] excuse me, and I bought diet several times, but I know what life and death's all about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this is what I tell people.  This is really not all that important, okay.  Eternity is important.  I don't care about your religion.  What's your relationship like?  How do you see God?  Do you see him as a big old ogre who's going to slap you down first time you make a mistake?  Or do you see him as merciful?  I don't know.  Think about it, I- I'll get back to you.  But life is what you make it.  You know, I mean, [LAUGH] what I make each month on this building, I made a week a- a- as an engineer, okay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It ain't pretty.  So, life's what you make it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you're a chemical engineer?
R:  Yes.
L:  You have my respect.  You've got great math skills.
R: [LAUGH] No, I have mediocre math skills.  You don't have to be a great mathematician to be an engineer. --
