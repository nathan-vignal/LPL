R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Sharon.
L:  Hi Sharon. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Chris, I'm from Michigan.
R:  And I'm from Texas.
L:  Wow!
R:  So ...
L:  This is neat. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know a whole lot about comedy [LAUGH] so -- I'm thinking, this isn't my subject, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like, I'm thinking, so okay, the difference between humor that's in good taste and humor that's in bad taste, um, ah, de- depends a lot on the context. 
L:  Yeah, I agree, there's bad humor.
R:  Yeah.  It is -- it's --it's li- like th- there -- there's some jokes that are going to offend me no matter who's telling them and then there's others that are like, okay, th- they're not going to be, like -- they're not going to be funny if someone tells them at work, but if I'm out with my -- if -- if I'm out with my friends and somebody tells it, it's like, like, cool, that's funny.
L:  That's true.  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's off-colored humor too, that, I don't particularly care for, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- and like you said, it's inappropriate at work with -- you know, with other people, then it can be fun.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Like, I don't -- I don't have a television so I don't really catch much of the [COUGH] mu- much, like much -- much -- much -- much of th- TV comedians, but like, wh- when I go and visit my folks, th- th- they'll -- they'll -- they'll always watch [inaudible], so I usually catch his monologue and that's mostly in good taste.  Occasionally, it's like, ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, well I don't watch a lot of TV either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neither [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't see a joke so it can't work [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or email jokes.
R:  Oh my, yeah.
L:  Some of them can be bad [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And then you get, like, six different copies of them from -- from people who [LAUGH] say, "Oh, I've got this new joke that I heard and ..."
L:  Oh, I know, that's true, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I already heard that once.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Most of Penman[?] are funny though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] He gives me raunchy ones. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's like ...
L:  As long as you don't share them with people at work, I guess.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It's like, o- o- o- once -- once -- once in a while if I go from -- if I'm -- if I'm -- if I'm calling my folks and, um, -- and I'm talking to my dad and my mom's not on the phone, then dad will actually tell me -- dad -- dad -- dad will actually tell me the mildly raunchy jokes that he's heard recently.  But if mom's on the phone he won't tell them [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He doesn't feel appropriate doing that with your mom around.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess not.
L:  Oh.  That's funny.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH]
L:  That's funny, no, there's people that'll tell me jokes that, you know, probably wouldn't tell somebody else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It just -- it just depends on who it is, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Are you supposed to ask us something else or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] I think I -- I -- I don't know if we should -- I- I- -- this is the first call I've done, so I don't know if it's going to be just people --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- I don't know if it's going be just the one question or if it's, like, we're supposed to come up with ten minutes or something [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not sure either.  This is the first time too, for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh well, I guess we- we- we're going to be useful data no matter what they [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, that's right. [LAUGH]
R:  Like, we couldn't come up with ten minutes to talk about all this, okay this is [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  I really can't either.  I don't enjoy, like, comedy movies all that much, or ...
R:  [COUGH] Right, yeah.
L:  This is probably not a good topic for me.
R:  Yeah.  Like, I like [SIGH] it's like, abo- I -- I -- I -- I --like -- I like -- I like a lot of British comedy.
L:  Do ya?
R:  But, yeah cause that's because they on -- on the occasions when I've had access to a television, um, a proper TV station, sort of things, like, they'll show The Vicar of Dibley and they'll show the, um, wh- what's that one ca- um, the -- the one -- the one -- the one who's name is some song and it's not somewhere in time, it's um, As Time Goes By, that was it.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, that -- that one -- that one, As Time Goes By is really nice because it's it- it's -- it's kind -- it's kind of, like, a sitcom but it's more intelligent.
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I can't -- I've never seen any --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, is that like, comedy, like, you could watch with anyone, you kids or whatever, or ...?
R:  Oh Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like -- like -- As -- As -- As Time Goes By, it's like, you know, um, it's, you know, it's kind of -- it's like -- it -- it's aimed at adults [inaudible] it -- it -- it's -- I guess -- it depends on how, like -- you know -- if -- if -- if -- you're bothered by a television show where, it's like, th- th- there's clearly two of the characters are -- are -- um -- are sleeping together and they're not -- not married, then you know, that sure is not going work, but then most shows aren't going to work, [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Right.
R:  But it's really -- there's not -- but there's not, you know, but there's nothing off color.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  You know, it's like, it's like, a- a- at most they'll be, like, you know, something is like a va- like an illusion and so and it's, like, if -- if -- if -- if -- if your mind is thinking that way you might pick up that there's something, but ...[COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But if, you know, it's like, if you're not looking for it, it's, you know ...
L:  Pretty appropriate for anyone then.
R:  Yeah.  It's like, I mean, I- I- I'd have no trouble with my -- with, you know, watching it with my -- with my little son in the room, so ...
L: Oh, I see.
R:  So.
L:  When I think of, like, British comedy, I think I like, Benny Hill.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That's very off-colored comedy.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly what -- definitely the adult end --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] And Mo- Mo -- Monty Python is, you know, it's like, it's like, wh- wherever if you -- kind of, like -- Monty Python Mo- Mo- Monty -- Monty Python -- Monty Python movies were kind of a rite of passage when you were about, like, sixteen or seventeen, it's like, you were actually old enough to get it and -- but it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they go way over the top so, it's like, it's kind of funny but you're -- and you're kind of going -- you're kind of going, oh, this is hilarious and oh, this is disgusting at the same time.
L:  I've never seen that either.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Never.
R:  Yeah.  Th- [COUGH] I li- some of -- some of, you know, some of their sketches are, you know, pr- some -- some -- some of their sketches are -- are -- are fairly reas- reasonable, and they're just kind of, like, you know, the usual humor -- humor thing of just, like, take an ordinary situation and, kind of, put it to ex- extremes, like, ...
L:  Right.
R:  One of their -- one of their famous sketches is the parrot shop...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The pet -- the pet shop where, there's a dead parrot --
L:  Oh
R:  The guy -- the guy -- the -- the -- this -- this --you know, John Cleese comes in and says to Michael Palin, you know, like, just like, you know, "I wish to register a complaint about this parrot that I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique".
L:  Oh my.
R:  [COUGH] And, you know, so, Michael Palin looks at this, you know, obviously dead bird in the cage and says, "Okay, ah, what's wrong with it?  I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad, he's dead!  That's what's wrong with -- "
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just goes on from there and just, you know, just, you know, m- m- John Cleese doing this beautiful outraged customer and Michael Palin doing this, you know, beautiful oblivious clerk.  It's just --
L: That's funny.
R:  -- yeah.  So, it's like, so -- of course, and then -- they -- and then they've got other sketches that are just, like, okay, this is not, like, like, thi- this is -- this is, like rude and obscene and disgusting, so it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like -- like -- in -- in -- in -- all of them -- all of their movies have at least -- have at least one scene where I'm going, this is gross.
L:  Really.
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  Is that one that's not appropriate for kids, or ...?
R:  That -- that -- that -- that's like -- th- the -- the -- movies I would not have my son watch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, you know, wh- wh- when he's about sixteen he will probably -- he will probably be -- that -- that's about the r- age where he -- he'd -- it's like, okay, it's -- it's the -- there are scenes that are disgusting and gory and such and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at sixteen, and you know, he'll be old enough to actually to -- to -- to be able to appreciate the -- that it -- it's -- it's so outrageous that's f- that it's sort of funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] So, there -- there -- there's this one scene in Monty Python in the Holy Grail, where King Arthur comes up against this knight, who, you know, this evil knight, who's guarding this pass and so, okay, so, he's they -- they fight and King Arthur cuts off one of his arms, and -- and so they have, and so -- they've got like -- they must have, like, a pump of red paint in there and so, it's like, for the entire rest of the scene, which goes on for, like, goes on for like, another three or four minutes, you've got blood gushing, you know, red paint gushing out of this ar- you know, arm so --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- then he cuts off -- so he has to cut off the other -- then -- then -- and -- and -- the -- the -- knight's still trying to fight him and so he has to cut off the other arm and then both the legs and then the knight's still coming, "Come over here and I'll fight you".
L:  Oh my.
R:  It -- it -- it's it -- it -- it's like, it's so outrageous that, like, it's like, I had to laugh at it and -- and yet, it's like, you know, this is --
L:  Sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  Like, what is going through these people's minds when they write this?  Ah huh. [COUGH]
L:  Kind of like Saturday Night Live.
R:  I -- I-- I've only seen, like, one epis- I think I've only seen like, one episode of that.
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  Kind of the same thing where they just make something stupid and really outrageous.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And it's like, then -- then there's for cl- for clean humor, um, my -- my-- my dad is um, is a big fan of, um, there was this named Grady Narrett[?] who was on, um, I think -- he -- he was on -- he was on the show he hauled back in the seventies, I guess.
L:  Oh my
R:  Um, and he -- he -- he -- um -- he -- um, he was about this preacher --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and h- and a comedian.  And so, he -- he -- he did these whole he -- he -- he -- he, you know, he -- he died, like, in early eighties, I think, and so mo- most of the stuff isn't available because there's been, um, his -- his -- his, um -- his heirs have apparently not wanted the stuff re-released but --
