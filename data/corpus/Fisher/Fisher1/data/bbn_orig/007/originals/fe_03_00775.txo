R:  Hi, my name is Janine Petrolli[?]
L:  Hi, I'm Karen Johnson.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This weird, [LAUGH] I haven't done this before. [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, would you leave?
L:  I don't know, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I don't think I would.  I mean, maybe if I could live on a beach somewhere [LAUGH] and not have to work and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do anything at all, I think I might, but [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  You don't know.
L:  I don't know anything really about other countries, or anything like that.
R:  No.  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I need a job.  I need to work. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things like that.  Um, how did you find out about the telephone study?  I'm just curious --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because, like, my friend told me about it, so ...
L:  Um.  I came across it on, um, a site on the internet.
R:  Oh.
L:  In a, like, freebie type newsletter.
R:  Oh, I do those too, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um.
R:  But, um, where are you from?
L:  Um, Eugene, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay.  New Jersey.
L:  Oh.
R:  Right across, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, they've been calling me every day this week [LAUGH] for this telephone study thing --
L:  Ah huh.
R:  -- it's like, I don't know, um, are we supposed to keep on topics?  This is, like, my first one that I've done.
L:  I'm not sure.  Yeah, because I haven't done these before either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they keep calling at, like, twelve o clock at night and I'm, like, [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I didn't ask for twelve o clock, I said like, five or six. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. They've called me a few times, too, but I haven't been home ...
R:  You haven't been home.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  That's funny.
L:  This is the first one --
R:  First one.
L:  -- I've got to do.
R:  'Cause I -- I really like sleeping in bed, and I'm like, no, not again.  And I just hung up.  I felt bad, but I didn't -- I didn't ask for twelve o clock.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um, maybe we should talk about a little something [LAUGH] so we don't get in trouble.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, yeah, like, I -- I wouldn't go, I mean, if they gave me a million dollars, I don't know, I'd probably, like, want to invest a lot of that and maybe I would do it, but it's kind of just such a random thing, it's like, okay, can I take my boyfriend with me?  Can I take my family with me?  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Do I have to go alone -- or, you know.
L:  Could you go anywhere? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Could you go anywhere, or would you have to go to, like Iraq or something? [LAUGH] Because I definitely wouldn't do it then, no way.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't either. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not at all.
L:  But it might be interesting to ...
R:  Yeah.  Would I -- yeah, and like, if you could come back in a couple of months and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I would do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that would be great.  If you'd be able to come back, you know.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  A million dollars is a lot of money.
L: Yeah, it is, so...
R:  I wouldn't even know what to do with it.
L:  [LAUGH] It'd be fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think I'd buy a house, how about that?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Vacation getaway.
R:  Ah, please, I'm trying to plan one now and it's just, like, a complete nightmare.  It's a nightmare.
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  That -- that would be a lot of money and a lot of fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely, yeah, instead of ah, doing these surveys, or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a couple here and a couple there, like I do all the time.
L:  Yeah, yeah, ah ...
R:  Too funny.
L:  Well, we can always use a lot of money.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I mean, what are they even studying, do you know?  Just how we talk to each other, and how much we ...?
L:  I'm not sure.  I -- something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not even sure how long we supposed to talk for. [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's, like, ten minutes, or so.
L:  Hm. [SIGH]
R:  Not sure about --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm not sure either. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and I wonder how they pair us up, too, because, like, I was thinking that I'd probably talk to a guy who was a lot older than me, just because, you know, we wouldn't have as much in common and stuff like that, you know, but ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I answered one yesterday ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, after I answered the phone, they put me on hold and said they were trying to find somebody else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for me to participate with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess it's whoever they find --
R:  Oh
L:  -- that answers their phone, maybe.
R:  I see.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I see.  Yeah, I mean, if they had called earlier, I would be okay but if you have to get up for work the next morning, you're like, no way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wanna sleep, you know.
L:  It gets to be too late. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, definitely.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So ...
L:  [MN] Well, ah.
R:  Well, I know.  Do you belong to the Big Big Forums?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No?
L:  No.
R:  No, it's like, another site where I saw this thing advertised, so ...
L: Oh.
R:  I just thought maybe, you were from there.
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  I think my mom signed up with them.
R:  You mom does?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  She does a lot of stuff on the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] That's like my father, he's ah, sixty five and he's all about the internet, it's like, hysterical, he's like, "Look, I got by buddy list open", [LAUGH] Like, that's great dad, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Take it easy.
L:  Yeah, my mom does, um, a lot of sweepstakes and contests.
R:  Oh, does she?
L:  Yeah, all that kind of stuff.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I do a lot of the freebies, and ...
R:  Yeah, freebies definitely, I know all about the freebies.  You should go to, um, there's a good one, it's W.W.W. dot big big forums dot com, and they have, like, a good freebies section.  I've gotten a lot of good things from there.
L:  Oh, I'll have to check that out.
R:  Yeah, it's really good, and, like, if you're into contests, their contest section is huge, so, and um ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I'll do like, the instant win ones on line, or whatever ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I take, like, my -- my flat top home from work and [LAUGH] I do it from my -- work computer and I'm, like, waiting for the day where they're, like, you know, you can't be doing that, they're like, watching me or whatever, but, yeah, I won some pretty good thing on, like, instant wins, and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.  That's cool.
R:  That are posted on there, so ...
L:  Yeah, I like doing those.
R:  They're fun.
L:  Must check that out. [LAUGH]
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, we really haven't talked much about the topic, but I really don't know [LAUGH] what to say.
L:  [LAUGH] I know, 'cause it's so -- it's hard to say whether you would go or not, or ...
R:  I know.  Um ...
L:  It just depends on all the circumstances.
R:  Like, if we knew, like, how we would be living and things like that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're going to put us in like a high -- you know, I mean, in the middle of the jungle, I'm not going to go somewhere, but ...
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely.
R:  Definitely.
L:  But if you could pick anywhere and go wherever you want to and come back when you want to ...
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Where would you go if you could go anywhere?
L: I have no idea.
R:  No?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't know.  I think I ...
L:  Some place warm.
R:  Yeah.  I like, um, hm, maybe like Aruba [LAUGH] and just sit on the beach all day, that'd be nice.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That'd be nice.
R:  Definitely. Definitely.
L:  Soak in the sun, and ...
R:  Soak in the sun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not -- try not to get too burned.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oregon must be cold this time of year, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and wet and ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Rainy.
R:  Isn't it always rainy there?
L:  Pretty much. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what they say, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It gets awfully tire- tiring in the rain.
R:  Tiring in the rain, yeah.
L: Yeah.  Tired of getting wet all the time.
R:  Oh.  That would drive me nuts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, New Jersey is just -- it's okay, but [LAUGH] I'd move, probably.  To another state.
L:  Yeah.  We've thought about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Have you?
L: Yeah, but ...
R:  Have you always lived there?
L:  Oh, most of my life, yeah.
R:  Most of your life you have.
L:  I was born in California.
R:  Oh, see, now that's a nice place to live, I would think.
L:  Yeah, it has a lot of earthquakes and ...
R:  Oh, hm.  No, maybe not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But, ah.
R:  Don't know [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] I never really did travel anywhere, so, that might be nice to go somewhere. [LAUGH]
R:  Somewhere, yeah.
L:  Anywhere. 
R:  I've been on, like, um, well, I went on a cruise last summer ...
L:  Hm.
R:  That was nice, but that's pretty much the extent of my traveling, too.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  Does you mom do these as well?
L:  Yeah, I told her about these and -- and she said that she got a phone call the other day ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, ah, she didn't tell me much about it.
R:  No.
L:  She lives in Las Vegas.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's nice, by uncle lives out there.  I've never been.
L: I haven't either. [LAUGH]
R:  No, really?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  No.
L:  But [MN] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder if they tell you when you're supposed --
R:  I think they do.
