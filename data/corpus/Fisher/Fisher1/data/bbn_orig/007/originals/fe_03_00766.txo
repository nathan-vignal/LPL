L:  Hello, I'm Sandra.
R:  Hi, my name is Karen.  It's an interesting question, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is [LAUGH] a very touchy one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  It didn't really say how close of a friend.
R:  Yeah, and for what kind of, ah -- to me, it also matters, um, wh- what kind of offence it is or, you know, well I guess -- I guess my quick answer would be no, I wouldn't do it, but I think there probably isn't a situation I would do it under, but I can't rule it out. [LAUGH] I guess ...
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think I'd be the same way, unless it was one of my children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wouldn't have any problem saying no, but ...
R:  Yeah.  If, ah, yeah, I have a son who's twenty years old and um, I would hope he would never get in trouble, but I guess one -- I guess one way -- one situation I could think of that maybe I would, would be if he made a mistake or -- or did something that was against the law and that I knew he would never do it again, that it was a real fluke, or -- I don't know, sometimes people get in trouble with the law when it's not even anything they did, but they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you know, say, ah ...
L:  Oh, I've known plenty of that to happen, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Fr- you know, especially kids my son's age, ah, maybe at a party --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something goes on and they don't have anything to do with it, but -- but everybody gets arrested, that kind of thing, you know.
L:  Yeah, well my son's twenty three so I know exactly where you're coming from.
R:  Yeah.  Do you know how long these calls are supposed to last? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, ten minutes, aren't they?
R:  Oh, I can't remember.  This is the first one I've gotten.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Um. [PAUSE] Let's see ...
L:  Another thing, we have to stay on the subject.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's the first one I've gotten.
R:  Yeah, um ...
L:  Hm.  They should have given us a little more information.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They could have at least told us what the charge was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  what was the perjury pertaining to.
R:  Yeah.  The question was just, would you -- would you possibly commit perjury for a close friend?  I think that's how they put it, right?
L:  I really don't see any circumstances I would do it for just a friend.
R:  Right.
L:  And it would have to be really something light for me to do it for my son.
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't do it if it was anything serious.
R:  Right.  Um, I- I guess if we're sticking to the question, I don't think -- I don't guess I would do it for -- for a friend either, um ...
L:  I can't think of any situation I would.
R:  Um, no, I can't think of any examples right off, but I -- I know there are sometimes laws that probably ought to be changed, or that I think ought to be changed, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I mean, if it's -- if it's something that's just, I mean, there are some things that there's just no question about, you know, things that are wrong, stealing --
L:  Yeah.
R:   --ah, you know, murder, assault, and that, you know, that sort of thing, but, um, I don't know, I guess -- guess maybe if it was some minor -- minor drug using type offence, even though I don't -- I don't take 'em myself and I don't think -- I don't think they're a good idea, I also think the prisons are too stuffed with, ah, with um drug offenders [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, I think they need to find a new way to deal with that situation, too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do too.  So, I guess, that's -- maybe that's one thing, like ah, that maybe I would, if, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  If to say if, ah -- if I were called to testify and they asked, ah, "Have you ever known your close friend to smoke marijuana?"  I don't know that they'd ask a question like that, but I -- if I thought it would ge- keep them from prison I would probably say, "No, I've never known them to smoke marijuana".
L:  Yeah.  I think you're right there.  That would be almost nothing.  I mean, it wouldn't be anything serious.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, that probably wouldn't happen.  I don't know.  I don't even have any friends that smoke it, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, neither.
R:  Oh, um ...
L:  And I got lucky, my son didn't ever use it so I really don't know much about that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah, um ...
L:  I wonder if they'll let us know when the time's up?
R:  I betcha they will, since it's automated.  I'm sure there'll be some ki- I betcha it'll say when there's, ah, thirty seconds left, or something.
L:  I was beginning to think I wasn't going to get a call.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, what else can we say about this?  I want to make sure we do it right [LAUGH] so we ...
L:  I don't know, um ...
R:  Would you commit perjury ...?
L:  They didn't say, you know, how long we had known the friend, if it's a close friend -- it would -- are they close just recently?  Or have we known them all of our lives or ...?
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's probably good that we bring things like that up, because when they listen to this maybe they will -- they'll, ah -- ah, maybe they'll learn ways that they ought to, ah, change the question, make it more specific --
L:  Yeah, make it a little more detail would be nice.
R:  -- so that's probably good to talk about -- yeah, because that's a good point.  You could feel like someone's a close friend but you've only known them for a month, that's -- then you don't really know 'em like you would somebody you've known --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since you were in school together, or something.
L:  That would make a lot of difference in the situation, too.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  If it was somebody I grew up with as a child --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd be probably more pertaining to do something like that than I would be for someone I only know a few years.
R:  Right, right.  Because, you know, what the old -- you really know what the old friend is like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, their character and -- um, I've never had to testify for -- in anything before.
L:  Oh, thank goodness, me neither. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't believe I could handle it.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, I just don't know what else to say about it really.
R:  I don't either, [LAUGH] hm.
L:  They caught me off guard.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- so, if um -- this is -- of course it's very hypothetical, if -- if your child -- if your son -- if you had a pretty good idea, say that he killed someone --
L:  Oh, now that would be serious.
R:  There's no way you would cover for --
L:  No, that would be no way.  Mm.
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  Um, well, I'm a real stickler for him doing what's right.  I just don't want to see anybody doing him wrong.
R:  Now here's -- okay -- here's another, ah, n- now say -- say you have to, um, testify in the case of, um, well let's keep it to a friend, since that's what they ask --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it's -- maybe what the trial is about, is, ah, um, is something very serious, but you know that they didn't do it.  But there's, ah, some kind of circumstantial -- they -- they maybe have c- circumstantial evidence kind of case against your friend ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe by sa- by answering a question -- or, you know, by committing perjury on -- on  -- on a question that they ask you, ah, that could, ah, okay, so remember the person is innocent.  You know they're innocent, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people do get railroaded, and um, say, if you could -- if you could answer a question that doesn't -- that's not really about anything very important, you know, there's some small thing that just happens to be part of the circumstantial evidence against --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the person -- I think I would do that.
L:  It would be a tough call.  Yeah, that would be a tough call there.
R:  I- I think I might do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd rather not, but ...
L:  But I would have to know without a doubt that they did not do it.
R:  Yes, me too.
L:  Not just a good belief, while I don't believe they're capable of that because ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have had that happen before.  A good friend of ours here that was actually my teacher in high school, murdered his wife.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And none of us would believe he was capable of it because he was the best teacher we had.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But none of us got to go testify, I don't know why they didn't call any of us in.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's a good point too.  Just because you think somebody's not capable of it doesn't mean that they're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you can't know everything.
L:  Yeah, you'd have to really, really know for sure, that what you're doing was right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we never would have believed he would have done that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It must have been a shock.
L:  He'd always acted like he was so crazy about his wife.  And we just -- we could not believe it, because he went to the extent of riding a bicycle twenty five miles to keep himself from getting caught.  He almost got away with it.
R:  Gosh.  Makes you wonder wh- wh- what happened that made him, ah, whether something suddenly happened that made him, ah, decide to do that, or ...
L:  I don't guess they really ever did say.  You know, the suspicion was that he had another woman, somewhere.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I don't know if that ended up being it or not, because he never did marry anybody else.  After he got out he was even alone, so I don't know.  But yeah, that would make me think twice about somebody that I thought would never do something like that.
R:  I- I guess one -- I couldn't rule it out completely because -- one reason is because, ah, I do -- I do know, ah, of a lot of cases where people have even been on death row and have turned out to be innocent, and ...
L: Yeah.  I've heard one case --
R:  I met one fellow personally, named Randall Adams, that is a pretty big, ah, pretty big case, in the Dallas, Texas area an, ah, was on death row, was about to get executed and ...
L: Oh my goodness.
R:  Um, someone else did it and, I mean --
L:  I've been thinking about that mother they were telling on TV the other night, that they had her in prison for murdering her child, they come to find out her child had some rare disease that causes bruises on 'em.
R:  [MN]
L:  Did you see that one?
R:  No, I haven't.  I've heard of that happening though, there's some kind of --
L:  That's another one that went to prison for something she didn't do.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, like, if you -- like I said, if -- if I -- if I, ah, say that would be a good example, say -- say your good friend, you know, that the child has the disease that could make it look like they've been abused and they ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  and they haven't, you know, ah, and there's another disease, brittle bone disease, I think it's called, and those kids will break bones just -- by just taking a little tumble like all kids do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a lot of times their parents get accused --
