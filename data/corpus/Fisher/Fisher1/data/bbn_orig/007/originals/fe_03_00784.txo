R:  Hi, my name --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- high, my name is Cynthia.
L:  My name's Dan. [PAUSE] Is this the first time, ah, you're doing this?
R:  Yes, it is actually.
L:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess we'll probably make some mistakes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah.
R:  Did they ask you the question already?
L:  Ah, they -- they said something about, ah, if I wanted -- if I started my own business ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And -- they wanted to know --
R:  Well, what would you do?
L:  -- um, I would probably, um, start my own, um, repair -- fix and repair shop.  I like to dabble in a lot of things, fixing things.
R:  Oh, okay, well I would like to, ah, open up, ah, a shelter for, um, homeless people, um, as well as a -- a cafeteria.
L: Oh, that would be nice.
R:  Albeit, um, not just -- not just for the homeless people though, the, ah, cafeteria would be for any -- anybody that would, ah, you know, be hungry, because we have a lot of working poor people -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and a lot of people that have to, um, unfortunately decide on paying a bill or feeding the kids, and --
L:  Yeah, I just watched a special the other night they were showing about the food lines in Ohio, how long they were.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  They said most of the people were working, they just couldn't afford to buy enough food to keep them going.
R:  Right, and , um, th- that's a terrible state to find yourself in, and children don't understand, um, I don't have enough money to buy food.  They don't understand that, they just know that they're hungry --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, if, um, money was not an object [LAUGH] and I could do whatever I wanted to do, if somebody just wrote me out a blank check and said, [LAUGH] here you go, then I would open up, um, those type of, I guess it would really be considered a non for profit, ah, organization or business, um, all around the country, because I know it's not just one particular part of the country, ah, that's hurting, in that area, it's all across the board, so if I had a blank check and they said to me, this is -- you can do whatever you want to do with it, that's what I would do. [LAUGH]
L:  Wouldn't that be nice? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's what I would do, if I had that kind of money, but, you know ...
L:  Yeah, I guess I'm not thinking on a big enough scale here. [LAUGH]
R:  Well no, that's not necessarily true because they didn't say, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, what, ah, I- I guess they just wanted to know how you -- how you felt and what you were thinking about, and this -- I was thinking about this for so long that this is what I would like to do and I guess it's because of my own experiences that, you know, that I've had to deal with, um -- um --
L:  Right.
R:   -- ah, fortunately, all of my children are grown now [LAUGH] so, I don't have to -- I don't have to make that choice, you know, or I'm not caught there anymore, but just the way society is going, and especially what happened after September eleven --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, the, ah, state of the economy, but you know what, actually, th- um, opening up, ah, the shop that you were talking about could definitely work too, because there's a lot of people that don't have cars and need transportation and, you know, the -- like the national lung association and ah, different kidney organization, they take old cars and they fix them up so that, um, people that are low income, people that don't have cars, you know, they give them cars so they can get back and forth and get jobs and stuff, like this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, we need people that would have shops that would be willing to [LAUGH] do that.
L:  Yeah, because I -- I've done a lot of that, I've, um, when people get new refrigerators or stoves, or something like that, they, ah, get me to haul their old ones off if they're -- if they're in working condition --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I take them out, clean them up and then I'll sell them to people who I know who can't afford to buy a new one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all I just sell for is, you know, to get the money out of what I put into it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a little bit of time, you know ...
R:  So sweet.  A- and all of it working together [LAUGH] We need all four stores, all come together.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So, you just, ah, you just do what you know to do, or what you're gifted in, the areas that you're gifted in, and then the other person in the areas that they're gifted in, they do what they know what to do, but then, if all the pieces fit in together in the puzzle to make a whole picture.
L:  Yeah, 'cause pretty much what I do is almost about the same thing as Salvation Army and, ah, um, St Paul's and places like that do too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah ...
R:  So see, that's real important because if we didn't have them, then, um, um, um, they call them mentally challenged, they wouldn't have a job or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or they wouldn't be able to teach them skills --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that -- that's important, and they would be just, you know, sitting somewhere wasting away.  Well that's a valuable life, so everybody has value, um, no matter what state you may see me in right now, don't mean that I'm not any more valuable than you, so I feel I'm just as valuable as Donald Tramp -- Trump, or --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or -- or Bill Gates [LAUGH] you know.  So, they just have more money than me. [LAUGH]
L:  That's about it.
R:  [LAUGH] But that don't make them better people.
L:  Money is about the only difference in us. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  So, no, they're not better people.
L:  Yeah, because I- I've been down to the bottom before.  I've had, ah, some operations and my wife was pregnant at the time, so we had to go all the way down to the welfare and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- go on to the food lines and everything else, you know, that, ah, now I'm doing a little better now, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, some of our best times were back when we were scrounging.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it seemed like you were closer to the family and every thing, so, I know what it's like.
R:  Yeah.  That brings you -- ah, those times would definitely bring out worth in you, [LAUGH] and you have to, ah, you know, you have to stay focused and just remember that it's not always going to be like this, and one day it's going to get better, but then that's when you truly find out who your real friends are.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind meeting this person who's going to give us the blank check though.
R:  I wouldn't mind meeting him either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know who they have set up to do that, but, ah, I don't have a problem with it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've never had that offer before. [LAUGH]
R:  Me neither.  I guess that's why they said it's a hypothetical situation.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Let you know right up -- up front, nobody's coming knocking on the door, telling about you just won the lottery.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Or if you -- if you could, what would you do with all the money.  Yeah, okay -- [LAUGH] -- okay, sir, I'll play the game, okay, all right, yeah. I can do this.
L:  [LAUGH] It'd be interesting.
R:  I don't remember the other questions.  Do you remember the other question?
L:  Um, I -- I -- no, I didn't catch the very end of it.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was trying to get my earphone hooked on here, because I -- I hate sitting here with the phone stuck up to my head. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I don't remember what the last part of it is, do you think they're going to count that against us?
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't remember. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My memory's not that good anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know.  I wonder how long they give you to talk and then they say, okay, time is up?
L:  Yeah, I think they said it's about ten minutes they'd, ah -- the computer would come on and tell you your time's almost up.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But ...
R:  Well then we talk for ten minutes?
L:  Ah, I don't know what time it was when I started.
R:  [LAUGH] Well I guess they'll let us know when our time is up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, a- g- good luck on your endeavor.
L:  Well, I kind of do that now, I'm kind of disabled, I've a -- fell out of a tree and broke my neck while I was hunting about ten years back, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm disabled, so I just kind of tinker around in the garage now, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't have any money to actually get my own business going, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just, ah, what I can do is what I have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, that good turned out because I get to spend more time with my children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  That's important.
L:  Yeah, but I would like to have my own business.
R:  Well, who knows, maybe one -- one of the -- one of the children will catch the g- the dream and run with it.
L:  I'm hoping so [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  They're -- both of my children are doing pretty good in school right now, so, I might be lucky, I think they will take, you know, pick up after me --
R:  Yes, you never know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially they, you know, out there watching you.  And, um --
L:  And because, you really can't get anywhere in this world working for somebody else, and if you can --
R:  Mm, this is so.
L:  -- get out there and get your own business going, ah --
