L:  Hi, I'm Sylvia.
R:  Hi, I'm Angel.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, Pennsylvania.  And you?
R:  I'm in Kentucky.
L:  Aye.
R:  So, let's see, they said the topic was drawing the line on humor?
L:  Right.  Um, I'm assuming on TV or movies, they're talking about?
R:  Yes, okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  I'm kind of losing my voice here, so please be patient.  Um, [COUGH] how do I draw the line?  Um, I really don't like when they, kind of zone in on the cheap sex jokes and keep at it and bad language.  They're the two things that bother me.
R:  Okay.  I -- I really don't like, um ... when they pick on someone else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To get a laugh.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, just, you know, picking out a small difference and making it seem big.
L:  Right.
R:  [PAUSE] So, have you done one of these before?
L:  No.  No, I haven't.  This is the first.
R:  It's a little different, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, and we're just supposed to keep talking about this, or ...?
R:  Yes, I guess so.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  I didn't picture it like that.
R:  I don't know, this is my first one too.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  And they call every day?  I wonder?
R:  They call me every day?
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, I just couldn't find my password until today.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Hm.
R:  So, which movies do you think are funny?
L:  Funny, um ... hm [LIPSMACK].  Probably, um ... the first thing that comes to mind is Something about Mary, although I -- I know that was kind of like cheap sex humor too, but --
R:  [LAUGH] I loved that movie.
L:  I remember laughing and crying as I -- as they showed it, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, I don't like the Dumb and Dumber kind of movies.
L:  Right.  Right.  It's just stupid humor, yeah.
R:  Right.  I like Something about Mary up until the last, like, fifteen minutes.
L:  And why's that?
R:  It -- it just seemed to go a bit too far ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, out of funny and just ... ends up kind of weird.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Where, like, everybody was in love with her.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And the guy was so sad and it was supposed to kind of still be funny.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't like the, ah [LIPSMACK] like, Not Another Teenage Movie.  I don't like those kinda ...
R:  I never saw that one.
L:  Yeah.  Very like that --
R:  Was it the same old --
L:  -- same old high school kid kind of last colored humor.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Let's see.  Have you ever seen Monkey Bone?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  That is a movie that is like, really silly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you have to be in sort of a goofy mood to enjoy it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it is really funny.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  It's about this cartoonist who draws this monkey, and it comes to life.
L:  Uh-huh.  I kind of -- I saw a few commercials for it so I kind of, ah, Brendan Fraser's in it, I believe.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's really wacky.  So, what about with your friends?  Wh- how do you con- what does it take for their humor to be just not funny?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um ... I think they do a lot of, um, like what you said, a lot of talking about each other --
R:  Uh-huh.
L: -- you know, when the other -- when another one isn't there, and I really don't like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  It's like fake -- fake friendship.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I had, um, this one roommate one time, who really, really thought he was funny. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  But he wasn't?  [LAUGH]
R:  And he wasn't. [LAUGH] No, he wasn't, and he liked to do long monologues ...
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- about pretty much any topic and if you didn't laugh along he got angry.
L:  Mm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  So ... I don't know, maybe ...[MN]
L:  And he did this just in front of his friends, or did he get up and do it somewhere?
R:  No, just in -- ju- common conversation, he didn't do two way. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, talking about his dates and things like that.
L:  Mm. [PAUSE] I like when something could, like, make you laugh out loud.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there's not too many of them.
R:  Ju- more than just like, a little chuckle?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] In my office the humor is -- is pretty light hearted.  Almost all the time.  I'm in sales.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I sell computer training.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, um, it's me and four men. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Which is kind of a weird situation all by itself.
L:  Right.
R:  But they manage to keep the atmosphere pretty light, you know, they always have, um, competitions going between each other and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Even if, like, somebody's upset about something, it's still really light and, you know, you kind of, like, tease the person just a little bit, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not really.
L:  No- no- not cross the line.  Well --
R:  I --
L:  -- it must be hard working with four men? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no!  I have the inside scoop on the male mind. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah! [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  And it's scary in there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I would imagine so. [LAUGH]
R:  But no, it's fun.  It- it's really -- it's competitive but I'm new there and holding my own, so, I -- I think it's all right.  Mm.
L:  Mm.  Well, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you do?
L:  I'm an accountant.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, in a -- a -- I'm, uh, like, the assisting controller in a factory.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of factory?
L:  Um, they make, ah, plastic bottle caps, like for a Coke bottle, plastic coke bottle.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, kind of boring, but it's good.  It's a small company, and like, ah, I work with just two other women in the office and it's good.
R:  Nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have a lot of, like, light hearted chatter during the day, or --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- is everything pretty serious?
L:  Yeah.  No, no they a real open minded company, you know, like, you can -- as long as you get your work done, they don't care what you do.  You know, so everyone gets along well.  Which is odd, because women working with other women is --
R:  [LAUGH] It usually doesn't work that way.  Yeah.
L:  -- they can get kind of catty sometimes, yeah.  So, but ...
R:  Is everybody pretty close in age?
L:  Um, actually no, the two other women are like, fifty or sixty and I'm thirty seven.
R:  Okay. 
L:  So, but they're pretty cool. 
R:  [LAUGH] Um ... do you think it's more difficult to ... joke around with people who are older?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, only if I know them and their personality, you know, and know what they ... what kind of humor they like, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because I tend to have, like, a drier sense of humor.  And I know that one woman loves that.  She thinks it's so hilarious and then other people, like, take offence to it.  So, if you know, like, what they enjoy and what they like it's a lot easier.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I sometimes have a little bit of problem like, with people who are lot older than me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I'm only twenty three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And before I got into sales I did a lot of office secretarial kind of work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I was working with, like, an office manager or somebody who was in the fifty or so age range, it seemed harder to keep, like, a friendly upbeat kind of conversation going.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because they really didn't have the same points of reference that I do.
L:  Right.
R:  And we just didn't really think the same things were funny.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I know a lot of people, like, will say, "Oh, that was such a great movie" or whatever and then I watch it, and it's like, not my kind of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kind of humor at all.  You know.  So ...
R:  Right.
L:  You're getting a subjective opinion.
R:  Yeah.  An- I -- I guess it's like when they're older ...?
L:  Mhm.
R:  When the people you work with are a lot older, ah, they seem to try take a parental kind of role.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And sort of a supervisor kind of role.
L:  Right

R:  And that doesn't always make it so easy to ... at least for me, to get along in a work environment.
L:  Right.  Well, there's a fine line between, like, kind of a --
