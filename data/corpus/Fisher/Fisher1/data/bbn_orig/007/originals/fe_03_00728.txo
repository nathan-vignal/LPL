R:  [NOISE] Robyn.
L:  Janice.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh hi. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry, I wasn't sure [several inaudible words] speaking or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I wasn't sure if you were connected or not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, did you hear our topic?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  Oh, I think I'd panic, definitely.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I know I would.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  You know, and it's hard to remain calm I think when you have kids which are baying on the bathroom door right now, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yes I know I've just walked outside 'cause I've got three of them myself.
R:  Oh yeah -- yeah I have four and I've got one who just will not leave me alone no matter what so.
L:  Gosh so you've got the same thing.  But oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely would panic.
R:  Yeah, it's uh, you know I just -- I hope it never comes down like that -- it's getting kinda scary lately with everything that's going on in the news and stuff so ...
L:  Oh, I know -- I know, my brother's over in, uh, Kosovo.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh goodness.
L:  And, uh, he's over there for a few months.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And yeah, so kinda worry about that but, yeah, we were up in North Carolina when the terrorist -- the, uh, New York happened.
R:  Okay.
L:  My husband was in Pennsylvania working.
R:  Oh really.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Uh.  Yeah, that's -- I -- you know it kinda hit close to home for everybody you know but just to think of it happening now.  I mean, you know, I just -- I don't know, you know it's kind of a touch subject with a lot of people I mean you know it's -- it's scary you know you don't.  You know, I have a ten year old too or actually he just turned eleven but you know it's I -- I just kinda don't know how to approach it with him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't want to tell him too much and then have him being scared and then I don't want to tell him not enough and something happens that he doesn't want to do.  You know but, um --'cause [NOISE] for the most part I mean -- it's just -- I'm sure a lot of people would panic and I'm sure a lot of people did with September eleven too, but you know, um, the good thing that came out of it was all the calm people that helped us you know get through it and helped the people get through it, you know.  So, I think that situation would take over again but, um ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I think in, um, well especially with September eleventh is you know you're wondering if it's going to happen again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now, you know, you hit a point where, you know -- where everybody's gotten kind of at ease but then you wonder are they waiting for that you know.
R:  Exactly.  You know, that's -- that's what everyone says -- is you know -- actually I heard it a lot too right after September eleventh was that you know, we've got this increased security and everyone is you know, uh, bracing for another attack and then nothing happens -- nothing happens -- nothing happens and then, you know the next thing you know we all let our guard down and it happens again.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know so it is -- it is kinda scary to me because I have to wonder what is our government doing?  You know what, you know, I always think we sit here and we have no decision, you know, whatsoever what goes on with our country and the president makes all these decisions and inadvertently it affects all of us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, our freedom is, you know, as -- and our safety, you know [LAUGH] it's kinda -- it's kinda scary when you think about it -- it's [MN] you know someone's making all these decisions for us but you know if it all comes out wrong in the end you know we're the ones who pay for it.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  You know.
L:  But then you know you think how, you know -- how's he going to try and please everybody, and that --
R:  Sure it's true.
L:  -- yeah that one you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was kind of scary too, so, it's yeah, you really don't have a choice in what's going to happen.  I mean --
R:  No.  I you know --
L:  -- if they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.  What part of the country are you in?
R:  Um, I'm on uh [inaudible] Wisconsin actually so ...
L:  Wisconsin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay I'm down here in Florida.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I have a sister in law down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  Right outside of Orlando and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] go to uh, to Disney while I've got until last September, [inaudible] the end of September.
R:  Okay.
L:  So it was over a year before [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] go back to a major theme park you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, so you must be having some nice weather down there, no?
L:  Uh, it's a little bit chilly.
R:  Is it?  Oh, yeah, well, chilly to you is probably you know warm to us over here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm from Michigan so you know.
R:  Oh, well then you understand so.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But I know that -- my mom was just up here this weekend and they live down south --
R:  Okay.
L: -- and they said that down there that -- um, two days before the, um -- the attack --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that there was a house full of, um, you know I think it was Arabic's, um, that were living there --
R:  Really?  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, they disappeared two days before that --
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the house has stood empty up until just about a month ago --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and the people had called and called and said hey these people [inaudible] well they went back to their country --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and they were out in the front with [inaudible] or stuff like that and nobody, you know -- not the police -- nobody bothered to check this house out.  Now, they're all over it. 
R:  Sure.
L:  But [LAUGH] yeah -- it's like wait a second guys you know here it is.  Over a year later you know we have this major thing going on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you've got people calling so I'm not sure -- you know what scares me a lot about terrorism is whether or not, you know -- security is all that --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- strong in our country but you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people -- I know that a friend of ours right after it happened took his aunt and uncle to the airport, and he has black hair and, he has a beard and moustache --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and he was out in the sun.
R:  Okay.
L:  He had forgotten his driver's licence here.
R:  Oh no.
L:  His aunt was in a wheelchair that is like eighty years old --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- was searched.  They did nothing for him; they let him walk right through.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  He said he couldn't believe it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I mean that's the scary thing too is you know, we -- like you said about security; we have all the security however, you know it doesn't take much for one person.  I mean everyone's human so you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it -- and it always seems like the wrong people are the ones that get through.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, I mean, you hear about people getting on the plane with a gun on accident, but you know why does that one person get through?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know that -- it's kinda scary you know you just --
L:  Well, you can have all the best security devices in the world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it is the people that are running them that are gonna ...
R:  Sure.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah I mean --
L:  Whether or not they -- they are doing their job efficiently.
R:  Er sure, exactly.  I mean, you know I'm sure that it's hard for them and I'm su- -- you know you don't want to -- I mean, you certainly don't want to single certain people out and you know pull over every Arabian person or you know Indian person anything like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you know really uh -- you know really, I figure that instinct goes along with that as well as the job.  You know, when you're doing it you just kinda [NOISE] hopefully you keep saying, well some people can sense things when things are not right.  But, you know. It just -- it always seems like the wrong people get -- you know, by with that stuff and it's just -- you know -- I don't know, it just -- it just amazes me and I you know -- it's just -- it's kinda scary that we have to be so careful today.  And, I mean, I'll admit I let my guard down a little bit more than you know -- it was pretty heightened right after September eleventh but, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, we do as a nation -- I think we all kinda settle back into our old routine and you know -- okay, this is America no one's gonna come on our land but --
L:  Sure
R:  -- you know, we've seen it happened already so it's --
L:  Well, one of the hardest things for, uh, to realize about terrorism is that people would do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know just randomly go about and just kill people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot of times you know it's in the name of religion which is --
R:  Yeah, exactly so you know.
L:  -- bad.  You know kinda blows my mind that you know people are saying they are killing because of religion but yet they're really not supposed to kill.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well you know.
R:  Well you know, it's funny you know I mean apparently some people just don't pick up the bible these days but ...
L:  Yeah, exactly that's -- yeah -- and it's just --
R:  You know and what kind of creator would allow you to do that, I mean there is none --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- so even if you had you know fifteen different gods you know I just don't see any of them saying okay [several inaudible words] fine in the name of religion, it's fine.
L:  Yeah kill off everybody else that doesn't believe in what we believe in.
R:  [LAUGH] You know ...
L:  I mean that doesn't make sense. Especially with the country that's where -- you know far away that has no bearing on your situation.
R:  Sure.
L:  And at that point you know every country should be worrying about their own country and their own people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And not worrying about you know.
R:  Well, I, you know -- I don't think we need to be sticking our nose in everyone's business.  I understand we've got to keep our nation sa- -- I mean we've had people that have wanted to come in America you know and take over for a long -- long time.  But, you know when you got people who actually have the means of doing it and have actually taken steps to try to, you know, disrupt our way of life you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you have to wonder what could be next.  And you know I guess that's something I try not to think about a lot, because with small kids you'd hate to think of you know the worst possible scenario with that.  But, um, you know you really do have to kinda prepare yourself and think okay, what would happen?  And it's a shame that they would come over here and attack innocent people; where we go over there and we will -- I mean, I know that we've you know entered [LAUGH] and killed thousands of innocent people as well but when you think about it our job and I think most people in our military have feelings, we don't just go over there and kill people mercilessly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like they have come over here and done with our people.
L:  Oh they --
R:  So.
L:  -- like, in this situation, I mean the effect it has put on us first, the United States.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's the same when you know Germany --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and Japan -- you know you're -- you know, you're protecting -- you're not going on to [inaudible] okay here I am.  I'm gonna [LAUGH] start you know -- start doing this.
R:  Oh, I'm telling you it's just uh -- you know I just hate to think that our world has come to this and you know I guess it's -- I -- you know you just --
L:  I -- you know what I have a feeling it's been like this forever.
R:  Oh sure.
L:  Right from the beginning of time that you're -- you're -- you know you just have bigger things to work with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And uh scarier things to work with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That unfortunately when they started coming up with all these things you know I don't think people thought in the long range like okay if we start making all these bombs and this and that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know yeah we're going to be protecting ourselves but can also be used against us.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, you know I mean that's the thing you know it's you know -- I guess in a perfect world there wouldn't be any of that but you know its true you know we build weapons someone else builds weapons, you know everyone else builds them and -- and for our own protection but yeah, you know it's almost kinda -- like you know when someone's storing up weapons.
